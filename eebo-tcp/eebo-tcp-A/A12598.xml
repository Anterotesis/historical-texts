            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the observation of some anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philosophers (who also prove it by divers good arguments) that all men, for the most part, have a naturall desire to <hi>immortality.</hi> But this we all know by common approv'd experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that <hi>Man that is borne of a Woman is of short continuance. He commethforth like a Flower and is cut downe, he flyeth also as a shadow and continueth not.</hi> Some therefore who knew not of any other world after this, in defence of natures wayes and providence, maintained, that she had in some manner satisfied the desire of man in making him <hi>generative. Nam quodammodo ipse putatur vivere, cujus progenies vivit, (For that man in some sort may be thought yet alive, whose progeny is living)</hi> as I may say in the words of <hi>Cassiodore</hi> with little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. But if there be any immortality in this,
<pb facs="tcp:22730:5"/>
it can be but an immortality of the body, not of the minde, the best and chiefest part of man. The immortality of the minde (all that it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of in this world, which though it be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality properly, yet may certainely much conduce to allay the complaints of mortall men concerning their shortnesse of life) doth, as I conceive, especially depend from that <hi>Memoria praeteritorum,</hi> and <hi>Providentia futurorum, (Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of things past,</hi> and <hi>Foresight of things to come)</hi> which the Latine Orator speakes of.</p>
            <p>As for the first, he certainly that knowes no more of the world (the time of a mans life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so short as it is) then what hath happened in his time, though he may be in yeares, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance very old in regard of his body, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his minde and knowledge, he can be accounted but a very child. Which is the very answer that an ancient <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary gave to <hi>Solon</hi> concerning the <hi>Grecians</hi> of his time: that they were all, the best and ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of them, but very babes and children. And his reason was, because none of them could say any thing of the state of their owne countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their owne and their fathers memory: whereas the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> out of their ancient holy Records, could tell them many memorable things, both concerning <hi>Greece</hi> in generall, and the state of their then famous <hi>Athens</hi> in particular,
<pb facs="tcp:22730:5"/>
for many hundred, if not thousand, of yeares before. If therefore a man living in a place of note, can by his industry, out of undoubted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Monuments (if such be the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the place, that it afford them) certainly finde, what have beene the severall both <hi>materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all alterations</hi> (as in respect of buildings, and the like) and <hi>historicall events,</hi> that have happened to it for divers ages before, and can derive the present times and places that he lives in, by a continuall series of chances and alterations from such or such a beginning, I doe not see (if know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be granted to be the life of the soule, as the soule is the life of the body) but he may reck on his yeares according to the proportion of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, accounting himselfe to have lived so many yeares, as he is able truely and historically to give an account of.</p>
            <p>Now for that other part of immortality, which is <hi>Providentia futurorum,</hi> even this hath such dependance of the former, as that he that is well vers'd in the knowledge of things past, may probably foresee what will happen in time to come. As for example; It was no difficult thing for one of the ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> (who lived in the dayes of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and was one of his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) having observed the course of the world, and what had already hapned to <hi>Greece</hi> it selfe, and to other places in that kinde, to foretell of
<pb facs="tcp:22730:6"/>
old <hi>Greece,</hi> then flourishing, that the time would come when it should be the seate of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Barbarisme;</hi> as it is at this day. Vpon the same grounds of former ages experience, did ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ancients both foresee and foretel, above a thousand yeares before any such thing happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the discovery of a new world, in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable words of his:
<q>
                  <l>—Venient annis</l>
                  <l>Seculaseris, quibus Oceanus</l>
                  <l>Vincularerum laxet, &amp; ingens</l>
                  <l>Pateat tell us, Tiphysque novos</l>
                  <l>Detegat orbes: nec sit terris</l>
                  <l>Vltima Thule.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As the knowledge of ancient things is pleasant, so is the ignorance as shamefull, and oftentimes exposes men to the scorne and contempt of stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. <hi>Tully</hi> relates of himselfe, that being sent with authority to <hi>Syracusa,</hi> a <hi>quondam</hi> renowned City of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> for his owne private satisfaction, he enquired of the chiefest of the City about the sepulcher and monument of their famous <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes;</hi> who (through shamefull ignorance of their City-Antiquities) denyed that he had any. But <hi>Tully</hi> knowing the contrary by what he had read, and by good luck remembring some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine verses that mentioned some particulars of his monument, whereby it might be knowne from others, taking along with him those <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb facs="tcp:22730:6"/>
blocks</hi> (who, as ordinary worldly men, had no care but for their profit, no curiosity but for their belly) he repaired to the place, being neer the City-gates, where ancient sepulchers and monuments were most frequent, and so negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted (whereby you may judge of the temper of the Inhabitants) that they were almost all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne with thickets and bushes. But the place being cleered by men that were on purpose set on worke, he found at last by helpe of the fore said directions, the monument that he sought, with the very markes (a <hi>Sphaera,</hi> and a <hi>Cylindrus)</hi> and the inscription (though now halfe worne out, more through neglect then age) that he looked for. And so, to the great shame of that City, and the inhabitants thereof (noted abroad for their luxurious life and great excesse in all worldly things) concludes with these upbraiding insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting words: <hi>Ita nobilissima Graeciae civitas, quonda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verò etiam doctissima sui civis unius acutissimi monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ignorasset, nisi ab homine Arpinate didi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisset.</hi> As if a man should scoffingly object to us here of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that he was faine to come out of <hi>Wales</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> of purpose to shew us the monument and place of buriall of some one of our famous <hi>Abbats,</hi> or renowned <hi>Archbishops,</hi> whose credit, and bounty, when living, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded much to the honour and benefit of the City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22730:7"/>
For these and the like reasons, my thoughts and affections having ever much inclined to the search and study of <hi>Antiquities,</hi> (to which also my particular calling did in some manner leade me) I have more particularly, as bound in duty and thankfulnesse, applyed my selfe to the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the place of my birth and abode. And to me this was a sufficient motive why I should of all other places desire to know the antiquities and former estate thereof. But why any man else, that is an <hi>Englishman,</hi> should have the same desire, other reasons may be given, very considerable, if I be not much deceived; as first, the <hi>Antiquities</hi> thereof. <hi>Antiquities</hi> due and proper <hi>Epithete</hi> is, <hi>venerable.</hi> Now the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest which our City hath in that venerable badge and cognisance is not unknowne: it being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for one of the most ancient Cities in the Kingdome. <hi>Quiacivitas Cantuariae est una de antiquissimis urbibus Angliae,</hi> is no other language then is frequently found in the <hi>Charters,</hi> and such <hi>private Acts of Parliament,</hi> as (making that a maine motive to the grant) have conveyed any <hi>Favour,</hi> or <hi>Franchise</hi> to the City or Citizens. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the great <hi>fame</hi> and <hi>repute</hi> that it had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, for reasons that will appeare by this <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise:</hi> and thereupon the great resort of strangers from all nations under heaven, (which in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie gave occasion to the proverbe of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury-tales)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:22730:7"/>
to the number sometimes, as shall be shewed, of a hundred thousand at once. But the chiefe reason, in my judgement, ought to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause from thence first the faith of <hi>Christ</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated and derived unto other parts of the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> after the <hi>Saxons</hi> our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers were become Lords and possessors of it. When the <hi>Romans</hi> had conquered <hi>Greece,</hi> they did not use them as they did other nations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by them subdued, but with all love and respect, <hi>Athens</hi> especially, which they had in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (say ancient <hi>Geographers</hi> of those times;) and, in token of their respect, suffered them to enjoy their ancient <hi>lawes, liberties</hi> and <hi>forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> as though they had not beene conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Tully</hi> gives the reason. <hi>Cum ei hominum generi praesimus non modo in quo ipsa sit, sed etiam à quo ad alios pervenisse putetur humanitas: certè iis eam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimùm tribuere debemus, à quibus accepimus.</hi> And doe not all piously-affected <hi>English</hi> owe so much honour and respect to the place, from whence the light of Christs glorious Gospell first shined unto their fore fathers, as to desire to be acquainted with the present and past estate of it?</p>
            <p>I have spoken of <hi>religion</hi> onely, but I might adde <hi>humanitatem, learning</hi> and good <hi>literature</hi> too. For with <hi>religion</hi> came <hi>learning:</hi> and in the dayes of <hi>Theodorus</hi> the seventh Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (if publike schooles wherein all good
<pb facs="tcp:22730:8"/>
Arts and Sciences, <hi>philosophy</hi> especially, are lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly taught and professed make an <hi>Vniversity) Canterbury</hi> was a <hi>famous Vniversity:</hi> yea, and was afterwards a patterne (as some have written and published) for the erection and foundation of a famous <hi>Vniversity</hi> in this land.</p>
            <p>This worke is chiefly collected from old <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts, Leiger-bookes</hi> and other <hi>Records</hi> of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, exhibited to me for the most part by the Treasury of our <hi>Cathedrall;</hi> which, as it exceeds most of the Realme, if not all, in beauty, state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and magnificence of building; so in this particular kinde of unvaluable treasure, is, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, inferior unto none. With the helpe of <hi>Spots History of Canterbury</hi> mentioned of <hi>Balaeus,</hi> and of <hi>Iohn Twine's</hi> collections of the Antiquities thereof spoken of by him in his <hi>Commentaries, de rebus Albionicis, &amp;c.</hi> could I but have gotten them, I should perchance have brought the work to more perfection: but with the helpes I have had, I have done my best endeavour that nothing might be strange or unknowne that carries with it any shew of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> either in the <hi>Church,</hi> (as the most eminent place of all) or in the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Suburbs</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Worke</hi> may not deserve thine acceptance (courteous Reader) for it selfe, let then the <hi>Authors</hi> love to <hi>Antiquities,</hi> his <hi>thankfull intentions</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>place</hi> of his <hi>birth, education</hi> and <hi>present

            <p>Now no one thing almost of this nature that discourse shall offer to the consideration of an English man, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Kentish man, shall finde more vulgar beleefe, nor is better grounded in tradition, then (my maine motive to the ensuing treatise) the Antiquity of this our City. And then it, what more celebrated in (the living Monuments of their deceased Authors) our stories and other like workes of English Writers?

            <p>As for the further discovery of the yet greater Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the place, if any shall desire it; let him consider with me in the next place, the names that former times have knowne it by. As the Saxons of old <note n="e" place="margin">Cambden <hi>in Kent.</hi>

               </gap> (i. the Kentish mens City, Court, or Borough:) A name well agreeing with that of <hi>Cair-Kent,</hi> or <hi>Caer-Kent</hi> (the City of Kent) as <hi>Nennius</hi> and the Britaines cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it.

With very little variation from which Romane name, you may finde that our elder Historians, <hi>Bede,</hi> and others called it <hi>Dorovernia,</hi> and <hi>Dorobernia:</hi> and that you see before, in the yeare 810. was called <hi>Antiquum voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum;</hi> and yet long afterwards in use, even untill that of <hi>Cantuaria,</hi> better answering to the English-Saxon, <hi>Cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warabyrig,</hi> and from about the Normane Conquest hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, more frequently then the other; and in time alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

                  <hi>Canterbury</hi> in being in the Romanes time.</note> of the Romanes Empire here. Let me adde, and before, in the preceding Britaines time too, as to me seemes somewhat evident from hence, that the Romane <hi>Durover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> is seemingly no other then the Latine-rendring of the Britaine <hi>Durwhern;</hi> by which or neere a like name (most probably) the Romanes found it called by the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains at their coming. However the mention of it in the Emperour <hi>Antonines Itinerary,</hi> more I take it, then foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred yeares old, and the many pieces of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Coyne, both of his, and also of preceding, and succeeding Emperours, found almost in all parts of the City; (some whereof are come to my hands) are evident tokens of the places great Antiquity. A thing not doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of a farre more learned, and judicious Surveyor of our City, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cambden</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Britannia. <hi>Of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>in</hi> Kent.</note>, in whose opinion it was famous in the Romanes time.</p>
            <p>One strong argument whereof amongst the rest, are the present remaines of a double Military way of theirs; the great Stone-causeys, I meane, directly leading from two of their famous havens, <hi>Dubris</hi> and <hi>Lemanis;</hi> unto this our City, the former by Barham-downe, the latter by Stone-streete.</p>
            <p>But (will some say:) what make I loytering here? It is neither in the Saxon, nor yet the Romane, neither the intervening Britain's time, that we are to expect the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Cities Originall. It's much elder: <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe <note place="margin">Elder then <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> not so old. Indeed I read that one <hi>Rud-hudibras</hi> or <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rudibras</hi> a King of the Britains almost nine hundred years, before our Saviours Incarnation, was our Cities Founder. <note place="margin">Of whom founded.</note> So sayes the Author of the British story, a Writer, though by the best of our Antiquaries <hi>(Cambden</hi> especially) for

            <head>The Citie wall, and Gates therein.</head>
            <p>VVHen <hi>Canterbury</hi> was first enclosed with a wall, I think, is no where to be found in story, or other record, either private or publick. Tokens of the walls good antiquitie are the British bricks, to be seen at <hi>Riding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> at the gate also now done up, sometime leading from the Castle-yard to <hi>Wencheape,</hi> and at <hi>Queningate,</hi> or rather (if you will) at the place in the wall, where once the gate so called stood, and is now also made up. But in greatest plenty, upon the bank on either side the River behinde S. <hi>Mildreds</hi> Church in the remaines of the wall there. And that the City was walled in before the Norman conquest, is evident by the testimonie of <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> 
               <note n="l" place="margin">Annal. Par. prior.</note>, who rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the siege and surprisall of the Citie by the Danes, in the time of King <hi>Etheldred, Anno Christi</hi> 1011. tells us, that (amongst particulars of the Danish crueltie, wreaked on the poore English people of the Citie) many of them being by the Danes cast headlong from the wall of the Citie met with death in the precipice.</p>
            <p>This may be further proved by severall Records of our Cathedrall, making mention of this wall in the English-Saxons time <note n="m" place="margin">In Archivis ecclesiae Christi. <hi>Cantuar.</hi>
               </note>. But that I may not seem to loyter, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely passe them by, and proceed to elder evidence. Now the first and most ancient mention of our City wall (I conceive) offers it self in King <hi>Ethelberts</hi> charter of the site of the Monastery called (from him, for whose sake it was founded of King <hi>Ethelbert)</hi> S. <hi>Augustines,</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 605. The ground therein set out for that intent being described to lie, <hi>sub orientali muro Civitatis Dorob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rniae.</hi> A plain argument of the Cities walling at that time, and (as I conjecture) Archbishop <hi>Parker's</hi> warrant for his <hi>Hanc muro cinctam</hi> 
               <note n="n" place="margin">Antiq. Brit. pag. 34.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he reports the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this City, with the Royaltie thereof by King
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22730:16"/>
               <hi>Ethelbert</hi> to <hi>Augustine.</hi> And that it was then walled, may hence be further argued, that as <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessour long after, is said to build S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Westminster</hi> without <hi>London-</hi>City-Wall, purposely for the place of his owne Sepulture <note n="o" place="margin">Post aleos vide <hi>Cambd.</hi> in Middlesex.</note>: so one maine end of the worke of that <hi>Augustinian</hi> Monastery, was (as both <hi>Ethelb.</hi> and <hi>Aug.</hi> in their severall Charters intimate) that it might be a Cimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or place of buriall for them and their successors; the Kings and Archbishops of the place for ever. And why? but even because of the then unlawfulnesse of buriall within Cities, and other walled Townes, a thing, by that <note n="*" place="margin">Though the Saxons in likelyhood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not that Romane law, yet <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> being a Romane did.</note> Law of the twelve Tables <hi>(Hominem mortuum infra ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem ne sepelito, neve urito.)</hi> flatly forbidden. So have I briefly trac'd our City Wals to the furthest of their known Antiquity.</p>
            <p>But, by the way, I may not conceale from you, what suspicion there is of (these Heralds of our City Wals An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity:) the <hi>Ethelbertine</hi> Charters to be fictitious and counterfeit. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> that learned and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admired Antiqua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y hath that opinion of them. And indeed, there is a note to be found in the Records of our Cathedrall <note n="p" place="margin">Vide Dom. <hi>Hen. Spelman.</hi> Tom. 1. Concil. pag. 125.</note>: which confirmes the suspicion. It tels us, that untill <hi>Withred</hi> (King of <hi>Kent)</hi> about the yeere of grace 700. that Church did peaceably enjoy it lands &amp; liberties, onely by custome, <hi>ex antiquo more,</hi> without any charters or other written muniments. Could it now be truly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>Withreds</hi> is the first and most ancient muniment of that Church, judging of the one by the other, this would give great cause of suspicion of the truth of those Ethelbertine charters. But in regard, that severall mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niments of elder times then <hi>Withreds,</hi> as one of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> sonne and successour of <hi>Ethelb:</hi> and two of <hi>Cedwalla</hi> the west-Saxon, made to this very Cathedrall, are to this day extant, being registred at length in the Leigers of that Church (I speak <hi>ex proprio visis)</hi> and, if judgement
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22730:17"/>
may be given by the agreement of the hands, even by the very pen of the authour of that note, there is more cause in my judgement to suspect that note, of falsitie, then those charters, which it may seem to question, of forgery.</p>
            <p>But the noble Knight sets before you (if you please to peruse them) other reasons for his opinion. I referre you to them, and them to your consideration: and so passe on to further discourse of our Citie wall. Which I conceive carries yet greater antiquitie, then hitherto hath been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. For (if as <hi>Huntington</hi> affirms it was) <hi>Canterbury</hi> were one of the 28 Cities infamousing this Iland in the Britains times, and of them called <hi>Kair-Chent,</hi> taking this note along with us, that <hi>Kair</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Caius</hi> de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitate <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabrig.</hi> lib. 16. 1</note> with them signified a wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defenced town or City, we need not doubt but it was walled in their times. And so much for the walls antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, now I passe to after-accidents that have betided it.</p>
            <p>The City (as I have given you a former touch) being by the <hi>Danes,</hi> in the dayes of King <hi>Etheldred,</hi> besieged, taken, and with the Cathedrall (as all our Chronologers agree) burnt and utterly wasted; the City wall (no doubt) being the Cities best securitie against a like surprisall, if it should still have stood, was not spared by that all-wasting enemy.</p>
            <p>I read that Archbishop <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> in the Conquerours time, was a great benefactour to the repaire of it. So saith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Lambert</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Perambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Kent.</hi> In <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </note>, and so <hi>Stow,</hi> followed by <hi>Speed.</hi> But no other story mentions it, no not that of his life and acts written by (his successour) Archbishop <hi>Parker.</hi> But so they say. Take it as I finde it. When or by whom soever it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, it is plain by the Monk of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> that in his time, which was about the yeare of grace 1142. in the reign of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> it was walled round. For he saith it was <note n="r" place="margin">De gest. Pontif. lib. 1. in Prologo.</note> then a City much renowned (amongst other things) for the walls whole and undecayed enclosing it round about. Which being so, and no violence offered them afterward
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:22730:17"/>
that we reade of, I marvell somewhat that there should be need of that fortification of the City with walls in <hi>Richard</hi> the first's time, as it seems there was: For the King being (it should appeare) taken prisoner in his return from the holy land, his Mother Q. <hi>Alianor,</hi> out of her care in her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sonnes behalfe, of this amongst other (as it seems) weak parts of the kingdome, takes order for the fortifying of it: as by her letters <note n="s" place="margin">In Archivis Ecclesiae <hi>Cant.</hi>
               </note> of the following tenor may appeare, written (itseems) at the instance and for the securitie of the Cathedrall Monks, fearfull that this one act of their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in the work of the Cities fortification, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe their libertie of <hi>Burgbote,</hi> and being drawn <hi>in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiam</hi> become a prejudiciall example, effectuall to compell them to the like in future time, as of the nature of a leading case.</p>

            <p>With like caution I finde the same Monks, a while after help forward the Cities defence another way. For in King <hi>Iohns</hi> time, <hi>Rich.</hi> 1. immediate successour, the Citizens after much suit to the Monks, prevailed with them at length, to sell them of their wood to make hurdles or wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles withall, for the defence of their City.

This <hi>Thomas Ickham,</hi> by the way, the Wall measurer, was Alderman of <hi>Burgate</hi> in the fourth yeare of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and dying the twenty sixe of May. 3. <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. was buried in Christ-Church. <note n="a" place="margin">Liber Ms. in Archivis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae Cant.</note> Others of his name and family, (I take it) lye buried in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as I shall show hereafter.</p>
            <p>By this Record you may perceive that the whole Wall betweene Westgate and Northgate was not then built, as now we see it is. For on either side the River, the Wall, by this Record, clearely breakes off, so that there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terjected distance of eighteene perches long betweene the one, and the other Wall. And indeed it will easily appeare to be but a slight observation; that so much of the Wall as stands and is made up in that then un-walled part, namely betweene the Posterne and the Waterlocke, next Northgate, through which in Arches, with a Portclose, the River now passeth from Abbots Mill, is in the stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke much different from the rest of the Wall, and shewes not in any part the least wracke or decay, as the other doth. It seemes then that Archbishop <hi>Sudbury</hi> built not all the long Wall.</p>
            <p>But enough of the Wall, unlesse the City of latter time had more tendred her own credit and safety in keeping it better repaired. In pity and just reproofe whereof (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this City, or any other) I crave leave here a little to enlarge my selfe. A Cities aspect is much blemished by ruinous edifices: especially publicke, and in places most obvious to the eye. Now what more publicke and obvious then the City Wall? Against this deformity the Civill law very carefully provides, which sayes: <hi>Civitas ruinis non debet deformari.</hi>

               <head>The Gates.</head>
               <p>The Gates of the City come next to be considered of. The Wall at this day admits of onely sixe (except the three Posternes) answering to the number of the Wards, Burgate, Newingate, Ridingate, Worthgate, Westgate, and Northgate. Anciently we had another, a seventh gate, which was called <hi>Queningate,</hi> whereof mention is made in the fore-going note of the measure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City Wall. I will briefely speake of them all, beginning with that whereof I finde eldest mention, Burgate, or Burrough-gate.</p>

It was afterwards, and still is otherwise called Saint <hi>Michaels-</hi>gate, from the Church so called sometime neighbouring to it. About the yeare of Grace 1475. This Gate was new builded, at whose charges is to be seene up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gate, without, where you may finde the principall

And in, or about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. reigne, I finde there arose a great debate, ending in a suite in law, betweene the City and the Abby concerning Limits; occasioned chiefely by the Citizens challenge, and the Monkes deniall of this way, to lye and be within the liberty and franchese of the City. The qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell happened in the time of the Bailiffes, who in their passage to and from S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Martins</hi> by that way, with their Maces, the ensignes of their Magistracy borne up before them, so distasted the Monkes, that on a time meeting them and their company upon the place, and not prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them <hi>verbis;</hi> or by force of argument to desert their, and the Cities claime in that behalfe: impatient of the affront, they attempted it <hi>vi,</hi> or by force of armes, endeavouring by strong hand to force them from the place, but being the weaker party, were put to the worst. To suit then they goe, but the issue what it was I cannot learne, onely I have seene (and have a Copy of) an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawne and framed on the Monkes part, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their limits and liberties, to the doing whereof

the premised difference gave the occasion. However the way continued and lay common till our memory. And here, in all probability, lay the most ancient rode between <hi>Burgate</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Martins,</hi> it meets in so streight a line, the rodes at either end; whereas Long-port rode lyes wide of them both, more south from the Abby: the rode being so turned of purpose (as I conceive) to make more way, and give larger scope for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Augustines</hi> Church-yard. And (which moves me most) the first site of the Abbey is bounded South to <hi>Burgate</hi> way, and not to Long-port <note n="f" place="margin">Vide C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it took not the name of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingate, that is Newgate, from this new building of it; but was much more anciently so called. For about the middle of the eleventh Century, in a Bull of Pope <hi>Alex.</hi> 3. to the Monkes of Christ-church, I read this; <hi>In civitate Cantuar. Ecclesiam scil.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, by it the road is continued, directly from Castle-street into Winchep, and <hi>è contra:</hi> whereas Winchep-gate carries no shew of the least antiquitie; and beside stands wide of Winchep, making the passenger wheel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and fetch a compasse to come to it. Besides observe the name, which I suppose taken up and given it since the building of the Castle, Worthgate, that is (as I conceive) the Castle-gate, or gate by the Castle: Worth (as some interpretit <note n="q" place="margin">Remaines of Surnames <hi>in verb.

               <p>Now the first of these stages betweene <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Richborough (Noviomagus) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cambden</hi> conceiveth to be that which is now called <hi>Woodcote,</hi> a little village neare <hi>Croydon</hi> in <hi>Surrey.</hi> The next <hi>(Vagniac.)</hi> he takes for <hi>Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> a Towne well knowne in <hi>Kent.</hi> The third <hi>(Durobro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis)</hi> for <hi>Rochester</hi> City.

               </p>
               <p>As for the third and two last of these stages, there is no cause of doubt (as I conceive) but he hits them aright: the <hi>Quaere</hi> rests then onely upon the other three. Now it will, I thinke, be easily granted that the Roman-roads betweene Port and Port; and betweene one great Towne and another, were made and laid out as direct and streight

And that the rode or Port-way betweene <hi>London</hi> and these Port-Townes was streight and without much winding, appeareth plainely by the totall of the miles, not onely betweene them (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially betweene <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Dover</hi> being reckoned but at 66. a distance which it holds almost to this day, though the English be longer then the Italian miles:) but also, if you marke it betweene <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Rochester,</hi> and between <hi>Rochester</hi> also and <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the former being 27. the latter 25. If this be so, the Traveller goes much awry and out of his way, that setting out of <hi>London,</hi> and bound for <hi>Richborough,</hi> goes first eight or ten miles wide of <hi>London,</hi> to <hi>Woodcote:</hi> from thence to <hi>Maidstone</hi> some 24. miles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder: and from <hi>Maidstone</hi> makes to <hi>Rochester</hi> (oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the way, without gaining a step nearer his journeys end, when he is there: and then quatering againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes into <hi>Maidstone</hi> rode, and salutes <hi>Lenham,</hi> and so makes forward. He that takes his way thus shall finde it little lesse thrn 80. of our miles betweene <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The case thus standing, suffer me to give my weake conjecture how the Rode might lye in the Romans time; and to tell you whereabout I guesse these Stations, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or stages that the <hi>Itinerary</hi> speakes of, were severally seated, and may now probably be found.</p>
               <p>As for the first then, being <hi>Noiomagus,</hi> or <hi>Noviomagus,</hi> and that seated tenne miles from <hi>London;</hi> I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <note place="margin">Noviomagus.</note> how it should be a stage for this rode, and lye wide of <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Woodcote</hi> doth, so many miles, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set the Traveller at as great a distance from the place whither he is bound <hi>(Richborough)</hi> as when he first set out
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22730:25"/>
of <hi>London.</hi> Considering this, and the distance betweene <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Rochester,</hi> by the <hi>Itinerary,</hi> I should rather place it about <hi>Crayford,</hi> much about tenne miles from <hi>London,</hi> upon or alongst some Hill or Downe, since it is otherwise called <hi>Noviodunum.</hi>

               <p>This Prison in those dayes was knowne by the name of the Spech-house. <hi>Nicholaus de Wilt-shire Priso in Gaola Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitatis Cant. vocat Spech-house moriebatur, &amp;c.</hi> say the Crowne-Rolls, 11. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2.

Our forefathers, whose wits the frequency of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion prompted to all manner of warlike invention, used to secure their City-gates against assailants, not onely with a Port-close to let downe before it, but also with a warlike device built over it, through which they could let downe any offensive thing against the enemy approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to assaile it. A Gate so fortified was called <hi>Porta ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checollata,</hi> from <hi>machecollare,</hi> or <hi>machecoulare,</hi> which (saith my Auther <note n="b" place="margin">Coke <hi>upon</hi> Litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sect. 1. pag 5.</note>) is to make a warlike device over a Gate or other passage like to a Grate, through which scalding water, or ponderous or offensive things may be cast upon the assailants. Thus he. After this manner were and are our two principall Gates built, this of Westgate, and in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof that of Newingate, with each of them a Port-close, like as Burgate: now to Northgate.</p>
               <p>This Gate stands under apart of Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Church, <note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Under the Quire or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell whereof is a Vault, with an open space or lope-hole in the Wall fashioned like a Crosse. It was sometime an Hermitage, but is now belonging to the Parsonage.</p>
               <p>Come we now to <hi>Queningate.</hi> But where shall we seeke it? Thereis none of the name at this day, and few know <note place="margin">Queningate.</note> where it stood. I sought as narrowly for it as for Ants<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths, and at length having found it will shew you where it was. It stood against the Priory of Christ Church, saith
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:22730:29"/>
our Wall-measurer, distanced from Northgate (saith he) 69. perches, but saith an Elder record of Christ Church, 71. perches. By these descriptions it must needs have stood neare the place of the now Posterne-gate, against S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Augustines.</hi> And indeed a remanent of British brickes laid and couched Arch-wise at a place in the Wall, a little North-ward of the Posterne, showes the very place. A small Gate it was <hi>(Parva porta de Queningate,</hi> saith <hi>Ickham;)</hi> but I will assure you a very ancient one, as not onely the Bricks-betoken, but the records of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> prove it, which tell that one <hi>Domwaldus</hi> (as I told you on a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer occasion) gave to that Abby certaine land within Queningate. The very name hath antiquity in it, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King or Queenes gate, being haply <hi>Ethelbert</hi> and his Queene <hi>Bertha</hi> their passage from their Palace neare adjoyning to the severall places of their divers devotions: the one (if <hi>Thorne</hi> say true) at Saint <hi>Pancrace</hi> (so after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called;) the other at Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> whereof more hereafter <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> S. August.</note>.</p>
               <p>Where the Church or Chappell stood, that had it name from this Gate, being called Saint <hi>Mary</hi> of Queningate, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Mary</hi> of Queningate Church.</note> I cannot well tell. That such a Church it had, is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. I trace it in many records (some 450 yeares old and more) of Christ-Church, which had the Patronage of that and Saint <hi>Michael</hi> of Burgate, confirmed to them in and by a Bull of Pope <hi>Alex.</hi> 3. and in many like Buls since. The Parson thereof in the yeare 1381. as those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords informe me, made an exchange of it and Burgate to which it was an annexed Chap. for <hi>Portpole</hi> Chantery in <hi>Pauls.</hi> This being certaine, it is no lesse sure that it stood not farre from the Gate, by the name of it; yet not very neare, it is like, because the bounders of the City-Wall and ground under it, betweene Northgate and Quenin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and betweene it and Burgate, granted to Christ-Church, neither of them mention it: and <hi>Ickhams</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:22730:29"/>
measurement saith Queningate stood <hi>versus Prioratum ecclesiae Christi,</hi> not <hi>versus,</hi> nor <hi>juxta ecclesiam</hi> or <hi>capellam de Quening.</hi> I must leave it, untill I am better instructed where to finde it. And so I have done with both Wall and Gates, and come now unto (my next Particular) the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Ditch. Only let me but name unto you the Posternes, which (as erewhile I told you) were three. One against <note place="margin">Posternes.</note> Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> a second at Saint <hi>Mildreds,</hi> and the third by the Sconce running from Abbats-Mill.</p>

For whether the City-Ditch be there inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or some siege rather or beleaguering of the City (for that sense the word <hi>Fossatum</hi> also carries:) it is to me some question.

Some take it for a Sentinell-house, a Scout-house. <hi>Chaucer</hi> useth the word <hi>Barbican</hi> for a Watch-to wer. Of the Saxon <hi>Ber-ic-ken.</hi> i. I ken or see the <hi>Borough,</hi> &amp;c. Here I will briefely prove unto you two things. 1. That there was <hi>Barbican.</hi> 2. The place where it stood. In a record of the City Chamber, shewing how the Fee-ferme of the City in <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. time was to be raised, occurres the name of the <hi>Barbican,</hi> in these words. <hi>De Barbicane,</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. <hi>qui debentur in comp'to super S'ccum.</hi> I finde also in the elder Rentals of Christ-Church, frequent mention of it, as a boundary to certaine of the Churches <hi>Demesnes</hi> lying neare it without Worthgate, in these or the like words. <hi>Extra Worgate juxta fossatum del Bayle, sed nunc Barbecan appellatur:</hi> and the like. Now that it was, is plaine enough. The place where it was, comes next to be inquired. I have seene a record of the 6. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. purporting that the City-Coroner coming to doe his office upon the dead Body of a murdered servant of the Prior of Christ-Church: he was not permitted, but the body being conveyed to the <hi>Barbecan, extra Castrum Cant.</hi> was there set upon and searched by a forreigne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner. Now it must of necessity follow that this place where the inquest was taken (the <hi>Barbecan)</hi> was without the Cities liberty: but there is not neare the Castle any place, save the Castle-yard, that is so. The Record (if you please to see it) is extant in my <hi>Appendix, pag.</hi> 298. The Castle-yard, and Wall then now much impaired with age; but sometimes set with divers Watch-towers, foure at least, and which was otherwise called the Bulwarke, being the fore-fence to the Castle, was undoubtedly the <hi>Barbican,</hi> or the place and structure, which former ages knew and called by that name. I collect and conclude it also from that of <hi>Fossatum del Bayle, &amp;c.</hi> which cannot otherwise be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood then of the Ditch about the Castle-yard-wall, which (untill of late that the piece of Wall was made betweene Winchep-gate and it at the one side, and the like at the other) compassed the same. Now for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the use and condition of this military structure,

The great commoditie and conveniency of our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties plantation by this river is attended by and with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie and annoyance of inundation. But our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, the Cities first <hi>Incolae,</hi> weighed not the inconvenience of the one, for the benefit and accommodation of the other. And it is an inconvenience in these dayes scarcely considerable, because seldome happening; or that can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in regard the City lies higher now then at thefirst, having in all parts of itbeen much raised at severall times, as cellar-diggers, and such like, who are much hindred in their work by old foundations which they meet with in their digging, daily finde: occasioned (as I conceive) by the many vastations of the City in the Danes time, and lastly about the yeare of our Lord 1160. by casuall fire.</p>
            <p>The greatest channell of this our river, ran anciently through the middest of the City, to the Kings-mill. For I finde Archbishop <hi>Pickham</hi> charged by the Citizens with the diverting of it, by certain cuts or trenches, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of his mill at Westgate: which the Jury found to have been done before partly in Archb. <hi>Kilwarby,</hi> and partly in Archb. <hi>Boniface</hi> times <note n="z" place="margin">Liber Camerae Civitatis.</note>. The channell to Westgate then (it seems) became inlarged. But the first division of the stream was not then made. For, that <hi>Stour</hi> had it course that way much more anciently then those times, is most cleare. For I finde it to give name in the Conq. time, to the Archbishops Mannor, since and at this day called Westgate (from the situation of it neare that gate:) but then, from the standing of it by the <hi>Stour-</hi>side, <hi>Stour-seat,</hi> the seat by the <hi>Stour;</hi> as that other part of her divided chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell gave name to the street it runs by, called to this day Stourstree, that is, the street by or nigh the <hi>Stour.</hi>

Who, <hi>requisitus an fuerat Firmarius dicti mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendini, dixit quòd non, sed fatetur ipsum fore servientem Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorum Civitatis Cantuar. per eos ibid. deputatum.

               <p>This suit happened in the yeare 1366. however this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of it mentions the Maiors of the City, which came not into being, by name, untill almost a 100. yeares after. Since these times, the case is altered with this mill. For (I take it) the City bakers of these dayes, neither are tied to grinde their corn at this mill (as by this note they seem to be:) nor yet have any such priviledge of grinding at that mill toll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>free, as then, for white bread. I have but one thing more to acquaint you with touching this mil.

            <p>These auspicious beginnings had answerable proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. For the foundation of the Abbey thus laid, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in processe of time much advanced, both in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of her buildings, and augmentations of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment. For the first. After the death of King <hi>Ethelb. Eadbaldus</hi> (his sonne) at the instance of <hi>Lawrence</hi> the Archb' builded a faire Church in this Monastery which he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:22730:45"/>
called <hi>S. Maries.</hi> After <hi>Eadbaldus,</hi> King <hi>Canute</hi> (the great Monarch of this Realme:) <hi>Egelsine</hi> (the Abbat that fled for feare of the Conquerour:) <hi>Scotlandus</hi> (whom the same King put in <hi>Egelsin's</hi> place:) <hi>Hugh Floriac</hi> (that was of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and by him made Abbat:) were the persons that chiefly increased the building: some bestowing Churches and Chapels; some Dortors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectories or dining places, and others other sort of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices <note n="p" place="margin">Lamb. <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amb. of</hi> Kent <hi>in</hi> Canterbury.</note>.</p>
            <p>Now for the latter, her increase in possessions and indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would be too tedious a matter to particularize but the one halfe of the donations and grants of lands and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues that were made and given by the multitude of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors of all sorts, who out of the heat of their devotion to the place, for the double founders sake, the one the great instrument of Christianisme brought and wrought amongst the Saxon people of those parts, the other (by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on his endeavours) the first Christian King of the English-Saxon race, strived of holy zeal, according to their knowledge to out-strip one another in an open handed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie to this Abbey.

King <hi>Eadbald</hi> his sonne and next Successor, who gave the mannor of <hi>Northborne,</hi> consisting of 30 plough-lands. King <hi>Lothaire,</hi> who gave 3 plough-lands in <hi>Stodmersh.</hi> King <hi>Withred,</hi> who gave the mannor of <hi>Littleborne</hi> of 5 plough-lands.

Kenewulf</hi> King of <hi>Mercia</hi> and <hi>Cuthred</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> who gave the mannor of <hi>Lenham,</hi> consisting of 20 plough-lands and 13 Denes. King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wulf</hi> the West-Saxon, who gave 40 Caslatos (Mansions I take it) in <hi>Lenham.</hi> King <hi>Ethelhert</hi> the West-Saxon also, who gave the mannor of <hi>Merton</hi> in East <hi>Kent,</hi> of 3 plough-lands. King <hi>Canute,</hi> who together with the body S. <hi>Mildred</hi> the virgin of <hi>Thanet,</hi> gave unto the Abbey all the indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that late Monastery. King <hi>Edgar</hi> who gave <hi>Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,</hi>

of 4 plough lands. <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, who gave all the land he had in <hi>Fordwich.</hi>

            <p>The succeeding Kings, for the most part, were rather confirmers or restorers of the old, then contributers of new possessions to this Abbey. Whose Charters (as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) are many of them already published partly in <hi>Reyner's Apostolatus Benedictinorum,</hi> and partly in <hi>Wevers</hi> Funerall Monuments. Wherefore I spare their recitall here. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I wade or enter farre into discourse of the once flourishing estate of this ancient Abbey, lest I finde it (as I may justly feare it) even endlesse. For so many were the priviledges, so wide the possessions, and so very great the estimation of this Abbey, in many respects (that of it being, of old, the selected place for the Royall and Archiepisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall sepulture, not the least:) as few other in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did or could in all points paralell it.</p>

            <p>It neither may, nor will (I know) be imagined but that this Abbey tasted of both fortunes.

            <p>Whereof the first in time and not of least regard was her losse of the long enjoyed right and interest to the burialls of the Kings and Archbishops, of which, the former, in Archbishop <hi>Brightwald's,</hi> and the latter in <hi>Cutbert's</hi> dayes were first taken from it <note n="x" place="margin">Lamb. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amb. of</hi> Kent <hi>in</hi> Canterbury.</note>.</p>
            <p>Another was the grievous and frequent infestation of <note place="margin">Abby infected by the Danes.</note> the place by the Danes: which (however their Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clers, for their Abbeys greater glory, sometimes ascribe their safety, defence and deliverance from those Invaders to a miraculous preservation:) yet doubtlesse either suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their violence, or at the least, and at the best, purchased their peace (and so prevented their greater calamity) at a deare rate, and with costly redemptions, especially in that lamentable spoil and devastation of the City under King <hi>Etheldred,</hi> in the yeare 1011. The recorders of the tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call story whereof, the elder Monks, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington, Roger Hoveden,</hi> and others, (whose pens a miracle so mainly tending to the advancement of Monkery, in all likelihood could not have escaped) tell of no such miracle as <hi>Thorne</hi> will have the Abbey then rescued and saved by, which was, that when a Dane had taken hold of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> pall or cloak (wherewith his tombe was covered) it stuck so fast to his fingers, that by no means possible he could lose it, till he came and yeelded himself to the Monks, and made sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull confession of his fault. Which thing so terrified the rest of the Danes, that they desisted and ceased from inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Monastery, and became chief protectors and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of it. <hi>Cum Dani</hi> (as <hi>Thornes</hi> own words are) <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

(foure hundred yeares ago) made between the then Archbishop and his Archdeacon of the one part, and the then Abbat, of the other: (amongst other things) touching Jurisdiction, and right to the coertion of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous persons of the Monastery delinquent in the Diocesse of <hi>Cant. extra septa sui Monasterii, quae continent elemosinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am extra portam eorum,</hi> as the composition wordeth it. <hi>Hugh</hi> the Abbat, of that name the second, when he divided and distinguished the offices of his Monastery <note n="d" place="margin">

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:22730:49"/>
observable (except the faire Hall, the late Refectory of the Monkes) is <hi>Ethelb.</hi> Tower. Not so called (as vulgar <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ethelberts</hi> Tower.</note> tradition will fabulously tell you it was) from the building of it, either by him, or by others in his time. In honor and memory of him I will grant it was, but yet long since his dayes, being not built (I take it) untill about the yeare 1047. For (as it is in the private Chronicler, <hi>Thorne)</hi> the then Archbishop <hi>Eadsin,</hi> beside some other acts of his bounty to the Abbey, gave 100. markes, <hi>ad turris aedifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, quae tunc fuerat in construendo,</hi> meaning this Tower, as I conceive. Other certainty of the age of it, I cannot give, and so leave it with the words of <hi>Speed</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Hist. pag. 294.</note>, who in the close of his discourse touching this Abbey, thus speakes of it.

               <hi>Augustine</hi> came; and used by the King, before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to Christianity, for the place of his Idol-worship, but after it, the first that <hi>Augustine,</hi> after he had purged it from the worship of the false, consecrated to the service of the true God, and dedicated to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pancrace.</hi> Wherewith the devill all inraged, and not brooking his ejection from the place he had so long enjoyed; the first time that <hi>Augustine</hi> celebrates masse there, furiously assaults the Chapell to overturne it. But having more of will then power to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his intended mischiefe, all he could doe was to leave the ensignes of his malice, the prints of his talons on the South-Porch-Wall of the Chapell, where they are visible to this day. Thus <hi>Thorne</hi> tels the tale. And no better then a tale can I conceive it to be. I will grant that a Chappell of that name, of no small antiquity there was sometime
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:22730:50"/>
standing, where a good part of her ruines are yet left, built almost wholly of British or Romane bricke (infallible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines of antiquity:) That on the Walls out-side of the South-Porch, such tokens as the Historian will have to be the markes of the Beast, are visible enough: That of latter time this Story became vulgarly received. <hi>(Hamon Beale,</hi> to instance in one for many, <hi>Anno</hi> 1492. gives by his Will <note n="f" place="margin">Penes Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum Domini Archid.

But that either this was the place, where Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> first said masse in <hi>England</hi> (S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Martins</hi> was it, as <hi>Bede</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Ecclesiastic. Hist. lib. 1. cap. 26.</note> will tell you:) or that the story is further true then I have granted, I cannot beleeve.</p>
            <p>To give you my reasons. Consult venerable <hi>Bede's</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his Ecclesiasticall Story, and you shall finde he there acknowledgeth his intelligence for these parts received chiefely from <hi>Albinus</hi> the then Abbat of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>August.</hi> who with diligence instructed him in all things that either by written record, or tradition of his Elders, had come unto his knowledge, any way memorable. But take his owne words. <hi>Auctor ante omnes</hi> (saith he) <hi>atque adjutor opusculi hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus Albinus Abbas reverendissimus, vir per omnia doctissimus, extitit. Qui in ecclesia Cantuariorum à beatae memoriae Theodoro Archiepiscopo &amp; Hadriano Abbate viris venerabilibus at erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimis institutus, diligenter omnia quae in ipsa Cantuariorum provincia, vel etiam in contiguis ejusdem regionibus à discipulis beati Papae Gregorii gesta fuere, vel monumentis litterarum, vel seniorum traditione cognoverat, &amp; ea mihi de his quae memoria digna videbantur per religiosum Londoniensis Ecclesiae presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum Nothelmum, sive litteris mandata sive ipsius Nothelmi viva voce referendo, transmisit.</hi> Thus <hi>Bede.</hi> Adde hereunto that this was a matter so remarkable, an occurrence, so much in itselfe, but in respect of the circumstances of time and place, much more memorable. Of time: It happening so in the very infancy of the English-Saxon Christian Church. Of place: Being such as from an Idol temple
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:22730:50"/>
was become, and that but newly a Christian Oratory, that, then it, there is not a thing more worthy to be kept in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory in the whole story of the times: and therefore could not have escaped the one, the intelligencers <hi>(Albine's)</hi> knowledge, nor consequently the other, the Historian <hi>(Bede's)</hi> pen. But, for all this, looke and you shall finde, that <hi>Bede</hi> is so farre from making mention of it, that he remembers not so much as the Chapell. This is much. But let me adde yet further. The following Chronologers, for the most part Monkes all, passe it over in deepe silence. Could fame have beene (thinke you) so sluggish, or so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, that so famous a matter as this should fall from no Authors pen till (in comparison) but yesterday, till <hi>Spott</hi> and <hi>Thornes</hi> dayes? The case so standing for me, <hi>credat Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus apella.</hi> And so I leave it.</p>
            <p>Now being upon taking our leave of the Abbey, and <note place="margin">Church yard.</note> making our retraict, let me lead you (as the next way out) over the forgotten Sepulchres of the dead; the ancient Cimitery ground of the Abbey, and so out at the gate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Burgate. Which great and faire Gate, with a battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that warlike invention of machicollation, called <hi>Porta occidentalis Cimiterii St</hi>

               <note n="h" place="margin">Sic in Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitione inter Abbatiam &amp; Civitatem, de qua pag. 275.</note>, heretofore lead from Church-street (for so the street before it hath usually beene called) into S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Augustines</hi> Church-yard. A buriall place not private and proper onely to the Abbey, nor only free to the choice of any that desired buriall there; but with all untill the Dissolution, the proper and onely Cimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery belonging unto divers Parish-Chuches of the City, destitute of such Dormitories of their owne, of which the Abbey had the patronage: such as were S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Andrew,</hi> and (as I verily beleeve) S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> too; however because of late some question hath beene made of it, I will not contend. But what if it shall appeare, that for more then 100. yeares together, next before the Dissolution of the Abbey, not one of the many testators of those Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes have once mentioned any Church-yard of their owne, either in appointment of it for the place of their buriall (as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:22730:51"/>
in other parishes that had Church-yards it was usuall to doe) or otherwise; though of their Churches often? That scores, if not hundreds of them have from time to time pitched on this common Cimitery of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Augustine</hi> for the place and purpose afore-said? that after the Dissolution, and that Cimitery withdrawne and taken from them, not yet a testator of succeeding times wills to be laid in any Church-yard of their owne; but, as now to seeke of a resting place for their bodies after death peculiar to them, betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for buriall to the Church-yards of Neighbour-Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes? That as the situation of two of these Parish-Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches will not admit of any adjoyning Churchyard: the one, like <hi>Fan-</hi>Church in <hi>London,</hi> standing in the middest of the street, the other in a throng of contiguous houses; so the the third needed none in regard of the neerenesse of it to this Churchyard of the Abby, which in right &amp; title (I take it) of foundation, had the patronage of it? That it was the knowne Monkish policy, for the gaine sake, to draw all the burials they could to their Abbey, and for that end proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <note place="margin">A piece of Monkish po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</note> at the Churches foundation, wittingly debarred the people of a Churchyard, to their Church: and lastly that this Abbey and Cimitery was built and set a part for a buriall of old, when as yet it was not lawfull to bury in Cities. If these things (I say) shall be made appeare and proved, as they easily may, what judicious and indifferent man then will conceive, against the strength of so much probability and presumption to the contrary, that these Churches had their proper Cimiteries adjoyning to them, however there may be some who (in confidence of not being gainesaid, because of their somewhat extraordinary age) shall say they had? But <hi>videant quorum interest.</hi> And so I leave this Abbey.</p>
            <p>The next thing after this Abbey, in the Suburbs, which I shall servey, is the Church of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Martin,</hi> much celebrated <note place="margin">S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Martin.</note> both for the great antiquity of it, and also for the resort of <hi>Augustine</hi> and his fellow-labourers thither to their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at their first arivall <note n="i" place="margin">

With which the same <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> finding them scarce well able to subsist, in augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, added 20 <hi>lib. per annum</hi> more to their former means,

But for some inconveniences (that of the leprous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people of this Hospitall, the main, rendring them both unable and unfit to attend and intermeddle in a tithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, especially so remote:) his next Successor <hi>Iohn Peckham</hi> alters and revokes what he <hi>(Kilwardby)</hi> had done, and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>integrates the Hospitalls into their former estate. Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Stratford</hi> afterwards gets the King <hi>(Ed.</hi> 3.) of whom this Parsonage held <hi>in capite,</hi> by his Charter, to appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it <hi>mensae Archiepiscopali,</hi> to the Archbishops table, yet charged with that old payment or stipend, which <hi>Simon I slip</hi> afterwards, with consent of the Chapter, the Prior and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, confirms unto them, and that (for the better strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their title, maintainable as yet onely by customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry right, having no sufficient <hi>jus scritpum</hi> to show) by his charter in writing, whereby to recover it, if at any time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied or detained. Ever since which time they have peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enjoyed the same. These things I thought good the rather to deduce, that I might vindicate that false aspersion wherewith some of the old people of these Hospitalls, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant altogether of the premised passages, are wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave some of the Archbishops of former times, for depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them of this and that Mannor, and I know not what other means, revenues and indowment, wherewith they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:22730:61"/>
say and will tell you their houses were at first so richly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, as they cannot think their Prior of old time, any lesse man forsooth then a Lord Prior, I wot. But thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have told them, and they think they may take it up upon trust, and say as much after them.</p>
            <p>I shall not insist on the specification of the other reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of this Hospitall, whereof, by the charity of former times, it hath a pretty competency: <hi>Eilgar</hi> at <hi>Bourne</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Tonford</hi> neighbours to the place in their time being the prime (I take it) of the secular benefactors, as King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. was of the Royall, who gave to the poore here 20 marks a yeare, out of of the City Fee-ferme, payable by the Chamber.</p>
            <p>This Hospitalls ancient governour, now called a Master, was a Deane. For to a very ancient deed of the Hospitall (amongst other witnesses) one <hi>Benedict</hi> in the first place subscribes, with this addition of <hi>tunc temporis Decani de san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto Nicolao.</hi> Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. <note n="d" place="margin">Inter Chartas Hospitalis.</note> by his bull, discharged this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitall of payment of tithes <hi>de hertis, virgultis &amp; animalium nutrimentis.</hi>

            <p>Hitherto and enough of the care taken for their bodies, and the furnishing of them with the necessaries of this life. Next, of the provision made for their souls, and their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian instruction that might prepare them for that better one to come.</p>

Hospitall, obligeth <hi>Estbridge</hi> Hospitall to the finding (not of a Vicar, the living was too slender to maintaine one, but) of a Chaplaine who should officiate and minister to them <hi>in divinis</hi> (as the foresaid Instrument will show:) In this, Archbishop <hi>Wittlesey</hi> afterwards finding some incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, <note place="margin">Harbal downe <hi>Chantery.</hi>

            <p>I was willing to enlarge my selfe in this matter the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because the state of this Church inquired into by some, but unknowne of most, I would make as evident as my reading and observation had enabled me.

            <p>What he there addes of a Priory of black Canons, which (as he saith) was originally annexed to this Hospitall by <hi>Lanfranc</hi> the founder, is but a tale.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. pag. 158.</note> saith was the first the Kingdome had, being built (as he delivers) by <hi>Adelwold</hi> or <hi>Ethelwolph, Hen.</hi> 1. his confessor, that first (if we may beleeve him) brought the order into this Land.</p>
            <p>What number of Canons here were required by the foundation, I know not, but in a visitation <note n="p" place="margin">Lib. Registri Consistor. Cant.</note> of the Priory by Cardinall <hi>Bourchier,</hi> onely five give up their names with the Prior, who indeed then complained of the pauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Canons, which (as he layes the fault) was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the diminution of their revenewes, or (in his owne words) their Lands, Tents and Rents. Which their reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new what it was, or where it lay, I can say but little; because I could never as yet get a sight of the Leiger.</p>
            <p>Concerning this Priory, in the Booke of <hi>Doomsday,</hi> in the Archbishops Mannor of Stove-saete or Westgate (as we now call it) thus I read. <hi>Et inibi sunt iterum</hi> xxx. <hi>&amp;</hi> ij. <hi>mansurae &amp; unum molendinum, quae tenent clerici sancti Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorii ad eorum ecclesiam.

            <p>As for any remarkeable matter or occurrence concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Priory untill the suppression, I read of none <note n="r" place="margin">Lambert Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amb. of <hi>Kent</hi> in <hi>Canterbury.</hi>

            <p>As appertaining, so also adjoyning to this Priory, before and untill the Dissolution (yea and after too) was a Coemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Church-yard, not proper onely to the Priory, for the buriall of the Domesticks, but which was (whether of right, or by curtesie onely, I know not) common to others also with them, and those not the Hospitallars onely (the reason why they were till very lately destitute of any Church-yard within themselves) but also the Parishioners of <hi>Northgate,</hi> their neighbours, of which Church this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory had the Patronage, who did constantly, by their Wils, appoint their Burials in that Church-yard, and never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion other of their owne: it faring with them as with those other Parish Churches of the City, which belonging some to Christ-Church, some to Saint <hi>Augustines,</hi> had their want of Church-yards supplyed by those Monasteries. This at Saint <hi>Gregories</hi> continued to the Parish of <hi>Northgate</hi> after the dissolution, untill (as the tradition goes) Sir <hi>Iohn Boys</hi> the late Tenent to the Priory obtained to appropriate and inclose it upon exchange of the moderne Church-yard

ground for it with the Churchwardens of Northgate for the time being. It continued (I say) till then to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, for a buriall place; <hi>de facto,</hi> but was not acknowledged theirs of right. For at a visitation <note n="s" place="margin">Lib.

in same state with other like places about the City: this Priory is pleaded to be as without the walls, so without the liberty also of the same City in these words, <hi>viz.

This of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time was fired in <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. time, as I finde by certain letters of the Hospitall under their seal, framed after the manner of a brief, &amp; directed to all prelates in generall, wherein they in pitifull manner deplore their miserable estate occasioned (as they say) by a late lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire happening in their house, which had wasted their Hospitall and adjacent edifices, in the which were more then an 100 poore people sustained, with desire of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable relief, letting them know (as the most perswasive Rhetorick of that age) what indulgences had been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their benefactors by severall Archbishops and Bishops of former times.</p>

            <head>Division of the City into Wards.</head>
            <p>THe Wards of our City at this day are, as (I take it) <note place="margin">Number and names of the Wards.</note> they ever were, nor more nor lesse then sixe in number. In name distinguished and differenced from each other, by the names of the sixe principall Gates, that is. 1. West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-ward. 2. Newingate-ward. 3. Northgate-ward. 4. Worthgate-ward. 5. Burgate-ward, and 6. Ridingate-ward. Of that number at first, haply in imitation of the Shires division into 6. Lathes, whereof it did of old consist.</p>
            <p>Of the first division made of the City into Wards, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther written Record, nor unwritten Tradition makes any <note place="margin">Their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> mention. But I conceive it very ancient. The whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (it seemes) in the Conquerors time, was but one intire hundred. For <hi>Doomsday</hi> Booke speaking of the Churches Mannor of <hi>Barton,</hi> which it calleth <hi>North-wood,</hi> saith it was <hi>de hundredo de Cantuarberia,</hi> as the very words are. If so, it was not long ere a sub-division made of it, haply for more easie and good Government, into divers severall hundreds, namely into the sixe Wards or hundreds now under our Survey. For the more ancient appellation and terme given to those our Cities moderne sub-divisions of Wards, was Hundred, as almost all our eldest deeds and other like evidences doe witnesse, which generally, close with a <hi>memorandum,</hi> that they were first made and recorded in the hundred of that Division (as in the hundred of West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, Burgate, and so alike for the rest) and afterwards in the Burgmote of the City. Another terme they had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what varying from the other in sound, but of synonymall sense and signification with it, which was <hi>Bertha,</hi> a frequent phrase in our ancient evidences.</p>
            <p>These Divisions, <hi>Fitz-Stephens,</hi> in his description of <hi>London,</hi> endeavouring to paralell it, all he could, with old <hi>Rome,</hi> calls Regions. Every of these Divisions, Hundreds, Wards, Regions, was committed and intrusted, for reigle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to an Alderman, one in office and authority, the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:22730:67"/>
same (I take it) with <hi>Praepositus Hundredi,</hi> or the Hundreds Ealdor, as our Ancestors would phrase it.</p>
            <p>I will spare all discourse touching (what many mens inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation hath made of vulgar knowledge) the word, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, both name, and office, in generall, derived, traduced and descended unto us from great antiquity, and confine my selfe to speake of those onely set over our City Wards. Whose antiquity I conceive to be from about <hi>Rich.</hi> 1. time; the generality of these Aldermen being said to bee of that ages production <note n="b" place="margin">Vide Dn. <hi>Hen. Spelmanni</hi> Glossar. in hac voce.</note> (foure hundred yeares old and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.)</p>
            <p>These Aldermen, every of them, had and kept within their Ward, and haply (as the Jewes held theirs <note n="c" place="margin">Deuter. cap. 21 ver. 19. &amp; cap. 16.</note>) at their severall Gates, a Court holden every three weekes, which was called of our ancestors sometime the Hundred-Court, sometime the Wardmote, that is, the meeting or assembly <note place="margin">Wardmote.</note> of the Hundred or Ward, or the Portmote, as the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was called <hi>Port-soka.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their office, from their name, was called an <hi>Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aldermanrie.</note> which it seemes was not (as now) elective, but as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold either demiseable or deviseable, <hi>ad libitum</hi> of him or her that held the same: or if neither demised, nor devised of him nor her in life time, but indisposed of at death, then as inheritance and fee, descended to the next heire at law; and thence it was that (as I finde) most of the same <hi>Aldermanries</hi> continued in a name and family, through many descents and successions, as that of Burgate to the <hi>Chiches,</hi> of Northgate to the <hi>Polres</hi> or <hi>Pollers,</hi> as we now write it, of Newingate to the <hi>Digges,</hi> of Worthgate to the <hi>Cokyns,</hi> afterward to the <hi>Tiernes,</hi> of Westgate to the <hi>Brownes,</hi> and so of the rest.</p>
            <p>This last of Westgate, was in 10. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. given by the Will <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. Camerae Civitatis.</note> of <hi>Henry Garnate</hi> to <hi>Sara</hi> his wife.

            <p>These Franciscans or Minorite Friers being a great prop to the Papacy were prosecuted by severall Popes with many priviledges, immunities, indulgences and what not graces, that might assure them the Popes fast friends, and faithfull sonnes and servants. Beside their exemption and immunitie from Episcopall and all other ordinary Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; in matter of tithes, they were priviledged from payment of any, either of their house, their orchard (or garden) and the nutriment. i. the herbage or agistment of their Cattell, as in the Decretalls <note n="p" place="margin">Nimis prava. 12. de excessib. praelat.</note>. They had withall in matter of buriall <hi>liberam sepulturam</hi> (paying the fourth part of the obventions to the Parish Church:) whosoever would, might elect and have their Church or Coemitery, for his place of buriall <note n="q" place="margin">Cap. Dudum. de sepult. in Clementin.</note>. And that was a thing whereof multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes were ambitious, and the rather because they were made beleeve, that who so was buried amongst them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ifin the holy and vertuous habit of a Frier, should not onely be secured from evill spirits that would else haply disturb the quiet of his grave, but also be as sure to go to heaven. There is authentick record of many worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages, and of worshipfull families that have been here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred: the Catalogue of whom <hi>Wever</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Of ancient funerall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents. <hi>pag.</hi> 238.</note> hath collected and delivers, but under a wrong title, saying they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the White, whereas he should have said the Gray-Friers: as I can make good to the satisfaction of any that makes a doubt hereof.</p>
            <p>As for benefactors to this Monastery, I finde these. One <hi>William Woodland</hi> of Holy crosse parish <hi>anno</hi> 1450. by his will <note n="s" place="margin">In Regist. Cons.

               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:22730:71"/>
Indeed (to be short) almost every testate dying man of the City and neighbouring parts of any worth, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred these FF. The Dominicans also and the Augustines of this City, in their wills with some legacy more or lesse. One domestick benefactor I meet with, one <hi>Richard Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> the Guardian (I take it) of the house, who in the yeare 1498. by his will <note n="t" place="margin">In Registro memorato.</note> gave liberally both to the Church and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. He was (as it seems by his will) Parson also of <hi>Ickham,</hi> and Vicar of <hi>Lyd</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> But what may he mean by writing himself (as he doth) Bishop of the universall Church? a title so cried down and condemned as Anti-christian by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great; I conceive he was a titular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, a Bishop in name and title onely, endued with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but not with the Jurisdiction Episcopall, having no particular charge to intend, but generally officiating as Bishop in any part of the Christian Church. These titular Bishops were frequent with us in those dayes. About the same time one <hi>Thomas Wells,</hi> the Prior of S. <hi>Gregories</hi> by <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in his will <note n="u" place="margin">In eod.

               </note> writes himself Bishop of <hi>Sidon.</hi> He was a titular Bishop likwise: an order as excepted against by some, so defended by other of the <hi>Trent</hi> Councell; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I leave you to informe your self further (if you please) from <hi>Tholosanus</hi>

            <p>This Monastery had, as the place still hath, a double gate and way to it, the one called <hi>Porta Orientalis,</hi> the other <hi>Porta Borealis;</hi> that in Stourstreet, in All-Saints Parish, this in High-street, in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Parish.</p>
            <p>Let me but acquaint you, that John <hi>Peckham</hi> Archbishop
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:22730:72"/>
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. time, was first a Fryer, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall of this order, and I have done with the Franciscans, or Gray-Fryers.</p>
            <p>Leaving these then, I come next to the other sort of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, <note place="margin">Black-Fryers.</note> the Dominican, Blacke, Preaching FF. Preaching, because they were the onely Preachers of all the Fryers: Blacke, because of their habit <note n="z" place="margin">Polyd Virg. de Invent Rer. lib. 7. cap 4.</note>, which was a blacke cope and cowle over a white cote: Dominican, because S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke</hi> was their founder, a holy man (they say) contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> and whose disciples (the first Fryers of this Covent) were even coaetaneous with the Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scans of this City, coming both hither much about the same time. It is said of them, that King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. at their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming received them kindly (so did <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> also the then Archbishop <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Harpsfield.</hi> Hi. Eccles. Anglic. Saec. 13 cap. 11.</note>:) and placed them at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where (it seemes) he built them this late Monastery, which was the first that the Kingdome had of that kinde. Hence and from this ground I suppose <hi>Wever</hi> takes his warrant for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the erection of this house to <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. The title proper to the governour of the Dominicans, was Prior. Like the Franciscans, they and the Monkes of Christ-Church, in the same yeare with the other (1294) came to composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about divers houses and lands lying within their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct.</p>
            <p>The Churchyard of this Monastery was the place of Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devous designed by the Citizens of <hi>Canterbury</hi> conspiring a revenge to be taken of the Monks of Christ-Church, for refusing them their ayde, and to joyne with them in the finding and furnishing of twelve horsemen imposed on the City by the King <hi>(Ed.</hi> 1.) for his expedition against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious <hi>Lewslyn Fitz-Griffin</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> which <hi>Stow</hi>

twelve horsemen, and send them to <hi>New-Castle,</hi> toward which charge, the Citizens required ayde of the Monks: who answered them that without the assent of the King and their Archbishop they would not agree thereunto, for so much as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had founded their Church in free and perpetuall almes. Whereupon <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Chilham</hi> Bailiffe, and many Commons of the City assembling themselves in the Preaching Fryers Church-yard, conspired and sware against the Monkes as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</q>

            <p>Now to the tenements which haply seem to be so mean as scarce worthy of any notice. True.

            <p>Shortly, there was sometime a family in our City, which from their neighbourhood or other relation to this place, took name from it, and were sirnamed <hi>De Cambio.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:22730:80"/>
An exchange relates to a Mint, or place of mintage and <note place="margin">Mint.</note> coynage of money; but of old, as will appeare by the Stat. <hi>anno primo H. 6. cap.</hi> 4. they might not be together, but were kept apart, and a place there was sometime neighbouring to the Exchange, on the other side of the same street, even there where now the Inne called the Crown or some part of it stands where our Mint was kept. <hi>In angulo monetariae versus East,</hi> is part of the boundary to that which is now the dwelling house of <hi>Isaac Clerk.</hi> The Officers and Ministers retaining to this Mint had their housing hard by it in some tenements of Christ-Church. Whence in their old rentalls is frequent mention <hi>De monetariis in parochia Sanctae Mariae Bredman.</hi> This Mint (I take it) was silenced about the same time with the Exchange, for of latter yeers I finde no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
            <p>From what antiquity it had stood and been kept at this <note place="margin">Antiquity of it</note> place I know not. But amongst the places where King <hi>Iohn</hi> in his letters makes mention of Mints kept in England, this City is one <note n="o" place="margin">Stow. <hi>Survey.</hi> pag. 46.</note>, and had been so (I suppose) for many ages. King <hi>Aethelstane</hi> appointing out the places for Mints, and the number of minters throughout the Kingdome <note n="p" place="margin">
                  <hi>Limbert.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choeonom.</note>, begins with <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to which he allowed seven minters: a greater number then to any other place in the Kingdome, except <hi>London,</hi> which was allowed to have eight. Of these 7, foure were for the King, two for the Archbishop, and the seventh for the Abbat of S. <hi>Augustines.</hi> The Archbishops mint (it seems) is yet elder. For M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Selden</hi> in his notes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Edmerus,</hi> and <hi>Speed</hi> in his History make mention of two severall coynes, one of Archbishop <hi>Plegmund</hi> under <hi>Alfred,</hi> the other of <hi>Celnoth</hi> under <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> extant, and presented in figure, by <hi>Speed</hi> the latter, by <hi>Selden</hi> the former. When or how the Arohbishop lost or left off his mintage here, I do no where finde. Of the time when the Abbats ceased I have showed before out of <hi>Thorne,</hi> in my Survey of S. <hi>Aug.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst other pieces of antique (Romane, Britain, Saxon, Danish and Norman) coyne which I have met with and reserve, some were stamped in this Mint, I take it; in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:22730:81"/>
this City, of certain, the reverse of the coyne saith so; I have withall a piece or two of <hi>H.</hi> 8. coyned at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> not here, but as I conceive at the place now called the Mint by the Court-gate of Christ-Church; where after the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution he coyned money for the service (they say) of his French warres. Ever since which time, the place therefore retains the name of the Mint, and the court or yard which it incloseth is called the Mint-yard. So much for the Mint.</p>
            <p>Retreating a little from this place, on the same side of the street there is a place where sometime the Jews, that, of old, <note place="margin">Jewes in <hi>Cant.</hi>
               </note> for a long time together, were suffered to dwell amongst us in most of our chief Cities, kept their residence; being housed in this street and in the lane by it, from thence to this day called Jury-lane, the same. (I take it) which of old I finde called Little-pet-lane <note n="q" place="margin">Rental, vel. eccles. Cant.</note>. There was of their houses hereaway to the number of almost 20. All which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Synagogue, or (as more frequently called) <hi>Schola Iudaeorum,</hi> their School, upon their generall banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of this and all other parts of the kingdome in <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. daies (at what time their number amounted unto 16511 <note n="r" place="margin">Matt. weslm. de anno 1290.</note>.) as confiscate, escheated to the King: and by him were eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones, some of gift, some otherwise alienated, some to one, some to another, but the most (to the number <hi>viz.</hi> of at least 12. and a void piece of ground which was <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis Iudaeorum Civitatis,</hi> .i. the Jewes in common) to the Monks of Christ-Church <note n="s" place="margin">Lib. eccles.

To which ground the very next house above (the Mitre) is bounded

Domus lapidea quae est contra terram ubi scola Iudaeorum sita est versus Occidentem.</hi> By all which I collect and verily conceive, that the now Stone-Parlour of the Saracens head, mounted upon a Vault and ascended by many Stone-steps (as the Iewish Synagogues and Schooles were alwayes built aloft <note n="t" place="margin">Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron. lib. 2. cap. 2. pag. 80.</note>) is the Remaines of a good part of that which was our <hi>Canterbury</hi> Iewes Schoole or Synagogue.</p>
            <p>I could here very much enlarge my selfe in giving you the Story of the Iewes first advent or entrance into this Land, their time of continuance here, with their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and dealings during that time, and the causes, reasons and motives for their expulsion at last: which were chiefely two; their immoderate usury; and their barbarous practice of crucifying, at places where they abode, any Christians child they could get about Easter time. But I am preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here in by many others that have severally divulged these things already to the full; as <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> and <hi>Stow,</hi> but more exactly and most elaborately and like himselfe, our learned <hi>Selden, Purcases</hi> guide and Author for a purposed discourse of this kinde; wherefore I forbeare, <hi>ne actum agerem:</hi> onely adding what I have seene noted, (but how truely I know not) that the Iewes, when living here, were such notorious Vsurers, that Usury, among the Christians, <note place="margin">Vsury called Iudeisme.</note> became called <hi>Iudaisme.

            <p>Now a word or two of the Gild-hall (or Court-hall, as <note place="margin">Gildhall.</note> we call it) and my survey of this Ward is at an end. Here then, as in the fittest, and most convenient place, being the principall street of the City, is the Court, Tribunall, or place of Judicature of the City seated and kept: where di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributive
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:22730:82"/>
Justice in both, civill and criminall causes, of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular nature, sorting to the cognizance of that Court, is administred. Vulgarly we call the place the <hi>Gildhall.</hi> The etymology and derivation whereof is from the Saxon (or old English) word, <hi>Gild,</hi> signifying a society or corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here is a Court kept every Munday throughout the yeare, for Law-matters, and for the deciding of differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and righting of grievances betweene party and party; and on every other Twesday a Court of Burgmote holden beside, for meeting and treaty about the affaires and good government of the City. It had not the name of the Gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall untill (as it were) of late yeares. That name of it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres not in any record that I could yet meet with, untill the 26. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. who then in his Charter of the change of the Bailiffes into a Maior, makes mention of this Tribunall by that name, granting <hi>(inter alia)</hi> that the Maior shall hold pleas <hi>in le Guildhall Civitatis praedict.</hi> as his words are. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretime <note place="margin">Spech-house.</note> it was commonly called and knowne by the name of the Spech-house; and the common goale or prison of the City, since removed to Westgate, being then kept by it, that is in that part of it which is to the street-ward, was from it adjacency to it, so called also. For proofe both of one and tother read the following notes extracted from certaine witnesses examinations, <hi>Anno</hi> 1414. taken in a cause of defamation, betweene a couple of the City (for calling one the other Thiefe, a crime and calumny where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the defamed of those dayes did usually after purgation, right himselfe in Court Christian) and recorded in a Booke of Depositions remaining in the Office <note n="x" place="margin">Regist.

            <p>The Towne-Court hath not alwayes beene kept at this place: but, as now it is and of long time hath beene here, so both it and the prison were formerly kept together else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and that (I take it) at the place of the now Corne-Market, and were then also called the Spech-house (of which before at large:) Very properly did they stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguously together, if <hi>Tholosanus</hi>

            <head>Northgate Ward.</head>
            <p>THis Ward offers and affords three remarkable places, to our Survey, and they are, 1. The place called Stable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:22730:85"/>
2. the <hi>quondam</hi> house of the Templars. 3. The late house of the black Princes chantery Priests.</p>
            <p>I will begin with Stablegate. A borough or hamlet by the <note place="margin">Stablegate.</note> Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. made to the City excepted from the Franchise of the same, as being a parcell of the vill of West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and of the see and liberty of the Archbishop, to whom of old it hath belonged: it being taken for the very place where <hi>Augustine</hi> the first Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and his company were entertained and seated by King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> before he resigned to him his royall Palace. <hi>Concessit cis (Thornes</hi> words) <hi>locum habitationis in civitate Doroberniae sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuatum, viz. infra parochiam Sancti Aclphegi, ex opposito regiae stratae versus Aquilonem; per murum Palatii Archiepiscopalis in longitudine se extendit, in quo Augustinus cum suis domesticis usque ad conversionem Regis hospitatus est. Fuerat tunc temporis quasi oratorium pro familia Regis ut ibi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whence it took the name of Stablegate, I am as yet igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Some surmise from the staple of wool which ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was kept in the City. <hi>Canterbury</hi> being one of the places where by the stat. 27. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. it was ordained to be kept, and the onely place that two yeares before (25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.) the same King appointed for the keeping of it at, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  </gap>ditionis.</note>. If so, then is there a mistake in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it Stablegate, for Staplegate.</p>
            <p>There was sometime a family in our City, who from their habitation either at or neare this place, were sirnamed <hi>De Stablegate,</hi> and of <hi>Stab.</hi> whereof one <hi>Edmund Stablegate</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Edmund Stable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</note> (the same man I take it that <hi>Lambert</hi> speaks of. Peramb. of <hi>Kent,</hi> in <hi>Bilsington)</hi> in the 42. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. was a Bailiff of the City.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:22730:86"/>
For to a deed or Charter of <hi>Nicholas</hi> at <hi>Crouch,</hi> made to the Hospitall of Eastbridge <hi>(de quieta clamatione juris sui in quodam tenemento cum gardino &amp; pertinen' scituat' in parochia sancti Petri Cant. inter curtilagium de Estbridge versus East, &amp; murum lapideum fratrum minorum Cant. versus West, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen' in longitudine a regia strata versus North usque ad aquam del Stour vers. South 136 pedes, &amp; in latitud. 46 pedes)</hi> this <hi>Edmund,</hi> by the title of one of the Bailiffs of the City is, with others, a witnesse. He had also a seat or habitation in the Suburbs by <hi>Natindon,</hi> limitaneous to the Cities Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chise thereaway, as the perambulation thereof will show.</p>
            <p>I leave Stablegate, and passe to the house of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars. <note place="margin">House of Templars.</note> An order of Knights that began in the yeare 1118. These Knights Templars (saith <hi>Stow</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Survey <hi>pag.</hi> 438. &amp; 439.</note>, speaking out of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Paris,</hi> of the Temple in <hi>London)</hi> took their beginning about the yeare 1118. in manner following. Certain noble Knights bound themselves by vow in the hands of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to serve Christ after the manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Canons, in chastity and obedience, and to renounce their own proper wills for ever: the first of which order were <hi>Hugh Pagan</hi> and <hi>Geffrey</hi> of S. <hi>Audomar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas at the first they had no certain habitation, <hi>Baldwin,</hi> King of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> granted unto them a dwelling place in his Palace by the Temple, and the Canons of the same Temple gave them the street, thereby to build there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their houses of Office; and the Patriarch, the King, the Nobles, and the Prelates, gave unto them certain revenues out of their Lordships.</p>
            <p>Their first profession was for safegard of the Pilgrims, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to visit the Sepulchre, and to keep the high-wayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the lying in wait of theeves &amp;c. About ten yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they had a rule appointed unto them, and a white habit by <hi>Honorius</hi> the second; then Pope; and whereas they had but nine in number, they began to increase greatly. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> time, they bare crosses of red cloth, on their uppermost garments, to be known from others, and in short time because they had their first Mansion hard
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:22730:86"/>
by the temple of our Lord in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they were called Knights of the Temple.</p>
            <p>Many Noblemen in all parts of Christendome, became brethren of this order, and builded for themselves Temples in every City or great Town in England, but this (saith my Author) at <hi>London</hi> was their chief house, which they build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the form of the Temple neare to the Sepulchre of our Lord at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> They had also (saith he) other Temples in <hi>Cambridge, Bristow, Canterbury, Dover, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in <hi>Canterbury Stow</hi> speaks of, was situate in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Parish, in or neare Waterlock-lane (the lane, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, under the Town-wall, and leading by Northgate Church within, down to the river running from Abbots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill.) For I reade <note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Thorne</hi> in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Abbat. Sancti Augustini.</note> of a messuage, which in the yeare 1271 was given to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            <p>Leaving them then, I shall show you next where the black <note place="margin">Princes Priests.</note> Princes Chantery Priests were once housed, and so I shall have done with this Ward. Their house stood, I may say it yet stands (for so I take it, in part it doth) very neare, if not in the place where some part of the Templars habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was situate. But let me first show you that such a house there once was, and that I shall do from the charter or deed of this Princes Chanteries foundation, in which are these words. <hi>Promora siquidem dictorum sacerdotum assignavimus quendam habitationis locum juxta elemosinariam dicti monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii</hi> (meaning Christ-Church) <hi>in quo construetur &amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with concurreth the relation of the Priests themselves (one of them at least) to <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Commissioners, which hath these words ofit. Also the said Prince <hi>Edward</hi> gave to the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>id. Chaplains and to their Successours for ever a house in S. <hi>Alphies</hi> Parish, the yearely value of it is XX<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Next let me observe unto you that over an ancient
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:22730:87"/>
stone-porch opening to the lane leading you from Stable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, Westward, towards the lane turning to Abbats-mill, there are yet undefaced the Black-Princes armes obvious to the eye of any observing passenger. And so by this time (I hope) the place is sufficiently discovered, and my task for this Ward absolved.</p>

            <head>Worthgate Ward.</head>
            <p>COming now to Worthgate ward. The first thing I shall survey there is the <hi>quondam</hi> Hospitall of poore Priests. <note place="margin">Hospitall of Poore Priests.</note> A Spittle first built and founded by <hi>Simon Langton</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon (and brother of <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> Archbishop) of <hi>Canterbury</hi> about the yeare 1240. Not (it seems) altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his own purse, but chiefly by and with the alms and charitie of pious and devout benefactors. <hi>Quod Hospitale idem Archidiaconus diversorum elemosinis dicitur fundasse,</hi> saith <hi>Thorne</hi> relating the foundation of this Spittle. It was (I conceive) intended for a place of succour and relief to poore Priests. i. Chaplaines, Curates, and other like unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficed Clerks, chiefly those (I suppose) that either by age or other infirmity, were disabled for the performance any longer of their holy function abroad in the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were here accommodated with a Chapell (wherein to pray, sing and celebrate for their benefactors, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <note place="margin">Chapell.</note> other divine duties) contiguous to this their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dedicate, as their Hospitall, to the blessed Virgin; whose first fabrick was not, as now, of stone. One <hi>Thomas Wyke</hi> (Master, I take it of the Hospitall) <hi>anno</hi> 1373. new built it of stone, but it is now made and parcelled out into dwellings and work-houses.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the Hospitalls foundation perfected, at <hi>Langton</hi> the founder his instance, the then Abbat and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> granted to it the Parsonage of <hi>Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersh,</hi> of their Patronage.

            <p>I shall not further insist on the particulars of this Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals demaines and revenewes, saving the Iland behinde it, and a forgotten milne sometime both neighbouring and belonging to it, called <hi>Medmilne,</hi> either I take it, because <note place="margin">Medmilne.</note> situate by the Meadowes, <hi>quasi Meadmilne,</hi> or else because standing about mid-way betweene Saint <hi>Mildreds</hi> Mill on the one, and <hi>Eastbridge</hi> on the other side, <hi>quasi Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milne.</hi> Before the Hospitals erection it was the proper Mill of one <hi>Lambinus</hi> or <hi>Lambin,</hi> from either his birth-place or parentage, sirnamed <hi>Flandrensis</hi> or <hi>Fleming,</hi> who dwelt where since and now the Hospitall is seated; and living there, gave to <hi>Eastbridge</hi> Hospitall, beside 14. perches of his land lying in <hi>With,</hi> an annuity of one quarter of wheate out of the said Mill, of which gift I once tooke this note from <hi>Eastbridge</hi> Booke. <hi>Carta Lambini Flandrensis filii Adae de Berghes, Hospitali de una summa frumenti de molendino meo quod vocatur Medmilne, &amp; 14. perticatis terrae meae quae jacet Binnewytt inter ter.

            <p>The Poore Priests afterwards succeeding <hi>Lambine</hi> in his seate, succeeded him (it seemes) in this Mill also. For in the yeare 1325. a controversie arising betweene the two Hospitals about this Mill <note n="i" place="margin">Liber sancti <hi>Lawrentii.</hi>

Now as for the Iland behind this Hospitall, and lying <note place="margin">Iland.</note> betweene it and the Fryers, called by a Saxon word <hi>With,</hi> it was sometime belonging to this Hospitall serving the poore Priests for a garden, but aforetime appertained partly to Christ-Church, and partly to severall private men: whereof one family long agoe, tooke their sirname, and from this their habitation were called the <hi>Withs</hi> or <hi>Binne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withs,</hi> as some of those were (as you have seene before) which inhabited the neighbour <hi>With</hi> or Iland, the late Gray Fryers seate. Part if not all the Iland anciently lay in the Parish of Saint <hi>Margaret.</hi> For the elder Rentals of Christ-Church who had rents here, make mention of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tenents and parcels of ground here, as of and within that Parish. And the private Leiger of this Hospitall so menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the house of one <hi>Solomon</hi> of <hi>Binnewith, Anno</hi> 1239. At <note place="margin">Way to the Iland.</note> or about which time the common and ordinary way or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to this Iland was by the now little and streightned lane leading from the street before the Hospitall (called <hi>Stour-</hi>street) to the common washing place on the North-side of the Hospitall, and from thence over the <hi>Stour</hi> by a Bridge crossing the streame. For the situation of that which is now the dwelling house of <hi>Peter Noble</hi> (then one <hi>Robert de Hotwells)</hi> on the North-side of the Chapell is in an ancient rentall of Christ-Church described thus. <hi>Inter domum quae fuit Lambini Flandrensis &amp; vicum sicut itur ad With. i.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the house sometime of <hi>L.

of all right and title to which house (or challenge thereof) the poore Priests <hi>Anno</hi> 1242. coming to be neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to it (and their neighbour-hood, it seemes, of the jealous Monkes suspected) make a Charter <note n="k" place="margin">Liber eccles. <hi>Cant.</hi>

            <p>The late owners of the Gray-Fryers have exchanged this house (which was theirs) with the City, for that Iland, which now goes with the Fryers, and is parcell of the same.</p>

            <p>Next I am perswaded (and so may easily, I thinke, any one be that well observes the place) that the workes both within and without the present Wall of the City, were not counter-workes one against the other, as the vulgar opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on goes; but were sometimes all one entire plot containing about three Acres of ground; of a triangular forme (the out-worke) with a mount or hill intrenched round within it. And that, when first made and cast up, it lay wholly without the City-wall: and hath been (the hill or mount, and most part also of the out-worke) for the Cities more security, taken and walled in since: that side of the trench encompassing the mount now lying without, and under the wall, fitly meeting with the rest of the City-ditch, after either side of the out-worke was cut thorough to make way for it, at the time of the Cities inditching, as I suppose it cannot seeme unlikely to have beene, to any that shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately marke and examine the place.</p>

                  <hi>Basil,</hi> who had prescribed them in the East-Countrey to certain Monks of his, about the yeare 383. which <hi>Basil</hi> was the first that gave rules or orders unto Monks:) The one of Chastity: the second of Poverty: the last of obedience. To live chastly, to possesse nothing, and to obey their Superiours commands. Again <hi>Benet</hi> gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Monks a new kinde of habit, he appointed them also a certain form of praying, and intending to allow them but mean commons, prescribed them a new rule of abstinence.

               <p>By the way, this congregation of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

They shave their heads, except one little round circle which they call their crown, and perpetually abstain from flesh, unlesse when they are sick &amp;c.

                  <p>Thus I am told; how truely, I make some doubt, both because, though conversant in the Church Records, I never as yet met with any such seale, and for that the seale which was in use not long after the Conquest, namely both in the time of <hi>Anselme</hi> the Archbishop <hi>(Lanfrancs</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate successor) and <hi>Arnulfe</hi> the Prior. 1. about the beginning of the eleventh century, which I have often seene, hath no other inscription at all on it, but this (nor would the proportion of the seale admit of a larger) <hi>Sigillum ecclesiae Christi.</hi> But to goe on.</p>
                  <p>Next after <hi>Lanfranc</hi> succeeded <hi>Anselme,</hi> as in his See, so in his piety.

For when some evill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded persons, maligning the worke, suggested to the King that the Monkes were mad, and prodigally wasted to superfluous uses what might stand him much in stead in his Regall expenses; he answers them thus. <hi>Quid</hi> (saith <note place="margin">

read of yet another combustion of this sacred edifice.

                  <p>The Monkes now at length more neerely affected with the woefull havocke which these frequent fires had made of their Church-fabricke, either occasioned or furthered by some neighbouring edifices, carefully provide to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that cause, and for that end, divers houses belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <hi>Thomas Chillenden</hi> was Prior of the Church at this time. He it seemes (as best able) of the Monkes was most bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to these workes.

               <p>Next observe we the first crosse-iles (wings some call them) of the Church, those (I mean) between the nave and the quire, which by the work, seem of like age with the body, saving that the North-Ile (the goodly and glorious window at the head whereof, a piece in it kinde beyond compare, was the gift of <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. as may be seen upon it) with the lofty Tower or Steeple in the middest or meeting of the Crosier by these capitall letters <hi>T.

               <p>In this North-Ile, between the cloyster-doore and the Lady-chapell is a place inclosed and set apart, called to this day the Martyrdome.

               <p>I passe hence to the Chapell contiguous, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Lady-Chapell, a piece not old; by the work, it should be much what about the age of Dunstan-steeple. <hi>In Anno Dom.</hi> 1452. I finde <note n="r" place="margin">Antiq. Brit. in vita <hi>Stafford.</hi> pag. 289.</note> it called <hi>Nova Capella beatae Mariae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confesse I reade of the Lady-chapell long before. Archbishop <hi>Richard, Beckets</hi> immediate Successor, was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in it. But that Chapell stood within the old body of the Church, and was parcell of it. I have it from the Church records verified by the leaden Inscription and Pontificall reliques, to wit, his Cope, Crosier and Chalice lately found
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:22730:104"/>

                  <hi>Iohn Boys</hi> his monument on the North side of the body, toward the upper end. That old Chappell was not heard of since the present body of the Church was built.</p>
               <p>By the entry or <hi>testudo,</hi> under the greeces or steps (the <hi>pulpitum</hi> as wont to be called) leading up to the Quire, from the body, I proceed and come to S. <hi>Michaels</hi> Chapell, <note place="margin">S. <hi>Michaels</hi> Chapell.</note> standing on the other (the South) side of the Quire. A Chapell indeed in name old. For Archbishop <hi>Langton</hi> in <hi>Hen.</hi> 3 dayes is storied <note n="s" place="margin">Antiq. Prit. in ejus vita pag. 149.</note> to have been there intombed. But the work of the building of the modern Chapell will not bear that age. I am therefore perswaded that the old one was fain to be taken down, whilest the body and crosse Iles of the Church were in building, to give better way to that work, and that that being finished, this was new built as now it is.</p>
               <p>Ascend we now by the steps or <hi>Pulpitum</hi> to the Quire <note place="margin">Quire.</note> (Chancell or Presbytery.) <hi>Ad hunc conscenditur multis gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus,</hi> saith <hi>Erasmus:</hi> which whole work of the Quire, from end to end, I mean, from the Westerne doore thereof un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Archiepiscopall throne or marble Chair behinde the high Altar, with the side-iles, crosse-iles and other build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on both sides the Quire (the Quires curious Westerne doore-case onely excepted, built, I take it, about the time that the body was) together with the under-croft (or vaults) to them (except the Princes Chapell there) are much of an age; there is that harmonious symmetry and agreement betweene the parts. But certainly of what age I cannot define; onely confessing it farre elder then the Nave; I dare constantly and confidently deny it to be elder then the Norman conquest: because of the building of it upon Arches, a forme of Architecture though in use with and among the Romanes long before, yet after their departure not used here in England till the Normans brought it over with them (as I told you) from France. So that (I say) elder then the conquest this piece <note n="t" place="margin">Vide pag. 113.</note> cannot be, and I dare not pronounce it, the roof of it at lest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:22730:104"/>
to be so old, because of the many combustions, beti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the fabrick since the Conquest. But by many induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I am throughly perswaded that it is (for the main) the upper part of that new Church which <hi>Lanfranc</hi> first built, whereof I have treated sufficiently before. And so I have shortly done with the antiquity of this fabrick, the Quire.</p>
               <p>Now a word or two of the Ornaments, and what else in it may worthily call for our speculation. To begin with the <note place="margin">Hangings.</note> Hangings setting forth the whole story both of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours life and death.

                  <p>The certain age of this part neither can I finde, but from great probability do conceive it to be that new work (whereof <hi>Edmerus</hi> speaks) begun and furthered by this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron) Archbishop <hi>Anselme,</hi> but continued and consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Enulph</hi> the Prior with the help of his Monks in <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. time.

The Monks (saith tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition)
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:22730:106"/>
at the the time of the Dissolution were in hand (in honour of <hi>Becket)</hi> to have advanc'd the building to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pitch, but their fall prevented that's rise. So that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before it had a handsome complete battlement, it is now a great blemish to the Church, and an eye-sore to specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, by the ragged and imperfect ruines of it.

Here, as season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, let me remember unto you, that <hi>Gervasius Dorober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis,</hi> the Monke of this place, for his good authority, so often cited of our late Historians, was in his time, dignified with this Office, of the Sacrist here, a part whereof it was to deliver the Crosier to the new made Archbishop, which Ceremony this man very solemnely performed to Archbishop <hi>Hubert</hi>

                  <p>There is a Roome next wall to this, having had a doore leading into it from hence, wherein partly, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the lost over this Vestry, the Church Records are kept.

This Chapell, with the closet to it newer then the Chapell, fell to the then Deanes share upon the division of houses &amp; buildings made anone after the change of the foundation by <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. By what name it was formerly called, is a thing uncertaine, or wherefore built. That Division calls it onely the Chapell next the Dorter. But observing the pictures of Pope <hi>Alex.</hi> 3. and <hi>Lewis</hi> 7. of <hi>France</hi> drawne on the Chapell-walls, the one opposite to the other, towards the East-end: observing also <hi>Beckets</hi> picture (as I take it, conjecturing by the new white glasse put in place of his coate of armes in the upper South-window, as the like was done generally throughout the Church where either this or his name was found:) and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:22730:107"/>
then considering what a Patron, Pope <hi>Alex.</hi> 3. was to <hi>Becket,</hi> what a friend K. <hi>Lewis</hi> 7. was to him in his exile, and lastly what a benefactor, for his sake to the Monkes after his death, and that the Records of the Church have a Charter of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. of xx<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. worth of land to be purchased for the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentation of seven Chaplains that should dayly celebrate in the Chapell of S<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering lastly, that the Priors ancient Gate, or the Gate of the Priory was and is, neare this Chapell, being the same which leadeth from the Green-Court into that which we now call the darke Entry, and so to the doore there now stopped up, the Timber-frame whereof is yet hanging on the things, and anciently lead into the Priors Cellar, as that other hard by it into his Chamber. All these things (I say) observed and considered, I am assured that this was S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Thomas</hi> Chapell, otherwise <hi>Anno 16. Ed.</hi> 2. called <hi>Capella beatae Mariae &amp; beati Thomae martyris juxta portam Prioratus;</hi> our Lady pictured in many of the Windowes sharing (it seemes) with him in the dedication.</p>
                  <p>Over this Chapell is the Church-library, not the same to the repaire whereof Archbishop <hi>Hubert</hi> gave the Church of <note place="margin">Library.</note> 
                     <hi>Halstow,</hi> this being built (as erewhile I told you) by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Chichley,</hi> and borrowed from the Chapell, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to it; the juniority of the worke, and the passage to it plainely intimate so much. It was by the founder and others once well stored with Bookes, but in mans memory shamefully robbed and spoiled of them all, an act much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall and very injurious both to posterity, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of letters. The piety of the present Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hath begun to replenish it, and may it have (what it well deserves) many benefactors, to the perfecting of the faire beginning; with which wish I leave both it and the Chapell.</p>
                  <p>And now I shall desire you would take notice of the Windowes, especially in the Churches upper part, which <note place="margin">Windowes.</note> both for the glasse and Iron-worke thereof are well worthy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:22730:107"/>
your observation. This part of the Church was highly commended of <hi>Malmesbury</hi>

And I beleeve as much may be said of the Iron-worke about them, apparently various in every Window. Besides, these Windowes affoord and offer to our view certaine verses containing a paralell of the old and new Testament. They are many and therefore to avoyde too great an interruption here, you may finde them in my Appendix <hi>Scriptura</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Let me now leade you to the Undercroft. A place fit, <note place="margin">Vndercroft.</note> and haply (as one cause) fitted to keepe in memory the subterraneous Temples of the Primitives, in the times of persecution. The West part, whereof being spatious and lightsome, for many yeares hath beene the Strangers-Church. A congregation for the most part of distressed <note place="margin">French-Church.</note> exiles, growne so great and yet daily multiplying, that the place in short time is likly to prove a hive too little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine such a swarme. So great an alteration is there since the time the first of the tribe came hither, the number of them then consisting of but eighteene families or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, which with the termes or Articles granted them at their humble suite by the then Maior and Communalty of the City, upon their first admittance, will appeare unto you, if you peruse what here followes <note n="h" place="margin">Lib. camerae Civilatis Cant.</note>.</p>

                  <p>But enough of this. Returne wee to our Undercroft.

sent to inquire and examine the state of all Chanteries, &amp;c. upon and according to the Stat. 37. <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 4. which tels that the said Chantery was founded in Christ-Church, in a place called the Undercroft in the yeare of our Lord God 1363. by the aforenamed Prince <hi>Edw.</hi> who with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his Father, King <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. purchased lands <note n="i" place="margin">

                     <hi>Nicholas de Lodington</hi> and their Successors for ever to receive yearely of the said Prior and Convent, forty markes above all charges of reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or otherwise. Also the said Prince <hi>Ed.</hi> gave to the said Chaplaines and to their Successors for ever, a house being in Saint <hi>Alphage</hi> Parish of the yearely value of xx<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. whereof 4<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. is yearely resolute to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Austins:</hi> the reparation whereof to be kept alwayes at the proper cost of the said P. and Co. of Christ-Church. Hence you may perceive the Founder and time of foundation of this Chapell. At or shortly after this relation given up, the Chap. formerly with grates and barres parted off from the rest of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dercroft growing out of use and deserted, was laid open to it, and sithence (I take it) the double way beaten and made through the wall, for a passage, by that Chapell, to the French-Church there. I may not leave this Chapell before I have observed the roofe of it, a piece of newer and more curious worke then the rest of the Vaults about it, and yet the over built Structure as old as any that stands within the neighbour Vaults of elder-fashioned-worke. How this might be thus made, haply some will wonder. But their satisfaction is easie. For the elder Roofe of the Chapell (as it might well bee without indangering the Church) was undoubtedly taken downe, and that the Chapell might in all parts the better correspond and suite with the dignity and degree of the Founder, was rebuilt in that neate quaint manner that now it is.</p>
                  <p>Leaving now this Chapell, come we to the next, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <note place="margin">Lady-Chapell.</note> called the Lady <hi>Vndercroft,</hi> an edifice, since the

In beauty it farre surpasseth that of <hi>Walsingham.</hi> This Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell (as he addes) is not shewed but to Noble men, and especiall friends, &amp;c. The Chapell doubtlesse is ancient.</q> For in the Church-Records I read of <hi>Altare beatae Mariae in Cryptis</hi> almost 400 yeares agoe, to wit in the yeare 1242, and againe in the yeare 1322. At what time the Altars in the Undercroft are recorded to be these: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin. If this word Altar amount not to prove it a Chapell: <hi>Capella</hi> (I am sure) it is called in the foundation of the Lady <hi>Mohunes</hi> Chantery, in the yeare 1397. long before Archbishop <hi>Mortons</hi> dayes, who some say was the founder of it.

time, either to the Church or Monastery, or both: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I perswade my selfe the number was not small, as may probably be argued from that one instance which Master <hi>Cambden</hi> gives of the new building of <hi>Crowland</hi> Abbey in <hi>Lincolnshire;</hi> whither I referre such as desire to know and learne, by what meanes such mighty huge and faire Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious houses and buildings as these were raised in former times. And this shall suffice to have spoken of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Now to make my Survey compleate, I must another while play the <hi>Mystagogus,</hi> and shew you the Monuments, <note place="margin">Monuments.</note> purposely reserving them till now, because being many, and some of them yeelding length of discourse, they would have too much interrupted my Survey of the Fabricke, if I should have intermixt them with it. Here I intend not a recitall of every Monument I meet with, but chiefely of the more ancient ones; those of latter times, being either fresh in memory, or more easily knowne by the Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Epitaphs cut in the grave-stones, then those of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der times, either wanting Inscriptions <hi>ab initio,</hi> or else done in Brasse, which for the most part is either with age defaced, or the Brasse it selfe by wicked hands purloined. And not all of them neither will I set downe in this place, purposing to mention the Archbishops and Priors Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their severall Catalogues.</p>
                  <p>And so I begin with the first (I meane, the lowermost) Monument in the body of the Church. Where is a very <note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Bokin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghams</hi> Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> faire grave-stone with much of the Brasse yet remaining, and having almost all the Inscription or Epitaph still intire, saving (the principall) the interred parties name upon it. It begins thus. <hi>Hic jacet in requie—</hi>and there (the brasse being worne or rather torne away) breakes off. My dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to inquire of the ancient retainers of the Church, whose Monument it was, could have no satisfaction. Yet at length one of them told me that the name was extant since his memory, which he said (as his memory served him) was either <hi>Bobingham</hi> or <hi>Robingham,</hi> or the like. This brought into my minde the name of <hi>Bokingham,</hi> which

                  <p>Here also is the tombe of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. King of England, (gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <note place="margin">

Of them both, as also of <hi>Mary,</hi> the same <hi>Henrie's</hi> first wife, <hi>Wever</hi> hath many things, of him especially, both in verse and prose: amongst the rest his Will. In which <hi>(inter alia)</hi> I note that he willed to have a Chantery to consist of 2 Priests to sing and pray for his soul in this Church, and in such place thereof and manner as should seem good to his Cousin the Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury (Tho. Arundell.)</hi> In all probabilitie the little Chapell on the North-side of his monument is the very Chapell which was built for that purpose: the window-work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by Prior <hi>Goldstones</hi> name in the foot of it, seems to be of his repairing.</p>

                  <p>The Church it self, with her appendent, annexed and connexed buildings thus throughly surveyed, my proposed method sends me to survey next the other ancient build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings within the precinct of it and the Palace &amp;c. I begin with the Palace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monk, and the first Archbishop of this See <note place="margin">Archbishops Palace.</note> and his associats, being kindely received of King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> and admitted into the City; for their present accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were seated (as whilome was told you) first at Stable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, neare unto this Palace, where presently they beganne (saith venerable <hi>Bede</hi> 
                     <note n="y" place="margin">Hist. eccles. lib. 1. c. 26.</note>) <hi>vitam imitari Apostolicam.</hi> By which and other meanes at length converting the King to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, and daily winning upon his favour; the King short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after removing and withdrawing himself and his Court
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:22730:117"/>
to Reculver, and there setling, as his Successors in the Kentish Kingdome whilest it lasted ever after did, (as some report <note n="z" place="margin">Antiq. Brit. in vita <hi>Augustini.</hi>
                     </note>) bestowes upon his beloved <hi>Augustine</hi> (for a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall seate for him and his Successors) his owne Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Palace in the City, conceived to have stood much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. This Palace with the neighbouring Church, <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> afterward converted both into a Cathedrall and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery, yet (as I take it) not dividing his dwelling or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out his habitation apart from the Monkes; but, as he was to them considered as Cathedrall Canons, Bishop, and considered as Claustrall Monkes, Abbat, or in place of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; and <hi>è converso,</hi> they to him considered as Bishop, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Canons and Chapter, and considered as Abbat, a Convent of Claustrall Monkes: So he and they and both their Successors intercommuning, as in goods and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, so in one and the same habitation, of one intire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct ever after untill (I take it) <hi>Lanfrancs</hi> dayes. Who innovating and altering the most of our fashions, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer usages in Church-affaires, and haply not digesting this amongst the rest, thought good (its like) to change it. For no mention of any such Palace or like severall habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Archbishop, is to be found before his time. He indeed, amongst his other structures built him a Court or Palace distinct from the Monkes. <hi>Edificavit &amp; curiam sibi, &amp;c.</hi> saith <hi>Edmerus,</hi> speaking of the same Archbishop <note n="a" place="margin">Hist. Novor. lib. 1. pag. 8.</note>. He it was that first shifted and setled (in that manner that <hi>Doomsdayes</hi> Survey found them) the Mannors and Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons betweene himselfe and the Monkes; setting out to each of them and the Successors of them both their distinct and proper parts <note n="b" place="margin">Lib. ecclesie Cant.</note>: and so no marvell if he discommoned himselfe and his Successors by a Palace, <hi>per se,</hi> from the Monkes ever after. <hi>Lanfranc</hi> then (I am perswaded) first furnished the See with a Palace here. Whereof I thinke little or no part is left to be now surveyed: Neither Hall, Chapell, or other whole piece about it (I exclude the Hall where the Archbishops civill-Court is holden, which I shall shew was but of late laid to the Palace) being to my seeming of that Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:22730:118"/>
And no marvell: for this house (saith <hi>Lambert')</hi> by that <note place="margin">Peramb. <hi>of Kent</hi> in Cant.</note> time <hi>Hubert</hi> the Archbishop had aspired to the See, was decayed, either with age, or flame, or both. Who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (saith he) pulled downe the most part of it, and in place thereof laid the foundation of that great Hall and other the Offices that are now to be seene. But by reason that himselfe wanted time (prevented by death) and some of his followers lacked money to performe the worke, it rested unperfect till the dayes of <hi>Boniface,</hi> who both sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially and beautifully finished the whole; and yet (as some thinke) <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> had accomplished the great Hall thereof before him. Thus <hi>Lambert. Harpesfield</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse for <hi>Langions</hi> building of the Hall. <hi>Egregiam illam</hi> (saith he <note n="d" place="margin">Ecclesiastic. Hist. Saecul 13. Cap. 5 pag. 434.</note>) <hi>Palatii Cantuariensis ille aulam aedificavit.</hi> For the rest, all or most of it is certainly much newer, as the work plainely discovers: whereof the present Gate-house (Iam told) was sometime used for the <hi>Lollards-</hi>Tower or Prison, and so called.</p>
                  <p>Thus my Survey of the Palace would shortly end, but <note place="margin">Great-Hall.</note> that I may not let the Great Hall (a piece of goodly stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) passe without some little digression and enlargement of my discourse touching the same, it being famous for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny solemnities and celebrious assemblies there. Amongst the rest, for that of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. his Wedding feast kept there <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Stow.</hi> Annals in <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.</note>. As also for that great state and solemnity of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Warhams</hi> intertainment both of the Emperour with his Mother, and the King and Queene of <hi>England,</hi> at a supper in the same Hall, and also of his owne entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there at his first coming and inthronization into the See; whereof his Successor (Archbishop <hi>Parker)</hi> and others make mention. And lastly for the intertainment there which the same Archbishop <hi>Parker</hi> gave the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the French Monsieur, the Duke of <hi>Rhetz,</hi> and many of the English Nobility. So much for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the Church-precinct: which how it lyes <note place="margin">Church-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct.</note> and where it goes at this day, is a thing easily traced and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:22730:118"/>
found out, as thus. From the partition Wall betweene the Palace and it, neare the Rush-market to the Church-gate, and so directly upwards almost to Burgate, from thence by the Towne-Wall included to the Chancell-head of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-Church, and from thence by the Almnary (or Mint-yard) Wall (crossing and taking in the way betweene the South-West corner of that Wall, and the opposite Palace Wall) to the Court-Gate, commonly called the Porters-Gate. Thus lyes the moderne precinct of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But time was when it lay otherwise, <hi>Lanfranc</hi> coming to the See; <hi>Omnes Officinas quae infra murum Curiae sunt, cum ipso muro aedificavit</hi> (saith <hi>Edmerus</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Hist.

                     <note n="g" place="margin">Liber ecclesiae. Cant.</note>. The Court and Church you see was sometimes walled in; the Church-yard was the like. For by a Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. the Monkes of the place had a way granted them, or rather restored, <hi>circa murum Cimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terii sui tempore guerrae nuper sublat.</hi> (meaning, I take it, that which happened at the end of King <hi>Stephens</hi> reigne:) which the King chargeth <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Hamon</hi> the then <hi>Praepositi</hi> of the City to deliver them <note n="h" place="margin">Liber ecclesie praedict.</note>. Some remaines of this old Wall yet appeare, as at D<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                     <hi>Causaubons</hi> a little remanent of it, and a larger parcell and of good height by the Covent or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-garden: whereby it appeares that this Wall stood some pretty distance from the Wall of the City. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed ground betweene which double Wall, not being then any parcell either of the Church demesnesse or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, lay partly in Northgate, partly in Burgate-Ward. That (I am sure) betweene Queningate and Burgate, called Queningate Lane, being in the Church-Records, before it came to the Monkes said to lye in <hi>Berthade Burgate,</hi> as I conceive it thence probable, the rest to have lyen in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate-Ward. Besides, within the moderne precinct, and that about the now Co. Garden, lay the best part of Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> Parish, and Queningate Parish betweene that and Queningate, within which Saint <hi>Austins</hi> Abbey, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:22730:119"/>
private men beside sometimes had houses, land and other interest, as they had also lower downe on the South-side of the now Church-yard. I will therefore (as pertinent) shew how in time the Church became possessed of the whole precinct as now it is.</p>
                  <p>And first for the South-side of the Church-yard, I read thus <note n="i" place="margin">Liber ecclesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> Abbey (as you may remember I told you) had sometimes also divers tenents, tenements and ground on the same quarter of the Church-yard, neare and behinde the <hi>Campanile</hi> or <hi>Clocarium</hi> of the Church, the ruined foundation whereof appearing now in the forme of a little Mount lyes inclosed in M<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Archdeacons Garden. These houses and lands in <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. time, and by his helpe, were obtained (upon exchange) of that neighbour Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, by the Monkes of this Church, as by what I have said hereof before, and by the composition made touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, copied in my Appendix, may further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Gervasius de Cornhill,</hi> whom that Composition (as you shall see) makes mention of, had divers tenements of his owne neere this <hi>Campanile,</hi> which the Church also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same time, and for the same reasons purchased of him, his sonne <hi>Reignald</hi> and <hi>Maud</hi> his Wife, exchanging for them certaine ground in Friday-street <hi>London,</hi> which together with the former exchange were confirmed by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:22730:119"/>
Charters of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. to be seene in the Liegers of the Church. It seemes by the premisses that this <hi>Campanile</hi> did terminate both the Church-ground and liberty at this time. But after this double exchange I suppose those houses taken downe, and the ground there laid open unto the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the row of shops along Burgate-street (Shops I call them, for such they were built for, and not for dwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, because, I take it, of fires, which the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of dwelling-houses might occasion to the Church; witnesse those by the Steeple, which we see were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purposely gotten in and had away:) And the same ground being so dishoused and laid open, was made cimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ground, and became part and parcell of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, and so accounted. For the reason which the Prior and Covent render and show to Archbishop <hi>Winchelsey</hi> in <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. time, why they ought not to contribute to the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Saint <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> Church in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in respect of their rents of those shops, was, that the same were <hi>infra limites Cimiterii ecclesiae Christi Cant. &amp; de manso Ecclesiae</hi>

                  <p>Now for the ground betweene Northgate and Quenin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. This parcell came first to the Church in <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. time, and of his gift. For by his Charter extant in the Leigers of the Church, he gives to the Church, <hi>in augmentum elemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinariae suae</hi> (as the words of it are) <hi>placeam illam inter murum Civitatis &amp; murum qui claudit curiam Prioris &amp; monachorum, quae jacet inter Norgate &amp; Queningate.

the Church-Records informe me. And so much also for that parcell of the now precinct.</p>
                  <p>For the rest of it thereabout, namely at and neere Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningate, and betweene it and Burgate, that is the ground knowne of late dayes by the name of the Co. Garden. I have seene <note n="m" place="margin">In Archivis ejusd. eccles.</note> severall deeds, that shew how, by parcells, it became added to and inclosed within the Church-precinct. As first, the Church hath a Composition made by the Monkes of the place with their neighbours of Saint <hi>Austins,</hi> and dated in the yeare 1287. wherein many houses &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Queningate, are (in exchange for other) passed over to the Church. <hi>De terris &amp; tenementis</hi> (so runnes the Deed) <hi>quae dicti Abbas &amp; Conventus habuerunt infra Queningate, viz.</hi> iij<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. viij<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>de duabus domibus Sacristiae suae, &amp;</hi> viij<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>de una vacua placeajacente à vico ibidem usque ad murum ecclesiae Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti praed'.

I finde the two Monasteries come to Composition about certaine other houses and land situate and lying about this place. The preamble of the Indenture thus states the matter. <hi>Quod cum iidem Prior &amp; Conventus certa messuagia &amp; tofta de quibus iidem Abbas &amp; Conventus redditum</hi> xv<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. <hi>particulariter percipere consueverunt continentia in longitudine &amp; latitudine dimidiam acram, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid. rod. &amp; quartam partem unius rod. terrae, &amp; quae de Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lao Horne, Iohanne Calward, Henrico ate Forstall &amp; aliis in Queningate-lane separatim acquisiverunt, &amp; partem inde ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumpniarunt, &amp; residuum eorund. Messuag. &amp; Toftor. in aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentationem gardini ipsorum Prio. &amp; Conv. ibidem includere praetendunt, &amp;c.</hi> Thus you may perceive the Church-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct extending and spreading further and further. And this composition gave scope for it. For after that preamble
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:22730:120"/>
it is yeelded by the Abbat and Covent of Saint <hi>Austins,</hi> what lay in them, that the Prior and Covent of Christ-Church, might at their pleasure inclose those messuages and ground.</p>
                  <p>After this came yet another parcell of the ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts to the Church. For I meete with a Deed or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Ralph Broughton</hi> and <hi>Iohn Tent</hi> Chaplaines, made to the Church 16. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. (amongst other things) of one Messuage in the Parish of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi> neare Quenegate, and of one Acre of Land in the same Parish neare Quenegate-lane: The house holding of the King. in Burgage, and the Land of Saint <hi>Austins</hi> for x<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. rent <hi>per annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this time (I take it) the Church had gotten in all the ground hereabouts, saving what lay betweene Queningate and Burgate, a slip called Queningate-lane. Now for that, <note place="margin">Queningate-lane.</note> I finde that by an Act of Parliament. 1. <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. (by which the Aldermanry of Westgate was granted to the City) the same parcell of ground, together with the Posterne and Bridge, was granted to the Church. But in case of eviction of the Aldermanry from the City, the slip of <note place="margin">Aldermanry of Westgate.</note> ground and premisses was to returne to the City, a part of whose demesnesse it was in Fee-ferme. And surely so it did; for in the 1. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. the same Aldermanry, by a like Act of Parliament was restored to S<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                     <hi>George Brownes</hi> heires, who by the former Act were made incapable of it, for their Father taking part with <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. against <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. But yet at length, after all this, by a composition betweene the Church and the City, made <hi>Anno 7. Hen.</hi> 7. the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ever after quietly seized both of the same ground and Wall, with the Towers, Posterne, and Bridge.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I shewed you (as neere as I thinke it may be found) the extent of the ancient precinct, and how and when it became enlarged to that bignesse that now it beares. And so much of the precinct in generall.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the survey of the particular ancient buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings <note place="margin">Church-Gate.</note> in and about the same, beginning with the Church-gate.

A very goodly, strong and beautifull structure, and of excellent artifice, built in the yeare 1507. as appeares by this now scarcely legible inscription on the Gates-Front. <hi>Hoc opus constructum est Anno Domini Millesimo, Quingentesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo septimo. Thomas Goldstone</hi> the Junior, as I may call him, there being two (and he the latter) of that name, being then Prior, and (as he was famous for his piety that way) this workes great benefactor. A new Gate it is, and not the first (I take it) was builded there, but succeeding a former standing where this doth. For that which is now Alderman <hi>Nicholsons</hi> dwelling house, is anciently. i. 41. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note n="n" place="margin">Charta in lib.

This (I suppose) is that <hi>vetus portacimiterii</hi> the old Records of Christ-Church so often mention, the opposition of it to that which is now Master <hi>Fidges,</hi> and the other contiguous houses to his being Church-houses, serving to bound out and describe their situation in the ancient Rentalls, calling them <hi>Magna do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus contra veterem portaem cimiterii.</hi> I have done with this Gate.</p>

The often-cited Division of houses betweene the Deane and Preb. appointing out Master Archdeacons now Prebends-house, and ground, bounds it out one way to the Schoole-Garden. There are that remember the Free-Schoole kept there, and that by one Master <hi>Twyne</hi> (sometime a Magistrate of the City) as they tell me. For it was a Free-Schoole for the City chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and so called, and sometime was of the liberty thereof,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:22730:121"/>
anciently wayed unto, and having a passage to it from some part of Burgate-street (I take it) leading you to the old doore of entrance which it had now made up at the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end and West-side thereof, haply that which <hi>Anno 32.

Arch. <hi>Theodore,</hi> the seventh after <hi>Augustine,</hi> we read erected at <hi>Canterbury</hi> by licence of <hi>Vitalianus</hi> the Pope, a Schoole or Colledge (a kinde of Academicall foundation it was) wherein he placed professors of all the liberall sciences, which (saith my Author<hi rend="sup">q</hi>) was the very <note place="margin">

                  <p>This we have in hand occurres to me <note n="r" place="margin">Ms. in Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis eccles.

In whose immediate Successors time, there arose a great controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie betweene the Rector of this Schoole, and the Parson of Saint <hi>Martin</hi> (who it seemes by the right and custome of his Church held and kept a kinde of pettite Free-Schoole there) about the rights and liberties of either
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:22730:122"/>
Schoole. The Records of the difference registred in Christ-Church, and faithfully extracted thence will best report the matter with the circumstance, which therefore my Appendix shall make publike, <hi>Scriptura</hi> xj<hi rend="sup">•</hi>.</p>
                  <p>Of this Schoole the Archbishop <hi>sede plena;</hi> and the Church, <hi>sede vacante,</hi> were patrons. The Archbishops right will appeare unto you from those Records. The Churches I gather from this note taken from other like Records. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio magisterii Scholarium grammaticalium Civitatis Cant. per Ricardum Priorem magistro Iohanni Bocton quem investivit per ferulae &amp; virgae traditionem, praestito per eum Iuramento de fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter &amp; diligenter regendo.</hi> This was in the yeare 1374. at what time the See was voyde by Archbishop <hi>Wittlesey's</hi> death. So much for the Schoole.</p>
                  <p>The next thing falling under my Survey are certaine old <note place="margin">Honors.</note> buildings called Honors or the Honors; in the apportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of dwellings amongst the first Deane and Preb. by that name divided and shared betweene the predecessors of Doctor <hi>Ieffery,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Vossius</hi> now Prebends. With Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Cowells</hi> helpe, I understand the terme; but how to apply it, or how it may suite with the present buildings I know not: Unlesse in that the late Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of Christ-church being a Barony, and the Prior there, in right of his dignity, one of the spirituall Barons of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, those buildings (sometime the prime part of his seat) might specially appertain unto him in right of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony, or be annexed to the Honor of the Barony, and thence take the name of Honors. Their name occurres not to me in any Record of the Church before this Division, else haply I could have said more of it, and with more certainty.</p>
                  <p>A step or two further brings me to the ruines of that building which in the Division is called the Fermary-Chapell. <note place="margin">Fermary-Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note>

                     <hi>Iohns</hi> Chapell <hi>Capgrave</hi> speaks of. By their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour I think not. For first, granting for truth, that there sometimes was such a Chapell, and we have barely <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves</hi> testimony for it (somewhat a weak ground to build upon;) yet I cannot imagine that so much as is yet standing of this Chapell could survive and stand out so many Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish inrodes, devastations and other combustions as have betided this place since <hi>Cuthberts</hi> dayes. Besides, <hi>Capgrave</hi> that tells of the beginning and foundation, withall straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way shows the end and overthrow of that Chapell where he sayes. <q>But this Church of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> many ages since, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Christ-Church, and the offices thereof exchanged her substance with fire. Of the repaire or reedifying whereof I never read.</q> Some supposing this and that other part of ancient building that is below it West-ward, to have been one intire structure, and to have had dependance one upon the other, do conceive it to have been the Church of S. <hi>Trinitie</hi> which Archbishop <hi>Lanfranc</hi> built. Indeed the arched or embowed work of it inclines my belief that it was a building erected since the Conquest. But others will have it to be the remaines of the old Church of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Saviour, that was built and standing before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, that haply which <hi>Agelnoth</hi> the Archbishop in King <hi>Knutes</hi> time, after the former was destroyed and burnt by the Danes, reedified. But by their favour, it was neither this, that, nor tother. Truth is, as there is an upper and a lower part of this building, so was each part a distinct stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture by it self, and not one intire piece, the lower<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern part whereof was sometime a Hall, for the pulling down whereof there passed a decree in Chapter <hi>anno</hi> 1545. whence
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:22730:123"/>
in the Division the very next yeare following it is called the late long Hall. And the upper or Eastern part of the building was this very Fermary or Infirmary-Chapell. The same Division calls it so, and that in regard-it did sometime appertain and was appropriate to those of the Infirmary or Infirmitory (the <hi>Nosocomium</hi> I may call it) of the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster situate by it, consisting chiefly of an Hall or Refecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for their common board or table (if able and fit to come to it, otherwise feeding in their chambers) a kitchin to dresse their necessary provision in, a Dormitory or Dortor for their place of sleep and repose, distributed into certain distinct and severall chambers; of which, that one might not disturb another, every of the infirme folk had one proper to himself. And a private Chapell for their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who either were sick and could not, or diseased and might not accompany their brethren in their more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and common devotions in the Temple. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

In all likelihood it was the Western wall of this Chapell, or the wall which terminated the Chapell West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a cleare argument of the disjunction and separation thereof from that other lower part of building.

This Infirmary or <hi>domus Infirmorum</hi> I reade of in our Chronicles in King <hi>Iohns</hi> time. For the Monks of this Church quitting the Monastery by command of the King sorely offended at them, for their choice of <hi>Stephen Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> for their Archbishop; 13 sick Monks which could not remove, were left behinde (saith my Author <note n="v" place="margin">Matt. Paris. pag. 299.</note>) <hi>in domo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmorum.</hi> The same had a bath at or neare the entrance of it, haply the leaden cistern yet remaining, of what use you may gather from the Decrees of <hi>Lanfranc</hi> in <hi>Reyners</hi> book. Archbishops <hi>Winchelsey's</hi> Statutes <note n="x" place="margin">Liber ms. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Cant.</note> also mention it, which have provided many things touching the place. Amongst the rest, that as a place of great secrecy, no secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar should be admitted into it to view or see it. And that the Prior of the Church should, if not twice, yet at least once a week personally visit and view the place, to see that there be nothing wanting to the sick there, nor ought else amisse, or if so, to see it reformed. It had a speciall Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor beside, who was called <hi>Infirmarius.</hi> But let us hence.</p>
                  <p>Of ancient buildings the next unto this is the Dortor, <note place="margin">Dortor.</note> the common Dormitory for the Monks, a very old piece, as any now stands (I beleeve) within the precinct. Here the Monks (according to S. <hi>Benets</hi> rule) slept <hi>vestiti.</hi> i. in their clothes, their regular habit, lying in the woollen, and without either sheet or shirt. Would you know why? Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (I take it) to further them in the way of Mortification of their bodies, and partly for their more readinesse to attend their Nocturnes, that is, their night Devotions, which in imitation of the Primitives, they observed at certain of their Canonicall houres. To prevent disturbance this place <note n="y" place="margin">Ms. memorat.</note> had two Vigils or Watchmen that guarded it every night; the one till midnight, the other till break of day. By Arch-Bishop <hi>Winchelsey's</hi> Statutes, no woman or stranger might by any meanes have accesse thither.</p>
                  <p>Neare unto this Dortor, are the ruines of the Kitchen, Pantry, Larder, and other like rooms or offices built for the common use and service of the Covent in point of food and repast, which was served in to them in their Common

Hall or Refectory built contiguous to the Kitchen (the <note place="margin">Refectory.</note> Remaines whereof show it to have been a very goodly, large and curious piece of structure) opening on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side with a faire doore into the Cloister, before which doore sometimes stood a double cistern, partly (I take it) for the service of the Hall, and partly as a layer used at that Ceremony of washing the hands and feet of the Monks by the chief Prelate or Superintendent by our Saviours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample towards his Disciples, commanded by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Benets</hi> rule at certain times, especially at their Mandy, to be observed <note n="z" place="margin">
                        <hi>Decreta</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franci <hi>&amp; caeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniale</hi> Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictin.</note> This Hall they called the <hi>Fratria,</hi> in old English the <hi>Frater</hi> (so the Division calls it) because it was the common place of resort and meeting for the Fraternitie to their repast served into them from the contiguous Kitchen. Their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fare and food here was fish and fruits, where they were not more commonly and constantly served in, then flesh was rarely or never. Abstinence from which being, as to all sorts of Monks in generall, so to these in particular expressely enjoyned, and strictly imposed, the common Refectory might upon no terms admit of or affoord any. But were any of the family sick, it was to be had for him in the Infirmary. The guests likewise in the <hi>Cella Hospitum</hi> (the guessing chamber I may call it) were not denied it: and besides, the Prior (to whose conscience and discretion in this behalf much was left) if he saw cause to refresh any one or more with the flesh at his own table in his private chamber, he might call unto him thither now and then such as he thought fit. Thus and in these cases and places flesh might be at any time, and was many times eaten. But within the publick Refectory never, and that (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) because of the rules violation in that behalf, which these specialties were so farre from infringing, that like as exceptions do a generall rule, they rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the same in the generality of it. For as in point ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the office or other like agends in the Church, or of rest and repose in the Dortor, by observing the rules (that is, the rites and customes) of the Monasterie in those cases
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:22730:124"/>
in the places proper thereunto, the Church and Dortor; by the generality of the Monks, the rule in those cases was conceived and construed to be kept and fulfilled: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by observing the Monastick rules and customes for food and repast (and particularly this of abstinence from flesh) in the Refectory, the proper place of common refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the whole Convent in generall, the rule in that case was by common intendment kept unviolated. And that it might be so, it was (no doubt) one main end of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising and erecting these common Refectories. For might the Monks have been allowed their particular Cells, and a <hi>Praebenda,</hi> or portion set them out wherewith to finde themselves, and provide them of their own commons, as our Prebendaries now have, it might justly be feared that the rule in this point of abstinence from flesh, would be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not at all, or nothing so well observed, as in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and publick Refectory, where each one saw what his fellow ate. The consideration whereof probably moved <hi>Wlfred</hi> the Archbishop of this Church 800 yeers ago and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards (when by his Codicill he allowed the then Monks of this place their proper Cells, or houses) to provide that the having of them should not excuse nor hinder their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to the Church, for prayers and other like agends there, at their canonicall houres, from the common Refectory for their boord, nor from the common Dormitory for their bed. As you shall finde by the Charter it self (if you peruse it) in my Appendix <hi>Scriptura</hi> 36. The Latine is much to blame, and the sense somewhat imperfect and incoherent, but I thought it not fit, nor my part to vary from it in the least syllable.</p>
                  <p>Of this Hall and the provision for the same and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering thereof, the chief care and oversight was intrusted to the Cellerar one of the foure great <hi>Obedientiarii</hi> (or <note place="margin">Cellerar.

But all this while we are without satisfaction for what use so strong and goodly a foundation as this is standing upon Vaults, and having to it a very gracefull ascent by stone-steps, be set on either side with smal Marble Columnes and other (arched) stone-worke was intended or how used in former time. If I may speake my opinion, I shall tell you (and I thinke rightly) what it was.</p>
                  <p>There was (you must know then) before the Dissolution
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:22730:127"/>
(as by Saint <hi>Benets</hi> Rule there ought to be) Hospitality kept and intertainment affoorded and allowed both at Bed and Boord unto such strangers (Travellers and Pilgrimes espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) as resorting to the Monastery should crave it of the Monkes: and consequently there was a place in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery set apart for that purpose. This place of receipt they called <hi>Aula &amp; Camera Hospitum.</hi> Now I am perswaded the <note place="margin">Aula Hospitum.</note> present building was that <hi>Aula &amp; Camera Hospitum.</hi> I will give you my reasons.</p>
                  <p>First it stood and stands most conveniently for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <note place="margin">1.</note> being by the Court-Gate, remote from the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery which strangers were not to pry into. And Archbishop <hi>Winchelsey</hi> his Statutes <note n="g" place="margin">Lib. Ms. eccles. Cant.</note> making mention of the place, seeme to intimate the standing of it within the Court. <hi>Item aula Hospitum &amp; paralitorium &amp; quaecunque officia ac domus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terioris curiae, &amp;c.</hi> Say the same Stat.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the Cellerar had charge of it. Now the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or Entry betweene the Court-Gate and his Hall did (as <note place="margin">2.</note> it were) make them meete.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly the present building was not onely a Hall, but <note place="margin">3.</note> divided (as appeares by it) into an Hall and a Chamber (or Parlor) so to accommodate the intertained guest with both Bed and Boord, and what doe the same <hi>Winch.</hi> Statutes call it but <hi>Aula Hospitum &amp; Paralitorium?</hi> as you see be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>I must acknowledge to have received some light also in this matter from the following story. A Keeper of Prince <hi>Edwards</hi> Ward-Robe (say the Records of the Church) in the great North-Hall of the Court, in the yeare 1304. kills another man within the precinct, and flyes streight way to the Chamber of the Hall, and though he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Steward of the Church, refuseth to come forth, or to suffer any to enter. Whereupon the Prince being consulted, another Keeper is sent downe, and order given to have the malefactor brought to his triall by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed time. In the interim the Justices in a Sessions holden <hi>ante portam castri Cant.</hi> inquire of the murder and finde it.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:22730:127"/>
Shortly after the malefactor is brought before some Judges <hi>regia placita tenentibus</hi> in the Archbishops Palace, where it being demanded of him how he would or could acquit himself, he answers that being a Clerk, he cannot <hi>sine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinario suorespondere:</hi> whereupon, being first found guilty of the fact by the Jury, he is, as convicted, delivered over to the Ordinary, and sent to the Archbishops Gaole at Maidstone. Thus goes the Story. Now I collect from hence that the Prince himself had been received here, and intertainment affoorded to his wardrobe after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; a use sutable to the condition of the place in hand. By this time (I trow) you see enough to perswade your beleef of this building to have been the <hi>Aula</hi> and <hi>Camera Hospitum.</hi> And now knowing what it was I shall next ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with what I further reade concerning it in the Church-records.</p>
                  <p>The Hall had her p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He was called <hi>Senescallus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae Hospitum.</hi> Here was intertainment to be had of charity, for religious and secular guests, and that (by the Statutes of Archbishop <hi>Winchelsey)</hi> for the space of at least a day and a night: horse and man. On the top or by the foot of the Staire-case of stone vaulted underneath, anciently hung a gate, whereof (it seems) there was a constant keeper, who had his chamber hard at hand. For in the yeare 1382. I finde the Prior and Covent make a donation <hi>Custodiae portae interioris juxta aulam Hospitii servienti &amp; armigero suo, cum camera dicti Custodis &amp;c.</hi> So mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beginning with the Archbishops, let me set before you in the first place, a few things very fit to be premised. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>

                  <item>1. The Antiquity of Archbishops in generall, and the cause of their first Institution.</item>
                  <item>2. The Antiquity of our Archbishops in particular, with the number of Archbishops in <hi>England,</hi> in former time, and at this day.</item>
               </list>
               <p>FOr the first (the Antiquity of Archbishops, &amp;c.) I shall not need take much paines to search it out. For truth is, the Antiquity both of the name and office of an Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop is already so fully laid downe and proved to my hand by the worthily admired Author of the Defence of the answer to the Admonition, and so vindicated and cleered from the aspersion of Antichristianisme (wherewith some late turbulent Innovators have beene pleased falsly to stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:22730:136"/>
them) and by his learned pen, who fetcheth and deriveth them (so venerable is their Antiquity) from before the time of the Gospell publike embracing by any Prince, or in any Kingdome, and (if I mistake him not) the Office, though not the Name, from the Apostolike times; and Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> also, Bishop <hi>Downham,</hi> and many others, as the learned well know, have so laboured in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that if I shall further proceed in the observing of the Antiquity of Archbishops, I shall but, as it were, <hi>actum agere.</hi> And therefore will it suffice that <hi>remissivè,</hi> I referre the reader to these mens Learned Labours, whom I have chosen to cite, because the vulgar, whose onely informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I here intend, can more easily both purchase and peruse them, their workes like themselves speaking English. The learned, I know, can further satisfie themselves in the point from <hi>Bertherius</hi> in his <hi>Pithano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Of the former also, he may see those men answered, who (relishing nothing but a <hi>Presbyterian-Vtopian parity</hi> in the Ministery) under the pretence of zeale for the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as they terme it) of disorders in the Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Archbishops &amp;c. kick and carpe at the same, and upon occasion which un-offered they take of the report of those, who to shew the originall of Archbishops in the Church, say that they succeeded in the places of the <hi>Archi-flamines</hi> (certaine heathen High-Priests, or Arch-Priests, which had the oversight of the manners of the <hi>Flamins,</hi> heathen Priests likewise, as Judges over them: of whom <hi>Duarenus</hi>

Of my</q> fore-cited Authors the Defender of the Answer to the Admonition chiefely takes these men to taske.

               <p>Some learned men (I am not ignorant) there have beene and are, which will by no meanes yeeld, that the Sees of our Bishops and Archbishops were adapted to the number and places of the Flamins and Arch-flamins, arguing very stifly against it, by name Bishop <hi>Godwin</hi> in his Treatise <hi>of the Conversion of Britannie,</hi> preceding his Catalogue of Bishops, <hi>Fol.</hi> 26. and some others.

For were it (think they) a good collection to say that because there is now a Minister of the Gospell placed, where in the Popes time there was a massing Priest: <hi>Ergo</hi> the Ministery of the Gospell is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the example of massing Priests? If they cannot justly say so of Ministers, neither can they of Bishops and Archbishops. For the reason is the same in both. As much to this purpose the said Author of the Defence &amp;c. hath it <hi>Fol.</hi> 321. Agreeable whereunto is that of Bishop <hi>Hall</hi>

Division of Parishes.</note> that about the yeare of our redemption 636. this man first began to divide England into Parishes: that so (saith my Author <note n="d" place="margin">Antiq.

I reade, that <hi>Euaristus</hi> the first Bishop of Rome, who suffered martyrdome under <hi>Trajan</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, about the yeare 110. did the like in Rome.

His arguments you may finde examined and answered by his Animadversioner, to whom for brevity-sake I referre you, and come to the History of the Councell of Trent, the Author whereof delivers his opinion in the generalitie of the point in hand thus. <q>The division of Parishes (saith he <note n="g" place="margin">Lib. 6. pag. 498.</note>) was first made by the people, when a certain number of inhabitants, having received the true faith, built a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for exercise of their Religion, hired a Priest and did constitute a Church, which by the neighbours was called a Parish; and when the number was encreased, if one Church &amp; Priest were not sufficient, those who were most remote did build another. In progresse of time, for good order and concord a custome began to have the Bishops consent also. Thus he. And so I return to our Archbishop</q> who sate almost 20 yeares, and died in the yeare 653.</p>

                     <hi>Cuthbert</hi> was his Successor. This man was the first that obtained Church-yards for this Kingdome. For you must <note place="margin">742.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:22730:140"/>
passengers in minde of their mortality) upon the top or at the feet of mountains. And this kinde of interrement by generall custome was used both of Jewes and Gentiles, as you may finde at large illustrated by <hi>Wever</hi> in his Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Hence was it that <hi>Augustine</hi> the first of our Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops procured the ground, on part whereof he afterward erected his Abbey, lying without the City, for a place of sepulture for the Kings of Kent, himself and all succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Archbishops of that See.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cicero</hi> making mention of this law, gives this reason for it. <hi>Credo</hi> (saith he) <hi>vel propter ignem, vel periculum.</hi> But <note n="l" place="margin">

It was a custome (saith he) in times of old that men and women were buried in their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houses or gardens; but afterwards for the noisome savour and contagious stink of the dead carcasses so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it was inacted that all burialls should be without Towns and Cities, in some convenient place appointed for that purpose. And however that this order was observed by the Gentiles upon this reason onely, <hi>scilicet ut in urbibus mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies servaretur, et aer minus inficeretur, ex cadaverum putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentium foetore;</hi> yet the true Christians, and such as by their lively faith were adopted the children of God, had a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mystery in this their manner of interrments: for by the carriage and buriall of the dead corps without their City-walls, they did publikely confirme and witnesse, that the parties deceased were gone out of this world to be made free denizens of another City, namely Heaven, there to remain with the blessed Saints in eternall happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>This order or custome of buriall without cities continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst the Christians untill the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, for as then the Monks, Friers and Priests (saith my foresaid Author) began to offer sacrifice for the souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. So that for their more ease and greater profit, they procured first that the places of sepulture should be adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto their Churches. Upon this reason out of the said

But persecution being ended, and peace given to the Christian Church, the manner grew in use to bury within Cities, at the entrance into their sacred Temples, yea and afterwards in the very Churches themselves. Now our Archbishop <hi>Cuthbert</hi> happening to be at Rome, and seeing of these bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls, obtained from the Pope a dispensation for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Coemiteries or Churchyards within Townes or Cities throughout England.</p>
                  <p>By this time you may see when the old custome of bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without City-walls ceased, and buryingin Churches and Church-yards both here and elsewhere began, and may guesse at the cause of the frequency of burialls in Churches in former times. A thing thus tartly reproved of <hi>Baldvinus</hi> the Civilian. <hi>Posteatamen</hi> (saith he <note n="o" place="margin">Ad LL. 12.

To the Prior and Monks of his Church, for their better future observance of S. <hi>Benets</hi> rule and order, from which by the remissenesse and neglect of former times, he found in them a deviation, he prescribed in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting certain ordinances, which intituled <hi>Decret' Lanfranci pro ordine sancti Benedicti,</hi> you may finde published in the latter end of <hi>Reyners Apostolatus Benedictionorum.</hi> This Archbishop having fate 19 yeares, and then dying was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at <hi>Cant.</hi> in his own Church. But his monument not now extant; however <hi>Wever</hi> tells he found his body to be interred there by a Table inscribed which hangs upon his Tombe. Erroniously. For there is neither Tombe nor Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his there.</p>

               <p>Let me adde that in the yeare 1075. (if we follow <hi>Harps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> account, which questionlesse is the truer, for <hi>Lanfranc</hi> was not yet Archbishop, when <hi>Parker</hi> saith <hi>Godwyn</hi> died) eleven yeares before <hi>Godwyn's</hi> time, to the <hi>Instrument</hi> or Record of the Councell holden at <hi>London De primatu eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae Cantuar. &amp; regulis ecclesiarum,</hi> next unto the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and BB. is this inscription. <hi>Ego Anschitillus sanctae Dorobernensis ecclesiae Archidiaconus subscripsi.</hi> How is it true then, that <hi>Lanfrank</hi> founded the <hi>Archdeaconry,</hi> and made the first Archdeacon of <hi>Canterb.?</hi> I answer and conceive
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:22730:176"/>
for truth that there was a setled Archdeaconry before <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franks</hi> dayes: but he that was Archdeacon of the Church, was withall Bishop of S. <hi>Martin:</hi> that is, beside that of an Archdeacon, was indued with the title, power and office of a Bishop, or (as I take it rather) of a <hi>Chorepisc.</hi> whereby the might and did <hi>vices gerere Archiepisc.</hi> and supply his absence in many things, wherein a bare Archdeacon, by his office, by law, cannot meddle. Now <hi>Lanfrank</hi> finding the case thus to stand, and well knowing that <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> (both in name and office) were abolished abroad, because of their pride, usurpation, and no very good ground of institution at first, and (as his own reason is) not liking to have two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to one City; <hi>Godwyn</hi> the Incumbent of that dignity dying in his time, (as he was a man that much changed the face ofthings in our Church affairs) he changed the <hi>Chore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall Archdeacon</hi> into a simple <hi>Archd.</hi> that is stript him of his <hi>Chorepiscopall</hi> title and power, restraining the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Archdeacons power within the limits onely of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons office. <hi>Et ita mihi videtur, pace alterius meliùs me sentientis semper salva.</hi> Now to my Catalogue.</p>

               <p>For the first, <hi>Robert:</hi> I reade that of Archdeacon of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terb.</hi> he was made Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> succeeding <hi>Hubert</hi> that was translated thence to <hi>Canterb:</hi> in the yeare 1193.</p>
               <p>The second <hi>Hen. de Castilion</hi> succeeded <hi>Robert,</hi> and was Archdeacon in <hi>Hubert</hi> the Archbishops time: as I finde by divers of his subscriptions to charters and other evidences

of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Radigund's</hi> Abbey by <hi>Dover,</hi> made by <hi>Hubert</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. In the yeare of our Lord 1202. this man being Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, there happened a great controversie between King <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Monks of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustines</hi> touching the right of the patronage of the Church of <hi>Feversham.</hi> They were so <note place="margin">Feversham.</note> stiffe and stout on both sides in the carriage of the businesse, that through the violence that was used by the one to out the other of possession, the Churches prophanation ensued, whereupon this our Archdeacon challenging right to the custodie of the Church during the vacancy thereof, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth himselfe, excommunicates the <hi>Monks</hi> for holding the Church by force, overthrows the altars as thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned, and then interdicts the Church. The <hi>Monks</hi> streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way appeale to the <hi>Pope.</hi> He sends out his commission for the full understanding of the matter: But (saith <hi>Lambert</hi>

                  </note>) the Monks (being now better advised) took a shorter way, and sending presents to the King, they both obtained at his hands restitution of their right, and also wan him to become their good Lord and Patron. Notwithstanding, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon and they proceeded on in suite at <hi>Rome,</hi> about the custodie and fruitss of their vacant Churches: this and <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> especially. In which suite issued out that <hi>Decretal</hi> Epistle of <hi>Innocent 3.

The matter which they strove for, was in those dayes of moment and very considerable, but the case is now altered by Stat. which gives the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour <note n="m" place="margin">

               <p>I come now to the third Archdeacon of this Century, which was <hi>Hen. de Stanford</hi> or <hi>Sandford</hi> (for I finde him writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten either way, and <hi>Harpsfield</hi> writes him <hi>Stafford)</hi> elected afterwards to the Bishoprick of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and consecrate <hi>anno</hi> 1227. Being Archdeacon, he tooke a resignation of <hi>Blean</hi> Church, by the title of <hi>vices gerens Domini Stephani Cantuariensis,</hi> which was Archbishop <hi>Langton.</hi> He was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>executor with the Prior of <hi>Christ-</hi>Church, of the Lady <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>

In favour of whom <hi>(carne &amp; sanguine revelante,</hi> saith a Record in Christ-Church) he much amended the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconry.

               <p>These things happening in <hi>December Anno Domini</hi> 1227.

kept it, as to the propriety of it at least wise, untill the 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and was the same (I take it) which they then exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the Canons of the place for other the like of theirs: in the deed whereof I finde it thus described, <hi>viz.

                  <hi>Stephanus de Vicenna</hi> succeeded <hi>Simon Langton.</hi> So the processe of the suit between his Successor <hi>Richard de Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> and the <hi>Chapter</hi> about title of Jurisdiction in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of the See informs me, which gives a Catalogue of the Archdeacons, and the order of their succession from <hi>Simon Langton</hi> down to that <hi>Richard.</hi> He held the place till his death, which by the computation of that processe was about x. yeares.</p>
               <p>But I am perswaded that one <hi>Stephanus de monte Luelli</hi> ought to have a share with him of that time allotted to him for his incumbency in that dignity, which that process omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this <hi>Stephen</hi> reckons between the former <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Hugh Mortimer.</hi> For in the yeer 1257. in the time of Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Boniface,</hi> I finde in a Lieger of S. <hi>Radigund's</hi> Abbey by Dover the subscription of this <hi>Stephanus de monte Luelli,</hi> by the expresse title of Archdeacon of <hi>Canterb.</hi> as (with others) a witnesse to some Instruments or Charters made to that Abbey by the Archbishop.

It seems he was also Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor or Vicar generall to the Archbishop. For in the yeare 1258. he sends his <hi>Mandatum ad inducendum</hi> to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons Officiall, for the inducting of the Abbat of S. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degund</hi> into the Parsonage of <hi>Alcham,</hi> in this form.

This Archdeacon after a few yeares was made a Cardinall.</p>
                  <p>The sixt, <hi>Thomas Chicheley,</hi> had the Archdeaconry after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conferred upon him by the same Archbishop <hi>Hen.

He was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a Prebendary of <hi>Canterbury</hi> whom Doctor <hi>Moulin,</hi> after many other, doth succeed.

                  <p>His next Successor was <hi>Edmund Freake,</hi> both in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconry, and also in the Bishopricke of <hi>Rochester,</hi> with which latter he held the Archdeaconry in <hi>Commendam,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he was afterward removed to <hi>Norwich,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Worceter.</hi> The fore-cited Catalogue will tell you more of him.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>I Come in the next place, according to my method, to speake of the <hi>parochiall</hi> Churches in and about the City. Give me leave, before I treate of them in severall (as I mean to doe) to premise a few things touching them in generall. It is but of a very few of them, that I know or have found the certaine either time or Author of their foundation. But as I shall shew you that some of them have beene erected since the <hi>Conquest:</hi> so I conceive (and am verily perswaded) none of them (except Saint <hi>Martins)</hi> doe much, if at all, exceed the same in age, and that for many inducements. One that before it our Churches were generally built and made of Wood, and it is a thing noted of the <hi>Normans,</hi> that upon their <hi>Income</hi> they builded their Churches of stone <note n="i" place="margin">Stow. Daniell.</note>. Another is that the Saints whose names some of our Churches doe carry will not beare any much greater age, as Saint <hi>Alphege,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <hi>Edmund</hi> the King and Martyr. A third reason I have, and I take it from a Deed or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Coenulf</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> and <hi>Cuthred</hi> his brother, King of <hi>Kent,</hi> made to the Abbesse and her Nonnes of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge,</hi>

Whence I inferre, that the face and condition of our City hath suffered an utter change since those dayes; and because we read that the <hi>Danes</hi> made havocke both of people and place in King <hi>Etheldreds</hi> dayes, slaying the most part of the one, and burning and spoiling all the other (not sparing the <hi>Cathedrall</hi> it selfe) I thinke we may justly charge upon that all-wasting deluge the utter subversion of such Churches as then were in our City, and consequently may not imagin any of our modern Churches (except as is before excepted) so ancient as to preced, but
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:22730:188"/>
contrariwise to succeed and follow the same. The Deed or Charter, because it may give content to some sort of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and indeed historically glanceth at the misery that our Countrey suffered by the frequent invasion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> as I conceive of it from the end for which this land was given by it to the <hi>Nonnes,</hi> being <hi>(Ad necessitatis refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium)</hi> I here subjoyne.

by it: It being a very common practice with our Ancestors to call their lanes by their names, who were knowne, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent men, and either dwelt in them or at one end of them. Hence (to begin with that) <hi>Canterbury-lane</hi> tooke <note place="margin">Canterbury-lane.</note> name first from a family of <hi>Canterburies</hi> somtime dwelling in or neer the same. The name of a lane hard by it in that Parish which we call <hi>Shepeshunklane,</hi> but should call <hi>Sepesonke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi>

               <p>Now onely a word or two to shew how it came to passe that the Records of the <hi>Consistory</hi> fall so much short of the originall of the Court, as indeed they do, beginning not untill about the yeare 1396. above 100 yeares after the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Commissariship,</hi> and then leaving the <hi>Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> I shall proceed to speak somewhat of the <hi>Deane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cause I cannot impute to the injurie of time consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Records, because Records of greater antiquity are daily seen, and frequently and generally extant. As I cannot impute it to that, so neither will I ascribe it to the sloth or negligence of the Registers in times past, which I cannot, in charitie, presume upon no better warrant then conjecture; although the meannesse of their places and the moveablenesse of the Court in those and latter times would readily help to support that surmise. To these causes (I say) I will not attribute the cause of our Courts disabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to produce the Records of those elder times. Because (after a hint received from some well versed in <hi>Antiquity)</hi> spending some time about perusing our Chronicles which make mention of the rebellious insurrection made by <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and <hi>Iack Straw,</hi> happening in the reigne of <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. and in the yeare of our Lord 1381. by and upon this perusall of the story, I found that they and their complices bare an especiall hatred and spite to Lawyers, insomuch that not onely they wasted and consumed with fire the Lawyers houses then situate neare <hi>Temple-</hi>barre <hi>London;</hi> but also being at, <hi>Canterb.</hi> and having received kinde welcome and intertainment of the Townsmen there (all the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

Preacher. What should kindle in them this fire of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to Lawyers, is easily apprehended if the drift of this their seditious rising be but considered. For like the <hi>Stoicks</hi> of old, whose hearts were set upon a <hi>communitie;</hi> whence that of <hi>Seneca. Homines quietissimè viverent si haec duo Pronomina de medio tollerentur, meum &amp; tuum)</hi> a <hi>parity</hi> and <hi>communitie</hi> was the thing projected, and the effecting of a <hi>plebetan li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie</hi> their aime, whereunto they well knew (as who knows it not) that laws and Lawyers were notorious enemies and obstacles: in as much as <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> cannot stand with <hi>community,</hi> for

               <p>Therefore saith one, speaking of this <hi>Ball,</hi> he perswaded or counselled them to kill and murder (amongst others) all <hi>Lawyers, Iusticers,</hi> and all manner <hi>Iudges, Magistrates</hi> and men in <hi>authoritie &amp;c.</hi> Herewithall, what writings or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords soever they could fasten on where they came (as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other obstacle to their projects thriving, which they were to remove) they concluded to set on fire. Hence was it that at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the rabble of them there, breaking up the chests and forcing the places where the Records of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie were kept, without regard had, or difference made of any writings, whether <hi>Charters, Bulls, Letters patents, Statutes</hi> or other monuments whatsoever, in the Market place, some, other elsewhere they committed to the flame. Now to bring this home to my present purpose, which is to shew what is become of our Records of the <hi>Consistory</hi> of <hi>Canterb.</hi> before those now extant. Having by this Story found how Lawyers and law-records were maliced by these all-wasting rebells, and considering (by comparing of the times) that our <hi>Registry</hi> takes its beginning not till awhile some few yeares after this rebellion, (it not being able pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to gather breath again) and that it was and is the Archbishops Registry whom they maliced even to the death: I cannot but perswade my self, and in mine opinion more then conjecturall it is, that those elder Records and their <hi>Registry</hi> bare a share with the rest of the Records and

                  </gap>, <hi>that is, the Hill where the Army was betrayed.</hi> Hence a man would thinke, (as no question but the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is made by some) that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Lambard</hi> met with that <hi>Saxon</hi> name of the place in some ancient Record or Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Saxons</hi> times. And indeed if he did not, he was to blame thus in a manner, to affirme as much. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily to deny that he did, I will not presume; but shall here propose to the consideration of my Reader such probable presumptions to the contrary; and that the place tooke and gain'd the present name of <hi>Herbaldowne,</hi> from other grounds long since the <hi>Saxons</hi> times, as, I thinke, may give just cause of suspition that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Lambard</hi> never had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for that name from any kinde of <hi>Saxon</hi> antiquity what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. I have collected them chiefly from the ancient <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> and <hi>Evidences</hi> of the <hi>Hospitall</hi> there, whereof Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> in the <hi>Conquerors</hi> time, was the undoubted Founder, which I thinke the best and fittest Judges to try and determine this matter.</p>
               <p>But for entry into this discourse, let me intreate you in the first place, to observe with me, that as this name of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath no ground in Story (no Chronicle of ours that ever I saw recording any such occurrence as the betraying of an Army, either there, or any where else thereabouts:) so M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Lambard</hi> is silent in the instancing or specifying of any such matter for the illustration of the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:22730:217"/>
name. Next if we consult <hi>Edmerus,</hi> who lived a Monk of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. time, and Records the erection of the <hi>Hospitall</hi> there by <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> and the situation of it <note n="*" place="margin">Vide pag. 82.</note>, we shall find him make no mention of the name of <hi>Herbaldowne,</hi> or of any other proper name it then had; not likely to have escap'd his pen, but that also it escap'd his knowledge. Now examine we the <hi>Hospitall Records.</hi> The eldest whereof that I have seene (and I thinke I have not left any unsearched) have no mention at all neither, of that name, untill <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. time.

Cleerely then so old it is: and that it should be much elder, I would be glad that any could shew me as sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory reasons, as, I thinke I can them, that it is not. Not to repeate these already premised; I must acquaint you that the <hi>quondam</hi> extent and continent of <hi>Blen-</hi>wood (or of the <hi>Forest</hi> of <hi>Blen,</hi> as I have seene it called in some old Deeds) <hi>cujus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:22730:217"/>
be inferred that it then extended to the place of the <hi>Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls</hi> situation: and therefore doth the Deed call it (as the best description, and most intelligible and proper for it at that time) <hi>Hospitale de bosco de Blen,</hi> (that is, the <hi>Hospitall of</hi> (or <hi>within) Blen-wood)</hi> without any other proper name. But (to come now to the originall and ground of the name of <hi>Harbaldowne)</hi> not long afterwards, to wit, in the interim of time betweene this Charter, and those afore-mentioned of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. time, I conceive the place, by grubbing or roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the wood there, was disforested, manured; and from Wood-land converted to herbage, or tillage. Aswell the <hi>Hospitals</hi> denomination in that Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. calling it (as I said) <hi>Hospitale de bosco de Blen;</hi> as the <hi>Grant</hi> it selfe, being to give the <hi>Hospitallers</hi> liberty to ridd away 8. perches of wood, on all sides (or round about) the <hi>Hospitall,</hi> plainly inferres that the place was woody then. For you better satisfaction, see here the Charter it selfe recited <hi>verbatim.</hi>

But specially you are to have care of Archers; and that they, who remaine at home, and have vacation from warre, hold Bowes and Arrowes in their houses. For care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse herein hath brought great damage to the Romane State. <hi>So</hi> Leo. <hi>This of old time was the opinion of the Romanes concerning Archers. How we are falne out with them in our dayes (the skill of the Bow, being a quality so commendable, and so proper to our Nation) I know not, unlesse fire-weapons perhaps have put them out of countenance. And surely it may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that the force of fire-weapons of our time doth farre exceed the height of all old inventions for annoying the enemy. And, when I have given them the first place, I will not doubt to give the second to Bowes and Arrowes: being so farre from casting them of, that I would rather follow the wisdome of the Grecians; who albeit they esteemed Arrowes the best flying weapons, yet thought it not amisse to hold in use slinges, and darts. Every weapon hath it property; and that which is fit for one service, is not so fit for another. The fire-weapons have their advantages; They have also their disadvantages. Their advantage is, they pierce all defence of armour, and lighting upon a place of the body, the wound whereof endangereth life, they bring with
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:22730:267"/>
them certaine death. Their disadvantages are, they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes certaine, sometimes for want of charging, sometimes through overcharging, sometimes the Bullet rowling out, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for want of good powder, or of dryed powder, sometimes because of an ill dryed match, not fit to coale, or not well cocked. Besides they are somewhat long in charging, while the</hi> Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier <hi>takes downe his Musket,</hi> uncockes <hi>the match,</hi> blowes, proynes, shuts, casts <hi>of the pan,</hi> castes about <hi>the musket,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens <hi>his charges,</hi> chargeth, drawes out <hi>his skouring sticke,</hi> rammes in <hi>the powder,</hi> drawes out <hi>againe, and</hi> puts up <hi>his skouring sticke,</hi> layes <hi>the musket on the rest,</hi> blowes <hi>of the match,</hi> cockes, <hi>and</hi> tryes <hi>it,</hi> gardes <hi>the pan, and so</hi> makes ready. <hi>All which actions must necessarily be observed, if you will not faile of the true use of a Musket. In raine, snow, fogs, or when the enemy hath gained the winde, they have small use. Adde that but one ranke (that is the first) can give fire upon the enemy at once. For the rest behinde, discharging, shall either wound their owne Companions before, or else shoote at randon, and so nothing endanger the enemy, the force of a musket being onely availeable at point blancke. Contrariwise the disadvantage of Arrowes is in the weaknesse of the stroke, which is not able to enter a Curace, that the foote or horse now use. Yet can no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be found, wherein you may not have good use of Bowes: raine, snow, winde, haile, fogs, hinder little (especially the string of the Bow being not to wet) nay rather profit. Because in them you can hardly discerne, muchlesse avoyde, the fall of the Arrow. As for quicknesse in delivery, the Bow farre excelleth the Musket. A good single Archer is able to give five shot in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for one of the Musketier; and that with such certainty, that you shall not heare of an Archer that misseth the delivery of his Arrow, where the Musketier, often faileth by reason of the accidents and impediments before by me rehearsed. Ioyne that a whole squadron of Archers, being embattailed, may shoote at once together: which onely the first ranke of Musketiers may doe. And make the case there were a hundred Musketiers, and a hundred Bow-men each digested into ten files, each file contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ten men, the Bow-men shall be able to shoote at once a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:22730:267"/>
Arrowes (all their Arrowes) for ten Bullets given by the Musketiers, namely those ten of the first ranke discharging alone. It must not be pretermitted, that the Bow and Quiver both for marching, and all service, are lighter and of lesse labour to use, then a Musket, which is no small advantage in armes and fight. To conclude, the Bow-men may be placed behinde the armed foote, and yet in shooting over the Phalange annoy the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before joyning, and</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Plut. <hi>in</hi> Sylla.</note> 
                  <hi>all the time of fight, even whilst they are at pushe of Pike; where the Musketier, there placed, must either idlely looke on, or else playing with his Musket, most of all endanger his owne friends. Neither is the force of Arrowes so weake, as is imagined, no not in the arming of our dayes. For the Pike albeit he have his head and body covered, yet are his legs, and feete, his armes, and hands open to wounds: any of which parts being wounded brings a disability of service. To say nothing of his face, and eyes, before which the showers of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes falling like a tempest without intermission, must needs breed a remedilesse terror, and make him thinke rather of saving himselfe, then offending his enemy. The Musketier being also unarmed is as subject to the shot of Arrowes, as the Archer is to the shot of the Musket; and the Arrow touching any vitall part, as much taketh away life, as doth the Musket. Lastly a horse-man for his owne person (I must confesse) is safe enough from the danger of Arrowes by reason of his armour; but his horse, being a faire and large marke, and having neither barbe, nor pectorall, nor ought else to hide his head or breast, how can hee escape wounds? Witnesse our fields in</hi> France, <hi>where our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers alwayes beate the French horse, being barbed, and better armed, then our horse are, at this day. And for the bloudy effect of Bowes the story of</hi> Plutarch <hi>is worth the rehearsing. He, in the life of</hi> Crassus <hi>hath thus:</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Plutarch <hi>in</hi> Crasso.</note> The Parthians opposing the Cataphracts against the Romane horse, the other Persians galloping here and there dispersedly, and troubling the face of the field, broke up from the bottome, Hils of Sand, that raised infinite dust, whereby the Romanes lost their sight and voyce: and thronging together, and thrusting one another were wounded, and dyed not a simple, of

And when <hi>Publius Crassus</hi> desired them once more to charge the Cataphracts, they shewed their hands nailed to their Targets, and their feete faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ground, whereby they were unable either to flye, or fight. <hi>These wonders did the Parthian Bowes, which notwithstanding were not to be compared to our ancient English Bowes, either for strength, or farre shooting.

Now then for us to leave the Bow, being a weapon of so great efficacy, so ready, so familiar, and as it were so domesticall to our Nation, to which we were wont to be accustomed from our Cradle, because other Nations take themselves to the Musket, hath not so much as any shew of reason. Other Nations may well forbeare that, they never had. Neither Italian, nor Spaniard, nor French, nor Dutch, have these five hundred yeares, beene accounted Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. It was a skill almost appropriated to our Nation. By it, we gained the battailes of</hi> Cressy, <hi>of</hi> Poitiers, <hi>of</hi> Agincourt, <hi>in</hi> France: <hi>of</hi> Navarre, <hi>in</hi> Spaine: <hi>By it, we made our selves famous over Christendome. And to give it over upon a conceit onely (for no experience can say that our Bow was ever beaten out of the field by the Musket) will prove an imitation of</hi> Aesops <hi>dog, who carrying a piece of flesh in his mouth over a River, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the shaddow in the water, snatched at the shaddow, and left
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:22730:268"/>
the flesh. I speake not this to abase the service of Muskets, which all men must acknowledge to be great; I onely shew, there may be good use of Bowes, if our Archers were such, as they were wont: which is not to be despaired, and will easily come with exercise.</hi>

                  <note n="k" place="margin">Matth. Paris. in Hen. 2.</note>. The Antiquity of this priviledge also shewes it selfe by many of the provinciall <hi>Constitutions,</hi> for example, by <hi>c. Item statui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and <hi>c. si aliqui. de Poenis.</hi> as likewise by <hi>c. contingit de Iudiciis,</hi> all made by <hi>Boniface</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury An. Dom.</hi> 1261. and other the like. And indeed the Antiquity of it is plainely seene in <hi>Beckets</hi> dayes. For albeit the King and his Ministers opposed and resisted it, yet then, if not sooner, it began to take roote here in <hi>England.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:22730:271"/>
by this <hi>Customes</hi> or <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> the Kings purpose was to put it downe, and take it away, yet, in part of his penance for the death of the Archbishop, these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles that originally were the occasion of the murder were by himselfe revoked<note n="l" place="margin">Antiquitat. Britan. in vita <hi>Thomae Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.</hi>
                  </note>. So as it may be said to have prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at that time, as it were, <hi>in contradictorio judicio.</hi> And not onely so but afterward, by degrees, through the meanes of succeeding Archbishops <hi>(Stephen Langton</hi> especially, and <hi>Boniface,</hi> stout Prelates both) backed by the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Canons,</hi> it did take place so farre, as that, not onely after the publication of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> it was ever construed and conceived to be a Church-liberty<note n="m" place="margin">Vide Stat. 4. <hi>H.</hi> 4. c. 3.</note>, but also sithence, beside the participation that it had with the rest of the Church liberties in generall in their allowance by the often iterated confirmation of that <hi>Grand-Charter,</hi> it became at length established by many particular Acts of Parliament, as first of all by that of the 3. <hi>Ed. 1. c.</hi> 2. following within little more then twenty yeares after the making of the great Charter. The next whereunto (from which we may argue the allowance of it) is that of the 4. <hi>Ed. 1. c.</hi> 5. Thirdly it obtained expresse confirmation by the Stat. of <hi>Articuli Cleri. 9. Ed. 2. c. 15. &amp;</hi> 16. But my purpose being onely in this place to shew the <hi>Antiquitie</hi> of this priviledge, and not to make any larger Catalogue of the Acts of Parliament that have <hi>de tempore in tempus</hi> confirmed it to the Church, then may serve to prove the same to have once, and that how long since, beene in it numbers absolute here in this land, therefore enough of this.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the extent of this Priviledge. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I must needs say that the Canon-law (as all know) <note place="margin">Particular 4.</note> affords it onely to Clerkes in orders. Secondly, that, for ought that I can finde, there is not any Statute of this land that <hi>ex professo</hi> hath granted or extended it to laymen, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Stat. 4. <hi>Hen. 7. c.</hi> 13. and some other since imply it. How is it then that heretofore and at this day laymen lay hold of, and have the benefit of this priviledge? Surely,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:22730:271"/>
by Custome, which as <hi>Harpsfield</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Hist. eccles. Angl.</note> writing of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, first set footing here in those dayes. <hi>Quin &amp; hoc</hi> (saith he) <hi>his temporibus in Anglia obtinuit, ut si quis legere potuisset, &amp; si nullo sacro ordini foret initiatus, pari potiretur privilegio.</hi> Now how this Custome come up I freely confesse I am to learne, and one would wonder how lay-men should come to share with Clerkes in their so peculiar priviledge. <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> making mention of it, saith because <hi>Clericis affines</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Histor. Angl. lib. 26.</note>. But in my poore opinion haply thus. Because an evident great favour and benefit redounded to Clergy-men in the enjoying of this priviledge, in that notwithstanding their conviction before the secular Magistrate, they might escape without punishment (at least of death, and losse of member) in case they were able canonically to purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before their Ordinary. And because also by the Canon-law, it belonged to the Church and ecclesiasticall Judge to handle the plea of Clergie, namely whether the offender be indeed (as in word he affirmes himselfe to be) a Clerke<note n="p" place="margin">C. Si Iudex. de senten. excem. lib. 6.</note>. Therefore, in favour of lay-men, who could not but take it much to heart to see Clerkes by this their immunity to escape, they themselves the whilest for want of it, suffering; and no lesse in favour of life; the secular Magistrates admitting and conniving at their plea, or their Ordinaries plea for them, of Clergy, permitted them as Clerkes to have the benefit of Clergy, in case (to colour over the matter) they could but read like a Clerke (the Booke being made as it were <hi>Vmpire</hi> betweene the two Judges:) the Ordinaries in the interim, for the inlargement of their Jurisdiction readily condiscending, and after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice had in processe of time given it the force of a Custome and so of a law, being constrained to make no difference in this point of Clerks and Laics that would pray their Clergy, but to challenge, claime and require them all alike; so farre forth (namely in such cases) as the Statutes of the land have not disallowed nor restrained the same. <hi>Ita mihi videtur, correctione alterius melius me sentien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis semper salva.</hi> And so inclining towards an end of this
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:22730:272"/>
discourse, I desire you to hearken to the last of my five <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The declining and waning of this Priviledge by degrees, and</hi>

                  <hi>restrained condition thereof with us at this day.</hi> To demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate which I will tye my selfe to speake even wholly out of the Statutes and Canons of this our Realme: ordering them so, as that out of them you may see this point histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally lead along from beginning to end. Turning then with me the old saying <hi>Religio peperit divitias, &amp; filia devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravit matrem,</hi> into <hi>Immunitas peperit impunitatem, &amp; filia &amp;c</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Vt partus ille viperinus, de quo Plinius. lib. 10. c. 62.</note>. you shall see this plainly verified in the subsequent story. If you have beene versed in <hi>Beckets</hi> story, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know that this immunity stood then generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of begetting impunity, and instances of it are there given in some Clerkes that escaped punishment altogether, or, if any, suffered but slight paines nothing answerable to the quality of their faults by vertue of this exemption, which thing caused the Kings so eager oppugning thereof. Now no course or provision (that I can finde) was taken for remedying this abuse either by the Church or State after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, untill that <hi>Boniface</hi> aforesaid in the yeare 1261. made and set out a <hi>provincial Constitution</hi>
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Cap. Item Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuimus de poenis. in Provincial.</note> commanding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Bishops in their Diocesses to erect and have one or more Prison or Prisous for the safe keeping of Clergy-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors. Providing withall that if any Clerke be so incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, and accustomed to commit wickednesse, such as for which, if he were a lay-man, he should by the lawes of the land suffer death, that he shall be adjudged to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall imprisonment, &amp;c. This <hi>Constitution,</hi> whether for want of execution, or because it was not penall enough, did not afterwards generally serve turne to keepe Clerkes within compasse, as may be gathered out of the very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Statute <note n="s" place="margin">3. Ed. 1. cap. 2.</note> that makes mention of this priviledge. For there, to the end the King should not need to provide any other remedy therein, he admonisheth and enjoyneth the Prelates, upon the faith which they owe to him, and
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:22730:272"/>
for the common profit and peace of the Realme, that Clerkes convict of fellony delivered over to the Ordinary shall not be delivered without due purgation: which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a remissnesse this way in Ordinaries in former time.

Canon. in Provincial.</note> providing against the too-easie enlargement of criminous Clerkes, and the admission of slight and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der purgations for them, and injoyning a solemnity and wary exactnesse to be used therein, so that no occasion of offence be offered to the King or his Ministers through the non observance of this <hi>Constitution.</hi> Had not both these last mentioned Stat. and Constit. laine neglected without execution, as it should seeme (by the preamble of the Stat. 23. <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 1.) they did, they might haply have beene the last that needed to have beene made of this nature. But because they wrought not that good effect which was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and expected, therefore in the 25. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Stat. <hi>(viz. c.</hi> 4.) is inacted, and (as I gather by it) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occasion, <hi>viz.</hi> Because that Clerkes were suffered, by Ordinaries, upon slight purgations, to be inlarged and dismissed to their incouragement to offend againe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the secular Magistrats debarred them their Clergy, and <hi>sine delectu personarum,</hi> punished them and lay men all alike. Now complaint being made here of in Parliament by the Prelates, this Stat. was agreed upon and made, whereby for redresse of the injury offered to the Church and Church-men, provision is first made for the priviledge of it and them, and then insueth a promise made in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe by the then Archbishop of <hi>Cant. (Simon Islep)</hi> to the King, that he will make a convenient Ordinance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Clericall offenders delivered to the Ordinaries shall be safely kept and duely punished, so that no Clerke shall take courage to offend for default of correction. The perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of which his promise you shall finde recorded and testified by a Successor of his the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Antiquitates
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:22730:273"/>
Britannicae,</hi> in the life of the same <hi>Simon pag.</hi> 244. under the yeare of Grace 1351. As also by <hi>Harpsfield</hi> in his <hi>Eccles. Hist. p.</hi> 532. whose severe Constitution made in that behalfe; if you desire to see, although you will not finde it (I know not why) incorporated into <hi>Lindwoods Provincial,</hi> yet is it extant amongst the Provinciall Constitutions placed and annexed at the latter end of the Legatine Constitutions, in some Bookes (in mine <hi>Fol.</hi> 150.) I must therefore why the Stat. 4. <hi>H. 4. c.</hi> 3. should about 50. yeares after the date of it, call for such a Constitution, as if it had beene yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made, and the old promise of the Archbishop not hitherto performed. For so the Stat. intimates, in so much as the then Archbishop <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> was faine to renew the promise in Parliament, which notwithstanding was neither by himselfe nor by any other succeeding Archbishop per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, as is testified and avouched by the forecited Stat. 23. <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 1. And thus much of the first part of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phthegme. Immunitas peperit impunitatem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great now had the patience of the King and State beene in expecting the reformation of such abuses as grew by reason of this ecclesiasticall priviledge, and a long time had the secular arme forborne to apply a temporall, but more terrible remedie and animadversion. So that now, sith neither the former Constitutions of the Church could keepe the Clergie in awe (as indeed how is it likely they should, the Authors of them not having <hi>gladii potestatem</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Duaren. De sacr. eccles. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. &amp; benef. lib. 1. c. 4.</note>?) neither the ingeminated threats of applying a temporall remedy to curbe their extravagancies, would make them and others, partakers with them in their priviledge, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, it was now high time to clip the wings of this master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse liberty by restraint. For untill the fourth yeare of <hi>H.</hi> 7. we shall finde no Act of Parliament that hath any whit dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated or taken away from this priviledge. But then (which brings on the latter part of the Apophthegme. <hi>Filia devora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit matrem)</hi> because that in confidence and trust of the priviledge of the Church, divers persons had beene the more bold to commit murder, rape, robbery, theft and all
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:22730:273"/>
other mischeivous deeds, because they have beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually admitted to the benefit of the Clergie, as often as they did offend in any of the premisses (as the preamble of the Stat. 4. <hi>H. 7, c.</hi> 13. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unneth) therefore, for avoiding of such boldnesse, it is enacted that the benefit of Clergie shall be but once allowed to any person not being within orders, and that convicted persons (to the end, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it may be knowne whether they have had their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie once before, or not) shall be marked with the letter <hi>M.</hi> for murder, or <hi>F.</hi> for any other fellony, and that to be done openly in the Court, before he be delivered to the Ordinary. Thus for Lay-clerkes. Now for Clerkes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it also provides, that if upon their second asking of their Clergie, they have not their letters of orders, or a certificate from their Ordinary witnessing the same, ready to show, or doe produce the one or the other by a day given them by the Justices to bring them in, then to loose the benefit of their Clergie as he shall doe that is without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>This Act (it should appeare) was not strict enough to bridle the insolencies of some Clergie-men and others that bare themselves upon the priviledge of Clergie. In the 23<hi rend="sup">th</hi> yeare therefore of the next King <hi>(H.</hi> 8.) his reigne, the Parliament having in the preamble of the Stat. 23. <hi>ejusd. H. cap.</hi> 1. enumerated many severall promises iterated and made by the prelates to take course within themselves, and by their owne power and authority without any need of the States, helpe to suppresse the insolencies of such male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, as upon confidence of Clergy dared the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of almost whatsoever foule enormities and outrages, and declared how these promises were frustrate and came to none effect, and withall complained of the many abuses of Ordinaries in and about purgations. For remedy, they inact that Clergy shall be taken quite away from all persons that are not within holy orders, which shall commit petit treason, Wilfull murder, and many the like fellonies. And as for persons in orders, none (saith the Statute) that shall
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:22730:274"/>
be convict of any the fellonies therein mentioned shall be suffered to make purgation before his Ordinary, but shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine and abide in perpetuall prison under the keeping of the Ordinarie, unlesse he become bound with sureties (such as the Stat. there alloweth and accepteth of) for his good abearing, with certaine other clauses and provisoes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which one is for the degrading of Clerkes convict, and sending them to the Kings bench, there to suffer judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to dye, as lay-men. You see this priviledge now brought pretty low, yet it stoopes lower, and now comes to be almost quite eclipsed. For besides many severall Acts of Parliament <note n="x" place="margin">23. H. 8. c. 11. &amp; 25. H. 8. c. 3. &amp; 5.</note> betweene the last spoken of, and the 28. <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 1. taking it away from divers sorts of fellonies. By this Act of 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 1. Clerkes in orders are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same paines and penalties that others be, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but temporall, and made to endure onely unto the last day of the next Parliament, when that time came about, was by the Stat. 32. <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 3. as good and beneficiall for the common wealth made perpetuall. By which lact Act, over and above, in expresse words, it is decreed that Clerkes in orders, in such manner as lay-clerkes are wont to be, shall be burnt in the hand for such fellonies as they may or ought to have their Clergie for.</p>
               <p>This priviledge being brought thus low rose up no more. For after the last mentioned Stat. came that of 1. <hi>Ed. 6. c.</hi> 12. whereas large an enumeration is made what offences shall exclude their Authors of their Clergie, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It suffered yet daily further restraint. For afterwards Statutes upon Statutes, one at the heele, and in the necke of another take it from this and tother offender, as <hi>Rastals Kalender,</hi> in <hi>verbo Clergy</hi> will fully direct, as also will <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards Eirenarcha. pag.</hi> 540. and so forward, to which I referre you.

               <p>And now, to set before you that which principally hath devested and outed the Church of her Jurisdiction over such as were and are to reape benefit by this priviledge, and
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:22730:274"/>
to shew unto you how the ancient course of the law in the point of delivering Clerkes to their Ordinaries to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, came to be altered. I have to acquaint you that the Stat. of 18. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 6. (the causes and motives for making whereof are in the preamble expressed, amongst the rest, to be these, <hi>viz.</hi> the avoyding of sundry perjuries and other abuses in and about the purgation of Clerkes convict deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Ordinaries) hath quite taken away purgation, untill that time ever accustomed, ordaining withall that no man, that shall be allowed his Clergie, shall be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Ordinary, but presently enlarged (after allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Clergy and burning in the hand:) Providing never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse that the Justices, for the Offenders further cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, may retaine him in prison for a time. Thus have you seene how this priviledge hath declined and beene brought downe to the present despicable condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is with us at this day. Remaines so meane, as by them the once flourishing estate of it will hardly gaine beleefe. Truely then
