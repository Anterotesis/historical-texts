         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IN order to the better understanding of
the Nature of this ensuing <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance,</hi>
I judged it fit to premit some
Particulars to the serious Consideration
of the Iudicious Reader.</p>
            <p>1. That over and above the Homologation
of our Assertions in the respective Articles by
Reason, and inartificial Arguments derived
from Authority, and dispersed (like so many
Veins, Nerves and Arteries) thorow that
Complex Body; I thought it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it to Confirm
those great Truths embosomed in these <hi>XIX
Proposals,</hi> by a more evident Method. <hi>First,</hi>
Seeing Divine Authority is both Infallible,
and more Noble than any other; Therefore
we have Superscribed every Article with the
Royal <hi>Placet</hi> of the <hi>King of Kings:</hi> And



<pb facs="tcp:100258:3"/>
that these Sacred Allegations may also serve
as <hi>Rubricks,</hi> or <hi>Titles,</hi> to Indicate the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Contents of the several Articles. Yet we
have not cited the places at large; Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
believing, that whosoever will be at the
pains to read these <hi>Lines,</hi> will think it no
trouble to find out the <hi>Chapter</hi> and <hi>Verse</hi>
in the <hi>Holy Bible,</hi> as they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere pointed
at. <hi>Next,</hi> We have immediately subjoyned
to every Article some Canons of Councels;
being extensively much more to be regarded
than the Authority of any Individual <hi>Father,</hi>
seeing they necessarily presuppose a Complex
of many; (For without a <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> of
divers Ecclesiastical <hi>Seniors</hi> no Councel can
consist.) And intensively too, in the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those who look upon these Canons as
binding to the Church; But in the eyes of
all Rational men, they afford a more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Testimony of the <hi>Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the
Church of God at that time, than any One
particular could do. <hi>In the last place,</hi> We
have annexed some Testimonies of the most
Famous <hi>Luminaries</hi> of the Primitive Church,
whose Doctrine is not found to interfere with
the most approved <hi>Morals</hi> and <hi>Rituals</hi> of
the Catholick Church in the Ages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in



<pb facs="tcp:100258:3"/>
they lived; yet we have very seldome ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them at large, for the Reason above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
            <p>2. Let the Reader take notice, That as the
<hi>Aera</hi> of our Allegations is the Apostolick Age,
(though there was no Provincial Councel Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
therein, far less any General, save
that at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which was obligatory to
the whole Church then in Being; whatever
some Divines imagine to the contrary.) So the
<hi>Terminus ad quem</hi> of the Citation of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
is, The Sixth <hi>General Synod,</hi> called
otherwise <hi>Synodus Quinti-Sexta.</hi> It had
been very easie to amasse a multitude of Canons
posteriour thereunto; yet we judged it neither
necessary, nor fit to proceed further; because
not long after that <hi>Convention,</hi> the <hi>Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storm</hi>
arose; Some adhering to the Councels
which were Assembled by <hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> and
<hi>Constantinus Copronymus,</hi> where the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage-Worship</hi>
was Condemned by the <hi>Ico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noclastae;</hi>
(as they were then termed) and
others cleaving to that of <hi>Constantine</hi> and
<hi>Irene,</hi> at <hi>Nice,</hi> and to some Roman Synods,
where the <hi>Adoration</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by those who were named <hi>Iconolatrae.</hi>
Then the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches began
to be divided, which have never since that



<pb facs="tcp:100258:4"/>
time been thorowly Cemented. As for the
Vltimate <hi>Term</hi> of the Allegation of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi>
We have fixed on <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great
Inclusively, whom I look upon as the Last of
that Venerable Number. Yet we have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
mentioned (though very sparingly) <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi>
of <hi>Sevil, Beda, Anselm,</hi> and St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard;</hi>
The three former, because they are so
often alleged in the <hi>Canon Law;</hi> and the
Last, in regard of the Sublimity of his Style,
(blended with so much Eloquence, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Zeal) in his 4. Books <hi>De Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi>
Ad <hi>Eugenium tertium;</hi> Though I am
not ignorant, that he was at the Distance of
many Centuries from <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>First</hi> at
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>In the third place;</hi> I shall subjoyn a
word or two concerning the <hi>Apostolick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi>
(as they are usually termed) in regard
we have here made some Vse of them. They
were indeed to the number of 185, Received
by the Sixth General Councel; (But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were the same which are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
is not certainly known.) But in respect
that some Ecclesiastical Writers reject them
all, as Apocryphal, and some admit but 60 of
them; Yea, the Plurality but the 50 which
are first in order; Therefore I have laid no



<pb facs="tcp:100258:4"/>
great stress upon them, citing these only which
(either in express terms, or sence at least)
are adopted by some of the most approved Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
or Provincial Councels: But whether
these Canons were Collected by <hi>Clemens</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> we shall not De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
though the last is most probable.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Next;</hi> I shall give a brief account why
the sixth General Councel is termed <hi>Synodus
Quini-sexta;</hi> because under that Notion we
have many times cited it. The ingenuous
Reader shall know, that the fifth General
Councel assembled by <hi>Justinian</hi> the Great, and
the sixth by <hi>Constantinus Pogonatus,</hi> made
no Canons for Discipline, but only some Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Declarations in Matters of Faith;
the Former determining against some Errors
fathered upon <hi>Origen;</hi> (fathered, I say, by
Hereticks upon that Zealous man, whose
Books they Corrupted, if we believe <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and him whose Testimony is more to be
regarded, viz. <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis.</hi>) and
Condemning the Writings of the <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ia Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula,</hi>
v. g. <hi>Theodorus Mopsuest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nus, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi>
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Ibas</hi> of <hi>Edessa,</hi> as
savouring of <hi>Nestorianism:</hi> The other against
the <hi>Monothelites;</hi> and Condemned the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of divers <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>



               <pb facs="tcp:100258:5"/>
One of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and one of <hi>Rome,
viz.</hi> Pope <hi>Honorius;</hi> for the Hereticks
themselves were dead long before that time.
But, that the Church might be regulated, not
only in Matters of Faith, but also in point
of Manners, <hi>Justinian</hi> the second, Son to
<hi>Constantinus Pogonatus (boni Patris, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
pessimus)</hi> Summoned a new Synod for
that effect, who did again meet in <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ullo,</hi>
an apartment of the Imperial Palace. And
in regard the Fathers thereof made 102 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
to supply the defect of the fifth and sixth
General Councels; therefore that Councel was
termed <hi>Synodus Quini-sexta;</hi> so the <hi>Greeks</hi>
(as <hi>Balsamon</hi> observes) call that <hi>Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Synodum Quintam-sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</hi>
And it being re-assembled within few
years to the Former, (four or five at most) so
that the greatest part of the Eastern B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shops
who were present at the Former, were also
present at the Later (as may appear by their
Subscriptions to hoth these Councels;) therefore
the Canons of that Synod usually pass under
the Name and Notion of <hi>the sixth General
Councel.</hi> This we take to be the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Account, which <hi>Tarasius</hi> Patriarch
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Petrus, Bishop</hi> of
<hi>Nicomedia,</hi> gave of it in the Face of the



<pb facs="tcp:100258:5"/>
second Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> as it is termed; <hi>(viz.
Actionem quartam istius Synodi.)</hi> for the
Reasons just now expressed; than what <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophanes,
Anastasius,</hi> &amp; <hi>G. Cedrenus,</hi> averr
That there interceeded no less than 27 years
betwixt the one Synod, assembled by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the other, by the Son.</p>
            <p>5. And that the Candid Reader may lay
the greater stress upon some Canons of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Synods here alleadged by us, he shall
further observe; That there were divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Councels adopted by the <hi>Quini-sexta,</hi>
or <hi>sixth General Councel;</hi> so that we are
to look upon their Canons as is equvalent to
the Constitutions of one OEcumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel:
These are <hi>Concilium Neo-Caesariense,
Gangrense, Antiochenum, Laodicense,
Sardicense,</hi> &amp; <hi>Carthaginense;</hi> as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the second Canon of the sixth <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councel.</hi> And in regard there were
no less than <hi>seven</hi> Councels holden at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
betwixt the first and sixth General
Councels; therefore it is the Opinion of some
Iudicious Antiquaries, That this indefinit Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologation
doth approve, and adopt them all;
five of which, with the four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
make up the Code of the universal Church,
as <hi>Justinian</hi> in his <hi>Novels</hi> phraseth it.</p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:100258:6"/>
6. Seeing the <hi>Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of the Church, are mainly concerned in
(almost all) these Articles, an Ingenious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may happily find fault, that we make so
little Vse of the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> in order to the
Confirmation of these Points. <hi>For Answer;</hi>
though formally we have seldome cited it, yet
upon the matter, we have built upon the
same Foundation, which is the <hi>Base</hi> of the
best and ancientest part of the <hi>Canon Law;</hi>

arose to any worldly Greatness, save only of
Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the first, who was contemporary
with the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and whose
name is very great in all the Churches of Christ.
But though the Text is too extravagant, yet
the Glosse upon it (in the approved Gregorian
Edition) is much more: For, what greater

We might easily adduce many
other falsifications of this nature practis'd by
<hi>Gratian;</hi> but by these Trumperies and strange
Metamorphoses we have instanc'd, (which are
well known, with many more, to those who
have any gust of Antiquity:) the Candid
Reader may, with no less Facility, perceive,
what Arts the Emissaries of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church have improv'd to buoy up a sorlorn
Cause: so that these pretended Sons of the
Antient Fathers make no bones to practise <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>'s
Cruelty in reference to his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so much talked of by the Heathen <hi>Poets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. I am not ignorant, that we have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
observed the exact series of time, in the
allegation of Councels and Fathers: But, seeing
that Method is not very material in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I have pursued that order (for the most
part) in which they crowded into my mind:
Yea, we have made an <hi>Hysteron-proteron</hi>
purposely, as to the time of the Celebration of
some Councels, and Writings of the Fathers,
that, what we judged fit to express at length,
might be either the <hi>Prologue</hi> or <hi>Epiphone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
of the Probation.</p>
            <p>We have also purposely forborn to Cite
the Canons of the Eastern Councels in the
Greek Language; but thought good, <hi>eos ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Latii donare:</hi> because these insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant



<pb facs="tcp:100258:8"/>
Lines may happily fall into the hands
of some ingenuous Gentlemen, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the one Language, and not
the other: the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue being much
more Epidemical in <hi>Scotland,</hi> than the <hi>Greek</hi>
Dialect.</p>
            <p>8. The Author hath also carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Citation of all those Books which
are <hi>Sublectae Fidei,</hi> and rejected as spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
by those who have best skill to judge.
Once indeed, (and I think but once,) <hi>Opus
imperfectum in Mathaeum</hi> is cited; but
so worded, that the Candid Reader may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
perceive, that the Author doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to be the Author
thereof: yet because it contains many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
things in it, he judged it worthy
of a single Citation. Yea, he hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
sollicitous in giving the Child to the right
Parent: For many Books Father'd on
<hi>St. Hierom</hi> (some of them being found in
the Volumes of his Works;) are by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to <hi>Origen,</hi> as the only true Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of them.</p>
            <p>9. There be divers Testimonies of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and of Ecclesiastical, and Secular
History, produc'd in these Articles, without
any Indication of <hi>Paragraph, Chapter,</hi> or



<pb facs="tcp:100258:8"/>
               <hi>Book,</hi> where to find them; But there be two
Reasons of this Omission: first, Because these
Authorites are generally obvious to any who
understand any thing of <hi>Antiquity</hi> or <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;</hi>
So that they who daily carry about
a far greater Library in their Brains, than
is here pointed at, cannot but easily find
them out. The other Reason is once and
again hinted at already; <hi>viz.</hi> lest this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Book swell to a great one. And for
that same End we shall put a Period to this
<hi>Premonition;</hi> reserving Liberty to make
this Protestation; (which I hope all Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Readers will believe.) That I have
shunned as the <hi>Syrenian Rocks,</hi> those four
Wayes whereby the Iudgment of a Writer
may be perverted; (though it were but in
Penning nineteen <hi>Articles</hi> for the good of
the Church:) <hi>viz. Timore, Cupiditate,

It is very observable, what the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Am. Marcellinus</hi> (though a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

               </p>
               <p>I say not, that Fasting is a formal part
of God's Worship; though we read in
Scripture of one that served God, with <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,</hi>
and <hi>Prayer;</hi> But as it is said of the
<hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Languages,</hi> that it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>Learning,</hi> yet a good help thereunto;
so it may be deemed of <hi>Fasting,</hi> that it is
not properly the Worship of God, but a
good Adminicle thereunto; For a grosse
Belly makes not only a gross Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but also a stupid Devotion. I wish, this
were well observed on the Day of the
<hi>Consecration</hi> of <hi>Bishops;</hi> For it is but too
much noticed; that though the ancient
Ceremony, of reading the 13 Chapter of
the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi> be still in Use,
yet the Duty therein recommended, which
is <hi>Fasting,</hi> (not to speak of that Moral



<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100258:14"/>
one of <hi>Prayer</hi>) hath fallen into such
a desuetude, that in lieu thereof, too
sumptuous and excessive Feasting hath
succeeded; so that the Solemnity of
such a Day doth rather resemble the
Pagan <hi>Cerealia, Floralia,</hi> the <hi>Saturnalia,</hi>
and <hi>Bacchanalia,</hi> than the ancient <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae</hi>
of the Christian Church; of which,
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his <hi>Apologetick,</hi> tells us,
That they were so far from supping pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally,
as if they meant to dye to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
(as <hi>Diogenes</hi> said of the People of
<hi>Megara,</hi>) that what cost was laid out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those <hi>Love-Feasts,</hi> was not expended
for Vain-glory, and to nourish <hi>Parasites,</hi>
but upon the account of Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to refresh the Poor: And
that they fed sparingly at them, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
they were to rise at night
to worship God; So that they appeared
not so much to have Feasted at Supper,
as to have fed upon <hi>Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
Sure, it were much more commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
(and fitter too) to vouchsafe these
hundreds of Crowns misimployed that
way, by way of Charitable Largess on the
Poor; that the Consecrated Person may
have many Supplicants at the Throne of



<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100258:14"/>
Grace, to pray for the health of his Soul,
and for the Divine Blessing on the future
Exercise of his Office; that (as <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi>
used to say) by these Hounds he
may hunt after the Kingdom of Heaven.
We find indeed that St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the three
<hi>Asian Gregories, Basil, Chrysostom,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
did prepare themselves for that
most eminent Ecclesiastical Degree, by
various Acts of Mortification, (as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the respective Histories of their
Lives) but none of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Apollo</hi>
the night of their Consecration.</p>
               <p>But, as the <hi>Wise man</hi> hath told us,
<hi>There is a time for all things;</hi> So that even
<hi>Fasting</hi> it self may be sometimes unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable;
not only upon a Physical, but
also upon a Moral account; which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more untimely than upon the <hi>Lord's
Day.</hi> I shall not be so uncharitable to
such Fasters, as is the Author of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> (Fathered on St.
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> though none of his:) who says,
That they <hi>are no better than murderers of
Christ, who fast on that day;</hi> yet one thing
is most certain, That the Antient Church
prohibited Fasting (both privately and
publickly) on the <hi>Lords Day;</hi> (I mean all



<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100258:15"/>
Religious Fasts,) and never permitted
them, no not in the Time of <hi>Lent,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that Day was the most ordinary
and constant <hi>Festival</hi> of the Church; It
being a weekly Solemnity Instituted for
the Resurrection of our Saviour. And
though these detestable Hereticks, the
<hi>Manicheans,</hi> and <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> made it
their Practice, (in Opposition to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church) to Fast on Sunday, yet
even the <hi>Montanists</hi> (who pretended much
to that kind of Mortification) abstained
from fasting on the Lord's Day; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Treatise <hi>De Iejuniis,</hi>
which he wrote after his unhappy Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanizing.</p>
               <p>But this Fasting in our Church on the
Lord's Day, is a part of that old Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Leaven, not yet half well purged
out of this Land; For when that Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Usurpation was culminating in the
<hi>Cuspe</hi> of the tenth House, such was their
<hi>Meridian Line,</hi> that they thought it their
Glory (though it was indeed their Shame)
to run counter to all the Practice of the
Primitive Church; therefore the Pilots
of the <hi>Leman Lake</hi> steered such a Course,
as they might at last become perfect <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes</hi>



                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100258:15"/>
thereunto: For whereas the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church solemnized a joyful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the Nativity of our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Lord,</hi> on the <hi>Anniversary</hi> thereof;
(which in the time of <hi>Dioclesian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a dismal Solemnity to some in <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia</hi>)
and of his Resurrection, every
Lord's Day, especially on <hi>Easter,</hi> which
is <hi>Caput institutionis;</hi> they on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
(as if they had not been unvalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Mercies, but rather great Plagues
to the World:) must needs Fast on
these Dayes; and alwayes on that Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
which did immediately preceed the
Lord's Day on which the Holy <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
was to be celebrated; though the
<hi>Anniversary</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Passion</hi> was
judged by the Ancients the much fitter
season for solemn Humiliation, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
in order to the due Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Commemorative Sacrifice
of Christ's Body and Blood, on <hi>Easter
Day;</hi> (for when Persecution ceased,
by the <hi>Haloyonian</hi>-dayes of the Great
<hi>Constantine,</hi> too much of the Christian
Fervour abated therewith; So that in the
later Centuries of the Primitive Church,



<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100258:16"/>
The Holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> was not received eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, no not every Lord's day, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be celebrated thrice a year;
<hi>viz.</hi> On the <hi>Anniversary</hi> of the <hi>Nativity</hi>
and <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our Blessed Lord, and
of the <hi>Descent</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> on the
day of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> (which Canons did at
last terminate in <hi>Easter Day.</hi>) But these
<hi>Antipodes</hi> are at the Expence of a <hi>Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar,</hi>
only to shun those dayes, as a <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Syrtes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that they might give a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
to the World, that they are not
sworn Enemies to their own Flesh and
Blood, and that it was not the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their own sensual Natures they
designed by such Abstinence; but rather
that they fasted for Strife and Debate, and
to smite with the Fist of Wickedness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such a Religions Palliation; It was
usually observed, that their most solemn
Fasts did usher in the greatest Villanies
they intended to act; so that all honest-hearted
men looked upon these <hi>Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
as prodigious <hi>Meteors</hi> portending
some bad <hi>Omen</hi> either to Church or State,
and too frequently to both. But that



<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100258:16"/>
they might make a sufficient amends to
the animal Life for these few Politick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions,
they gratified the same with
Feasting (when they could come at it)
all the dayes of the Week; though <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
hath told us, that in his time Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
was practised throughout all the
World, every <hi>Wednesday</hi> and <hi>Friday,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the <hi>Anniversary</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi>
did happen upon one of these dayes.
As for <hi>Saturday's</hi> Fast, (though Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
pretended the Apostles Fasted that
Day, because Christ lay in the Grave all
that time;) It did not so early, nor uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
obtain; For it was not practised at
<hi>Millan,</hi> in the Time of S. <hi>Ambrose.</hi> Yea
more than so, they were most willing to
Feast all the time of <hi>Lent;</hi> the Passion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wee
(kwhich was deservedly termed by the
Ancients, <hi>Hebdomada magna &amp; Sancta;</hi> Not,
that it hath (sayes <hi>Chrysostom</hi>) either more
dayes or hours than other Weeks; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is the Week in which truly great
and ineffable good things were purchased
for us:) not being excepted: and were more
ready to gormandize, than on the <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary</hi>
of our Saviours Passion; all the
Sympathy they discovered with his impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd



<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100258:17"/>
Sufferings on that Day, being
meerly Symbolical; and that in a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
sense too. For as the Flesh of our
Blessed Lord was inhumanely torne on
that Day, so they were ready, with too
greedy Appetites, to tear the Flesh of
Brutes: hateing so much to be reputed
<hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> or <hi>Manicheans,</hi> on that
Day; that they would have chosen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be accounted <hi>Canibals:</hi> and ever
since that time, the <hi>Flesh-Market</hi> on that
day is the greatest of all the year; and
though the Change of it to some other
Day, hath been frequently desired by
some sober Persons in this Church, for
the avoiding of Scandal; Yet, such is the
Prevalency of <hi>Fanaticisme</hi> in some Royal
Burghs, that the Bishop with his Clergy
could not obtain that most reasonable
Request: This being one of the <hi>Cimelia

not to bring home with them, <hi>per Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spontum

<hi>Theodosian Code,</hi>) commanded all Suits

Prisoners to be set free, in this Holy



<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100258:17"/>
week. Whence it may appear; these Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivorous
Animals have never seriously
pondered that Typical Expostulation of
our dying Redeemer, which we find in
the <hi>Lamentations</hi> of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> Chap. 1.
ver. 12. (interpreted by all the Ancients,
of Christ himself,) and which concerns
them as much as any.</p>
               <p>But, that they might shew themselves
Prefect in that Art of Opposition to the
Primitive Church, they still presumed to
approach to that <hi>Holy Table, absque Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
Saliva;</hi> though it was also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the Ancient Canons; (and
I wish some of them had rested satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with their Ordinary Repast, in that
great Morning of the <hi>Feast.</hi>) But there
is good reason to fear That the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Plebeian Christians, shall
rise in Judgment, and condemn those
Epicurean Fanaticks; For these will not
(upon any account) usher in that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Incorruptible Food with any
Temporal and perishing Harbinger. Now
if any shall say, That they are afraid of
Fainting; I must confess, <hi>Necessity hath
no Law:</hi> But I wish, some have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
that Necessity by Intemperance;



<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100258:18"/>
                  <hi>For Nature is content with little, and Grace
with less.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have also heard some object, That
Christ himself Condemned Fasting in the
Pharisees. But take St. <hi>Chrysostom's</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to this ignorant Scruple, who tells
us, <hi>That Christ did not simply Condemn the
Pharisees their Fasting twice a Week, or
their exact payment of Tithes; but their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
and Ostentation.</hi> But if we shall
judge by the Practice of too many of
those, we have good reason to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That they have perswaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that Christ Condemned both these
Matters in <hi>Thesi;</hi> and that there is no
necessity of any <hi>Hypothesis</hi> to expound
the Text.</p>
               <p>But in the Last place; Some of the
more knowing of them are ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Authority of <hi>Thorndyke</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy
Taylor,</hi> (both which were very far
from <hi>Phanaticism,</hi>) that they have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

Call, and which is secured to them by

The Erection of Hospitals for infirm

for Contemplative Souls;</hi> yet without any
Bond upon the Conscience, (as it is in
some Convents of <hi>Germany.</hi>) save that,
of serving God more strictly in their
Speculative Retirements. And I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
there should be much more Purity
within the Walls of these Cloysters if the
<hi>Recluses</hi> had not Vows of Continency im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on them; (that of the Poet, <hi>Niti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
in vetitum. &amp;c.</hi> being too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
verified in every Age:) For that <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
Novitius</hi> may last a while beyond the
years of <hi>Probation,</hi> and then degenerate
into a perfect Congelation; which by an
hellish <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> doth frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
an <hi>Vstulation.</hi>) But there be two
great Advantages which a Contemplative
Life affords to some Christians.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100258:21"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is a most secure Sanctuary
to all those, who, in regard of a Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
Nature, are very obnoxious to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience;
The matter about which Our
Patience is exercised ordinarily proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either immediately from God, or
from our Neighbours, or from our selves;
If they come from men (as Injuries either
real or verbal) they are generally more
bitter than those that come from God,
as <hi>Sickness,</hi> &amp;c. though in themselves
greater; because other men are but equal
to us, and we know not their secret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
but are apt to suspect the worst
when they do us any Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m; therefore
we take such things worse at their hands
than we would at God's, who (besides
that He is omnipotent, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Dominion over us,) we know that
his Goodness is infinite; So that we can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
our selves, that all his deali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gs towards
us are meant for our good; though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we cannot see how they can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to it. And as for matters of Affliction,
which through Imprudence, or any other
defect, we bring upon our selves; we are less
moved to Impatience by them; (though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to a secret Shame:) because that (besides



<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100258:21"/>
we are too apt to excuse and favour our
selves,) we are secure that we meant no
harm to our selves. Whence it is evident,
That a <hi>Speculative Life</hi> (being far removed
from the crowd of the World,) is lesse ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to Impatience than an <hi>Active Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>other</hi> great Advantage which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds
to Christians by <hi>Comtemplation</hi> is,
That Vertues are more easily obtained,
more securely possessed, and more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practised, than in an Active Life. Let
us suppose a Person to aspire unto Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in this, yet he stands in need of many
things to enable him for the Practice of the
Duties disposing thereunto: For the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of the external Works of Charity, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
are needful <hi>Riches</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> &amp;c. And
for Spiritual Alms-giving there is required
<hi>Learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Study, Disputation,</hi> &amp;c. And if by
the help of these there be acquired an esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
habit of solid Charity, it is not very
securely possessed in the midst of so many
Distractions, Solitudes, and Temptations:
But a comtemplative Life (as the <hi>Angelical
Doctor</hi> observes, even from <hi>Aristotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
vid. <hi>Thom. Summ. secunda secundae.
quaes. 182. Art.</hi> 1.) stands in need of very
few things; being to it self sufficient.



<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100258:22"/>
Such a Person alone, without needing
other Assistance, or Favour from abroad,
can both purchase and exercise all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
yea and liberally Dispense all kinds
of Charity to others also; for by Prayer
alone, exercised in Solitude, he can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
and engage God's Omnipotence,
Wisdom, and all the Treasures of his
Riches, for the supplying all the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
External and Internal, of his Church.
Yea the greater Solitude there is, the
Soul is at the more Freedom to run spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
and lightly to the Course of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
For nothing doth indeed fetter her
but Self-love and Propriety. And when
the Habits of Vertue are once acquired,
they are most securely possessed in Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
from whence all Distractions (and
almost all Temptations) are excluded.</p>
               <p>There is yet another Advantage to
which the Poverty of this Countrey
would frequently exhibit the Occasion;
which is, That these would be excellent
<hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Refuge</hi> for some Persons of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Descent, (specially of the Female
Sex,) whose prodigal Parents have wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all their Patrimonies; so that they
(finding too good reason to despair of a



<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100258:22"/>
Match according to their Quality:) live
exposed to the Contempt of the World,
even to their dying day: For though
some of them are so happy, as to twist
Nobility and Vertue together, yet that
<hi>Conjunction</hi> not being irradiated with the
splendid Aspect of <hi>Plutus,</hi> they become
despicable in Vulgar eyes, which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dazled with the Glistering of Gold and
Silver. So that I heartily approve the
Judgement of the Author of <hi>Claustrum
Animae;</hi> Necessary Reformations (saith
he) might have repurged Monasteries,
as well as the Church, without abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them: and they might have been
still Houses of Religion, without having
any dependance upon <hi>Rome.</hi> I have insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the longer upon this Theam, (though
it may be termed a <hi>Digression;</hi>) because I
judged my self concerned to vindicate
that most excellent kind of Life from the
Imputation of <hi>Vselesness,</hi> as if they were
all
<q>
                     <l>Ignavum pecus fruges consumere nati. Et,</l>
                     <l>—Telluris inutile pondus.</l>
                  </q>



                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100258:23"/>
Sure I am, If the Practice of the Devout
<hi>Asceticks</hi> of <hi>Nitria,</hi> and of the Primitive
<hi>Monks</hi> in general, (whereof S. <hi>Hierom,
Augustine, Palladius, Cassian,</hi> and others,
give us an account:) were retrived
into our Church, Judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> would
not have been so uncharitable, as to say
of them all, that
<q>—Velut porci saginantur in haris.</q>
For if the Abuse of a thing should always
take away the lawful Use thereof, the most
laudable Institutions of the World would
fall to the ground; For what therein hath
not been abused? But to take off the
groundless <hi>Odium</hi> of the name, let these
Habitations be also termed <hi>Hospitals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But above all; Let the Governours of
the Church make Conscience to educate
Towardly Youths, (whether Descended
of the Clergy or Laity,) whose Parents are
not <hi>in bonis</hi> to entertain them at Schools;
yet are well principled, and derived from
honest Families: That (having a liberal
and holy Education in the Bishop's Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and their Conversation being alwayes
in his eye,) they may prove excellent
Materials at last, to build the House of God;



<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100258:23"/>
when, being found good Proficients in
Knowledge, and in the School of <hi>Holy Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;</hi>
they may be called forth to that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Function</hi> in God's good time; It being
the practice of <hi>St. Augustine</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the Primitive Church, to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
such <hi>Seminaries</hi> about them. And
these (even in this Age) would be look'd
upon as the <hi>Succedanei</hi> of the ancient <hi>Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luthi,</hi>
who were the <hi>individui Comites</hi> of the
Primitive Bishops; and being constant
Witnesses unto their holy Conversation,
were thereby framed (through the Divine
Grace) to the exact imitation of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Pattern. This Method would be
found, not only a Charitable Office, but
also an act of great Prudence and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Policy, in reference to all; but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Ministers of the Gospel. And
would to God all Church-men were taken
up with the Study of such Laudable Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and <hi>Piae fraudes,</hi> as the Apostle phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them: For it could not but perswade
them who have any Principles of Generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
within them, to a Cordial Complyance
with the Government, when they perceive
it their great Care to do good to them and
theirs. Yea, more than so; It would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite



<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100258:24"/>
a commendable Emulation amongst
the Clergy of the same Diocese, which
of them should appear most Deserving in
the eyes of their <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and that in
order to a Preference as to the <hi>Foris-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi>
of their Sons; when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
That over and above the Poverty
of their Estates, and Riches of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
these Presbyters are most Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced,
and Their Sons regarded by their
Bishop in the first place, who are Persons
of a pious and prudent Conversation, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in their Studies, and Faithful in
the Discharge of all the Duties of their
Holy Vocation.</p>
               <p>I might add to the former Instances
of Charity, <hi>The Redemption</hi> of <hi>Christian
Captives;</hi> (For which merciful Acts <hi>Acati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
Ambrose, Paulinus,</hi> and many other
Primitive Bishops, are highly applauded:)
As also, <hi>Bequeathing the Holy Bible, and
other Books of Devotion,</hi> gratis, <hi>to poor
Christians;</hi> (the Soul being the principal
Object of Charity to our Neighbour:)
For which the Martyr <hi>Pamphilus</hi> is Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
by <hi>Eusebius</hi> and <hi>Hierom.</hi> And in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine; The <hi>furnishing</hi> of some resolute <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists</hi>
with a <hi>Viaticum,</hi> to propagate



<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100258:24"/>
the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> among <hi>Infidels;</hi> which
was one of the <hi>Elogiums</hi> of St. <hi>Chrysostom:</hi>
(For which Act of Universal Charity
<hi>Demetrius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was, long before
him, highly applauded; for sending the
Learned <hi>Pantaenus</hi> to preach the Blessed
Gospel unto the remotest <hi>Indians.</hi>) And
that the Roman <hi>Propaganda</hi> may not
rise up in the Great <hi>Audit,</hi> against the
Governours of the Reformed Church,
they should be no less solicitous for it.</p>
               <p>We need not multiplie any more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
For if the half of these Instances
of Charity be practised to purpose, there
will be few Materials reserved for the
gaudy Busks of Wives, the Prodigality
of Sons, the Vanity of Daughters, and
Debauchery of their Retinue: For the
<hi>Treasure of the Church</hi> (thus S. <hi>Lawrence</hi>
termed the Poor, and not <hi>Works of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation:</hi>)
would exhaust all those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits
of Luxury, and nothing would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
to be bestowed on costly Furniture,
rich Hangings, curious Coaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
For the Primitive Bishops used not
Coaches, neither had they any Swords
to draw upon their Coach-men. (not to
speak of their expending more on their



<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100258:25"/>
Horses yearly, than some poor Ministers
have to maintain their Families: the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Possession of which (as <hi>Clemens Alex.</hi>
hath well observed,) creates Envy, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
to the Clergy, whose Ornaments
ought to be of a more Spiritual <hi>Make</hi> and
<hi>Temper.</hi> Neither would they have any
Temptation to re-act that <hi>Tragedy</hi> of the
<hi>Ewe-Lamb</hi> in <hi>Nathan's</hi> Parable, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to abridge any poor Minister's <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend;</hi>
far less to substract that inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Pittance destinated for the Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Communion-Elements:</hi> Least of all
would they find in their hearts, to give
Money to an Advocate, to obstruct the
Reputation of a Church; if ten Merks
Scots be all the Summ which is expected
from a hard-hearted Patron, to uphold
a decayed Fabrick. Yea, suppose they
had a legal Title to part of that <hi>Salary,</hi>
yet they would dispence with it as a part
of their Charity unto those who may be
said <hi>sedere super Chaenicem,</hi> in regard of
the smalness of their <hi>Intrado,</hi> and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Families: and None should
have occasion to upbraid that <hi>Order,</hi>
That no publick charitable Works have
been done by any of them; Such as, the



<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100258:25"/>
Such as, The Building and Repairing of
Bridges on High-wayes; (though some
of those already half demolished, are
within the Prospect of their Ordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidences,
and daily invite them to put
to their helping hand.) Neither would
any who Travel by their Parish-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
find any ground to admire that piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Spectacle, <hi>Of Bells hanging upon Trees,</hi>
for want of <hi>Bell-houses,</hi> as if they owned
that part of <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Doctrine, which
Condemns Bells in Steeples; or did joyn
Issue with the Invectives of the <hi>Quakers</hi>
against <hi>Steeple-houses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And till Reason and Religion can sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
no other Imployment for that parcel
of the Churches Patrimony in their hands;
Let them not be sollicitous to make that
invidious and uncharitable scrambling for
a great Estate, to aggrandize a near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in this World, who <hi>(deserendo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra
nostra)</hi> do (as it is too frequently
observed) in the next Age, if not in that
of their Creation, resemble the Viper, in
tearing by Scorn and Contempt the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of that Parent, which alone produced
their Fortune and Honour; It being,
through the just Judgement of God, the



<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100258:26"/>
unhappy Fate of that Sacred Grove, to
lend an handle to that Ax which lops its
Reputation: For the Clergy had no
greater enemy, nor vilisier, in that Age,
than <hi>Caesar Borgia,</hi> the perverse spurious
Brat of an Ecclesiastick.</p>
               <p>But for them to retain so much of their
Revenue as is requisite to supply the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of Nature, or the Wants of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ought neither to be the Object of
Envy, or Fear: For he must needs be
worse than a <hi>Momus,</hi> or <hi>Zoilus,</hi> who
carps at the provision of Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which a poor Tradesman makes to
his own Family by his Lawful Calling.
Yet the Dignity of that Sacred Office is
such, that Decency requires a more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
manner of living, than the sordid
and mean way of Plebeians; in regard
they are particularly commanded to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
<hi>Hospitality.</hi> (For which, not only
<hi>Spiridion</hi> was Famous, but also the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the Prelates of the Primitive
Church, whether in a Celibate, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
state:) But as that Famous Bishop
of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was far from Superfluity in his
Entertainment of Strangers; So should
they be, who are bound to know, That



<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100258:26"/>
simple Habit and Diet are most conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the primitive Simplicity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
but especially of Church-men:
There being no Heavenly-minded Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick,
who is thorowly Mortified as to
the Blandishments of the Flesh, and hath
absolutely resigned his Soul to God) but
useth even these things which are Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
sparingly and moderately, not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nature its Tribute without some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
grudging the little time he spends
about it; and therefore makes haste to
get from the Table, that he may return
to his better Exercises. And seeing (in
imitation of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>) he comes to
his Meat as to a Medicine, it cannot be
presumed, that he will cast away much of
his precious time in such unedifying Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
but rather (after the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of that Great <hi>Conquerour,</hi>) will drive
away all curious Cooks, and other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers
of Luxury, far from his Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And let not any imagine that this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Charity, which cannot but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the study of these <hi>Persian</hi> Arts of
Splendour, and effeminate Gallantry,
(too much in fashion in this Age) shall

expose that Sacred <hi>Order</hi> to Contempt in

to Honour the Clergy. And they
who are knowing Persons of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
look upon it as no Disparagement to
their Grandeur, to put Characters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and Signatures of Honour, on the

which <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Great carried to St.

Holy Orders to the Admiration of the

               <p>And though it be very commendable
in any great Person (as being a great
Evidence of true Piety in them) to put
such Respect upon the <hi>Representatives</hi> of
their Great Masters; yet I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the ambitious Affectation of it in
any Church-man, or a solicitous Desire
in any of them, to be preferred to the
great Officers of State: For this vanity
they did never learn from him who gave
them their <hi>Commission;</hi> (if ever they
were sent of God,) For, <hi>He was meek
and lowly in heart,</hi> and commanded all
his Disciples to learn that Document from
his Example.</p>
               <p>But, if it be objected; how then shall
a Church-man vindicate himself from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
seeing it is their Fate to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
palpably dis-respected: The Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Gospel is indeed a Bundle of Mysteries

That the <hi>Ancient</hi> of Dayes

That he who hath his Center every

<hi>Mercurius Trismegistus</hi> describes a <hi>Deity:</hi>)

nine Moneths, in the narrow Womb of a

to those of a more Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Descent; as if (forsooth) their Blood
(be it never so noble) were attainted by
the most honourable Employment in the
World: whence it comes to pass, That
some Gentlemen <hi>in Decimo-Sexto</hi> (whose

Method of vindicating one from
Contempt: For in effect it amounts to no
more than this; that because they are

must be like them. But the first Course
a Church-man is to take, is, To reflect

of Our Church, That the particular

all the Retaliation I would have them
make for these undeserved Undervalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
is, a generous inward Contempt.
For, seeing it is yet Controverted among
Moralists, whether Honour be in the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

to conclude, That such despicable
Arts will rather rebound a dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p>And all Church-men should carefully
avoid the Company of such who have
little Civility, and less Christianity; as
being unedifying and contagious: For the

               <p>The first is <hi>Atheism;</hi> And it is no
Wonder that they hate and despise the

Servant, who could never yet find in
their Hearts to love and honour the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
And because the Presence of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man (how mean soever he be) doth,
as it were, fetter the Devil with Chains
in a wicked man, so that he cannot actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
his perverse habits so frankly as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
therefore these <hi>Gadarenes</hi> drive

praying earnestly for a dissipation of that
Cloud of wrath which is hanging over

Let not any of that Sacred <hi>Order</hi> say, If
we do thus, what shall become of our
Wives and Children when we are gone;
seeing it is not now the custom of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
the Relicts and Orphans of the
Clergy, out of the Churches <hi>Intrado?</hi>
This is easily answered. For, without all
Peradventure, a good and holy Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a rich Patrimony; as <hi>Gregorie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianz.</hi>
tells of his Sister <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> (who
was also Daughter to an humble and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying
Bishop, That she bequeathed
great Riches to her Children, in leaving
them such an excellent Pattern as her
self, and a desire to follow her Example.
Yea more than so, seeing the best way to
gather is, thus to scatter, these Charitable
Husbands and Parents may considently
leave their Widows and Fatherless Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with God: For the Heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post

not suffer these young Crowes to starve for
hunger.</hi> And it was observed, that God
provided very well for them all. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum

               <p>I have been the more prolix on this

he is such an Enemy to Merit, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid

the left hand know what the right Hand
doth, <hi>he lets none in Heaven or in Earth
know it.</hi> And next, Because People are
generally apt to look upon Charity, as
the most infallible Demonstration of the
Sincerity of the Faith and Piety of
Church-men; all being naturally prone
to homologate that of S. <hi>Augustine; Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta

Church-Offices were bestowed on those

them, but fled from all Promotion, and
yet had deserved well of the Church,
by honest Principles, and an holy Life
and a diuturnal Proof of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of their Knowledge and Prudence;
It being (saith he) in this Divine Art,

of Bishops to vacant Places; (there being

Preach, in order to the Conscientious
Choice of a Person fit for that Eminent
Employment. And that after Fasting

Persons, by the common Suffrages of all
the Ministers of the Diocesan Synod: and
that some discreet Persons among them

to entreat his gracious Majesty
to present, out of that number, one to

(the renowned Historian <hi>I. A.

did fill it in this manner; (as we
read in the first Chapter of the <hi>Acts of the

Custom of the Primitive Church to
do so; and of our own also, not many
years ago; I am fully perswaded, that
our Gracious Sovereign (whom God
bless with a long and prosperous Reign

such transcendent Goodness towards this
Church, would be pleased graciously to
Condescend to the humble Address of his
obedient Subjects and Servants: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

Church may be stopped, and these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
which are cast upon the Office,
wiped off; as, That Bishops are only the
Creatures of Courtiers, or of some Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Church-men, introduced by Motives
best known to themselves; and that they
are yet but <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as having no Call

Prayers of the <hi>Chapter</hi> in their Elections,
are but a Mocking of God, in seeking
Grace to direct them in the Choice of a
fit Person for the vacant Place, whilst
(being predetermined by a <hi>Conge-d'elire</hi>

               <head>A Brief Historical Account of

in the Primitive Church.</head>
               <p>THat the Method of Election expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Article, was observed
<hi>in Ecclesia primo-primitiva,</hi> (as <hi>Gratian</hi>

Three Centuries, may appear from the
subsequent Historical Instances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clemens Rom.</hi> the First of the Christian
Fathers next the Apostles, in his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Epistle to the Corinthians,</hi> gives a full
Account of that Method of Election,
which was practised in the Infancy of the
Christian Church, and is absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to that we wished for in the last
Article. But, for brevity's sake, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the ingenuous Reader to the 101 pag.
of that Epistle. Yet, for all our haste, I
must make a little stop, and Congratulate
(with all Lovers of Antiquity) the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the only genuine Treatise of
that Apostolick man, unto the present
Church; this notable Epistle, so full of



<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100258:43"/>
Primitive Simplicity, Candour, and Zeal;
having (like the River <hi>Alphaeus</hi>) run un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ground, for so many Centuries of
years: But in this last Age, that Fountain
<hi>Arethusa</hi> hath appeared to the Publick
view of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next Instance is in the 39th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of</hi> Tertullian <hi>his</hi> Apologetick, <hi>where he
speaks to this purpose;</hi> Praesident probati

               <p>The next in the <hi>Series</hi> of time, is the
Famous <hi>Origen,</hi> in <hi>Hom.</hi> 6. in <hi>Levit.</hi> who
there speaks to the same purpose. Yet it
cannot be denied, but that <hi>Sixtus Senen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
Praesat. in Bibliothec.</hi> averrs the said
<hi>Commentary</hi> to be falsly ascribed to <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen;</hi>
as also, that on <hi>Iob;</hi> and he pretends
solid Reasons for his Assertion.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is so copious in this matter,
and his mind so well known therein, unto
all that have read his <hi>Works,</hi> that we need
not consume any Paper in citing that zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Father. I shall therefore remit the
Reader to his 68th Epistle throughout;
and the 52d; wherein he tells us, That
his <hi>fidus Achates, Cornelius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
was chosen <hi>Clericorum pene omnium testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monio.</hi>

in the same Epistle, speaking of the Choice

Therefore it is observed, That all

<hi>M. Anton. De Dom. Repub. Eccles. l. 3.

Bishops in some Parts of the World; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
either they, or the People belonging
to their Cathedral, were deprived of
Preaching on the Lords Day: For in the

               <p>But there is another Exception (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

sufficiently warrant the Conscience of a

               <p>NExt, Let this Shepherd of Pastors be
careful to visit his Diocess once
every year, in Conformity to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Canons; unless it be of a very great
Dimension, and the Churches therein so
numerous, that the Difficulty is insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
But what is wanting the one year,
should be supplied in the beginning of
the next; that by such accurate Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he may find opportunity to Water
what God hath Planted, and to thrust
those out of the Vineyard, whom the
Great Master never sent to work there:
(they being hurried thereinto by their
own insufficient forwardness, Simoniacal
Pactions, and other unconscionable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
and whose after-Practices are
found too sutable thereunto.) And let
him exactly take notice, when he comes
upon the place, if the Minister and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple



<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100258:50"/>
perform reciprocal Duties, and afford
mutual Encouragements one to another.
But, seeing all these Particulars are fully
expressed in the Books for Visitations, I
shall add no more but this General; That
he is bound to take inspection, If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
use a conscionable Endeavour
to perform all Personal, Relational, and
Functional Duties; Which if he be found
to do, let him have his due Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For, <hi>Virtus laudata crescit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp;



laudando praecipimus.</hi> But if any be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
to be very defective in their
Intellectuals, or Morals, or in any of the
elicit, or imperat Acts of those Faculties,
so that Charity it self cannot be so blind,
but may perceive, that they throw down
more with the one hand, than they build
with the other; Let these be Censured
according to their Demerits. For (as a
Skilful Physician) our Prelate is obliged
to purge the Mystical Body, of its most
noxious Humours, by applying season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>Catharticks,</hi> and a Dose too that is
proportionable to the Distemper; and (as
a good Surgeon) speedily to cut off these
Organical Members, which are already
sphacelated, lest that Gangrene invade the
whole Body.</p>
               <p>


                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:100258:51"/>
                  <q>Ense recidendum, ne pars sincera trahatur,</q>
(saith the Poet.)</p>
               <p>Which if he do not, he must resolve to
be accountable to the most impartial
Tribunal imaginable, (which is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
above the pretended Justice of <hi>Aea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
Minos,</hi> and <hi>Radamanthus</hi>) for
those destructive Neglects, which carry
the apparent Ruin of many Souls in the
front of them.</p>
               <p>Likewise, at these Visitations, they may
find an excellent opportunity of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>(jure-postliminii)</hi> that Antient Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> excluding (in
the mean time) all Superstition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from;
though some are apt to believe,
that it is not the fear of giving Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
which is the <hi>Remora</hi> of this use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Practice, but rather the Laziness of
some Church-Governours; that Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
being one of the honourable Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
of Episcopacy, and, (as some
thought) incommunicable to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
there being very few Instances of
any of them, who in the Primitive Church
were delegated to perform the same.



<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100258:51"/>
And sure, the seasonable noticing, if
Ministers and Parents have exercised
their respective Duties in order to the
Education of Young Ones, is so far
from giving just matter of Offence to
any, that (if rightly considered) it
would be found in it self a Work
highly commendable, and very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for the Church, if Conscionably pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd.
For what harm can the Imposition
of a Bishop's hands do to any, unless
they have the <hi>Polonian Plica,</hi> or a Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Leprosie in their heads? And sure
I am, the fervent Prayer of an Holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
seconded with the Devotion of
that Church before which the Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Person hath Solemnly Homologated
his Baptismal Vows, may do much good,
in order to the procuring of their
growth in Grace, and the Knowledge
of <hi>Holy Iesus,</hi> and the enabling of them
to perform these vows and Purposes,
and that Profession of Faith which they
had before embraced in Baptism. But we
need not insist any more on this particular;
for the Usefulness thereof is so evidently,
and fully holden forth, by D. <hi>Hammond,
Taylor, Dallee, Hanmer,</hi> and <hi>Baxter,</hi> that

               </argument>
               <p>SEEING the <hi>Candidates</hi> of the Sacred
Function are no inconsiderable part
of the Episcopal Charge, Let those of that
Eminent Order, exactly note the ensuing
Particulars, before they proceed to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>1. If they have a competent measure of
Knowledge, whereby they are able to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and Convince Gain-sayers. <hi>Vrim</hi> and
<hi>Thummim,</hi> should be laid up in the Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of every Gospel-Priest; That is, The
<hi>Light</hi> of Knowledge, and <hi>Perfection</hi> of
Manners: For, if they be sent of God, the
<hi>Almighty</hi> will put his Word into their
mouths, before he set them over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.



<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100258:53"/>
And if any be found to reject Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
let them be rejected from being
Priests unto the Lord; Our Saviour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
told us, that <hi>if the blind lead the blind,
both shall fall into the ditch.</hi> But, alas!
there be too many in this Age, to whom
that old Observation may be too justly
applied, <hi>Multi fiunt indoctorum Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri,
&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Yet there be some who undergo the
Fate of our first Parents; The Tree of
<hi>Knowledge</hi> bereaves them of the Tree of
<hi>Life:</hi> For, as there be Comets which have
the Light and Elevation of Stars, so there
are Vicious Persons that are endued with
excellent Parts, and though they have
the Venom of Dragons in their Hearts,
yet they have precious Stones in their
Heads. And there be too many who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the Carpenters of <hi>Noah's</hi> Ark,
they are Instrumental in saving others,
and, in the mean time, by acts of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality,
ruine their own Souls; and
though their Heads be like the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Sun,
which is sometimes full of Light,
yet their Hearts resemble the Winters
Earth, which is alwayes cold and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.
Therefore their present Conversation



<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100258:54"/>
should be carefully examined: And let a
Prelate of the Church choose rather to
lay his Hands upon Thorns, than on the
Heads of those, whose Hearts are pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and their Deportment is scandalous
to the World; which cannot but prove
a Stumbling-Block to many, and paves
the way to Speculative Atheism in their
Hearers.</p>
               <p>3. But as a Compound of Intellectuals
and Morals, let the next Inquisition be
after his Prudentials. (Which Inquest is
too much neglected in this Age.) S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> hath told us, that, <hi>Ars Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
est, Cura Animarum:</hi> And sure, he
needs no small Measure of Christian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
who hath not only his own Soul
to govern, but is also appointed to be
the guide of others. Our Saviour hath
Commanded all his Disciples, to joyn the
<hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Serpent, with the <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi>
of the Dove: Which holy Sagacity
is indispensably necessary in all Ministers
of the Gospel; in Destitution whereof,
he that is <hi>Iuvenis moribus,</hi> if admitted to
Sacred Orders, will bring that Curse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Church, <hi>Children shall rule over
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:100258:54"/>
4. Neither ought he to be <hi>Iuvenis aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te:</hi>
For; <hi>The word of the Lord was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in those dayes, when the</hi> Child Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
<hi>ministred before him in a linnen Ephod.</hi>
I wish, the Canonical Year appointed by
the Ancient Church, were well observed
in this: Then no <hi>Minor</hi> should be found
to intrude himself into the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Spiritual Matters, to whom the
Civil Law permits not an irrevocable
Management of his own Temporal Affairs.
And let not a Dispensation be given to
any, upon the pretext of the more early
Blossoms of his Youth; For that will
open too wide a door to many others, to
claim the same Privilege, though no <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cox
fructus</hi> is visible in them, or scarce
any appearance of Winter-fruit: For, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all such, that <hi>Dicterium</hi> may be fitly
applied, <hi>Malitia supplet aetatem.</hi> Therefore
let all the Governours of the Church be
careful to stop the Career of those hasty
Births, who run abroad with the Shell on
their Heads.</p>
               <p>5. And let them not fail to search di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
into the Principles of the <hi>Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
before they give them <hi>Imposition
of hands.</hi> And if they be found to be,



<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100258:55"/>
either Schismatical, (as that they are apt
to Controvert the Lawfulness of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Government of the Church, by
<hi>Arch-Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> or to question
any innocent Ceremony which may be
imposed by Authority.) or Disloyal;
by justifying the late damnable Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
at least as to the two great
Wheels of that hellish Combination:
<hi>viz.</hi> By maintaining the Lawfulness
of Defensive Arms in Subjects against
their Prince; which (if once taken
up) do seldome fail to become offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
e're they be laid down. I shall
say no more against this Infernal Spring,
but that the Primitive Church knew
no such Doctrine, nor Practice: and
they must be grossely ignorant of their
<hi>Tenents</hi> who imagine the Contrary;
it being <hi>Lippis &amp; Tonsoribus notum,</hi>
That <hi>Preces &amp; Lachrymae,</hi> were the
only Offensive and Defensive Arms of
that Church, against her most violent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors,
under the Notion of <hi>Authority:</hi>
So that we need not Instance <hi>S. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricius,</hi>
with his famous <hi>Thebaean Legion;</hi>
Nor the Army of <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostate;</hi>
Nor make a Retrogradation unto the



<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100258:55"/>
                  <hi>Apologetick</hi> of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who tells the
<hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, That the Christians
in his time were so numerous, that they
had so filled the Court, and Places of
Judicature, yea and the Imperial Army
it self, that they wanted not sufficient
Physical Power to defend themselves
against all their Adversaries; If their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Religion had not taught them,
rather to suffer patiently for God, than
to resist the Authority then in Being;
which (though wickedly exercised) they
acknowledged to be derived from God.
Or if they have the Confidence to say,
That there is an Obligation lying upon
People, (when they dream of a Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
to Reform the Church, if they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Prince to be negligent; and
that, not only without, but also against
the Authority of their Sovereign: Such
Bigots, though dying in the Attempt,
were never reputed <hi>Martyrs</hi> by the
Primitive Church, but rather judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
Seditious; as is evident from
<hi>Can. 60. Concil. Elib.</hi> Which insinuates
this Reason; That <hi>Paul</hi> made not Use
of his Hands, but only of his eloquent
Tongue against the <hi>Idols of Athens.</hi>



                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:100258:56"/>
If such Phanatical Principles be found in
them, let them be rejected, as the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Spawn of <hi>Presbyterian, Independant,</hi>
and <hi>Anabaptistical</hi> Brood, which is still
endeavouring to hatch a <hi>Cockatrice</hi> Egg,
that may prove a <hi>Basilisk</hi> to this Church.
And I fear there be too many such
young Snakes already taken in her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
which, being once warmed with
the heat of Sedition, will do their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to sting unto death the Mother that
fosters them.</p>
               <p>Yet, I should wish, that if any of these
Youths be found towardly (though piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
marred in their Education) the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
who is most concerned in them,
would take them home to his own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and (by piece-meal) instill better
Principles into them; It being found by
Experience, that they who are sincere
Converts, become most zealous for the
Interest of the Church.</p>
               <p>6. The next Particular I would have
noticed, is that of <hi>Simony:</hi> Therefore
let all those who desire to enter into
Holy Orders, or who are to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
from one Church to another,
purge themselves by Oath of that Crime.



<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100258:56"/>
It cannot be denyed, but that the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Oath tendered in this Church, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
strict, though some (in this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Age) have invented modes of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it; But whatsoever Paction Parents
make privily with the Patron, let not
the Sons be balked from vindicating
themselves of being <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Part</hi> of those
hellish Transactions; it being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to Reason, that they who are
of approved Integrity should be waved,
than those who are under Suspition:
For, as <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> said of his Wife,
so it should be with all Ministers of the
Gospel, even <hi>not only void of a Crime,
but also of Suspicion.</hi> But I fear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is too frequently done; That Oath
being tendered in Course to those who
are under no Suspicion but these some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
pretermitted who are under a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
Scandal of Simony. Which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
not only verifies that of the
Poet,
<q>Dat veniam corvis. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
but also brings an indelible Reproach
on the Church, and Governours thereof.



<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100258:57"/>
And if any Church-man, having come by
a blank <hi>Presentation,</hi> should be so grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
as to fill up the Name of his recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Beneficiary, because he hath reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the Pockets of his Patron with
some money; though a jeering Laick
would happly say,
<q>Emerat ille prius, vendere jure potest:</q>
Yet there is not modest Ecclesiastick, but
would be so far out of Countenance with
that Reproach upon the Church, as to
return nothing else, save that Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Poet,
<q>
                     <l>—Pudet haec opprobria nobis</l>
                     <l>Et dici potuisse, &amp; non potuisse refelli.</l>
                  </q>
And if any refuse to take the Oath when
it is tendered to them, let them be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Inhabiles,</hi> according to the ancient
Canons. And if they be found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
guilty, notwithstanding they have
taken the Oath; let them be degraded
and excommunicated, for adding Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to that Crime which needed no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to make it great; for they who,



<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100258:57"/>
living in the Gall of Bitterness, and Bond
of Iniquity, have owned <hi>Simon Magus</hi> for
their Father, ought not to be reputed
Sons of the Church. And let all those
<hi>Gehazites,</hi> who have the Impudence to sell
such Matters (that kind of Merchandise
having become too much in fashion in
this Age) be Censured according to the
Canons of the Church: <hi>For to their Souls,</hi>
(as an old Father hath said, St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> by
name) <hi>in lieu of the Grace of God, a Leprosie
doth cleave, much worse than that which did
adhere unto the Covetous Servant of</hi> Elisha,
<hi>and his Seed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their common Apology may be easily
answered. For, though it is no Spiritual
Gift which they sell, and consequently
not properly <hi>Simony;</hi> yet it is <hi>Spirituali
annexum,</hi> and therefore declared by the
Canons of the Church, to fall under the
Censure of that Crime, and its Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And seeing, by all the Laws
whereby our Church is Governed, the
<hi>Officium</hi> is declared inseparable <hi>à Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficio,</hi>
(there being no <hi>Ministeria va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi>
amongst us) and by the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi>
when a <hi>Presbyter</hi> was Ordained <hi>sine Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
the Bishop who did so, was bound to
maintain him, till he were otherwise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided;



<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100258:58"/>
Therefore our Church hath good
reason to censure the Buyers and Sellers
of Benefices, as Simoniacal Persons. Now
over and above that Pathetical Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> I could amass ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other sharp Invectives of the Fathers
against this Crime; but I forbear, lest
this <hi>Article</hi> swell to too great a Bulk: and
shall only add this Wish; That, seeing
there be too many Laick Patrons who
have a liquorish Appetite after the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God's Bread, (as one phraseth it
to a very bad Sence,) I say, I wish that
they were authorized by a Municipal
Law, to gather up the Fruits of the first
Year's Vacancy, or of the half thereof,
where there is an <hi>Annat;</hi> provided, that
the Bishop of the Diocess, with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the respective Presbytery, (who
may be presumed to know better than
any, the State of a vacant Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their own Bounds) have the Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Incumbent.</hi> Which expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
would not only obviate that detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Crime, but should also prevent many
other Inconveniences, not fit to be here
expressed. As for the pretence of a Law,
wherewith some in this Land are apt to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alliate their Simony; I shall remit them



<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100258:58"/>
to the <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> of <hi>D. I. Forbes</hi>
of <hi>Corse,</hi> before his <hi>Tractate</hi> upon <hi>Simony,</hi>
Where our learned Compatriot, with an
Holy <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, declames most rationally
against that Surreptitious <hi>Edict,</hi> which
he fitly terms, <hi>Non Lex, sed Labes:</hi> and
though some account it <hi>Lex soli,</hi> yet, that
it should never be reputed by any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to be <hi>Lex Poli.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we should amass all the <hi>Canons</hi> of
the Councels, and <hi>Invectives</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
these alone would amount to no
small Volume; but lest this <hi>Enchiridium</hi>
swell too much, I shall supersede many
of them: yet the ingenious Reader may
find divers of them subjoyned, by way
of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> to this Article. But to
shew how detestable that Crime of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
was in the eyes of the ancient Church,
and how cautious these Primitive <hi>Lights</hi>
were in that Affair, I cannot forbear,
just now, to notice that <hi>Canon</hi> of the
<hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> which determined,
That nothing should be given at the time
of Receipt of the Eucharist, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the notion of Charity to the Poor;
lest any should suspect that Donation to
be made for the holy <hi>Communion,</hi> But,
alack! we have reason to fear in this



<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100258:59"/>
Age, that the time is come of the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Prophecy of S. <hi>Bernard, That
Christ will again descend from Heaven, and
take the whip in his hand, and scourge mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
Priests out of his Temple, as formerly
he did other kinds of Merchants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Flagellation too many avaricious
Prelates of <hi>Rome</hi> have good reason to fear,
for presuming to dispence in this Matter;
not only with all the ancient Canons, but
also with the inviolable Law of God; by
practising various kinds of <hi>Simony,</hi> not fit
here to be expressed. I am not ignorant of
that base Flattery of some <hi>Roman</hi> Parasites,
(I mean the Sycophantine <hi>Canonists:</hi>) who
look upon the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> as the <hi>Lord
Paramount</hi> on Earth of all the Degrees of
Priesthood; whence they infer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that he
cannot commit <hi>Simony,</hi> though he should
make Sale of them all; because a Lord may
lawfully sell his own. Which perverse Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
(as it was well observed, so it) is most
rationally confuted by that moderate and
learned <hi>Roman</hi> Doctor <hi>Cl. Espencaeus</hi> in his
excellent <hi>Comment.</hi> on the <hi>Epist.</hi> to <hi>Tit.</hi> to
which I remit those base Flatterers for their
Castigation. And I wish from my heart, that
some leading men in this Church, did not
transcribe that Copy of pretended <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations:</hi>



                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:100258:59"/>
If it were so, we should not find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them so impudent as to give it under
his Hand, that a simple Rebuke is an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
Punishment unto a Presbyter who is
convict of notorious <hi>Simony;</hi> &amp; that this
least of Censures is an Expedient fit enough
to unload the Church of that great Burden
of Reproach, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> such a flagrant Scandal
had laid upon it. But seeing this <hi>Oracular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponse
of Delphi</hi> is so diametrically opposite
to all the ancient Canons, we hence perceive
<hi>Fortuna quem nimium favet, stultum facit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. In the last place, I would tender this
humble advice to all the Governours of
this Church. Seeing they enjoy the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of the Advocation of some Churches,
that they be exceedingly solicitous, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
Persons for those Vacances, that are
<hi>Pares Negotio:</hi> and let them be of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great his Mind, about the Succession,
whose last words were, <hi>Detur digniori;</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the more uncertain <hi>Testament</hi> of
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the <hi>Epirote,</hi> who bequeathed all
at Random, <hi>unto him who had the sharpest
Sword.</hi> For if it be otherwayes, indifferent
Spectators will be apt to pass this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
upon it, That Bishops are no more
concerned with the Interest of the
Church than Laicks, and that they have



<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100258:60"/>
drawn them a Copy, to present insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
men. But, as I hope, none of the
sacred Order shall in that Race which
God hath set before them, be found to
resemble <hi>Atalanta,</hi> who was diverted
from her Course by the three golden Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>Hippomanes,</hi> (a fit Emblem of
the Profits, Pleasures and Glory of the
World, which are a Snare to all, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
the greatest part of the Sons of men.)
So I should wish, that none of them be
so blind with natural Affection, as to
bring a Reproach upon themselves, and
give Scandal to the Gospel, by prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
unworthy Relatives in the Church.
<hi>Perit enim omne judicium</hi> (saith <hi>Seneca)
cùm res transierit in affectum.</hi> I cannot
deny, but if indifferent Persons (who
have a Faculty of judging such Matters,)
do observe in those, a competency of
means adapted to the end of their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so much Respect may be deferred
to a natural Obligation, that <hi>caeteris pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
they may be preferred: for there is
a Possibility of erring when they consult
not with Flesh and Blood; as is evident,
in civil Matters, from <hi>Antipater's</hi> Mistake,
in preferring <hi>Polyspercon</hi> to the Protector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship



<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100258:60"/>
of <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> though his Son <hi>Cassan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
was found by experience to be the
fitter man: and that Greek Emperour
who mixed the Meal of the Western
Christians with Lime, when they went
to recover the <hi>Holy Land</hi> from Infidels,
was recommended to the Imperial Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by his dying Father, before his elder
Brother, meerly upon the account of
that publick Spirit, and Sentiments of
Justice, which the misjudging Father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
to be in him. But if the Tie
of Nature be the A and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of his Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
there being scarce any thing
else to make the <hi>aequilibrium,</hi> (far less to
preponderate the Scale;) but only some
grains of homogeneal Blood; then let a
Church-man remember, that in the Cause
of God, a good <hi>Levite</hi> regards not his
nearest Relations, nor doth acknowledge
his Brethren. And let them trace the
Foot-steps of that Holy <hi>Groslhead,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> when one of his Relatives
(who was but a ground-Labourer,) heard
of <hi>Grosthead</hi>'s Preferment, his gross Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance

odious in the Sight of God, and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
to the Church; unless very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Reasons plead for a Dispensation
for a short time. What was said of some
Monks, by <hi>Anthony</hi> the Father of them,
<hi>Monachus in oppido, ut piscis in arido,</hi>
may be applyed to all wandering <hi>Levites,</hi>
who are found straying in Cities where

yet they needed not have gone further for
a <hi>Topick</hi> to prove the Point, than their own
Natural Reason; It being a self-evident
Principle, That when the End is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
all the Means are supposed to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
without which it cannot possibly
be obtained: Now this Spiritual Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alone, being a burden too weighty for
<hi>Atlas</hi> his Shoulders, (it being S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s
Judgment, that the <hi>Burden of a Bishop was
formidable, even to an Angel, to undergo,</hi>)
unless sufflaminated with the Divine aid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so
that a Church-Governour would need
<hi>Argus's</hi> Eyes, and <hi>Briareus</hi>'s Hands, to buoy

there can be no place left for the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
of <hi>Non-Residency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any have the Forehead to say, that the
most part of these Duties incumbent on a Bishop,
may be performed <hi>per Vicarium;</hi> he must give me
leave to apply the other part of that Maxim, <hi>per Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carium
intrabit Regnum Coelorum.</hi> Sure the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church had no such Sentiments; For, when
the Fathers of the Councel of <hi>Sardica</hi> took notice,
that some Bishops used to go to Court upon By-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands,
and private Designs of their own, they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained;



<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100258:63"/>
That no Bishop should go to Court, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
either immediately Summoned by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's
Letters; or that their Assistance were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
to help the oppressed, to right Widows and
Orphans, and to rescue them from the unjust Grasps
of Potent and Merciless Oppressours; or to seek Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to represent unto the Supream Magistrate
the most pressing Grievances of Church and State,
not suppressing the Oppressions of great Ones,
whether without any Shadow of Law, or under
some Pretext thereof; (<hi>Summum jus</hi> proving too
often <hi>Summa Injuria;</hi>) and finally, to preserve
their Respective Cities from imminent Ruin; thus
<hi>Flavianus</hi> the Patriarch resorted to <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
to intercede with <hi>Theadosius</hi> the Great, in Behalf
of his <hi>Antiochians,</hi> whose Extermination that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated
Prince had designed; and who can blame
S. <hi>Leo</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> for travelling many Miles, to divert
that <hi>Flagellum Dei,</hi> from being a Scourge to his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
who at last, (like to the high Priest <hi>Iaddus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

prevailed in his Sute?</p>
               <p>Neither can we omit the usual Temptation to

a Scandal condemned even by the Councel of

have troubled <hi>Rome,</hi> as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce a Scottish Bishop did,
prompted by his Conscience, to be rid of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
part of his Charge and Revenues. But,
as the Peace of Conscience, so this Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Conjunction, passeth my Natural Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding:
and I think, my shallow Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
shall never reach it, How one man can be
<hi>Parson</hi> in one Diocess, and <hi>Bishop</hi> in another,



<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100258:64"/>
and yet have a simultaneous Sufficiency
for both: <hi>For who is sufficient for one of
these Things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if it be said, that they are not
without a Precedent, being nothing else
but Emulators of that infamous Bishop
of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> of whom it is written, That
he had an Organical Church within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as having monopolized all the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
of Ecclesiastical Offices in his own
Person, at one time; yet I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of these Monopolists, (for I inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
confess, that such a <hi>Davus</hi> as I,
would need an <hi>Oëdipus</hi> to unriddle this
Mystery.) If they can determine the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Boundaries and Measures of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
of that Excentrick Rectory
to the Bishop thereof; and whosoever
doth it intelligibly, <hi>erit mihi magnus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi>
and much wiser than that Monster
<hi>Sphinx,</hi> in my Esteem. For under the
Notion of a Presbyter, he ought to be
subordinate to his <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and should
reverence him as a Father; and yet (in
the mean time) he may possibly claim
<hi>(jure Stationis)</hi> the Place and Privilege
of an elder Brother. But, seeing I have
not so much Geometry as to determine



<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100258:64"/>
these Marches, I shall only subjoyn this
Sentiment of mine; That though many
have good Reason to doubt how these
scattered Flocks shall be competently fed
by one who doth not pretend to <hi>Biloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
yet I have not the least Scruple
imaginable to believe, that they have a
Cordial Design to feed their own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
to the full, and not to live <hi>precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</hi>
But I fear, that this <hi>Tympany</hi> in
their Splenes, shall at last produce an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophia</hi>
in the Mystical Body; unless a
more skillful hand than that of an <hi>Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi>
do speedily apply Chalybeat Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

to find such unsuitable Returns
from many who had experienced his real

best Antidote against this unthankful

is, the unparallel'd Constancy of his
Prince's Favour, which (I hope) will

where we find a Shoal of Instances
for the <hi>Assessorian</hi> Dignity of Presbyters
and Councels. I shall only point at two
or three, which are obvious to any who
have any acquaintance with Church-History.
We shall begin with Pope <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor;</hi>
and though his Spirit was too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
(which peaceable <hi>Irenaeus</hi> scrupled
not to tell him;) yet he acted not any
matter of moment without the Consent of
his Clergy. So at <hi>Antioch P. Samosate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
that Heretical Patriarch, was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by a Synod, consisting of Bishops,
Presbyters, and Deacons; and in their
Names the Synodal Epistle was penned,
and directed to the Catholick Church;
and <hi>Cornelius</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> declares, That all
his Presbyters concurred with him in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the Schismatick <hi>Novatus,</hi> though
(as <hi>Eusebius</hi> informs us) he had sixty
Bishops to be his Associates in that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.
Neither can we pretermit that
Excellent <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Illiberis,</hi> (whose



<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100258:74"/>
laudable Canons are yet very instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to thee Catholick Church:) in
which there were but nineteen Bishops,
and twenty six Presbyters: But that
which is <hi>instar omnium</hi> in the first and
best of General Councels, (I mean that
at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) that the Presbyters had a
decisive Voice with the Apostles, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to any who can read (without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice)
the Tenour of those <hi>Decrees.</hi> I
shall shut up this Point with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a learned and moderate Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
man, who, in his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> speaks
to this Purpose; <hi>The Top-gallant of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy

               <head type="sub">Concerning the Chor-Episcopi,
(as they were termed in the Greek-Church,)
or the Vicarii Episcoporum, as they were
named in the Western Church.</head>
               <p>WE have added this Paragraph <hi>ex
superabundanti,</hi> to prove that some
Presbyters were honoured <hi>Iure Suffragii</hi>
in General Councels; It being granted
by all, that the <hi>Chor-Episcopi</hi> did subscribe
in their own names, even in those Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical
Assemblies: If we shall make it
appear, that they were nothing else but
Presbyters, invested with some more
Power than ordinary; I hope the point
is gained which we designed to prove.
Now the same is evident from the 13th
Canon of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> and the
13th of the Councel of <hi>Neo-Caesarea;</hi> as
also the 10th of the Councel of <hi>Antioch:</hi>
In all which, the Privilege that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
most essential to the Episcopal
Function, <hi>viz.</hi> The Power to Ordain
Presbyters and Deacons (which <hi>Ierom</hi>



                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:100258:75"/>
supposed to be the only formal Difference
betwixt Bishops and Presbyters) is denied
to the <hi>Chor-Episcopi.</hi> And though it may
be objected; That the tenth <hi>Canon</hi> of the
<hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> (which is one of the
<hi>Provincials</hi> that was adopted by the sixth
<hi>General Councel;</hi>) insinuates, that the <hi>Chor-Episcopi</hi>
were consecrated as Bishops, by
the <hi>Imposition</hi> of the Bishop's hands; yet,
that seems either to be a sophisticated <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
or that it was a <hi>Ceremony</hi> of particular
Designation, like to that of the thirteenth
of the <hi>Acts;</hi> For it is most certain, S. <hi>Paul</hi>
was an Apostle long before that <hi>Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Hands.</hi> Which Gloss upon the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
appears to me to be most probable;
because this Provincial was celebrated a
little after that Famous <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Nice;</hi>
and it is most improbable, that they would
have contradicted, so expressly, that great
<hi>Oecumenical,</hi> in two Particulars; <hi>viz.</hi> The
Ordination of a Bishop by one individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of that Order; and the making two
Bishops in one Diocess: whereas that first
General <hi>Councel</hi> ordains, three Bishops,
at least, to concur in the <hi>Ordination</hi> of
a Bishop; and appoints but one Bishop
in every Diocess: The Ignorance of



<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100258:75"/>
which <hi>Canon</hi> was a matter of Regret
to the great <hi>Augustine, qui Valerio in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopatu
Hipponensi non successit, sed accessit.</hi>
On which account, although he design'd
<hi>Eradius</hi> his own Successor, yet he would
not have him ordain'd in his own time:
<hi>erit (inquit) Presbyter ut est, quando De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
voluerit futurus Episcopus.</hi> And though
it may be presumed, that <hi>P. Damasus</hi> was
not ignorant of that <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> (if
there was truly any such:) he living so
nigh to the time of that <hi>Councel;</hi> yet, in
his <hi>Constitution,</hi> whereby he endeavours to
abolish the <hi>Chor-Episcopi,</hi> (which we find
in <hi>Decr. Gratian. p. 1. Dist. 68. c. Chor-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisc.</hi>)
he calls them, meer and <hi>single Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi>
and that through Pride only they
usurped the Episcopal Office: and that by
virtue of their Ordination they could not
exercise any Episcopal Privilege, both the
<hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Neo-Caesarea,</hi> and <hi>Damasus,</hi>
ground upon this Foundation, That <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
succeed only to the 70 Disciples, and not
to the Apostles.</hi> But suppose the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on which they build to be a tottering
<hi>Basis,</hi> yet we may clearly read so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Frontispiece</hi> of that Superstructure,
That they judged the <hi>Chor-Episcopi</hi> to be



<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100258:76"/>
nothing else but <hi>Presbyters.</hi> But as to
the Succession, the Learned <hi>Spalatensis</hi> (a
great Asserter of the Episcopal Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges)
judgeth aright, that both Bishops
and Presbyters are the Apostles Successors
<hi>in potestate ordinaria;</hi> but with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
that the former succeed <hi>in plenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem
potestatis,</hi> the latter <hi>in partem solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudinis;</hi>
which in the case of the <hi>Chor-Episcopi,</hi>
was a little amplified: that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
which the Ecclesiastical Law hath
laid upon the intrinsecal Power of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter
being taken off. For an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
may be impowered <hi>jure Sacerdotii,</hi>
to do many things in <hi>actu primo,</hi> even
when the <hi>exercitium actûs</hi> is sitly bound
up by the Canons of the Church, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the eviting of Schism, Scandal and
Confusion in the House of God; which
ought to be <hi>Domus Ordinata.</hi> And if that

               <p>HAVING but just now mentioned
the Honour of the Clergy, I would
next advise all the Governours of the
Church to demean themselves courteously
and affably to all; their Christian Gentile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Condescendence being the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Machin to scrue out internal Respect
from all Ranks of People. For nothing
commends Church-men so much, as a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Modesty: all Degrees of Persons, but
especially theirs, being like Coins, or
Medals; to which, howsoever Virtue
give the Stamp and Impression, Humility
must give the Weight. Let not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any of them in their Travels towards
the Northern Pole, use insolent Boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
towards any Person of Honour; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in their own Habitations, which
ought to be <hi>Asyla</hi> to all. And let them
not improve that strange Logick any
more, as to inferr, That some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are bigot Fanaticks, because they



<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100258:77"/>
earnestly entreated them to preach on the
29th of <hi>May,</hi> seeing they were upon the
Place, and the Church was vacant: though
they were not pleased to do it. Or, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that they called some other Bishops,
<hi>Cheats</hi> &amp; <hi>Knaves,</hi> because they wished, that
all of them were as good and just as their
own <hi>Ordinary.</hi> For, without all Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
one haughty expression of a proud
Priest, hath a greater Tendency in it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte
a far greater number to Fanaticism,
than twenty uttered by the humblest of
them all, can bring over to Conformity.</p>
               <p>And let all honest Ministers of the
Gospel have a large share of those Acts of
Humanity; (none of which deserve that
Title, who afford not a due Respect to
their Superiours, either in Church or State;
he being most unworthy to command,
who hath not first learned to obey.) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being more easie than a little Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And yet an obliging Deportment in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the Clergy, is a matter of great
Importance for the good of the <hi>Order;</hi>
For by cherishing all those, as Sons,
and Brethren, who are well principled,
and make Conscience of their Office, they
insinuate themselves into the Hearts of



<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100258:77"/>
those, who (next to the favour of God,
and of their Prince,) are indeed the best
Support of their Government; for (as
the Excellent Historian hath said) <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiâ
res parvae crescunt; Discordiâ maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae
dilabuntur.</hi> O! how lovingly (as
there had been no disparity at all)
did <hi>St. Ignatius, Polycarp, Irenaeus, Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
the three <hi>Asian Gregories, Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,
Basil, Augustin,</hi> and many other
Lights of the Primitive Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with their respective Colleges of
Presbyters? Neither will I ever forget
that excellent Attestation of the Pious
and Eloquent Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> (deservedly
termed the <hi>English Seneca</hi>) who appealed
to his own Clergy, If his Deportment
amongst them were not such, as if he had
been no more but a Presbyter with them,
or they all Bishops with him.</p>
               <p>Away then with that invidious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
in reference to Presbyters, <hi>The
Inferiour Clergy,</hi> (though it is one of my
<hi>Eusticks,</hi> That all the Governours of our
Church were superiour to all their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
in that which is usually termed
<hi>Clergy:</hi>) But whether that Fantastick
Phrase savour more of Pride or Ignorance,



<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100258:78"/>
it can hardly be determined. Sure I am,
in the Primitive Church only Deacons
and Sub-Deacons, with the rest of the
Orders inferiour to them, were so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted:
As for Presbyters, they were
called <hi>Clerici Superioris loci.</hi> And though
some Popish <hi>Schoolmen</hi> have multiplyed
the Sacred <hi>Orders</hi> into the number of
<hi>Nine,</hi> yet the Generality of their <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>
and <hi>Canonists,</hi> reduce them to <hi>Seven,</hi>
whereof <hi>Sacerdotium</hi> is the highest Order;
Which Opinion indeed makes <hi>Episcopatus</hi>
to be but <hi>Gradus Sacerdotii;</hi> and compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<hi>Cantores</hi> under the <hi>Lectores.</hi> It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the Judgment of some Moderns, That,
after the <hi>Chor-Episcopi</hi> were exauctorated
by the Primitive Church, as useless and
burdensome; that Presbyters were term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Antistites in secundo Ordine;</hi> which
they collect from that <hi>Iambick</hi> of S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Senate of Presbyters, that preside over
the People, and possess the second Throne.</hi>
Deacons were indeed prohibited by the
ancient Canons, to sitdown before Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
without their Leave and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
But as for the Demeanour of
Bishops in reference to their Presbyters,



<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100258:78"/>
it was a <hi>Canon,</hi> renewed more than once
<hi>Ne sedeat Episcopus stante Presbytero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, more than so; There be some, not
inconsiderable Antiquaries, who are so
far from thrusting Presbyters below the
Hatches, that they have elevated Deacons
to the upper Deck of the Superiour Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
imagining, that only Sub-Deacons,
and these Orders below them, are to be
accounted the <hi>Inferiour Clergy,</hi> which
they would collect from <hi>Hierom.</hi> on <hi>Tit.</hi>
and <hi>Aug. Epist.</hi> 162. But, <hi>non sic fuit ab

cannot be denied, but that in the latter
Centuries of the Primitive Church, the
Order of Deacons at <hi>Rome,</hi> (who were
but <hi>seven</hi> in number, according to the
Primitive Institution; and that of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
very numerous;) began, not only
to equal themselves, but also to look big
upon the Presbyters; and the Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
assumed the Title of <hi>Cardinal Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con:</hi>



                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:100258:79"/>
which Superciliousness, not only
gave occasion to the framing of those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
we have already hinted at, against
them; but also to St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to take the Pen in his hand, that he
might vindicate his own Order from the
Contempt of their Inferiours, which he
doth at length, <hi>Epist. 85. ad Evagrium.</hi>
For let <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Salmasius</hi> pretend what
they please, this Renowed Father had
no quarrel with the Order of <hi>Episcopaly</hi>
but was not a little irritated by the sawcy
and arrogant behaviour of the Deacons:
and that they might learn to know, and
keep their distance; and that Presbyters
might look down upon them, as the
<hi>Church-Nethinims,</hi> he screws up the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteratus</hi>
as nigh to <hi>Episcopacy</hi> as possibly
he can.</p>
               <p>And, (if I were not afraid to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
an impertinent Digressor) it
were easie to demonstrate from the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of this Father, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Power of <hi>Ordination, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,</hi>
and <hi>Confirmation,</hi> to belong
most properly to Bishops. And, even
in his <hi>Comment</hi> on <hi>Titus</hi> (on which
<hi>Blondel</hi> layes the greatest stress;) he



<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100258:79"/>
hath this differencing Expression, <hi>In quo
differt Episcopus à Presbytero, exceptâ Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatione?</hi>
Now, as <hi>Exceptio firmat Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulam

Keenness in his Spirit, (neither did his

Bishops over Presbyters; and that is, his

who saith, That <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Bishops cannot be excused; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I deny, but that he was much
irritated by the insolent Pride of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
Patriarch of <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> I shall only
take notice of that, which indeed I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a Punctilio not worth the noticing,
though the Enemies of this Sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
we are pleading for, lay no little
weight upon it, therefore I shall speak
a little unto it: and that is, <hi>Hierom</hi> his
asserting, that in the Infancy of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, there was an Identity of
Names; and that <hi>Episcopus</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi>
signified one and the self same thing. <hi>For
Answer.</hi> I never judg'd it a real Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
which is managed about Names;
<hi>He must be drenched very deep in the dregs
of Malice,</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian) who raiseth
deadly Quarrels about Words or Names, if
there be no real Controversie about Things.</hi>
Therefore I shall readily grant unto them
that Bishops of old were called <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
or <hi>Elders;</hi> and shall go a greater Length
too, than <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his <hi>Comment</hi> on the
<hi>Ephesians,</hi> (if it be his) who tells us; that
<hi>Omnis Episcopus est Presbyter; sed non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis



<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100258:80"/>
Presbyter est Episcopus;</hi> For I verily
believe, that in the Infancy of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
Presbyters were also termed <hi>Bishops</hi>
or <hi>Overseers;</hi> and that the Appropriation
of those Names to the different Orders,
or Degrees of the same Order, was not
made till a little after. Yet I joyn not Issue
with these, who cite the 20th Chapter
of the <hi>Acts,</hi> verse 28. to this purpose:
They who are for the <hi>Genevian Platform,</hi>
will have those <hi>Elders</hi> to be nothing else
but Presbyters, and they hug this Text as
their <hi>Palladium;</hi> because (as they fondly
imagine) it affords them an <hi>Achillaeum

               <p>SEING we have so frequently menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
the ancient Canons of the
Church; (it being as indecent, if not as
dangerous, for a Church to be without
Canons, as for a State to be without
Edicts; these serving not only as a Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
to the reciprocal Duties of Bishops,
Presbyters, and People, but being also
Boundaries to all.) I wish we had some
thing that looked like them, and served
in Lieu of them, till they be imposed
by Authority. For the <hi>Tender</hi> of the
Canonical Oath unto the <hi>Candidates</hi> of



<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100258:88"/>
that Sacred Function doth necessarily
presuppose some Canons according to
which their Obedience should be squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and by which also the Injunctions
of their Superiours ought to be regulated.
For I hope none of them are so simple,
as to imagine, that this Oath doth imply
an absolute implicit Obedience unto the
<hi>Beneplacita</hi> of Ecclesiastick Governours,
as if
<q>Sic volo, sic jubeo, slat pro ratione Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas,</q>
were the adequate Law of our Church.

it cannot be a binding Law to the

import, that he knows them from the



<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100258:89"/>

also, that this <hi>Sacramentum Militare</hi> is
with a due Subordination unto him who
gave that General his Commission; (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

is reported by some, that, before his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Retreat to <hi>Fgra,</hi> he took an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Oath of the Imperial Army.) For
the Precepts of the Superiour must not
interfere with the Commands of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme;
which, if they be found to do,
they ought not to be obeyed. And if it
be concluded, that this Canonical Oath
in the privation of Canons, is but a meer
<hi>Non-ens;</hi> Certainly these Fanatical Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are most obliged to some Bishops, who
have permitted them still to Officiate in
this Church, and yet were never so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
as to require from them any
Subscription to this Chimerical Fiction.
Therefore, I would humbly entreat the
Reverend Fathers of our Church to meet
privately amongst themselves (accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with one or two of their respective
Presbyters, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> to be of unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Principles;) and let them unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously



<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100258:89"/>
resolve upon an Uniformity of
<hi>Doctrine, Worship, Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
to be practised in this Church. It
is certainly a matter of Lamentation, that
our National Church should resemble <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi>
in its first Discovery: for (as <hi>Peter
Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Ioseph Acosta</hi> report,) a good
Horseman, in one Summer's day's Travel,
might meet with variety of Languages,
Habits, and Religion, amongst that Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
People. Sure I am, (not to speak
of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> which is already pressed;)
they might easily introduce a Platform
of Administrating the Blessed Sacraments
of the Gospel; For when one varies
from the precise words of the Institution,
(which is but too frequently done;) he
shall hardly perswade me, that he hath
Consecrated those Holy Symbols or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
(as they are usually termed) at
that time; the words of the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
being the Essential Form of a
Sacrament. And let not the <hi>Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
be any more neglected in the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
of the Eucharist, which (as St.
<hi>Cyprian</hi> testifies) was the constant <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonema</hi>
of that Solemn Benediction, in
all the Churches of Christ, in his time:



<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100258:90"/>
The same is also attested by St. <hi>Hilary,</hi>
and St. <hi>Augustin.</hi> As for the Gesture at
the Holy Table, I humbly suppose, <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
will be found the best Expedient to
introduce Uniformity into this Church;
not only because it staves off the serupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Fears of an <hi>Arto-latria,</hi> but also in
regard we find direct Evidence for the
Practice thereof in the Primitive Church.
I shall only produce one Private, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Publick Authority for it, though
many more might be adduc'd to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
<hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus</hi> (who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
about the middle of the third Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
and Wrote <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 260.) testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
in a Letter to Pope <hi>Xystus,</hi> That it
was the Custom of the Church in his time,
to stand at the Lord's Table. As for
the Publick Authority; The 20th Canon
of the Great and First General Councel
at <hi>Nice</hi> is sufficient, where we find <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
on the Lord's Day, and on the day
of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> expresly prohibited, and the
practice of <hi>Standing</hi> at their Devotions,
explicitly enjoyn'd: And that because
the Lord's Day is the ordinary Christian
Festival, and the whole time of <hi>Pentecost</hi>
(which comprehends the fifty dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt



<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100258:90"/>
Easter and Whitsunday inclusive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:)
the constant Festivity of the Church.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> looking upon
it, as an Apostolical universal Tradition,
not to kneel all that time. Whence we
may infer, That if some men speak <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter
ad Principia;</hi> (one whereof is,
That this Blessed Sacrament is the most
solemn part of Christian Devotion:) they
must either grant, that the Eucharist was
received on those dayes in a standing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture;
or that the People of God did not
at all communicate at these times, which
were a very absurd Notion; seeing they
are acknowledged by all, (who are not
wildly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the Participation of that great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
whereas that of Kneeling is but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentially
inferr'd, because the <hi>Fathers</hi>
usually term the Holy Eucharist, <hi>The most
sublime, the most solemn, and most useful
part of Christian Devotion;</hi> and that it is,
<hi>Tremendum &amp; adorab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le Mysterium:</hi>
though, under Favour, we must expound
it (and so the Context usually imports:)
of internal Adoration: unless we intend
to joyn Issue with the Popish Idolatry.
As for that irreverent and lazy Posture



<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100258:91"/>
of <hi>Sitting,</hi> we find neither direct nor indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Testimony for it: Those Canons
which command Standing every Lord's
Day, do consequently exclude Sitting, if
we look upon that Solemn Action as an
Act of Devotion: and <hi>Optatus</hi> hath told
us, <hi>Lib. 4. That the People may not sit in the
Church;</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives the reason,
<hi>Lib. de Oratione, cap. 12. That it was an
Heathen Custom, and therefore ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</hi>
Let all those who plead so
much for that irreverent and lazy Posture,
remember, that they comply in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
not only with these detestable <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
Hereticks, (who design'd thereby to
vilifie the Son of God:) but also with
those who are worse, the damnable <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi>
as is evident from <hi>Socinus</hi> his <hi>Tract.
De Coena Domi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i.</hi> And I wish all Sober
Christians would seriously advert to this;
That it is not a Corporal Repast, but a
Spiritual Refreshment they are call'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
when they come to that Holy Table:
and let the consideration of the Great King
who invites them, and of the unparallel'd
Mystery they are to receive, (the Feast-Maker
being the Feast it self;) perswade
all Christians to present themselves at



<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100258:91"/>
this Gospel-Altar with much more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
than they are obliged to practise at
an ordinary Banquet, or a Penny-Bridale.</p>
               <p>Yet, Let not any imagine, that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
by these <hi>Lines,</hi> to reflect upon some
Canons of our Church; Truly I had no
such Design; but on the contrary, de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
that these <hi>Articles</hi> are fallen too much

to Uniformity, that did prompt me to
tender this Overture (yet with all due
submission) to the Governours of our
Church; It being a most desireable thing
to see all those who desire to fear God's
Name, blessed with one mind, one heart,
and one way. As for mine own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I can easily subscribe to those
words of R. Mr. <hi>Baxter; If it be lawful to
take a Pardon from the King upon our knees,
I know not what can make it unlawful to
take a sealed Pardon from Christ and his
Ambassadours, upon our knees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewise, a set Form of <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to be used by all; whether it be the
Lesser, call'd properly <hi>Abstentio ab Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristia;</hi>

Church, which was so copious in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
being too much neglected in this Age;)



<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100258:92"/>
or the greater <hi>Anathema;</hi> with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective

               <p>And let all Bishops, wherever they are,
(if they be in health) preach on the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversaries
of the <hi>Nativity, Passion,</hi> and
<hi>Resurrection</hi> of our Blessed Lord, and on

Ghost; as also, on that of the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Restauration of our gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
upon Earth. And let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to all their Presbyters to do
so; as also to celebrate the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

hath been said already) is <hi>Caput instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis</hi>
of the Christian Sabbath; for though
these things be not authoritatively en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd;
yet the Governours of the
Church may easily thereby find the Pulse
of their Clergy; and by this <hi>Tessera</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
if there remain as yet any amongst
them, who are fermented with some of
that foure leaven of Presbytery. It were
no difficult Province (if I did not study
Brevity;) to answer all the Paralogisms,



<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100258:92"/>
and most foolish Cavils of the Fanaticks,
against these Festivals of the Church:
But I shall remit them for their Doom to
S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who makes it a Character
of a true Son of the Church, to solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
the Festivals thereof. <hi>Serm. 253. De
Temp.</hi> (in which number he places that
of the <hi>Nativity</hi> in the Front:) and to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius,</hi>
who in his 75th <hi>Heresie,</hi> tells
us, That <hi>Aërius</hi> was condemned as an
Heretick, as for other things, so for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
and condemning the Festivals of
the Church. But the ingenuous Reader
may find the Lawfulness and Usefulness of
these Festivals fully asserted by that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<hi>Hooker,</hi> in his <hi>Ecclesiastical Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi>
and the (no less) wonderful <hi>D.
Hammond,</hi> in his <hi>Treatise</hi> on that Subject:
and in particular, whosoever desires to
see the Feast of the <hi>Nativity</hi> vindicated
from the Imputation of Novelty, let them
peruse <hi>Origen lib. 8. contra Celsum:</hi> and
his <hi>Hom. 3. in Math.</hi> the Treatise of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>
on that day: and the <hi>Homily</hi> of
<hi>Chrysostom,</hi> to the same Purpose; and
they will find each of them deducing it
from the Practice of the first Antiquity:
yea, that the 25th of <hi>December</hi> is the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary



<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100258:93"/>
of our Saviour's Birth, (in my
humble judgment) is notably demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by <hi>Baronius,</hi> in his <hi>Apparatus,</hi> and
the Learned <hi>Mountague,</hi> in his Answer to
him: But most of all, by M. <hi>I. Gregory,
Oxon:</hi> of whom it may be truly said, That
he hath dived into the very bottom of
Antiquity.</p>
               <p>If these things, and such as these,
were Universally practis'd, a <hi>Liturgy</hi>
might be stollen in <hi>pedetentim</hi> upon this
Church. And I wish we had a well-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
one, purified from the Dregs of
Popery and Superstition, and framed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the pattern of the most Authentick
Liturgies of the Primitive Church (of
which the Learned <hi>G. Cassander</hi> hath
collected no small variety;) that we
may again resume the Face and Garb
of a National Church; which hath been,
too long, as a Body without the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Ornament of Skin and Muscles, or as a
flat Picture, not duely heightened with
its Shadows: a Liturgy being found, by
the Experience of all ancient Times, as
a necessary Hedge and Mound to preserve
any Profession of Religion, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God in a National Church, from



<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100258:93"/>
Irreverence, Confusion, and Contempt:
without which Boundary, it is impossible
that a tolerable Uniformity should be
long retained in any great Incorporation
of Christians. And it's observable, That
M. <hi>Calvin</hi> himself, when from <hi>Frankfort</hi>
he had received an odious, malicious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of many Particulars in the <hi>English</hi>
Liturgy, (as any will acknowledge, who
shall compare the Report then made, with
what he finds:) though he were so
transported as to call them <hi>Ineptias tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,</hi>
yet in a more sober mood, he gave
positive Approbation of the same; as is
evident from his Epistle to the <hi>Protector</hi>
of that Kingdom; in these words: <hi>As for
Form of Prayers, and Ecclesiastical Rites,
I very much approve that it be set, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
from which it may not be lawful for
the Pastors in their Function to depart: that
so there may be Provision made, for the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
and Vnskillfulness of some; and that
the Consent of all the Churches among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
may more certainly appear: And Lastly
also, that the extravagant Levity of some, who
affect Novelties, (or at the best, vent a Rhapso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of pious Non-sence:) may be prevented.</hi> &amp;c.
Whence we rationally infer; that they who



<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100258:94"/>
endeavoured the total Abolition of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
in that Church, had a design to
Reform, (or to say better, Deform) <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi>
as well as <hi>England;</hi> and to chastise
<hi>Calvin</hi>'s Estimation of it, as well as that
of the English Prelates: Not to speak of
that applause which the Learned <hi>Isaac
Casa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bon</hi> gave, of the great care of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
and Purity observed in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Liturgy, proclaimed every where in
his Epistles to all his Friends; That there
was not any where else in the World
the like to be found, nor ever hoped he
to see it, till he came into that Kingdom.
But it seems <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> the old Martyr,
prophesied of these Haters of all Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
under the Notion of Anti-Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
(for all their Declamations against
Anti-Christian Rites;) For in his Book <hi>De

that favour, as to expunge what they

But they neglecting to take Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
thus by the Foretop, they have
ever since found it <hi>bald behind.</hi> Which
puts me in mind of the great Soloecism
committed by the great <hi>Hannibal,</hi> in
point of War, (though he was one of
the slyest and wariest Captains that ever
liv'd:) who went not immediately to
<hi>Rome,</hi> after the mighty Defeat given to
the <hi>Romans</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Cannae;</hi> for
during that great Consternation he might
(as <hi>Rawleigh</hi> hath judiciously observed)

of Divine Service, and that which is also
the best Expedient to pave the Way into
a more perfect one, is; To recommend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the Ministers of the Gospel, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Lord's Day before Sermon they read,
with great Reverence) a Lesson at least, out
of the Old Testament; and a Chapter or
two from the New; (this being much more
properly <hi>The Word of God,</hi> than what they
preach:) that their People may, in Process
of time, be as well acquainted with the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
part of the Scripture, as with the
Precepts, Promises, and dreadful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of the Gospel; For they are
meer Strangers to Antiquity, who doe
not know, that preaching was scarce the
third part of the Solemn Service of the



<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100258:95"/>
Lord's Day, that being but a <hi>Tractatus</hi> (as
<hi>Augustine</hi> testifieth) on the Lesson which
was last read. And let them solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Decalogue, and Apostolick
Creed; all these Steps of Divine Service
being variegated and intermixed with short
Acts of Prayer and Praise. And sure I am,
there is no Congregation (unless the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
thereof be very rough hewen: but will
stand up (if desired by the Minister to do
so,) when he solemnly pronounceth the
Sum of the Moral Law, and (as the
Mouth of the People) makes a publick
Confession of Faith; whereby they shall
testifie their willingness, through Divine
Grace, to believe and obey all that God
hath revealed and commanded.</p>
               <p>And let not those, who have the <hi>Cura
Animarum,</hi> forget, specially to enjoyn
their respective Flocks to put themselves
in a reverent Posture, when they accost
Heaven with solemn Acts of Prayer and
Praise; that being indispensibly practised by
all the Primitive Church, whose bodily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
proved not an invincible Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
to them. And, seeing the seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Blessing before meat, and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
after it, are brief Adorations of



<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100258:96"/>
the infinite Goodness, Let all Ministers
by their own Example recommend a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
Posture to the rest of the Guests.
Sure, it is a matter of Admiration, to see
the Generality of Fanaticks (the <hi>Quakers</hi>
only excepted: making their <hi>Graces</hi> (as
they are usually termed) commensurable
with any pertinent Prayer that is void
of Tautologies, and yet not to accost the
great <hi>Provisor</hi> of all the Families of the
Earth, with more Reverence than a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Host. And when that short (but
very substantial) Hymn was sung, which
is termed the <hi>Doxology,</hi> and is a direct
Adoration of the Blessed Trinity, (which
if I were not asham'd of frequent Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,

For, though it is an unquestionable
Truth, That the Heart ought to be the
<hi>Primum Mobile</hi> in all our Acts of Divine
Worship, without whose primary Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Concurrence, it is at best but a
Carkass of Devotion we offer unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
yet, seeing by the Law of Creation
and Grace of Redemption, we are bound
to glori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie God with our Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
(for <hi>both are his</hi> saith the Apostle.)
Therefore when we make our Addresses
to the Throne of Grace, we are obliged
to put them both in an humble Posture
of Adoration: the Primitive Christians
being so far from practising that irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and lazy Posture of Sitting in the
time of Prayer, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> (as we
find in his excellent Treatise <hi>De Oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne:</hi>)
inveighs sharply against those who
did sit down instantly after Prayer; and
he tells them, that they upbraid God
to his Face, that they are soon weary of
the Duty.</p>
               <p>And it were also very fit, that all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
were desir'd to exhort their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to hear reverently, and with disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered



<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100258:97"/>
Heads, that Weekly Proclamation
from Heaven: (I mean the Preaching of
the Gospel,) which was the constant
Practice of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, who
was so far from covering his Head then,
that he could not be perswaded to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
standing all the time of Preaching,
much less to sit in the time of Prayer:
and of the two <hi>Theodosii,</hi> and <hi>Martianus,</hi>
the immediate Successor of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the
Younger: and I wish that of the Poet
were fulfill'd in this particular,
<q>Regis ad Exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</q>
But the Deportment of the far greater
number of those who are called Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
is so intolerably notorious, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately
profane, that if St. <hi>Pauls Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>
should come in, he would be so far
from falling down and Worshiping, that
he would be presently bound to report,
<hi>God is not in you of a truth.</hi> Yea, some
Christians do more reverence to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of a Church, than we to the presence
of God within it: These of <hi>Habassia,</hi>
(saith <hi>Alvarez</hi>) if they pass by a Church
(be their haste never so great) they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly



<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100258:97"/>
dismount, and walk on foot, till
they leave not only the Church, but also
the Church-yard, very far behind them.
And, I fear, the <hi>Turks</hi> shall rise up in
Judgment against many Christians for
their irreverence in Gods House; for (as
<hi>Busbequius</hi> tells us) if a <hi>Turk</hi> should but
scratch his head in the time of Divine
Service, he would be verily perswaded
that he should lose the Benefit of coming
to Church at that time: but with us it is
Iniquity, even the <hi>Solemn Meeting.</hi> But
take we heed lest we come to know, that
God was here, by his departure from
hence; and that Voice be uttered out of
our Temples, which was once heard out
of that of the <hi>Iews, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And, in sine, Let it be recommended

when they ascend that Sacred <hi>Ambo,</hi>

Neither should we have such occasion
to mind that famous Story (if it may be
so termed) of the seven <hi>Ephesian</hi> Sleepers;
if the Governours of our Church, during
these eighteen Winters last by-gone, had
studied so much Uniformity, as to be at
the pains, unanimously to compile a plain
and brief <hi>Catechism;</hi> (but withal a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Sum of the whole Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine)
and that for the publick Use of
this Nation: that every Country-Curate
may not improve a Mode of his own;
which, if it be not contradictory, is at
least disparate from the Platform of his
Neighbour: But that by a Form of sound
words generally authorized, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
young ones may be early informed
of the Principal Duties of <hi>Piety</hi> they owe
unto God, of <hi>Charity</hi> to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and of <hi>Sobriety</hi> to themselves.</p>
               <p>If such things as these were accorded
unto, and accordingly performed, it could
not truly be said of the Governours of
this Church, That they never yet pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the right Ends of their Government.
Yea many such Acts would be a sufficient
Gagg to stop the Mouths of the virulent
Adversaries thereof, who stick not to say,

That they look upon Bishops as the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest

some make no Bones to assimulate

having received Assurance of a Pension

(as favouring too much of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Episcopal

of this Article.</p>
               <p>When such things as these are resolv'd
upon for the Behoof of the Clergy,
they ought to be prudently recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but not imperiously commanded,
under the Notion of Church-Canons;
For it is only a General Convocation
that can make them such; as being the
sole true Representative of a National
Church: And till his Majestie's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be interposed, they cannot have the
Force of Laws. It being a well known
<hi>Saying</hi> of <hi>Optatus Milevit. Ecclesia est in
Republica, non Respublica in Ecclesia.</hi>
Let us therefore patiently wait till Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence give us serener times,
and more Tranquillity in the Land, (for
as Physitians say, <hi>Cocta movenda sunt,
non cruda.</hi>) and till it please his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to indict a General Convocation
of the Clergy. (and, that the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Circumstances of such a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is one of the Royal Prerogatives,
none, but they who are Fanatically
Principled, will Question.) But if once
this Church were so happy, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,



<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100258:99"/>
with his Majesty's Favour, such a
Convention; then all the ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
which are judged useful for this
Church, ought to be retrived: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is (after mature Deliberation)
found Convenient, <hi>pro re nata,</hi> should
be reduc'd into Canons, that all may
know the proper Standard of the
Church.</p>
               <p>And let an effectual Course be taken to
suppress and eradicate all Schisme, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and Profaneness, out of this Land;
that the Church of God may become ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to all such, as is an Army with Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>And let a door be opened to all Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
(who are <hi>habiles</hi> in Law) to give in
Indictments, <hi>sub periculo,</hi> against any sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
or organical Member of this Church;

But that Church-men must needs be more

be some Roman Doctors (especially the
<hi>Canonists:</hi> so parasitical, as to adore that
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as a Demi-God, and
more than a man; and to teach, <hi>That he

most sober and judicious of them, even
when they conclude him to be <hi>Major sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis,</hi>

And that this was the Sentiment and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of two late General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
(when the Pope's Usurpation was

<hi>Martin</hi> the 5th. Likewise the
Councel of <hi>Basil</hi> pronounced the Sentence
of Degradation against <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 4th,
and in his Place substituted the Duke of

Yet, that the Authority of this last

               </argument>
               <p>BUT till this Church be blessed with
such a General Rendezvouz of its
Clergy, let every Bishop vigorously set
about his Duty in his own Sphere. For
what One said well concerning a General
Reformation; That if every man would
Reform himself, there would little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
for the Supreme Magistrate to do,
may be here fitly applied; For, if every
Governour would act his part within his
own Precinct, sure there would be less
trouble given to a General Assembly,
whenever Providence shall give the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
thereof. Therefore let them use all
Means possible, which are purely Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick,
to reduce all Schismaticks to the
path of Unity, and all Hereticks to the
path of Verity. But if (after much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
waiting for the fruit of their Labours)
there be no hope of their Conversion,



<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100258:104"/>
then let them proceed to a Judicial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of these obstinate Sinners, who
are found to be Irreclamable: and let
the Church-Censures alwayes prevent the
Castigations of the Civil Magistrate; it
being a most invidious thing, for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Church to clamour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Criminal Judge to Fine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
those Delinquents, whom they have
scarce ever noted as such in their Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick
Courts. This preposterous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
looks, not only like the <hi>Duo gladii</hi>
of <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8th, but doth also resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the second, his throwing
S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys into <hi>Tyber,</hi> that he might
betake himself unto S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sword.</p>
               <p>But this was not the Method of the
Primitive Church, which permitted none
of it's Organical Members to meddle, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
directly, or indirectly, in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Blood, or bodily Coercions; as is
evident from the ancient Canons; the
passive Effusion of the precious Blood of
<hi>Holy Iesus,</hi> and of his Blessed Martyrs,
being a rich Compost to the Soil of the
Church; but not the active Shedding of
the Blood of others, under a Pretext of
Religious Zeal for the Enlargement



<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100258:104"/>
thereof. Which looks liker <hi>Mahumet</hi>'s
way of Propagation, than the Tranquill
Methods of the Gospel of Peace.</p>
               <p>Primitive Christianity (which did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
infinitely transcend this Age, in
the Glowings of Divine Zeal,) knew no
such Calentures of Passion: <hi>Bellona</hi> was
not then looked upon as a Nursing-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Church; Nor <hi>Mars</hi> as a
God of Reformation: Neither were
the Laws of Christ like those of <hi>Draco</hi>
or <hi>Mahumet,</hi> written with the Blood of his
Enemies; though he sealed them with his
own, and sprinkled them with the
Blood of Martyrs; as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith:
It being very observable, that the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Ianus</hi> was then shut, when the
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> was born. For the
Church is sufficiently furnished with
Means of saving Souls, though she never
draw a Temporal Sword: The Diseases
of the Mind not being cureable like those
of the Body; for Asperitie is no proper
Remedy for them, but only Reason, and
Lenity of Words. Those good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
<hi>Constantine, Valentinian,</hi> the two
<hi>Theodosii,</hi> and <hi>Martianus;</hi> proceeded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
no greater Extremity against the most



<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100258:105"/>
to no greater Extremity against the most
damnable and incorrigible Hereticks of
their Times, than the Sentence of Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Which Christian Lenity was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to the Judgment of <hi>Tertullian, cap.
24. &amp; 28. Apologet.</hi> And in his <hi>Book</hi> to <hi>Scapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
we have this excellent Expression; <hi>Sed
nec Religionis est cogere Religionem; quae
sponte suscipi debet, non: vicum &amp; hostiae ab
animo libente expostulentur.</hi> With whom
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> joyns Issue, <hi>Epist.</hi> 62. and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,

placet, si usque ad mortem in quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam,
licèt Haereticum, saeviatur.</hi> Whence
we may perceive, that the Apology of
some Ecclesiasticks, for imbruing their
hands in the blood of that detestable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
<hi>Servetus;</hi> is point blank contrary
unto the unanimous Doctrine of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Fathers.</p>
               <p>And if we shall alter the Scene from
<hi>Geneva</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> it will be found no less
tragical and bloody: For (as East and



<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100258:105"/>
West meet together at last, by going asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
so the <hi>Iesuit</hi> and <hi>Fanatick</hi> trust most
unhappily in that Anti-Christian Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Treachery and Cruelty, &amp; in those
damnable Arts of Rebellion, and King-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
to which execrable Assasinations, and
perverse Intendments, <hi>Britain</hi> hath been
too long the fatal Theatre. And though
these pretend to be Christians, yet I suppose
they have no other Apology for their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiousness,
than that of a barbarous King,
who said, <hi>That his Tongue was not made of
Bone.</hi> For it is impossible that Christian
Religion should afford them any; it being
very observable, That in all those famous
Persecutions of the Primitive Church
(whereby many Millions were absorpted
in the gulfe of Death:) not one was found,
who thought it lawful to make use of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Arms, (though in a just cause) against
the supream Authority then in being; but
did conquer their Victors and Tormentors,
with Constancy and Patience; it being most
false what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> asserts, that it was not a
Moral, but a Physical incapacity, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
them; For <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
doth clearly evince the contrary.</p>
               <p>Whence we may easily conclude, in
what Shop those Offensive Arms were



<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100258:106"/>
framed, wherewith <hi>Hildebrand</hi> assaulted
the German Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth,
and by what hellish Councel his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
<hi>Paschal</hi> the second, was influenced to
excite <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth against his Father
and Sovereign; not to speak of those
Storms which disquieted <hi>Frederick</hi> the
first and second all their Dayes; the
Clouds that ingendered them being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled
at <hi>Rome.</hi> But we had need to
transcribe the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> to
enumerate the Hostilities of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Bishops against the Emperours their
Lords; eight of which they excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
and when that was done, then
they made the Temporal Sword cut off
those whom the Spiritual had struck at.
Which Anti-Christian Methods became
so formidable to the languishing Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
that <hi>Rodulph</hi> of <hi>Habspurg,</hi> (the
Founder of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Greatness) would
not go into <hi>Italy,</hi> to receive the Crown
of Gold at <hi>Rome,</hi> after he was chosen
Emperour; calling that bloody City,
<hi>The Lyon's Den:</hi> And unto those who
urged him to go thither, to receive that
third Ceremonial Crown, he frequently
uttered that of the Poet,</p>
               <q>

                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:100258:106"/>
Olim quod Vulpes aegroto, cauta, Leoni
Respondit, reseram &amp;c.</q>
               <p>But <hi>Germany</hi> was not the sole Theatre of
the unchristian Plots and Practices of
these Anti-Primitive Prelates; For, no
little Trouble was given to <hi>Philip the
Fair,</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>P. Boniface</hi> the eighth
of whom it was truly said, <hi>intravit ut
Vulpes, regnavit ut Leo, mortuus est ut Canis.</hi>
Likewise <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th had his share of
Disquiet from that Martial Prelate <hi>Iulius</hi>
the second, by whose Fulminations the
poor King of <hi>Navarr</hi> was Thunder-struck
without Remedy. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
having indeed a most <hi>Catholick</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
after the Dominions of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
not to speak of the barbarous As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sasination
of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and fourth
of <hi>France,</hi> by two desperate Villains,
who had been carefully instructed by
their Ghostly Fathers in that meritorious
Art of King-killing: <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the forehead, in a publick <hi>Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> to celebrate that <hi>Iacobin</hi>
Friar, as a notable Martyr upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:100258:107"/>
But we need not cross the Seas for Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of this Nature; For if <hi>Innocent</hi> the third
(the Hatcher of that most seditious and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious
XXX Canon of the Councel of
<hi>Lateran:</hi>) with his Legate <hi>Pandolphus,</hi> were
now alive, they would be found to talk of
that inauspicious King of <hi>England,</hi> named
<hi>Iohn,</hi> his constrained Resignation: and it
is no small wonder, after so many Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of years, to hear again (in this Age)
any noise of that vain and illegal Pretence
which all sober Persons imagined, had
been blown up long agoe by that Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean
<hi>Powder-Plot:</hi> but it seems, they
intend to give a Demonstration to the
World, that no Prescription of time can
render a common Whore honest. And if
a grain-weight of Christian Ingenuity, or
Humanity, can be found in that late prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<hi>Conspiracy</hi> against our Church and
State, let the Universality of that infernal
Design, with those base Appendages of
diuturnal plotting, vile Ingratitude,
Treachery, and Cruelty, be the sole
Judges thereof.</p>
               <p>And, in fine, it is my humble Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that, till these Coals of <hi>Iuniper</hi> be
quenched, which have too long infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med



<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100258:107"/>
all the Vitals of the Christian Church
(I mean the Puritanical Papist, and Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited
Puritan: our unchristian Animosities
and Feuds (many whereof are meer <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomachies,</hi>
and groundless) shall never
be throughly extinguished, till the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
Fire of Hell consume these lesser
Flames.</p>
               <p>Neither will I ever forget that notable
Instance of this <hi>Concordantia Discordantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
which that excellent Historian <hi>I. A.
Thuan.</hi> affords unto us, in his 56th <hi>Book,</hi>
where he tells us, that the <hi>Daemagogues</hi> of
<hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Pulpiteers</hi> of <hi>Rochel,</hi> centered
in that point of treacherous inhumanity,
<hi>viz.</hi> to put to Death all Prisoners of War,
even after the publick Faith had been
given unto them. But
<q>Tractent fabrilia Fabri.</q>
Therefore the <hi>Antisignani</hi> of the <hi>Arrians,
Macedonians, Nestorians,</hi> and <hi>Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
(not to speak of many other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:)
were not only conven'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the respective General Councels,
which are accounted the most famous
of them all; but were also judicially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
and Sentenc'd with the highest Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Church, before the Civil



<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100258:108"/>
Magistrate took any other notice of them
as Delinquents, than to compell those er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Schismaticks to appear personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before the Ecclesiastical Court, to
which they had been legally summoned:
The Church in these Dayes laying down
this, as an inviolable Conclusion, that
they would not fail to do their own Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and if the Civil Magistrate afterwards
neglected his, let him answer to God for
it, who punisheth <hi>Potentes potenter:</hi> and
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; as saith <hi>Herodot. in

man must stand and fall to his own
Master. The <hi>Brachium Seculare</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
fit enough to restrain exorbitant
Practices, but it hath no direct Influence
upon irregular Judgments; and I fear, it
makes more Hypocrites than sincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts;
Fire and Faggot (the beloved Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) having a
more natural Tendency to a preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Consumption, than to a Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
Therefore the <hi>Arrians</hi> (whose
Courses were generally very violent, and
bloody:) are deservedly look'd upon as
the genuine Parents of these Coercive
Motives, and disingenuous Arts, which



<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100258:108"/>
were judged very heterogeneal to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Constitution of the Church; which
as it transacts only in Spiritual Matters,
so it could inflict no other than Spiritual
Censures and Chastisements. But when
the fiery <hi>Dominicans</hi> arose, (the Dream
of <hi>Dominicus</hi> his Mother being a sad
Prognostick of the Violence of that <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>)
they might justly have been term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in this Regard, <hi>Arriani Redivivi;</hi> so
merciless was that Persecution of the
poor <hi>Waldenses,</hi> to which they carried
both Lanterns and Faggots: Which bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Method continues to this day in the
<hi>Spanish Inquisition:</hi> these violent Spirits
being usually the cruel Lords of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
Judicatory, whose inhumane
Machins resemble the wild and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Fancies of <hi>Mezentius</hi> and <hi>Procrustes,</hi>
the unnatural Bellowings of <hi>Phalaris</hi> his
Bull, the Turkish Gaunching and Impale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Stakes, much rather than the
harmless Engines of the Gospel. And if
a Pythagorean <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
I would imagine, that there had been
a transmigration of the Souls of these
<hi>Dominicans</hi> into the Bodies of some late
<hi>Presbyterians;</hi> one egg, or Fish, not being
found liker to another, than is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance



<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100258:109"/>
of some of these Incendiaries:
on which account, one of their abortive Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
hath (in one of his Pamphlets) not
unfitly termed their <hi>Covenant, Taht great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of Blood;</hi> whereby he verifies
that common Observation, <hi>Omnis Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
persequitur suum Ordinem.</hi> But seeing
the <hi>Dominicans</hi> were nothing else but the
Emissaries of those Masters who pretend to
be S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successors, and in their fierce
Anger, and cruel Rage, have cut off
more than the Ears of many who were
much more innocent than that Servant of
the high Priest; Therefore I cannot forget
to take notice, in this Place, of another
great Abuse committed by some Popes;
For the <hi>Croysade</hi> (which was at first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to rescue the Holy <hi>Sepulchre</hi> from
the Possession of Infidels; to which great
Undertaking many Myriads of Christians
were animated by the preaching and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of S. <hi>Bernard:</hi>) was so perverted
from that Primary pious Institution, that
it was employed to the utter Extirpation
of many thousands of the simple and
harmless Inhabitants of the Mountains of
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Provence.</hi> Such is the
Affectation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops to



<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100258:109"/>
wear the Livery of that Scarlet-coloured
Beast.</p>
               <p>But the bright <hi>Olybian Flames</hi> of the
Primitive Church (which were not <hi>Ignes
comburentes, sed lambentes:</hi>) hated, with
a perfect Hatred, those Sanguinary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
as may appear from the Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of S. <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> who (as
<hi>Sulpitius Sev.</hi> reports) refused to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with <hi>Ithasius</hi> and <hi>Idacius,</hi> two
Spanish Bishops, because they did prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
unto Death some of the <hi>Priscillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi>
and that before the Tyrant <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi>
(though it cannot be denyed, but
that they were detestable Hereticks,
even <hi>Manichaei Redivivi,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but half Christians.) So great was
the Aversion of these truly Evangelical
Spirits, from Shedding of Blood, even in
the Cause of God.</p>
               <p>Yea more than so: so great was the
Antipathy that S. <hi>Martin</hi> had conceived
against such violent Courses, that when
he was informed, the Tyrant had impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd
some Military Tribunes to go into
<hi>Spain,</hi> &amp; there to depopulate the Country,
&amp; pillage the goods of all those who would



<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100258:110"/>
not conform, he immediately went to
that Emperour, and freely told him,
That this pretended Zeal was not kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by a Coal from the Altar of God,
but rather an infernal Fire bred in the
Breasts of some furious Bishops, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the Venome of that old Red
Dragon, the natural Feuel thereof: the
Event whereof could be no other, than
that of a furious Tempest, or overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Inundation, which bears down all
before it, and puts no Difference betwixt
the Good and the Bad, Old or Young,
Male or Female, but sweeps away all
promiscuously: or like unto a number of
ravenous Wolves let loose upon a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of harmless and naked Animals,
which have not the Faculty to discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
betwixt the mangy Sheep and those
which are sound in the Flock; So it
should fare with those defenceless Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
if an Hostile Army should invade
a peaceable People, living securely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Fear or Apprehension of such a
sudden Deluge; Friends and Foes, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox
and Orthodox, Conformist and
Non-Conformist, would be all overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alike: the insolent Souldier having no



<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100258:110"/>
other Eyes to discern (but what Nature
hath given to all living Creatures;) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Faith of an Heretick, and the
Orthodox, save only by their Paleness
and Garb. So that they who are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to Rapine, almost from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancies,
if they found rich Moveables,
and easily transportable to their own
Countries, whether the Owners were
rich in the Faith, or not, they would not
concern themselves with that nice Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
But, as it was said of the dayes of
<hi>Caligula,</hi> That it was then Crime enough
to be rich; so all should be Fish that
should come in their Net: so impartial
would these rude Souldiers be. And
the Emperour would be so far from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
his End, that it would rather
harden these deluded People to persist in
their Non-Conformity; they looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves as <hi>Martyrs</hi> (at least <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors</hi>)
for their imaginary Faith: the
most ignorant among them being at least
so intelligent, as to understand, that this
is not the peaceable Method of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
to proselyte any to the Christian
Faith, but point blank contrary thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
By which (truly zealous) Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,



<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100258:111"/>
this Devout man at last diverted
the Tyrant from that most cruel Design.</p>
               <p>But, in fine, I shall remit them to the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Consideration of the State and Practice
of the Primitive Church, when the Civil
Magistrate was no Christian, but a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that way, whose Concurrence they
could not expect to their Discipline, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a violent Opposition thereunto. And
if any of them seemed to put to their help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hand, it was not any Love to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the Church, but <hi>Ragione del'
Stato,</hi> as the Italians phrase it; Thus the
Emperour <hi>Aurelianus</hi> did drive away <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Samosatenus,</hi> that Arch-heretick, and
Bishop, from <hi>Antioch;</hi> but it was out of
no Principle of Respect to the Church
that he did so, (for he was accounted one
of the <hi>Persecuting Emperours;</hi>) but from
Reason of State, because that proud He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
was a great Incendiary in that
City. Let therefore the present Church
imitate that excellent Pattern of the
Primitive, before the Halcyonian day of
the great <hi>Constantine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if <hi>(in ordine ad Spiritualia)</hi> they
will needs make their Address to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Magistrate, for the Coercion of



<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100258:111"/>
Delinquents, I wish it were rather in the
matter of gross Scandal, contumaciously
persever'd in, notwithstanding of the
highest Censures of the Church inflicted
upon them; than of the Sentiments of
the Judgment which proceed not the
length of unwarrantable Practices. For
they who are incorrigibly profane are
more overawed by the Terror of man,
than by the Fear of God; and much more
by the Temporal Sword of the Criminal
Judge, than by the Spiritual Sword of
the Church; for habitual Practical Atheists
may (without breach of Charity) be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
to be such in Speculation. I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
instance the Profanation of the Lord's
Day by Salmon-Fishing; there being a
vile Pack of brain-sick Hereticks in this
Land, who allow the Practice of it. I
am indeed far from pleading for a Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical
Sabbath in this Church; But for
any who are called Christians to be so
employed in the time of God's Solemn
Worship, must needs be very odious in
the Sight of Heaven, and exceedingly
scandalous in the Eyes of all those who are
devoted to a Religious Service. Neither
find we any such Irregularities tolerated



<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100258:112"/>
in any Christian Church, which passeth
not under the name of Barbarous; no,
not in <hi>Geneva,</hi> or <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> I know
certainly, that this Insolency hath been
represented, both privately and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to the chiefest Governours of this
Church; and they obtested, to implore
the Assistance of his Majesties Secret
Councel, in order to the effectual Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of that Scandal, as being so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flective
upon the present Government:
but I fear, it hath not yet been done,
for there is neither Bruit nor Fruit of
that Address.</p>
               <p>But if the Governours of our Church
desire to avoid those bitter Sarcasmes, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
cura teipsum; &amp; Turpe est Doctori</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>De ingratis etiam ingrati queruntur:
qui non ardet, non accendit: Si vis me fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
&amp;c. Which (in plain English) import
that we should wash our own Mouths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we apply Gargarisms to others; Or
(to use our Saviour's Phrase) <hi>pull out the
Beam, before thou espy the Mote;</hi> then let
them have a special Care, not to be
found Profaners of the Lord's Day them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Which Scandal' they ought to
shun the more solicitously, because it was



<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100258:112"/>
one of the Rocks on which their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
did split; if we may believe the
verbal Assertion of many living Witnesses,
and that which a late learned Writer hath
consign'd in print: Which Reflection
should serve, at least, as a <hi>Pharos,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all Shipwracks of that nature for
the future. But how this Beacon hath
been observed, may be perceived from
the ensuing little Story. A Bedal of
a Country-Church being questioned,
not long agoe, before a Country-Session,
for bringing home a Burden of Flax on
the Lord's Day, made this Apology for
himself, That not many Days before,
there had been a Bishop in that Village,
who in his Return from the North,
(where he had been visiting his aged
Father, of the same Order with himself;)
lodged all Night in the Minister's House,
though the Incumbent was not at home;
and (not staying to supply that Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
travelled many Miles that Day of
his Removal, which was the Lord's Day,
with a great Baggage-Horse in his Train,
whose Burden was far above the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Flax he had brought home;
Whence he inferr'd, That he thought



<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100258:113"/>
the Bishops had brought such Carriages
in Fashion on the Lord's Day, and that
he might lawfully imitate them who were
the Fathers and Lights of the Church.
From which blunt, but true, Story, (for
the poor door-keeper was censured in
Publick, for all his imaginary Authentick
Apology.) I shall also deduce this Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
That all Church-men should be
as vigilant as Dragons, over their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
in the World, that they give
not the least Offence unto any; (that
Stumbling-block occasioning the most
dangerous Fall, which is laid by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent
deportment of an Ecclesiastick.)
The Plurality of men being more enclined
to live by Examples than by Rules, the
former being much more obvious to Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian
heads than the latter, besides it
hath a secret Magnetical Virtue, like the
Loadstone it attracts by a Power of which
we can give no Account. Yea such is the
perverseness of humane Nature, since that
woful Lapse of our first Parents, that
the generality of men are more prone to
follow Evil, than to imitate that which
is Good.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:100258:113"/>
But, that we may shut up this Point,
I shall add no more to the Prosecution of
Delinquents <hi>in Foro Ecclesiastico,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this Wish, That the Governours of
our Church do not (by their applying
violent Corrosives to some who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to Error, and too great Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to others who are Scandalous,) give
occasion unto any, of applying to them
that usual Observation concerning the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, That she punisheth more
severely the Violaters of her own Laws,
than the Transgressors of the unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Laws of God. I cannot deny, but
that it doth exceedingly grate my Spirit,
to hear the Adversaries of our Church
upbraid the present Government with
a Connivence at some Scandals, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That it was not so in the Time of
their <hi>Covenant,</hi> (for so they term that
Rebellious Combination against Church
and State:) and that <hi>Presbytery</hi> was a
better Bulwark against Error and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness,
than <hi>Episcopacy;</hi> I fail not
indeed to tell them, that it must needs
have been a very precious Rampart which
was cemented with the Blood of Kings;
and that I could give them an account



<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100258:114"/>
of many Tyrants (both in regard of Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
and Domination) who made very
good Laws, and put them severely in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution;
For, <hi>Ex malis moribus bonae ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untur
Leges.</hi> Yet I wish from my very Soul,
That our Church (as it is now Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
did in Piety, Charity, and Purity
(both as to Errour and Prophaneness)
outvie all the Sects and Conventicles in
the World.</p>

be Apostates from our Religion, to Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerism,

be observed to be destitute of that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

to a pannick fear, and void of
zeal for the Glory of God, through Want
of the Virtue of active Fortitude; so that
they are many times afraid of their own
shadows. And it was upon the account
of that destitution, that the Primitive

               </p>
               <p>Now the Courage of a Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
imports such a Magnanimity
that excludes Pusillanimity on the one
hand, and Temerity on the other; that
<hi>foelix temeritas</hi> (which, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
attended the Actions of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the Great) being unsutable in a
Church-man, who ought alwayes to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Affairs with discretion; For
Christian Prudence admits of the Sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Serpent, in conjunction with
the Harmlesness of the Dove. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Virtue in an Ecclesiastick,
must also shut out that Volatile Salt
which is observed in some who pretend
to Greatness of Spirit, and should be



<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100258:117"/>
reduc'd to such a Fixation that amounts
to an immoveable Constancy in that which
(after mature deliberation) hath once been
well resolved upon, in conformity to that
Advice of Judicious <hi>Salust. Antequam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipias
Consulta.—ubi Consulueris maturè,
facto opus est.</hi> But that Fixation must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come the length of a <hi>Caput Mortuum;</hi>
For, as a faint-hearted Creature is easily
frighted by the Audacious; so an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
wavering Spirit is, with no less
facility, imposed and wrought upon by
the Crafty.</p>
               <p>That Character of <hi>Socrates; Semper
eodem incedebat vul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>u;</hi> and that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's
Motto, <hi>Semper idem,</hi> are decent
Epithetes in a Church-man. As the

that <hi>Elogium, That the Sun might be

Noble</hi> Athenian <hi>from the Path of Iustice;</hi>
So the inviolable Resolution of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
to adhere unto the Truth, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that deserved <hi>Encomium, Sedem po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiùs

less than a Syllable (even the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of one Letter into the Churches



<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100258:117"/>
Creed,) would have composed the
Difference betwixt the <hi>Orthodox</hi> and
<hi>Arrians,</hi> and have procured eternal
Peace to the Christian World, all the
Years of the Reign of the Emperours
<hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valens:</hi> and that (in all
probability) much more effectually, than
the Nine disparate Creeds Penned by the
<hi>Arrians,</hi> during the Reign of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
But they adhered closely to the
Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and did choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to cast themselves upon the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, than to consent to the
least Alteration; they perceiving that
the substitution of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
did not only pervert the Sence, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate
the Authority of that great Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod;
but that it did totally invalidate
its Determination for <hi>Consubstantiality.</hi>
For the Orthodox considered, that as
<hi>Wisdom is alwaies justified of her own
Children;</hi> So that Wisdom which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
from above, is first pure, then
peaceable; And that <hi>Optabilius est Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
pace impiâ, &amp; à Deo distrahente.</hi>
But I greatly fear that there are too
many in this Iron Age so flexible,



<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100258:118"/>
that they would Cause to renounce, not
only any Letter of the Alphabet, but
also all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Consonants, and <hi>Sela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonian</hi>
Words, yea, both Α, and Ω, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they willingly abandoned their Seats,
they being Willows, and not Oaks:
Which was given as the reason, by an
old Courtier, why he stood (but I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
not uprightly) in favour, during
all the Twenty four Years of Bloody
War betwixt the <hi>Red Rose</hi> and the <hi>White:</hi>
such persons having a <hi>Versatile Ingenium</hi>
(as was said of <hi>Cato</hi> the Elder) which
can <hi>uti foro, &amp; servire Scenae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a prudent Resolution with a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
Constancy, in a Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
will not fail to animate all the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
within his Jurisdiction, to exercise
Church-Discipline impartially, without
any fear of finding their own subordinate
Authority baffled in the matter of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals,
when Scandalous persons provoke
from their Award to the Bishops Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
which is too frequently practis'd in
this Age. But if (in lieu of strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
they perceive their Superiours
palpably weakening their hands, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving
too long, and indulging too



<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100258:118"/>
much unto some Delinquents, it will give
occasion, even to those who cannot but
approve the form of Government, to
wish that they had never seen such Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
who regard not the Glory of
God, or the Good of his Church, nor the
Credit of their own Office, nor the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of their Clergy; and that they are
too like unto K. <hi>Saul,</hi> given rather for a
Curse, than a Blessing unto the People of
God: All <hi>Laodicean</hi> Bishops, and all who
(as the Satyr said) blow hot and cold with
one mouth, being hateful in the sight of
God, and odious in the eyes of those
who have a pure zeal for the Glory of
God, and the Good of his Church; for
<hi>Corruptio optimi est pessima.</hi> Yet I doubt
not, but that this free Remonstrance
(though made by the most Conform of the
Clergy,) shall verifie that of the Royal
Prophet, <hi>Tange montes, &amp; fumigabunt;</hi>
which by some of the old Fathers is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to these rancorous Vapors which
barefac'd Truth exhales from some Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of worldly Dignity. And from
these little partial Policies (which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
too rankly of a timorous sinful



<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100258:119"/>
Compliance:) Judicious Spectators will
take occasion to compare them unto <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop's</hi>
Dog, who would neither do good,
nor let good be done; and to the <hi>Crimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Tartars,</hi> who will not suffer the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
to manure a parcel of fertile ground
interjacent betwixt them, and that part
of the Ancient <hi>Scythia Europaea,</hi> neither
will they be at the pains to cultivate it
themselves. I deny not, but <hi>Pax cum
hominibus, &amp; Bellum cum vitiis,</hi> is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Christian Maxim; But sure I am,
<hi>Pax cum hominibus &amp; vitiis,</hi> is an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
Conjuncture.</p>
               <p>But the impartial execution of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
hath also a Train of many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Advantages following after it;
For all the Cardinal Vertues do evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and eminently appear therein: And it
is an imitation of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of
our Great Master; as also the best Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to perswade all Ranks of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to comply with their Admonitions,
and to submit enirely and cheerfully to
the Yoke of Discipline, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their Rulers to be no Respecters
of Persons, and that their Justice is so



<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100258:119"/>
far blind, as not to put any difference
(in their Censures) betwixt the Noble
and the Ignoble, the Rich and the Poor.
But if any Byass be perceived towards
the Left Hand of Secular Interest, unby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed
persons will be apt to resemble
those Canons whereby they pretend to
be regulated, unto Spiders Webs, (as
one compared <hi>Solon</hi>'s Laws;) which catch
the lesser Insects, but the greater ones
pass through them Scot-free. It was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Consideration of the unmallea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
impartiality of a Prelat, which prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
that Great Emperor <hi>Theodosius</hi> to
say, <hi>That he knew no Bishop but</hi> Ambrose.
There is but little fear, in this byassed
Age of the World, of the violation of
that Antique Precept, <hi>Ye sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

a poor man in his Cause;</hi> but the
Reverse thereof is too frequently trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed,
it being an old Complaint
<q>Dat veniam Corvis, vexat Censura Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbas.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another Advantage of the impartial
Execution of Discipline, is, a great
Conformity to the Method of the



<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100258:120"/>
Primitive Church. And sure if the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
practice of many disused Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary
Canons were retrived into this Age,
it would resemble the Face and Garb of
the Ancient Christian Church, much
more than it doth. Me thinks, it cannot
but be a matter of great admiration
unto any that is acquainted with the
Primitive History, to find (even before
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire turn'd Christian;)
such a Crowd of <hi>Penitents,</hi> especially the
<hi>Lapsi,</hi> willingly offering themselves to
undergo the severest Penances enjoined
by those Ancient Canons, which were
so strict and diuturnal, that many of them
required many years appearance in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth
and Ashes, before they were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished;
the Church-Guides wanting the
<hi>Brachium Saeculare</hi> to second their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
and many times meeting with much
opposition therefrom. Neither had the
<hi>Penitents</hi> any Temporal Hopes or Fears
to induce them, but only a firm belief of
the Future Rewards and Punishments of
another World. The Principal Canons
which contain a Platform of that Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Austere Discipline, and which do
enjoin an impartial Execution of Church-Censures



<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100258:120"/>
upon all Delinquents without
respect of persons, shall be subjoin'd at
the period of this Article. I shall only
here take notice of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the
Primitive Fathers; For in some Cases,
these Disciplinarian Canons permitted a
great Latitude to the Governours of the
Church, to dispence with the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
or rigorous execution of them, upon the
account of Humanity, Charity, Prudence,
and Compassion, especially towards those
who were in danger to be swallow'd up
of too much Grief, or to be absorpted in
the Gulf of Death, before they were
reconciled to the Church by fulfilling
the whole Canonical time of Penance.
This Discretion is recommended in the
11th. Canon of that great Council of
<hi>Nice:</hi> And the reason of this Remission of
the Rigour of the Law in some Cases is
expressed in general, by the 7th. Canon
of the XI<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Council of <hi>Toledo;</hi> where we
have these very Words; <hi>Ecclesiarum
Rectoribus discretio esse debet, ne per in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditam
&amp; indiscretam Disciplinam,
subeant Homicidii nolam.</hi> And the 12th
Canon of the same Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> may



<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100258:121"/>
be termed a Commentary upon that 11th
of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> Now this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
of Penance (which was nothing
else, but a Dispensation with the Rigour
of the Canon, upon Prudential and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Motives,) being a great Favour
granted by the <hi>Poenitentiary,</hi> or Spiritual
Guide to the Publick or Private <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi>
it was fitly termed by the Primitive
Church, an <hi>Indulgence;</hi> Which Word in
the later Ages was grossely abused by the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, in the matter of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory;</hi>
and the unlawful Gain which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded
from that Doctrine, reckoned
upon as one of the Three Spiritual Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the Temporal <hi>Intrado</hi> of the
Popes of Rome.</p>
               <p>But whether this Politick Invention did
contribute more to the Avarice, or Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Hierarchy, can hardly be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
But sure I am, the Primitive Fathers
knew no such Lucrative Doctrine: And
if they could have heard <hi>Ticelius,</hi> with
the rest of his <hi>Dominican</hi> Pardon-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
promulgating that most Scandalous
Sale of Indulgences in <hi>Germany,</hi> (where,
for a little Money, they promised in the
Pope's Name, That the Living should



<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100258:121"/>
be preserved from the Flames of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and the Dead immediately extrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out of them;) they would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
have concluded, That these <hi>Praeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
came from Hell, to publish that Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal
Doctrine, of which we find <hi>ne</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>quidem,</hi> in all the authentick Decrees of
the most ancient Bishops of <hi>Rome:</hi> Yea
to him that readeth the <hi>Decretals,</hi> it may
plainly appear, That an <hi>Indulgence</hi> is,
an Absolution from Penance imposed
in <hi>Confession</hi> only; which was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of that Learned Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi>
after he had once and again conferr'd
with <hi>M. Luther</hi> at <hi>Ausburg;</hi> the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that great Cardinal being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologated
by that ingenuous (but mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
deluded by his Cardinals) Pope
<hi>Adrian</hi> the 6th, who was also a great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and had written on that Subject long
before <hi>Luther</hi> thought to handle it. As
for the <hi>Aera</hi> of that unhandsome way of
gaining money; It was certainly posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to the 11th <hi>Century,</hi> and did not
commence, till <hi>Vrban</hi> the second, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
granted a plenary Indulgence and
Remission of all Sins to whosoever made
War in the Holy Land, to regain



<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100258:122"/>
the Sepulchre of Christ out of the Hands
of the <hi>Mahumetans;</hi> which was imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his Successors for some hundreds
of years; Some of which granted it to
those who maintain'd a Souldier, in case
they could not go to war themselves in
Person: and after, in Progress of time,
the same Indulgences were given for the
taking of Arms against those that obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (at which
we hinted in another Article,) although
they were also Christians; and for the
most part, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inite Exactions were made,
under these Pretences; all which (or the
greater part) were applyed to baser Ends
and Uses, than was pretended. But it
is high time to crave pardon for this
brief polemical Digression, and I shall
speedily shut up this Article with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to one or two Objections.</p>
               <p>Peradventure some are ready to say,
it's impossible to retrive that Primitive
Pattern unto this Age, unless it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
(whereof there is but little hope,)
unto that intense Contrition, and Zeal,
Faith, Hope, Charity, Humility, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Temperance, which abounded
in the Infant Christian Church. Yea,



<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100258:122"/>
more than so, There were many Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
in the Primitive times, (such as the
<hi>Novations, Donatists, Miletians,</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferians.</hi>)
and some Hereticks, (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the <hi>Montanists,</hi> called otherwise <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphrygians,</hi>)
who, with a malicious vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy,
watched for the halting of the
Orthodox; which made them bestirr
themselves the more vigorously against
Delinquents; and with a seeming Severity,
lest these watchful Dragons should up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
them with too much Lenity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Answer;</hi> It is a matter of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grett
to all the true Lovers of <hi>Sion,</hi> that
these Christian Vertues are at the best
practised among us in too remiss a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
And it should be the Endeavour of
all Christians to come up to the length of
that grand Exemplar; for we have Souls
to be saved or lost, as well as they; and
there is no less Obligation lying upon us
to glorifie God, than was on them. And
if every one who professeth that Holy
Calling, would in his own Sphere move
aright through Divine Grace, we needed
not doubt, but that Golden Age would,
in a great part, be brought back to the
Church, and that we should anticipate



<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100258:123"/>
that blessed <hi>Millenium</hi> which was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the most ancient Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
before the Consummation of the
World. To which Purpose the most
Learned <hi>M. Mede</hi> applyes the Doctrine
of the ancient <hi>Chiliasts,</hi> and vindicates
the Sectators of <hi>Papias,</hi> from the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of S. <hi>Hierom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the other Objection; It is but
too evident, that we have but too many
Hereticks and Schismaticks living amongst
us, whose <hi>Lyncaean</hi> Eyes are as mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously

The Practice of holy Bishops being the

before we subjoyn any of their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

I shall give a brief hint of some

the Memory of the judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;

                  <p>The first is of <hi>Maris</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
a blind Bishop, yet he fought not

               <p>WHatever Bombast Epithets others
give unto them, Let all Bishops
when they Converse and salute one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>viva voce,</hi> or by writing, use no
other Compellation than that of <hi>Brethren,</hi>
which is most consonant unto the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Pattern; all Christians then living
as Brethren, and denominating one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
under that notion of <hi>Fraternity;</hi>
(which word was much used in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
of the Church: and from it the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
also took occasion to traduce our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.)
But none used it more than the
Ministers of the Gospel, whether Bishops
or Presbyters; it being (as <hi>Baronius</hi> that
great Annalist hath well observed;) the



<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100258:125"/>
most usual Compellation of all Bishops
among themselves, where there was a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Age, or no great disproportion.
But when any of the Order, who had
stepped in upon a decrepit old age (call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Latines, <hi>Aetas Capularis,</hi> and
<hi>Silicernium:</hi>) did converse with one of
the same Order much younger than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he usually called him <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>vice
versâ,</hi> the younger termed the elder <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
(though none of them were so
young, but that fourty Winters (at least)
had snowed upon their Heads; yea, very
few Presbyters were Ordained in these
Times of Persecution, whose Pulse had
not beaten twice twenty years:) To
which, if some late Criticks had well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
they would have made Use of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Argument to repudiate the pretended
<hi>Areopagite,</hi> (as there want not some solid
reasons to do the feat,) than his impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
in calling <hi>Timothy,</hi> Son, at the Close
of his Book, <hi>Of Ecclesiastical Hierarchy;</hi>
though (say they) the said <hi>Timothy</hi> was
equal to him, (if not his Superiour) in
Piety, Doctrine, and Authority, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bishops of famous Churches, and <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
(where <hi>Timothy</hi> Govern'd) rather a



<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100258:126"/>
Mother-Church than <hi>Athens;</hi> and that it
was the General Custom of the Primitive
Church, for Bishops to call one another
<hi>Brethren:</hi> But this is a meer Fallacy, <hi>à



dicto secundum quid, ad dictum simpliciter;</hi>
For in respect of Age, he might have
called him <hi>Son,</hi> though in many other
things he had been his Superiour; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we find, more than a thousand years
after that time, (when Christian Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and Humility were much rarer in
the World,) that <hi>Ioseph</hi> Patriarch of
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> flatly refused the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
thereof, (whose, almost desperate,
Affairs, in that Conjuncture required as
great Complyance with the Latin Church,
as Conscience could possibly permit,) to
prostitute himself to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
by giving him the usual Adorations of
the occidental Church at that time; and
plainly told him, that if <hi>Eugenius</hi> the
4th (by whose Influence the Councel
of <hi>Florence</hi> was celebrated, which was
first assembled at <hi>Ferrara:</hi>) were a man
much elder than himself, he would call
him <hi>Father;</hi> if but of equal years, he
would term him <hi>Brother;</hi> if much youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
he would style him <hi>Son,</hi> without the

                  </gap>east mention of his pretended Title of
<hi>Holiness.</hi> And this was all the Compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Obeysance could be obtained
from that peremptory Patriarch.</p>
               <p>It were also desireable, That all our
Bishops took Place among themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Age; (excepting the
<hi>Metropolitan</hi> or <hi>Primate,</hi> who is constant
<hi>Praeses</hi> of that Sacred Colledge, and who
usually in the Primitive Church was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
above the rest, not only in all lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Qualifications, but also in respect
of Age.) For in doing so, they would
not only imitate the Sons of that great
Patriarch <hi>Iacob,</hi> but they would shew
themselves humbly obsequious to many
ancient Canons, which appoint the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency
of Bishops among themselves,
to be, at least, conform to the <hi>Aera</hi> of
their present Dignity (of which we shall
give an account at the end of this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;)
it being a most indecent Spectacle,
(and that which in the City of <hi>Sparta</hi>
would have appear'd a very ridiculous
Pageantry:) to see a Reverend old man
treading upon the Heels of one who
might have been his Grand-child, and
yet of that same Order with himself.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:100258:127"/>
But whether young or old (if they
be once of the Order) there is all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the World, that all of them should
be interested in all the material Concerns
thereof. Time was, when there were no
such peculiar Precincts in this Church,
which are now termed <hi>Dioceses;</hi> but all
of that Sacred Order Governed this
Church <hi>Communi-consilio &amp; Suffragio,</hi> and
therefore were denominated <hi>Episcopi Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum,</hi>
in general: And without Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
all Bishops and Presbyters, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonically
Elected and Ordained, are,
<hi>Iure Divino,</hi> Organical Members of the
Catholick Church, (as is sufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
by M. <hi>Hudson,</hi> and divers
others:) though we should prescind
from all Limitations of Diocesan and
Parochial Churches; which restrictive
Boundaries were only determined <hi>Iure
Humano: (Damasus</hi> and <hi>Platina</hi> testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>P. Evaristus, primus in urbe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
divisit Titulos Presbyteris.</hi>) For, if
this most reasonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> correspondence,
and good Understanding were observed
amongst all the Bishops of a National
Church, there should be no occasion
given unto any of that Order, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret



<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100258:127"/>
that they are seldom call'd to
give their Advice in the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Affairs of the Church; far less
their Consent required to the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them. Nor should they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
that when their Assistance is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
they are us'd much worse than
the <hi>Pedarii Senatores</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> the
point-blank contrary being put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
to that which the Plurality
had resolved upon; as if they were not
the Edifiers of <hi>Sion,</hi> but the Builders
of <hi>Babel,</hi> and understood not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Language. Which Slight put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Bishops, may a little alleviate the
Neglect of Presbyters; For,
<q>Solamen miseries, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But I would humbly tender my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the Governours of our Church,
not to use such singular Methods, and
dis-joynted Counsels; lest they give
occasion unto intelligent Persons, for
to resemble them unto <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
of <hi>France,</hi> of whom it was said,
<hi>That he carried all his Councel about with



<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100258:128"/>
him upon one horse.</hi> And <hi>Philip de Commines,</hi>
that excellent Historian, observes it to
have been the cause of the final Ruin,
and fatal end of that King's Rival,
<hi>Charles the Warlike,</hi> That he harkened
to no Counsel, save that of his own.
Perhaps some of these Leading-men have
not only the Vanity of <hi>Themistocles</hi> the
<hi>Athenian</hi> General, who dispatch'd all the
important Concerns of his Office, the last
day of his Abode in the City (as <hi>Plutarch</hi>
reports in the History of his Life;) but
also the ambition to be thought no less
sufficient than that <hi>Perpetual Dictator,</hi>
whose great Parts did cast such a dark
shadow upon his insignificant Colleague
in the Consulship, that they, who in
mockery did calculate the <hi>Fasti Consula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
design'd that Year thus; <hi>Iulio &amp; Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sare

so <hi>sharp,</hi> I hope they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
there is some acuteness in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the Wise <hi>Man, In the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Councellors there is Safety;</hi> and
some sence in that old Maxim, <hi>Plus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100258:128"/>
                  <hi>Vis Consilii expers, mole ruit suâ.</hi> For they
who will not give ear to the Advice of
any other man, (be he never so godly
and Learned) must needs be such Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niators,
as <hi>Iamblicus</hi> out of <hi>Aristotle</hi>
speaks of, who imagine themselves a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
sort of <hi>Rationals,</hi> betwixt God and
Man. Yet these Fantastical <hi>Semidii,</hi> shall
not only dye like men, but they have
good reason to fear, that there shall be
no such King found as <hi>David</hi> was, to
follow the Bier, and to Lament over
them thus; <hi>Dyed these Generals of the
Ten Tribes as Fool dieth?</hi> Nay, on the
contrary, they may apprehend the Fate
of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> that wicked King of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
who departed <hi>Not being desir'd; i.e.</hi> None
seriously affecting the prolongation of
that Life, which was so useless and noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the World. And let them remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that there is scarce any Ancient
Councel (if ever they did read them;)
whether General or Provincial, (so that
we need not amass Citations to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;)
but Ordains every <hi>Metropolitan</hi>
to Assemble a Councel of his Comprovin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials
once every year at least, that with
common Advice and Consent they may



<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100258:129"/>
resolve on those things which concern
the Good of that Church, at whose Helm
Providence hath placed them.</p>
               <p>And it is very observable, That there
have been some in the World, who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
dream'd of an <gap reason="foreign">

(as if these Fantastick Deities did
emulate one of the Names of the true
God, which is <hi>Schaddai,</hi>) yet have been
led by the Nose by some Sycophantine
Creatures of their own; which sons of
<hi>Ptolomee Ceraun.</hi> and <hi>Campobasso,</hi> will not
fail (when occasion serves) to cut the
Throats of their deluded Patrons. But
whatever Success their Subterranean At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
may have, that Ecclesiastick must
needs be too prodigal of his Fame, who is
surrounded with such disingenuous Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
that cast so dark a Shadow upon him,
which proves not only a great Scandal
to the Church, but also a very great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon his own Judgment and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
For (as <hi>Constantius Chlorus</hi> said
well) <hi>He who is not faithful unto God, can
never be faithful unto man.</hi> It was an old
saying,
<q>Nulla fides pietasve viris qui Castra se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuntur.</q>

I wish there be no ground to apply this to

and that none of them may be found like
to that perfidious <hi>Grecian Lysander,</hi> who
vaunted of himself, That, as some men
cheated young Children with a little dose
of Sweet Junkets, so he used to Trepan
men with Oaths. And it is beyond all
doubt, that they must needs be men of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
Consciences, and who would make
no bones of falsifying their own Oaths for
a little Worldly Interest, who endeavour
to perswade a Metropolitan Councel to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

<q>Ille Crucem sceleris pretium tulit, hic
Diadema.</q>
Which Honourable Elevation is too apt a
Temptation to pave the way in corrupt
Nature unto inveterate Knavery, when it
is observed, That early Villany is prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in Youth, and hath the hap to be
Crown'd in old Age; unless it be such a
Mock-Diadem wherewith an Ambitious
Nobleman was once Stigmatized in this
Land. To which unhappy Advancement
and ominous Elevation, as the <hi>Causa de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibilis,</hi>
(together with that Curse which
usually attends such Weather-cocks,) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny



<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100258:132"/>
are apt to impute the Non-pursuance
of the true Ends of this present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the re-establishment thereof on
sure Foundations; that Proverb being too
often verified, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>i.e.
Mali principii, malus exitus:</hi> and Errours <hi>in
prima concoctione</hi> are most dangerous. For,
Sir <hi>Iohn Presbyter</hi> is scarce yet warned to
Remove from his Usurped Possession, save
only, that in lieu of a Presbyterian Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,
we now have a Presbyterian Bishop,
invested with a new Title, and larger Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues.</p>
               <p>And what greater Demonstration need
we of it than this, That some Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Preachers, and Ministers too, are Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
by the sole Authority of some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
to enjoy the <hi>Officium &amp; Beneficium</hi>
of those Churches wherein they have been
Bellows of <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Sedition:</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet acknowledged any Church-Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
higher than their Kirk-Session,
since the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment
of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Which is a sufficient evidence, that
<hi>simile simili gaudet,</hi> and <hi>Birds of one feather
flock together.</hi> For if there were not such
Bigots to cajole the <hi>Populace,</hi> the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
of this Land would soon crumble
away to nothing.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:100258:133"/>
Another evidence of the Continuance
of their doting upon their Darling <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
is, Their Design to depress (as much
as possibly they can) those of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Clergy, who have been constantly
Loyal to Church and State. Who (in his
right Wits) would imagine, when any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
See, Theological Chair, or Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of a College is vacant, but that they
would be ready <hi>(secundum vires Inventa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii)</hi>
to prefer unto those Vacancies, a
well-qualified Person, who would be fast
to their Government, upon the account
of his Loyal Principles? But we see the
contrary practis'd; Their old associates
in that Hellish Combination must be the
only men of whom they are fond; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they embrace <hi>Ixion's</hi> Cloud instead of
<hi>Iuno,</hi> and verifie the common Proverb,
<hi>Quos Iupiter vult perdere, illos dementat:</hi>
and <hi>Qui sibi nequam, cui bonus?</hi> which joyn
issue with that of <hi>Homer,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Talis est hominum Terrestrium mens,</l>
                     <l>Qualem quotidie ducit Pater Virorumque
Deorumque.</l>
                  </q>
But—<hi>aliquisque malo fuit usus in illo.</hi>



                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:100258:133"/>
For (these being the inveterate <hi>Socii Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi>)
they are sure they will never up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
them, either directly or indirectly,
with their former Immoralities; For, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere
debet omni vitio, qui in alterum dicere
paratus est.</hi> And if any of them should
prove such bold Adventurers, they have
this recriminating Repartee in readiness,
for such shameless Upbraiders, <hi>Quamvis
dignus essem hac Contumeliâ, indignus tu qui
diceres tamen;</hi> or that other, which is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
thereto, <hi>Loripedem rectus irrideat, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopem
albus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is a matter of Lamentation, that
their Endeavours of Depression have prov'd
too successful. (though,
<q>Nascitur indignè per quem denascitur alter.)</q>
For, (suppose we had lived the Life of
<hi>Nestor</hi>) none could remember, that ever
they saw this Holy Function under so
much Obloquy and Contempt, as it hath
been these few years past. For, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a man have something else to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him than the Dignity of his Office,
(though it is most Sacred, and should ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Exercisers of it every way invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable:)
yet it is no <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to protect



<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100258:134"/>
him from the Scoffings, and scurrile Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the Profane; nor from the
Undervaluings of those who pretend to
some Shadow of Civility and Religion.
Yet I should wish, (in behalf of the Church)
That, what is grated from the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
were at least, cemented with the
Center. But alack! we find there is such
an unhappy Conjuncture in this Affair,
that there is too perfect a Resemblance
thereof, unto <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Dream, of which
we read, <hi>That the lean and ill-favoured
Kine did eat up the first seven fat Kine,
yet it could not be known that they had eaten
them up; for they were still lean and ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
as at the Beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that we may put a Period to this
grating Article; I do firmly believe, That
if his Gracious Majesty had been well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
of those deplorable Inconveniences,
He would have chosen rather to have sent
down some English Doctors to have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
us <hi>in prima instantia,</hi> than have
permitted any of those <hi>Willy-wisps</hi> to
jump into these empty Chairs; our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Church
being such a fertile Soil, that
it could easily spare a Charitable Antidote
against the Famine of another; (though,
to speak Truth, it is a kind of <hi>Nazareth</hi>



                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:100258:134"/>
to our wildest Fanaticks; for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
foresee, that any Good shall come
from thence.) Yea, I am con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ident, if
our own <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had been search'd with
Light Candles, as many, who have been
constantly Loyal, (and have suffered
much too upon that account;) would
have been found to be <hi>Pares Negotio,</hi>
who are inferiour to these late <hi>Daema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi>
in nothing that is truly good, and
much superiour to them all in real Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.
Yea it is the Opinion of many judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Persons, That some leading Secular
Subjects, whose Hearts were not well
disposed towards the Government, had
a hand in the Advancement of such;
that through their sides (which were too
patent to Reproaches) this sacred Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might be easily wounded: their
feeble Arms not being able to susslaminate
that Burden, they conjectured that the
weight thereof would make them faint at
last, and so permit that celestial Load to
fall to the Ground, before an <hi>Hercules</hi> could
be found to support it with his Shoulders.</p>
               <p>But as for those who longed for the
Reestabliment of that ancient Government
upon lasting Foundations; and cordially
wished to see all that Dirt of Obloquie



<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100258:135"/>
and Contempt, which had been thrown
in the Face of that Primitive Regiment,
and sullied it for half an Age, so wiped
off, that it might shine with a greater Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre
than before: these well-wishers know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that outward Esteem and Reputation
is the same to great Persons (especially of
the Clergy) which the Skin is unto the
Fruit: For, though it be but a Slight
and Delicate Cover, yet without it, the
Fruit will presently dis-colour, and rot.
Sure it would never have entered into
the minds of those real Friends of the
Church, that no better Expedient could
be found to appease a raging Sea, and to
procure <hi>Halcyonian</hi> Seasons unto that
Storm-beaten (and almost Shipwrack'd)
Vessel, than to invert the Story of <hi>Ionah</hi>
by placing those runnagate Prophets at
the Helm of the Church; the more dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
and auspicious Pilots being, in the
mean time, thrown over Board, into a
Sea of Confusion and contempt, like to
the scattered Limbs of Innocent <hi>Absyrtus,</hi>
and all for that end to retard the just Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of a Criminal <hi>Medea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, seeing it hath been the unhappy
Fate of this Church, that such Persons
have become the Steer-Masters of that



<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100258:135"/>
fluctuating <hi>Ark;</hi> yet true Repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> hath said) <hi>Optima Tabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
post Naufragium;</hi> I should wish, that
there had been a day of Solemn Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appointed, wherein these <hi>Fugitive
Lapsi,</hi> might have given Glory to God,
by confessing before all his People, (and
that from deep Conviction too) a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Sense of their former Schismatical
and Seditious Courses. Which <hi>Exomolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesis</hi>
(in my humble Judgment) should
have been found more justifiable, and
much more edifying too, than to attest
the <hi>Searcher of all hearts,</hi> That their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
did still approve that persecuted
Way, even then when they were preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and acting with all their Might
against it: whereby they detected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
either to have been Hypocrites all
that time (than which <hi>Heart, and a Heart</hi>
nothing is more odious in the Sight of
that God who delights in Uprightness:)
or at least, that they would have others
to repute them such.</p>
               <p>For, I deny not the truth of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim,
<hi>Ne pudeat ad meliora transire,</hi> the
meaning whereof, as to the present case,
is this; That these Malefactors should not
be asham'd to repent of their former Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness,



<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100258:136"/>
and to learn more Candour and
Christian Ingenuity for the future. But,
I fear, that many of those who were <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tei</hi>
before the year 1660, if there come a
new Revolution, (which, as long as I
breath, I shall every day pray God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,)
would easily become <hi>Vertumni:</hi>
And that the canting Language of a bold
Usurper, would cast them into a new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxysm
of their old <hi>Vertigo;</hi> so that they
should again become the <hi>Ecebolii</hi> of their
Age.</p>

               <p>THIS Article concerns only those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
who are Chancellours of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities:
And I wish they look upon
that Honourable Prerogative, as a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
part of their Province; having a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Care, that the respective Houses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
to their Charge be well Governed,
by causing exact Discipline to be observed
in them, and edifying Doctrine alwayes
taught, even all the Learned Languages,
and Liberal Arts, if there be competent
Maintenance settled for these several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
or which may be provided by a
right improvement of the old Revenues,
and the encouragement of pious Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
(who are <hi>in bonis</hi>) to make some Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Donations for that effect.</p>
               <p>And let them regard all Professours im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially,
by hugging them all (as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Father) with an equal Paternal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
provided they be men of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
Learning, Prudence, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
joyn'd with a faithful Sufficiency
to exercise their respective Functions sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
and diligently. And, above all,



<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100258:137"/>
that they be Persons of Loyal Principles,
both in reference to Church and State:
as also, peaceably disposed, and averse from
intrinsecal Factions. As for these <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,</hi>
who (like the Seditious in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>)
are still jarring within, when they
should be opposing the Common Enemy
from without, let such be speedily turned
out, lest that Brood of the Viper at last
tear out the very Bowels of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But, seeing the Education of Youth, at
their first appearance upon the University-Theatre,
is immediately intrusted to the
care of the Professours of Philosophy;
Let not these Masters be permitted to be
vain in their Conversation or Apparel;
(as if they were School-Boys themselves,
who needed to be tutor'd, and have not
as yet attain'd to that measure of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as to govern themselves aright:)
but let them be ordered to be patterns of
Piety, Gravity, Sobriety, and all kind of
Temperance, to Young ones; that they
may edifie them both by their Example
and Doctrine.</p>
               <p>And let them be careful to teach Youths
the most Solid Parts of Philosophy; <hi>viz.</hi>
The most useful part of <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Logicks,



<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100258:137"/>
(which was his greatest Talent wherein
his strength did lye, and whereby he did
merit most from the World:) Remitting
the vain pursuit of these Aëreal Notions
concerning <hi>Vniversale, Ens rationis, &amp;c.</hi> to
Brain-sick Creatures, whose <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> it is,
<hi>Festucas legere,</hi> and chief Employment,
<hi>Nugas &amp; quisquilias prosequi.</hi> Let them be
also taught somewhat of the <hi>Physicks, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks,</hi>
and <hi>Metaphysicks:</hi> But, I humbly
suppose, <hi>Moral Philosophy</hi> may be more
exactly learned from the <hi>Platonists</hi> and
<hi>Stoicks,</hi> than from <hi>Aristotle's Ethicks; viz.</hi>
The Books of <hi>Plato, Hierocles, Plotinus,
Epictetus, Simplicius, Antoninus, Arian, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,
Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch:</hi> But seeing
Christians are to call in Auxiliaries from
such, there is no question but <hi>Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi>
his <hi>Secundae Secundae</hi> would be very
useful in this Affair. And, I should wish,
that the most Learned, Solid, and Discreet
Philosophers of an University, or Nation,
were employed, not only to draw up an
exact <hi>Systeme</hi> of Moral Philosophy, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of Natural, Collected from <hi>Des Cartes,
Gassendus,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English Virtuosi,</hi>
not forgetting the Learned Works of Sir
<hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> (whose profound Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Wit gave the first Rise to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern



<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100258:138"/>
Experimental Philosophy:) especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
his <hi>Natural History</hi> and <hi>Novum Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi>
yea, his <hi>Advancement</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi>
his <hi>History of Winds,</hi> and <hi>The Prolongation

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> such a Design. But, as that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme
should be very material, so it ought
to be succinct, like to that brief (but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent)
Epitome, composed, as some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
by M. <hi>Arnold,</hi> and term'd <hi>Ars cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandi,</hi>
which is a notable Summary of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.
Such a Systeme should serve, at least,
as a Text, both to Masters and Scholars;
a little Latitude being indulg'd to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
to Paraphrase on that Diuturnal
<hi>Ephemerides.</hi> But let not capricious Brains
presume to set forth a new Philosophical
Almanack every year, with a design to put
the former out of Date, till a new Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
re-enjoyn it.</p>
               <p>But, above all, (in destitution of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Professour of the Mathematicks)
Let every Master of Philosophy Teach
his Scholars every Year some of the most
useful Species of that excellent Science;
<hi>viz. Arithmetick, Geometry, Geography,</hi>
and <hi>Astronomy,</hi> which will be found infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more useful, than these <hi>Operosae nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gae,</hi>
taught heretofore in those Places;



<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100258:138"/>
which have no better Effect, than to stuff
the Brain, like to a Bubble of Water, or
a blown Bladder; and which directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles
those delicious Viands wherewith
Necromancers pretend to feed their Guests,
but when they go away, they find their
Maws as empty, as when they began that
imaginary Feast. So that when these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
Youths come to Commence <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Arts,</hi> their Instructors may say of
them, (though not with a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
<hi>Accipiamus pecuniam, &amp;c.</hi> And
(without any humble Modesty to be their
Prompter) they may say of themselves,
(with as much truth at least as <hi>Socrates,</hi>
when he was pronounced by the Oracle,
to be the wisest man in the World) <hi>This
I know; That I know nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, that with Secular Learning they
may drink in the first Milk of Piety, from
the Breasts of that <hi>Alma Mater,</hi> Let the
Principles of Christian Religion be early
instilled into the Minds of young ones;
that, Being seasonably taught to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
their Creator in the Dayes of their
Youth, they may not forget him in their
old Age, nor be forsaken by him; For
<q>Quo semel est imbuta, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>



                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:100258:139"/>
For that end, let such a Book as <hi>H. Grotius</hi>
his excellent little Treatise <hi>De veritate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionis
Christianae</hi> (which, without any
Hyperbole, is worth it's weight in the
purest Gold,) be so inculcated into their
Memories, that they may, not only have
it all by heart, but also throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it. As also that notable <hi>Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
of Christian Offices, call'd, <hi>The whole
Duty of man,</hi> composed by an unknown
Author: or the <hi>Practical Catechism</hi> of the
Learned <hi>D. Hammond;</hi> or that of <hi>D. Vsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
of <hi>Armach,</hi> Primate of <hi>Ireland:</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they be first <hi>jure Latii donati;</hi> For
all the Communications of the <hi>Lycaeum</hi>
ought to be in the Dialect of old <hi>Rome,</hi> or
that of the City of <hi>Minerva;</hi> that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
Memories of the young ones
may be habituated to those Learned Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
               <p>And how necessary the good Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Youth is, may appear from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Observation of the great <hi>Lo. Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi>
That, <hi>The great Multiplication of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
upon humane Nature resis on Societies
well ordered and disciplin'd: For Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
and good Governments nourish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
grown, but do not much mend the Seeds.</hi>
Whence he infers, That there ought to be



<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100258:139"/>
a most exquisite <hi>Delectus</hi> of the Tutors
of Youth. And (if we give Faith to <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
Seneca,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch;</hi>) they should
be as well qualified Persons as are light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be found in the World. And sure,
this solicitous Choice of the Educators of
Youth was never more necessary, than in
this Iron Age, wherein many have been
so marred in their Education by Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
and Disloyal Principles, too early
instilled into them, that this foundering
in the Feet hath caused Convulsive Fits,
and unsteady Motions in them, as long as
they lived. But if the Universities of
this Land were blessed with such Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
as we have above described; it is
most probable, that from those Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Knowledge, and fruitful Nurseries
of the Muses, eminent Plants might blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
in Process of Time, to the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
either of Church or State, as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence shall determine their
Lot.</p>
               <p>And, seeing these Stations of Philosophy
are the best Seminaries this Nation enjoys,
for perfecting Young men in order to that
Sacred Function; Therefore let not these
Professours Monopolize them for many
Yeares, by nestling their Families therein,



<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100258:140"/>
as if the Foundator had designed nothing
else, but the Provision of their Posterity.
But let them be enjoyned to live in a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libate
State, that with less Distraction they
may prosecute their Studies: and, after
the expiration of five, or six years at most,
let them give place to others; that, by
such a happy Circulation, all the Corners
of the Land may reap the Advantages of
that Foundation.</p>
               <p>It were (in my humble judgment) a
very desirable Blessing to this Nation;
That His Gracious Majesty, with his Great
Councel, would be pleased to allow some
few Months Cess, to be stocked, for the
Inhancing of the Revenues of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities;
especially of the Primar, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Philosophy; that the Head of the
House may have a competent and constant
Annual <hi>Intrado,</hi> to live Splendidly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the dignity of his Station.
And this opening of Free-Schools to the
Professours of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> (without any
expectation of the least acknowledgment
from any Scholar, and that under the pain
of immediate Extrusion from the respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
House where they Officiate:) would
not only obviate those Scandalous Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
which too frequently occurr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt



<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100258:140"/>
Masters of different Colleges, in the
Exercise of their beggarly Trade of Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
Scholars, but would also be
found the best Expedient to Retrive
<hi>(jure postliminii)</hi> that ancient University-Discipline,
which hath been obnoxious to
such a woful Lapse, that it hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
the Fate of an immemorial Dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.
For, if Avarice and Self-interest
did not prevail with too many, over the
Qualifications and Proficiency of those
intrusted to their Charge, yea, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate
the Publick Reputation of the
House where they live, many who are
now <hi>ambabus ulnis amplexi,</hi> would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
incapable to enter within the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophick
Porch, as being deprehended
foundered in the feet, and frequently
Criminal in breaking <hi>Priscian</hi>'s Head.
And not a few who have already entred
within these Gates of the Muses, would
either be found unworthy to remain there,
upon the account of Vitiosity of Life,
(which is contagious to the rest of the
Society:) or be Extruded for Non-profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
in their Studies: Degradation to
a lower Class, till they caught hold of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva's</hi>
Train, would certainly be the least
of their Censure. Neither should the



<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100258:141"/>
Subject, by this wished for Contribution,
be a Loser; but (as we use to speak) he
should prove a Gainer at the long run;
for, what is now expended by them,
would, by this Method of Free-Schools,
preserve no less, (if not much more) to
their Posterity, over and above their more
laudable Education: For Persons of all
Ranks in this Nation, usually sending
their Sons to be taught in some Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
(which is highly Commendable, and
much applauded beyond Seas:) they are,
(according to their Quality) oblig'd to
Dispense proportionable Salaries to their
Instructors; Yea, they who have the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
of them, are necessitated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
these <hi>Honoraria,</hi> seeing the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of some Foundations are so small a
pittance, that they are disproportionable
to that <hi>Victus</hi> and <hi>Amictus</hi> which the most
Sober Person stands in need of; Not to
speak of the fuel of Charity and Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and those Materials for buying of
Books, and Entertainment of a Servant to
wait upon them, which the Dignity of
that Office calls for. All which require
much more money, than the Poverty of
some Foundations can afford.</p>
               <p>

                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:100258:141"/>
And let this Chancellour of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
contribute his utmost endeavours
that the Provost, or Head of the College,
(usually term'd <hi>Primar</hi>) excell, not only
in the above expressed Qualities, (that
he may deservedly be termed the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi>
of that Incorporation) but that also
he be Doctor of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Canon Law; that he may be in
a capacity to conferr that Dignity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the most Learned of the Clergy,
when their <hi>Ordinary</hi> shall call them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
that many may be encouraged to
merit that Degree; Honour being the
best Nursing-Mother of Arts, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mover
of Sciences.—But, let those who
are, not only Pious, Learned, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
but also known to have deserved
well of the Church, by their constant
Loyalty, be invited in the first place, to
the participation of that Honourable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
For it is well enough known, that
Bishops are not in a capacity to promote
all such to the most eminent Dignity of
the Church; (it were indeed a pitiful
Nation, if the number of those did not
far surpass that of the Episcopal Sees,
suppose the Church were so happy, as to
have the absolute Disposal of them:)



<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100258:142"/>
therefore it were but just and fit, that such
deserving Persons were (at least) rewarded
with those minute and inexpensive Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
as a Character of the Churches spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Favour towards them.</p>
               <p>But seeing the Royal Family (the sole
Fountain of Honour) hath gratified our
Universities with that honourable Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
and Faculty, To dispense that Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of Learning to the Worthy; let
the Chancellours have a special Care, that
the same be not abused and disgrac'd, by
the Promotion of the Unworthy: For,
if old Knaves, Epicures, Buffoons, and
grosse Ignorants, who have not a mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of good Latin, nor the art to form a
right Syllogism, (not to speak of those
<hi>Doctorculi Dominarum:</hi>) be advanced to
that Honour; it may provoke his Majesty
to recall that Privilege from Universities
which hath been so vilified. And, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his Majesty be not informed of such
an Abuse, yet it will infallibly render
that Honour despicable, for an Age at least.
We read indeed of that famous <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
that by his undertaking the sordid
Office of a <hi>Scavenger,</hi> he rendered that
(which was formerly accounted the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,)
the most honourable in his City:



<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100258:142"/>
But I fear, these pitiful <hi>Doctorculi</hi> shall be
found the Reverse of the Story, and the
<hi>Antipodes</hi> of that gallant <hi>Theban;</hi> for the
Degree will never dignifie them, but they
will vilifie the Honour: And it shall fare
with it in the end, as it did with the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of S. <hi>Michael</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which was at
first reputed very honourable, but when
two or three unworthy Persons were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto that <hi>Fraternity,</hi> no man of
any worth would look after it any more,
nor regard it in the least, who had any
Regard to his Reputation. Thus <hi>Thuan</hi>
in the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Book of his excellent History,
introduceth a French Gentleman, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Purpose, of that <hi>Order</hi> of
<hi>Knighthood,</hi> (which was first instituted by
<hi>Lewis</hi> the 11th, and at last abolished by
K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Third.) <hi>Torquem Conchiliatum
postquam indignis promiscuè communicari coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisset,
non jam esse fortium virorum Insigne,
sed omnium bestiarum Collare.</hi> And it shall
be the Fate of those ignorant <hi>Knights Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
to be compared unto that vain <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Ventidius Bassus,</hi> of whom it was
said, That he spoiled a good <hi>Muleter,</hi>
and made but a bad <hi>Consul.</hi> But I shall
shut up this Paragraph with the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some very Judicious Persons;



<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100258:143"/>
That the Principal Reason wherefore <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
hath so few painted Shields in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is, because the Sons of <hi>Minerva</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
so little Encouragement from their
Superiours; the much easier Arts of Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and implicit Obedience, being
more valued, than the wearisom Trade
of Evisceration; (it being no unfit <hi>Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>
of the Word <hi>Minerva, quod nervos im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minuat;</hi>
and of <hi>Pallas, quod pallidos red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat.</hi>)
For there is much Sence in that of
the Poet,
<q>Sint Maecenates, non deerunt Flacce Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And some in this too,

                     <l>Praemia si tollas?</l>
                  </q>
Time was (even among the Heathen)
that Learning was a sufficient Protection
against Tyranny; Winess <hi>Antonius Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vir,</hi>
who, when <hi>Varro</hi> (his Enemy, and
of a contrary Faction) was listed for
Death; thus gallantly superscrib'd his

of the House and Family of <hi>Pindarus,</hi>
in that total Eversion, and Epidemical
Destruction of the <hi>Thebans;</hi> because he
was the Renowned Prince of the <hi>Lyrick

him. For, though this <hi>Domitian, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,</hi>

Examples of this nature, yet ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
have (almost innumerable) Instances

            <p>BEing stirred in Spirit, I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
(yet with all due submission)
to tender these Nineteen <hi>Proposals</hi> unto
the serious Consideration of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of this Church. And sure I am,
the Conscionable Practice of them, would
be found more Honourable, and much
more useful, both to Church and State,
than were the <hi>Propositions</hi> of an equal
number, which by the mischievous
<hi>Long Parliament,</hi> were sent after that
Glorious Martyr, King <hi>Charles</hi> the first,
whom they had first driven from his
Royal Residence, by most insolent Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.</p>
            <p>If the Author had not resolved, long
ago, never to raise his insignificant Name
out of the Dust of Oblivion, by giving
the Press the Trouble thereof, (which is
already too much oppress'd with a Shoal
of others,) he would not have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd
to owne those <hi>Lines</hi> before all the
World, with as much Confidence, and



<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100258:145"/>
more Innocency too, than <hi>Heliodorus</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoused
his ingenious <hi>Romance:</hi> But this
ingenuous Boldness had never its Rise
from a Reflection upon the Eloquence of
these few Sheets; for he is throughly
convinced, that his blunt Style is very far
from the Art of Oratory, and his Genius
no less removed from any Affectation of
the Flowers of Rhetorick: but it is the
Sense of these sad Truths, and good
Wishes, embosom'd in those <hi>Lines,</hi> which
did create that Confidence; with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
also which his Conscience calls <hi>Zeal,</hi>
for the Glory of God, and good of his
Church: Wherein he hath endeavoured
to trace the Footsteps of <hi>Salvian,</hi> (that
zealous Bishop of <hi>Marseils,</hi> who, in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel

<hi>Non verba, sed res; non Ornamenta, sed

ruthful Lamentations for the great Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy
of the British Church.</p>
            <p>And, if his heart deceive him not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much, he may confidently appeal to
the Searcher of all Hearts, That it was
no Dissatisfaction with the present Form
of Church-Government, which prompted



<pb n="273" facs="tcp:100258:145"/>
him to pen this Pamphlet; but rather a
sincere Affection thereunto, and an ardent
Desire to see the Glory of the second Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
transcend the Splendour of the First;
which he would account a kind of Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical
Vision upon Earth; and wisheth not
to live one minute Longer, than to behold
this Church once in Possession of that Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:
For, since he was blessed with any Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
he had alwayes a Veneration
for that mode of Government, as having (in
the greater Lines thereof) a greater Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
to the Primitive Regiment, than any
other Form coyn'd in the Mint-house of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva:</hi>
And if the most ancient <hi>Records</hi> of
Church-History, and Fathers of the Church
be made Judges in the matter, (which, in
matters of Fact, must needs be; unless any
be so Enthysiastick as to expect Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
<hi>de novo,</hi> to determine this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie.)
I suppose the little Antiquity
which he hath read, would engage him to
pawn his natural Life upon the Probation
of that Assertion, against all the Paralogisms
of <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Salmasius</hi> (the two great
Genevian Champions) and the more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

Now, though the Author hath hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
tendered this Advice unto all of that
Sacred Order; yet he would not have
any to imagine, that he undervalues any
of them, or that he values all alike: He
knows, that there were some two or three
Stars among them, of the First Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
now Eclipsed from us; (the dark
Curtain of Death being drawn divers
years ago, betwixt them and this World:)
who, (when they were in it) were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon by all honest men, as Persons of
approved Integrity, and who suffered
much for Conscience-sake, even Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
Banishment, and Confiscation of
their Goods; yea, some of them hardly
escap'd with their Lives: that Hellish
Conspiracy amongst us being somewhat
of kin to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Confederacy,
whose Insolent Cruelty did so oppress the
poor <hi>Trojans,</hi> that it gave occasion to the
Poet to say,
<q>Vna salus victis, nullam sperare salutem.</q>
Yea, the Author being honoured with
the intimate acquaintance of some that
are alive, he doth highly esteem them, as



<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100258:146"/>
very good men; and so they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
reputed when they were but Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
yet, either the want of a resolute
Courage in them, (the privation whereof
is a great <hi>Remora</hi> to great Actions:) or
the destitution of Concurrence in others,
(it being the Fate of those who are une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
yoked, when one presseth forward,
another draweth back; hath nullified
their best Wishes, and annihilated their
good Endeavours; Nothing being more
contrary, nor a greater Adversary to a
direct and strait motion, than that which
is Oblique and Retrograde; and nothing
more repugnant to a natural <hi>Conamen,</hi>
than a Peristaltick Motion. Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable
Disappointment cannot but give
occasion to those well-meaning men, to
take up that Lamentation of Pope <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
the Sixth, (whose best motions were
retarded, and absolutely hindred by his
unhappy Colleagues in the Consistory:)
who said to his familiar and trusty Friends,
<hi>That the condition of Popes was miserable;
seeing it was plain, that they could not do
good, though they desired and endeavoured
to do it.</hi> (which Obstacles are set down
at length by <hi>Padre Paulo,</hi> or <hi>Pietro Saovè



<pb n="276" facs="tcp:100258:147"/>
Polano,</hi> in his excellent History of the
Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi>) From which Story <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus
Cervinus</hi> (another Pope, of 22 days
standing) took occasion to say, <hi>Non vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
se, quomodo qui fastigium hoc altissimum te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerent,
saluti suae consulere possint.</hi> Yea,
they will be apt to joyn Issue in the End,
with the Protestation of that dying Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<hi>Faelix si non Imperassem:</hi> and <hi>multum
incola fuit anima mea.</hi> And from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficacious
Employment, many Spectators
(who see not these hidden Impediments,
and secret Back-sprents;) are ready to
take Occasion to pass this uncharitable Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
on those good men; That their best
Wishes are but <hi>Velleities;</hi> and that they
have marred good Presbyters, and made but
ill Bishops: And, in fine, will apply to them
the Observation of the Historian concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Emperour <hi>Galba;</hi> That all men
thought him Worthy to reign, before he
did Design to Reign: the same being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

to this Remonstrance: For he is so far

that <hi>He who walks uprightly,

a Story, which one of my Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate



<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100258:150"/>
Acquaintance told me; (whom I
have very good Reason to believe:)
About the time of the Reestablishment of
this Government, a Motion was made
to him, by one that was a great Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
then, That he would procure unto
him a Call to ascend one of those empty
Chairs. But he answered to this Purpose
(having first returned a homely Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Thanks to that generous Person,
for that immerited Favour:) In such a
Conjuncture, when that Tabernacle is to
be reared up again, which (not many
Years agoe) was thrown down with so
much Malice, Obloquie, and Contempt,
so that the very Name of the Government
was odious to a Multitude of bigotted
People, who demolished that ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
with no less aversation of it, than
the Government of the <hi>Decemviri</hi> was at
<hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Thirty Tyrants</hi> of <hi>Athens;</hi>
and who would be no less averse from the
Restitution of it, than those of Old <hi>Rome</hi>
were, from the Restauration of the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Tarquins;</hi> or those of <hi>Syracusa,</hi> from
the Redress of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the younger; or
the People of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the second: That these



<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100258:150"/>
vile Aspersions which had been thrown
upon the late Government and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
(many whereof he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
were Invidious and Groundless:)
might be speedily wiped off; and that
Apostolick Regiment restored to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
Beauty and Vigour; there was an
indispensible Necessity, that the New
Governours should be endued with Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Charity, Learning, Humility, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Patience; with self-denyal, Gravity,
Hospitality, and all the Cardinal Vertues,
far above the ordinary Level; that by
the extraordinary and admirable Lustre
of their Parts, they might again restore
this Church to its former Splendour.
Which being a very <hi>Impar Congressus</hi> for
him, who was <hi>juvenis omni modo,</hi> and the
unfittest of ten thousand; therefore he
neither could, nor would undertake that
Office, in such a ticklish Conjuncture. I
have not the Ambition (subjoyned he)
to say with <hi>Cato</hi> the elder, That I had rather
it were enquired, Wherefore <hi>Cato</hi> hath no
<hi>Statua,</hi> than, wherefore he hath one; but
sure I am, it would be a matter of no less
Complacency to me, than it was to that
noble <hi>Spartan,</hi> to hear, that there be, not



<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100258:151"/>
only 300, but also 3000 of my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
more capable of those sublime Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
than my poor self. Yet, (as he
further added) if I thought my self <hi>Par Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotio,</hi>
I bless Heaven for it, that I have the
same Sentiment that possessed the Soul of
dying S. <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Tours,</hi> who in his last
Agony cryed out, <hi>Domine, si adhuc sim
utilis tuae Ecclesiae, non recuso Laborem;</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that Labour could be useful to the
Church: which, in this present Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
can hardly be expected. Yea, the
Reporter, being honoured with some Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
by that great man, when he was
in Private, (for, as <hi>Minutius Faelix</hi> hath
said, <hi>Amicitia aut Pares invenit, aut facit:</hi>)
he had shut up this Declinator with these
very words, <hi>quia nec possum, nec debeo,
ideo non volo,</hi> For (if there be any Truth
in that old Maxim, <hi>qui clàm vixit, bene vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xit;</hi>)
it must needs be verified in this
vertiginous and critical Age. And, sure
I am, he then spoke as he thought: and if
at any time since he entertained any
such Thoughts, God knows he had no
other Design, but to retrive again the
Apostolick Pattern into this Church as
much as possibly could be effected by



<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100258:151"/>
one moving within the Sphere of his own
Capacity. Yea suppose he had the fairest
Invitation imaginable to be elevated unto
the <hi>Solstice</hi> of Ecclesiastical Honour in this
National Church, yet he would entertain
it with no other Complacency, but this
alone, That he had now a Call from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to exercise an Art of very great Self-denial,
even to Sacrifice all his worldly
Contentment, and Enjoyments, for the
Interest of the Church, and Glory of his
heavenly Master. If S. <hi>Paulinus</hi> did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
make himself a Slave, to redeem a
poor Widow's Son from Bondage; (not
to speak of those Heathen <hi>Heroës, Codrus
Zopirus, Curtius,</hi> and the two Roman
<hi>Decii,</hi> who devoted themselves to Death
for the Good of their respective Countries:)
sure it becomes all the true Sons of the
Church (in imitation of <hi>Moses,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi>)
to devote all their dearest Interests, that
they may procure the Manumission of her
that conceiv'd them.</p>
            <p>But, lest this Pamphlet run out at the
Gate of a tedious <hi>Peroration,</hi> (as the
<hi>Cynick Philosopher</hi> said of the little City
of <hi>Mindus,</hi> with its disproportionable
Gates:) I shall therefore period it with



<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100258:152"/>
this humble <hi>Intreaty</hi> to all Ingenuous
Readers, That they be not so unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the Author, as to impute these
Lines unto a Principle of Envy or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
against the Persons of any of our
Governours, as if he had the desperate
boldness to run the hazard of that Curse
of <hi>Cham,</hi> for discovering his Father's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness:
But, let us suppose the Author
to have been basely injured by some
of them to whom he had done good
Offices, and palpably betrayed under
Trust; (though he is not so Dispirited
with the consideration of their Sublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and his own Lowness, but that he
knows, that <hi>Formica habet suam bilem,</hi>
and that the despised <hi>Scarabee</hi> aveng'd
it self on the Bird of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> though the
same is reputed King of the plumed Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals;)
yet Christianity would have
prompted him to have gone a greater
length in Self-denial than <hi>Christopher,</hi>
(who said only, <hi>If I were not a Christian,
I should be avenged:</hi>) by heaping even
coals of Fire upon the heads of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Enemies, when occasion served: And
in doing so, would have expected a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from God. Which Self-denial he



<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100258:152"/>
might have learned from some of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens;
even from the Practice of <hi>Lycurgus</hi>
and <hi>Zeno,</hi> and from the Doctrine of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi>
who hath taught us, That <hi>immane
verbum est Vltio:</hi> in which regard he
discovered himself a much better Moralist,
than that <hi>Stagyrite,</hi> who reputed Revenge
an act of Magnanimity. For when the
Author ruminates upon all these things
which fall under consideration in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to that Office, he is very apt to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that whosoever undertakes it
in this Age, becomes rather the object of
Pity than Envy; it being truly said by
the Emperour <hi>Dioclesian, Difficillimum est
rectè imperare:</hi> how much more in this
Iron Age, in which that Wish is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
unnecessary,</p>
            <q>Materiamque tuis tristem Virtutibus opta.</q>
            <p>And as for any imputation of Malice,

he would be much more ready to make

them in his behalf: Yea, (as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>

was no less useful to the State
of <hi>Rome,</hi> than <hi>Scipio Africanus;</hi> because,
as this Noble <hi>Roman</hi> did defeat the
Physical Enemies of his Countrey, so
that austere <hi>Censor</hi> did successfully Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
against the Moral Adversaries
thereof. That Apology which St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
made for his Tartness, is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Vindication of the Author; For, if
a <hi>Stylus aculeatus</hi> be allowable against
a Charge of Heresie, it is no less law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the Cause of God. For when
the Honour of the Divine Majesty, and
the Interest of his Church, are deeply
concerned, we ought to regard the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Supreme, infinitely above that
of any other Superiour; For <hi>Amicus Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,

zealous Ecclesiasticks are animated by
that notable Saying of Saint <hi>Augustine,

            </p>
            <p>But, though <hi>Tiberias</hi> (none of the
best of Emperours) used to say, <hi>In
Civitate libera, linguam, mentemque libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram
esse debere;</hi> yet sure I am, If these
<hi>Gravamina</hi> (which would amount to
the number of <hi>German</hi> ones, if they
were subdivided, and sold by Retail)
had been heard patiently in private,
they needed not have been told in
Publick; though there were never
more Provocations for all men to speak
than now, when all the Mischiefs that
other Ages did but imagine, are now
practised, and when <hi>Oppression hath
made a Wise man mad,</hi> and (in the
mean time) the <hi>dumb Asses</hi> are taught
to <hi>forbid the Madness of the Prophets.</hi>
But there being too many in the world,
who, (as <hi>Aristippus</hi> said) have their
ears in their feet, and they who are
straight, finding it very inconvenient to
stoop so low, therefore are necessitated
to take other measures of Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>Desperata ejus Principis salus est,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But perhaps it may be objected, That
it is fit, that all Papers which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for the Press, should <hi>(in prima
instantia)</hi> be presented unto those, who,
<hi>Iure eminentiae,</hi> are appointed Supervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
thereof. I shall refer it to the
Judgment of the Candid Reader, if
the Author had not good reason to
conclude, that he might spare his pains
in making such an Address, by the
strange ensuing Narration told him (not
long ago) by one who had designed
something very useful (as he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
for the Church; <hi>viz. An exact
Method of studying the Primitive Fathers,</hi>
even to the Death of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great,
whom he accounted the Last of those
Worthies; (as one called <hi>Brutus</hi> and
<hi>Cassius, Vltimi Romanorum:</hi>) though
Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> Holy <hi>Anselm,</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
<hi>Bernard,</hi> have merited eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
in the Church. Which <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi>
(if prosecuted as he intended)
he humbly conceiv'd, would be found



<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100258:154"/>
more useful for all Unbyassed Readers,
than the Treatises of <hi>Baronius, Sixtus
Senensis, Bellarmin, Possevin, Perron, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Sirmundus,</hi> and <hi>Contius,</hi> to that
purpose; or the Tractates of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgenses,</hi>
with their Epitomator <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,
Scultetus, Reinolds, Cocus, Rivet,
Blondel, and Dallee,</hi> the Popish Authors
being generally too lax (though the
four last in order are either <hi>Nasutiores,</hi>
or much more ingenuous than the rest,)
and the Reformed too strict, on that
Subject; the former discovering too
palpable a Design to buoy up a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
Cause by Supposititious Fathers,
and Spurious Books; and the latter hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much of the Critick and Satyrist
in them.</p>
            <p>The Diagram of which great Design
being presented by the Author to a
Principal Member of that Order, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the giving of his Judgment as
to the propos'd Method; And what he
concluded to be either defective or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant
therein, the Author was resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to take in very good part; (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself bound to reverence the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of his Superiours. But he did



<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100258:155"/>
meet with no other Verdict or Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
save this astonishing Answer from
such a Person; That he had no Leisure
to look after such Books, (he being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
too much with other Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:)
and that there were too many
Books already in the World. (which
hasty Censure he passed on that whereof
he had never read one Line.) Which
could not but appear very strange to any
in his right Wits, when he reflects upon
the Disposition of the Country whereof
it was spoken. We find indeed in a late
<hi>Satyrist,</hi> (who had the Spirit of his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as abundantly as any;) a Nation tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as being Epidemical, because they send
forth many <hi>Examina</hi> of the Fruit of their
Bodies into forreign Countries, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Colonies to <hi>New Plantations;</hi> but it
is the first time I have heard them
charged with the exuberant Spawn of the
fruit of their Brains. And though that
Observation concerning <hi>Africa, semper
aliquid adfert novi,</hi> may be also applyed
to this Country, yet it is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of the one or the other, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to new Books; but rather of
renewed monstruous Productions; both



<pb n="293" facs="tcp:100258:155"/>
these Countries being, in these latter Ages
of the World, sandy and barren, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Births.</p>
            <p>But, in fine, he remitted the perusal
of that Platform to another of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who was no less taken up with the
Study of Modern Politicks than himself;
yea, was become so much in Love with
that Trade, that he had put the intervall
of many German Miles and Years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
himself and his proper Charge, that
he might practice the Principles of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Art upon a fitter Scene: whereby
this ghostly Mountebank did emulate the
Sagacity of a <hi>Sharleton,</hi> as to the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
of the Erection of his Stage; all
Quak-salvers (who have the Spirit of their
base Calling) being sure to resort unto
those places where there is most Money,
and the greatest Concourse of People.</p>
            <p>The slighted Brother finding such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to be in vain, immediately call'd
to mind the Answer which that cruel
<hi>Duke de Alva</hi> gave to <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th of
<hi>France;</hi> who having demanded of him,
if he had observed that great Ecclipse of
the Sun which had lately happened;
the Duke ingenuously reply'd, <hi>That



<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100258:156"/>
he had so much adoe upon Earth, that he
could not get leisure to look up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi>
And at last concluded, that the
true Cause of their aversation (though
they were asham'd to utter it) was
that old Maxim, <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> and
<hi>Blind Men should not judge of Colours.</hi>
Yet that indiscreet Repulse proved such
a Temptation to the Author, that he
had much ado to restrain himself from
throwing those painful Papers into the
jaws of <hi>Vulcan;</hi> and hardly refrained
from crying out with <hi>Scipio Africanus,
Ingrata Patria, ne ossa quidem mea habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis:</hi>
but could not forbear the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
that Expostulation, <hi>Bone De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us!
Ad quae tempora me reservasti?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet some were more charitable to
their Intellectuals, than to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals;
And did apprehend, that the Fear
of the Expence of a <hi>Dedication,</hi> made
them so shye; wherein they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
greatly mistaken: For, as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the intention of the Author to prey
upon his Patron, (he having alwayes
hated a beggarly Dependance;) so it was
as little in his mind to shelter himself
under the Wings of such Protectors,



<pb n="295" facs="tcp:100258:156"/>
(lest that Support should prove a Staff
of Reed in the end:) that Lucubration
being design'd for a Noble Person of
much greater Worth and Eminency,
who was pleased, out of his own mouth,
to permit that Honour to the Author;
yea, more than so, who was so obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condescending, as to declare, That
he look'd upon it as a special Honour
design'd for himself: (so vast is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt a Noble and a Plebeian
Education) the Effect whereof will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in its own time: there being (as
to this great Undertaking) an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensible
necessity of complying with
that sound Advice, in reference to the
Writing of a Book judiciously, <hi>In nonum
prematur annum:</hi> And, I wish, that even
these years be found commensurable to
such a Work. For the Author of such
a Laborious Task, hath good reason to
say, as <hi>Virgil</hi> did of his Works, <hi>se versus
suos componere, ut Vrsi foetus, lambendo.</hi>
But from this supposed Misconception,
we may inferr, That none should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert
upon the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, till they be sure
of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And thus ended that Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:100258:157"/>
But if it be further Objected; That,
(howsoever those of the Order imploy
their time,) they have <hi>Chaplains</hi> whose
Province it is to Supervise the Press. For
<hi>Answer;</hi> This were indeed a pertinent
Objection, and fit Expedient, if they who
pass under that Notion, did emulate those
of that Office in <hi>England;</hi> (some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
not only merited to be Doctors of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
but have also a stock of Knowledge
little inferiour to any of the Nation:) But
with us, some have not any Servants that
go under that Denomination, (and, I wish,
in the destitution thereof, they be not
wanting to that Oeconomical Religious
Solemnity, termed <hi>Family-Worship.</hi>) And
as for those who are invested with that
Title, they are usually such pitiful, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Striplings, that they have not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
capacity to examine, to good purpose,
the most inconsiderable Catechism, far less
are they <hi>pares negotio</hi> for so great a Work,
which cost the Learned Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi>
eighteen years Study. And if any of these
Chaplains had the forehead to undertake
such <hi>Animadversions,</hi> it might be deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
said of them, <hi>velut Asinus ad Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram;</hi>
and they would be found to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble



<pb n="297" facs="tcp:100258:157"/>
               <hi>Aesop's</hi> Cock, who preferr'd the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-grain
to the precious Gemm; and
greater fools than <hi>Paris,</hi> who put a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
estimate on fading Beauty, than on
Wisdom or Power; yea, they would be
observed to run parallel to the <hi>Phrygian
Midas,</hi> who preferr'd the Pipe of <hi>Pan</hi> to
the Harp of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and got Asses Ears for
the Guerdon of his foolish Judgment:
Neither should they have any thing to
magnifie their ignorant boldness, save
that Epitaph of <hi>Phaeton,</hi> (whose Fate they
would surely undergo;)</p>
            <q>Et si non potuit, magnis tamen excidit ausis.</q>
            <p>But it is high time to end this little <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiridium,</hi>
which is swell'd to a greater
bulk than at first we design'd it; (it being
one of my greatest troubles, in study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brevity to avoid Prolixity:) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall conclude with this one Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the whole Premises.</p>
            <p>I am fully perswaded, that if our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
did cordially comply with the
fore-going Proposals, this Church (which
hath been long Militant in the most
pitiful sence,) would at last become



<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100258:158"/>
Triumphant, and should erect the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies
of its victory over its most implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Enemies; And our Bishops, being
honoured by the Almighty to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staurators
of this Church, should (in fine)
have occasion to say of it, as <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
said of <hi>Rome, Inveni lateritiam, relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo
memoream.</hi> For I have heard many
well-meaning Persons, who pass under
the Notion of Fanaticks, solemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
That if they observed our Bishops
making Conscience to perform all those
Duties which are incumbent on their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
they would be as forward as any to
hugg them in their Arms, and ready to
submit cheerfully to their Jurisdiction:
Yea more than so; That if their Morals
were intire and eminent, their moderate
Rituals would be but feeble Scar-crows,
and fearless Bug-bears to them. For when
they see any Ecclesiastick of an Holy Life,
and who sets about all the Duties of his
Calling diligently and faithfully, though
he be diametrically opposite, and point
blank contrary to their Way; yet they
inwardly reverence him, and defer no
little external Respect to him: yea, they
are apt to envy our Church the Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on



<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100258:158"/>
of him, and to say, <hi>Talis cùm sit, utinam
noster esset:</hi> And I am fully perswaded,
that this would be a more durable <hi>Enoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
than that <hi>German Interim,</hi> which was
contrived with so much Craft, by that
<hi>Triumviri</hi> of <hi>Almain, viz. Flugius, Eslebius,</hi>
and <hi>Sidonius.</hi> But this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
onely of those Fanaticks, whose
Hectick Fever hath not as yet proceeded
the length of an incurable <hi>Marasmus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The best <hi>Epiphonema</hi> I can subjoyn, as
an Epilogue to this <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> is, the
Royal Judgment of one who deserves to
be termed <hi>A Nursing-Father</hi> both to
Church and State, who hath testified of
himself, That he esteemed it his greatest
Title to be called, and his chiefest glory
to be the <hi>Desender of the Church,</hi> both in
its true Faith, and its just Fruitions;
equally abhorring <hi>Sacrilege</hi> and <hi>Apostacy.</hi>
This is that Glorious Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi>
the First, in his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, where he
expresseth himself thus: <hi>Not that I am
against the managing of this Presidency and
Authority in one man, by the joynt counsel
and consent of many Presbyters: I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to restore that, as a fit Means to avoid
those Errours, Corruptions, and Partialities,



<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100258:159"/>
which are incident to any one man; also to
avoid Tyranny, which becomes no Christian:
least of all Church-men: besides, it will be
a means to take away that burthen, and</hi> odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
<hi>of Affairs, which may lye too heavy on
one mans shoulders, as indeed I think it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
did on the Bishops here.</hi> And a little
after, in that same Section, concerning
the Difference betwixt the King and
Two Houses, in point of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
His Majesty adds this Brief,
but most Judicious Sentiment concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Church-Government;</p>
            <p>A right Episcopacy would at once satisfie
all just Desires, and Interests of good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
humble Presbyters, and sober People;
so as Church-Affairs should be managed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Tyranny, Parity, nor Popularity;
neither Bishops ejected, nor Presbyters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
nor People oppressed. <hi>Amen.</hi>
