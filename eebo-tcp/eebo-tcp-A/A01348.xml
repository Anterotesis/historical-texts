            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as negligent as though it had not per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayned to them. Therfore ſayeth Chryſt: Wo vnto yow Scrybes, and Phariſes, ye ypocrytes, which tyth mynte, anyſe and comyn, and leaue the wayghtyer matters of the law behynde: namely iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gment, mercy, and fayth. Theſe ought to haue bene done, and not to leaue the other behynde, that is, So longe as the lawe hath her courſe (as yet ſhe hath) ſo longe ye maye receaue your dewty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tythes, yee of anyſe, mynte, and comyn: but the dedes of fayth, loue, and mercy which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe requyreth of you as chefeſt maye you not leaue vndone, but rather do them afore all other. Beholde now we ther thys rebuke (which oure ſpyritualty applyeth to theyr excuſation) doth aptly ſerue to warne and to rebuke them: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge they be curſed with the aforeſade ypocrytes curſe. For they curſe and yau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>le more vpon them in theyr pulpet, that withdraw them theyr offerynge dayes, or prouent dewtyes (which notwithſton<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge God hath not graunted them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new teſtament, as he dyd in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde wyth

               <p>Yes verely I ſhal declare that vnto you by a ſymilitude or enſample: A chylde hath no perceauynge inwarde, nor ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth outwardly ony behaueoure wether he haue a ſure confidence towarde his fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther or not, vnto the tyme he is aſſayd in thys hyd fayth: But wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this chylde is ether beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or miſdealt of a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyfteth he is voyce in hys anguyſſhe, preaſſinge to his father through the myd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of his enemyes with a ſure fayth &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence to be delyuered and ſaued. Yee in his flyght &amp; haſtynge for reſcue which he ſhall ſurely optayne there, his mynde is certified that he ſhall be reſcued, and this is a greate quietneſſe of conſcience, and a ſpeciall eaſe at hys hart that hys enymyes ſhall nomore reioyce ouer him. After thys maner alſo is the matter wyth the chyldren of God: Oure hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father hath geuen vs power to
<pb facs="tcp:7128:19"/>
be y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> children of God, &amp; that through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuynge in his name, which by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commaundement is become man for vs, and hath choſen vs to be eyres w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him.

The ſauegarde &amp; quietnes of conſcience which we haue in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardly in the myddes of troubell, is a frute of the holy gooſt, ſuſtaynynge vs leſt we fall into myſbeleue or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge of God, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which oure puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t myght cauſe ryghtwell.

For God nother ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be, nor is a ſcourger or tyrant

Paul wrytinge to the Romanes in the .viii. chap. ſayeth: We haue not now recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſprete of bondage to feare ony more: but we haue receaued the ſprete of adoption, wherby we call Abba, deare fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a luſty corage &amp; a ſure faith.

               <p>Yee it is a thouſande tymes better, for Chriſtes ſaynge is: Loke what ye haue done vnto the leaſt of mine, that haue ye done vnto me.

Al that ye ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue wythout ſuch a redyneſſe of harte is not counted for an almes before the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.

De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye death with all them that can holde wyth hym, for they can not harme you, they can not mynyſſhe one heer of you. Saye hardely wyth the prophet Oſe. O death where is thy ſtynge? O hell where is thy gloriation or reioycenge
<pb facs="tcp:7128:78"/>
The death is ſwalowed vp in Chriſtes victory. And therfore is death called in ſcripture a ſlepynge more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death.

Herken how royally the reſurreccion of Chryſt is ſet forth vnto vs in ſcripture. Paul ſayeth in the .x. chap. to the Romanes.

<pb facs="tcp:7128:90"/>

For ſo much than as Chriſt beynge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trew ſede of Eua hath deſtroyed and bruſed the ſerpentes heade, that is death, wherby the ſerpent raygned myghtely vpon all mankynde: then maie ye now hardely triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe inwar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dely ſayeng: Death, where is the ſtynge? o hel where is thy glory? prayſed be god which hath geuen vs victory by Ieſu Chriſte.

Whan the lorde God had fyrſt created Adam our father, he cauſed hym to ſlepe, that out of the ſlepers ſyde he might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a lyuynge creature, namly Heua, to be a helpe vnto man (Gene. ii.) the whiche alſo he dyd. Lo how ſtraunge ſeme the workes of God to be in oure ymagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

Death of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtians is called in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a ſlepe or a peaceable reſt. Lazarus reſted in the boſome of Abraham. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the fyrſt martyr dyd ſlepe in the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, whan he was ſtoned. Is it not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that the holy gooſt doth call oure dyenge here but a ſlepe or a reſt? Steuen dyd ſlepe in the Lorde, (that is) he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted hence with a ſuete reſt and eaſe at the harte, wherin he felt no paynfulneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:7128:91"/>
at the harte as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſlepeth a naturall ſlepe, ſlepeth without ony paſſion or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. That death is not payn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full to the beleuenge, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of Chriſtes death.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Abraham to offre hys only ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Iſaac, he wente thre dayes iourney vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God, leauenge his owne vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtondynge and wyt, yeldynge himſelf wholy in the handes of God, ſo that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane ſeaſon was Iſaac dead and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: For Abraham was fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myned to offre hys ſonne vpon the hyll, which he ſawe afar of on the thyrde daye But finally whan Iſaac was neareſt vnto death, and Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drew the ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to ſmyte hym, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the ſonne who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harte of hys father, and fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered

vnto death. Where Abraham now ſawe the death of his ſonne in lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwearde, there appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the life of his ſonne: for the ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de was ſtayed by the angel, of the which he was not ware dat it ſhulde happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this enſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple alſo was Chriſt rekened dead of the whole worlde, what tyme as he laye in the graue: But on the thyrde daye he roſe agayne, ſhewenge hymſelfe alyue. This wyſe ſhall it be wyth vs. Death ſemeth to take vs wholy and put vs out of mans remembraunce: but tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall fyrſt oure lyfe appeare, accordinge as Paul ſayeth: Youre lyfe is hyd wyth Chriſt in God. Farthermore you rede that Moſes was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded Nume. xxi (whan a greate multitude of the people was ſlayne with the venymous ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, becauſe of their murmuringe agayn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſte God) to ſet vp a braſen ſerpent in a to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken, that whoſe behelde it, ſhulbe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and lyue, whiche alſo chaunched. What is the meanynge of thys? Chriſt Ieſu is ſignifyed by this braſen ſerpent, which beynge lyfted from the earth and

Thys is yt that Chriſt alſo ſayde Iohn. iii. And lyke as Moſes lyft vp the ſerpent in the wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, euen ſo muſt the ſonne of man be lyft vp, that whoſoeuer beleueth in him ſhulde not periſhe, but haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtynge lyfe. Take this figure to youre doctrine good brother. You lye here bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the ſerpentes your ſynnes, whiche haue kylled with bytynge oure forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with all their progeny: For by the enuy and venym of the deuyll is death come in the whole worlde. Wherfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde now your ſaueoure on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> croſſe: Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>holde the lyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the kynred of Iuda that hath ouercome all. Beholde this ſerpent as a ſure toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the good wil of God to you warde, &amp; ye nede not to feare death, for it geueth you lyfe. Ionas the prophet was rekened for dead, what tyme as
<pb facs="tcp:7128:93"/>
he laye thre dayes in the whals belly dead drouned: But afterwarde was he alyue againe ſhewed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Niniuytes, for he was ſuſtaineth from death by god which relyued hym agayne. By this Ionas is Chryſt alſo fygured, wytneſſynge it hys owne ſelfe in the goſpel to aſſure vs that we ſhall alſo ryſe with him agayne, yf we abyde ſtedfaſtly beleuynge vnto the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. What more aſſuraunce can ye haue of God, than that he hath not ſpared hys owne ſonne: but hath geuen hym ouer vnto death for vs, to ouercome death, &amp; to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agayne the gates of lyfe. Fynal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beholde how Chryſt declareth hys lyfe in dyenge, to ſtabyliſhe oure fayth, that we ſhulde not doubte in the lyfe tocome no not in the myddes of death. For Chryſt hangynge on the croſſe, geuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge vp hys ſpryte vnto hys father, teſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyenge with the bowenge downe of hys heade that he was euen dead: he ſhewed yet ſome tokens of lyfe that were hyd in hym, whan hys bleſſed ſyde was opened wherout ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> runnynge water and bloude Wherfore doubt not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyfe tocome: for
<pb facs="tcp:7128:93"/>
ye haue receaued a pledge of this lyfe by the loue of Chryſt, which is poured in you by the knoledge of God. Chryſt dyed and is crucifyed for oure weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, but he lyueth by the power of God. We are alſo weake with hym, and dye by reaſon of weakneſſe, but we ſhal lyue afterwarde with Chryſt by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame power of God. Searche and proue yourſelfe whether ye haue alſo thys hope, &amp; fayth in the Lorde, and in hys promiſes, which ſhall geue you hys ryghtweſneſſe for you<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re ſynnes, and lyfe for death.</p>

               <p>Yt is ſure ſo, greate myſbeleue cauſeth vs to fear hell. But knowe ye what is hell? Hell is nothynge els ſaue feare, and drede of death, and a tremblinge againſt the iudgment and ryghtwyſneſſe of God
<pb facs="tcp:7128:94"/>
The vngodly, and damned can neuer eſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cape thys death and hell, for they haue no luſt nor loue to God, whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde as a fearfull iudge, and feare hys ryghtwyſneſſe. He is ſayde to be in hell, that perceaueth wythin hymſelf how wycked and wreched he is, wherby he is enfourmed, and perſuaded the fear of death, and damnation. So that the mooſt damnation, and payne of hell, is the deſpyſynge, and blaſphemynge of God. For ſo longe as we haue no lyuely wytneſſe inwardly of the ſpryte of God, that we be the chyldren of God: ſo longe do we hate him, and can not beholde his ryghtwyſnes, ſo doth oure haynous con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience of ſynne dryue vs. By theſe afore ſayde wordes is it playne vnto you, that the hell of the vnryghtwyſe begynneth here in earth, ſeynge the worme of theyr wicked conſciencie dyeth not, and the fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of theyr wrath is not quenched. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, as the kyngdom of God is iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, peace, reſt, and godly corage: euen ſo is hel, ſynne, troubell, and raygne. In this hell was Caym, whan he fled here
<pb facs="tcp:7128:94"/>
earth no man perſuynge hym. In this hel alſo was Iudas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> traytour, &amp; abode therin to his damnation. Pether ſayeth Act. ii. that God hath rayſed vp Chryſt, looſed the ſorowes of death: for ſo much as it was impoſſible that he ſhulde be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>holden of her (that is) Chriſt hath rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs and made vs ſawe from all oure enmyes. The deuell is a puſſaunte Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and well weapened with all hys tray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, erroures, and fearfulneſſes. Math. xii. But the ſonne of God was a mygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer Lorde, which hath torne the powers of hell, for all thynges were geuen hym, in hys hande as Chryſt ſayeth. Math. xxviii. Vnto me is geuen all power, in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; in earth. Yf al thinge be geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to hym, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mynge of hell geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.

thynges preſent, nor thynges tocome, nor heyght, nor, depth, nor ony other creature ſhalbe able to ſeperate vs from the loue of God, which is in Chriſt Ieſu our lord. Chriſt ſayeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boke of pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. Lorde, out of hell haſt thou drawen my ſoule. This redemynge &amp; delyueryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of Chriſt, is happened to oure profete For as Chriſt was a conquerer of al: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſhal we alſo be ouercomers &amp; winners through him, for ſo much as we be in cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porate in hym: Before we were ſundered but now are come neare by the bloude of Chriſt: For he is become our peace he hath made vs cyteſens with the ſayntes, &amp; of the houſholde of God. Seynge we are gathered in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe of God, we haue here altogether a kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, an heretage a victory, and all ſaluation. To this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the prayer of Chriſt, which he made to the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father Iohn. xvii.

Thynke ye thys prayer is ſpoken for nought? Thynke ye God the father hath not herde his beloued ſonne in the houre of hys ſufferynge?
