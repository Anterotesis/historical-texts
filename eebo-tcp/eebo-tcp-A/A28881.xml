            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT is not any great Opinion I have of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Performance,
<pb facs="tcp:47305:4"/>
(though there are ſome who would perſwade me, that it is not altogether deſpicable) that makes me preſume to prefix your <hi>Name</hi> before it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, amongſt Men of Senſe and Learning, <hi>Truth</hi> for the moſt Part brings
<pb facs="tcp:47305:4"/>
it's own Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation along with it, and finds that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and ready Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. But the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Mankind will not reliſh any thing, that bears not in the Front ſome great and eminent Name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47305:5"/>And for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is, that I have made bold to make this <hi>Dedication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your real Worth which hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly placed you in two Eminent Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to both which you do more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour than you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from them: And the Encouragement
<pb facs="tcp:47305:5"/>
and Favour you ſhew to all Perſons of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Vertue and good Learning under your Government, ſoon determined me in the Choice of ſuch a Patron; though my ſmall Share of each of the latter, could merit neither of the former.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47305:6"/>And here, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the uſual Mode of Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I might eaſily enlarge upon ſo fair a Character; But as it is your peculiar Delight to oblige &amp; do good with all the eaſe and ſweetneſs imaginable, ſo with as little Noiſe and Oſtentation poſſible:
<pb facs="tcp:47305:6"/>
And I ſhould ſooner hope for your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and the Faults of my Book, than for ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon your Modeſty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore only add, that you would be pleaſed to accept this as a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

               <hi>Opinions of ſome Learned Men; eſpeciatly of that never too much Honoured Dr.</hi> Willis, <hi>who was One of the Greateſt Phyſitians of his and preceding Ages.

            <p>
               <hi>That then which I hope, will be an Apology for ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, is, That I have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Opinion, with no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47305:9"/>
               <hi>than an Endeavour after Truth, and have offered nothing againſt his Opinion, but plain and unprejudiced Reaſons; and though I have given Reaſon enough to prove he was mistaken in this Point, yet I muſt ever have the greatest Veneration and Eſteem for all ſuch Men of unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled Worth and Learning, and ſo candidly Ingenuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But whether this little BOOK may pretend to any Reaſon for what it offers or not, I am more encouraged to ask Your Patronage, it being approved by Men of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Learning and eminently Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, the</hi> Preſident <hi>and</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors <hi>of the</hi> College <hi>of</hi> Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47305:14"/>
to have, but a ſlight and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Knowledg of it: For if that ſmall Part we know, be compared with what we know not; all our Knowledg is but as an inviſible Speck; thoſe things to which it extends, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, if compared with that vaſt and endleſs Maſs of the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>But although that Part of the Univerſe, which in ſome Meaſure<note place="margin">Which is furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Objects too copious for our Senſes</note> lyes within the Cope of our Senſes, be ſmall and inconſiderable, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the vaſt Extent of the whole Creation; yet when we reflect on the vaſt Variety of Objects, contained within thoſe narrow Dimenſions; we
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47305:14"/>
find, and muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it very conſiderable; and ſuperabundantly furniſh'd with Matter for our Senſes to work upon.</p>
            <p>For, the Extenſion of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, as to thoſe<note place="margin">Of which at the beſt we have but an imperfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.</note> Objects, is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Limits not very ſpatious; &amp; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diligence and Induſtry of Learned Men, and the great Improvements, made in moſt Parts of Knowledg: The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Men, and the moſt profound Philoſophers muſt of neceſſity own, that of thoſe Things they know moſt, their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is very imperfect. <hi>We know but in Part,</hi> and indeed ſo ſmall a Part, that it chiefly ſeems to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47305:15"/>
inform us, more ſenſibly of our Ignorance.</p>
            <p>But ſo pleaſant and deſirable is Knowledg; and we find ſo much<note place="margin">The Purſuit of Knowledg very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable.</note> uneaſineſs in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, when once we have taſted of it; that it's impoſſible to abſtain from a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Purſuit after it at leaſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the vaſt diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt our Knowledg and Ignorance, which continually lyes in our way to diſcourage us.</p>
            <p>And as we thirſt after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to attain to<note place="margin">Eſpecially of that which is moſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious.</note> a more adequate and compleat Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of it; ſo we moſt eagerly purſue thoſe Parts of it, which we hope to underſtand
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47305:15"/>
moſt clearly, and which we expect to make a Progreſs in, with the moſt conſiderable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>Since then the Microcoſm, which is, as if it<note place="margin">There is more Reaſon to expect Truth and Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm than the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm.</note> were a Type and Epitomy of the Macrocoſm, lyes much more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the narrow Cope of our Senſes; ſince we can dive and ſearch into all, and the inmoſt Receſſes of it; and come nearer to thoſe Springs and Fountains, upon which all the Effects, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in it, depend; we have much more ſolid and firm Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to proceed upon, than in any other Parts of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy whatſoever; and may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47305:16"/>
much more reaſonably hope for Certainty and Truth; beſides the Purſuit of it, muſt needs be not only more Pleaſant, but Advantagious.</p>
            <p>And although in a Man's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſome Things<note place="margin">Where it is eaſily attained.</note> are much more apparent &amp; clear than others; yet the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, may eaſily be ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and underſtood; as is neceſſary and ſubſervient to ſhew the Uſe of them, and to what Ends they were deſigned.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, the Heat<note place="margin">The Heat of the Blood not obſcure in reſpect of it's Cauſe.</note> of the Blood is unfortunately one; but the Reaſon why it is ſo, is not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47305:16"/>
that it is leſs apparent in it ſelf, but rather the Inadvertency of thoſe that ſearched into it: If poſſible ſuch great Men, as have writ concerning it, may be guilty of ſo great a Fault, which (although otherwiſe no ſmall one) is much more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable in thoſe, whoſe more weighty Concerns take 'em of a deeper Enquiry.</p>
            <p>Since then, ſo many learned Men, and thoſe to whom Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is not leaſt obliged, for conſiderable Improvements, have writ on this Subject; I think it not only Juſtice, but alſo Reaſonable, I ſhould ſhew upon what Grounds, and for what Reaſons I have rejected their Opinions, before I take leave to propoſe my own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:47305:17"/>It would be<note place="margin">Both Antients and Moderns have differed as to the Cauſe of it.</note> needleſs to ſpend time in Informing my Reader, that both Antient and Modern Writers have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to account for it; and it would be Information to but a few; ſince none that have made any conſiderable Progreſs in Phyſick, can be ignorant of it. I ſhall only as briefly as I can, mention the Opinions of the Antients, that it may better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the more unlearned, wherein they are deficient; and then, I ſhall conſider the moſt remarkable Opinions of the Moderns, that leſs competent Judges, and young Students in Phyſick, may ſpend leſs time in convincing themſelves, how
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47305:17"/>
far they come ſhort of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Reaſon of the Heat of the Blood.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the<note place="margin">The Opinions of the Antients very Superficial and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory.</note> Ancients, who wanted thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy, that have been made of late, to direct them in their Judgments; ſome fancied that it proceeded from a <hi>Calidum innatum,</hi> or <hi>innate Heat;</hi> which was fixed and rooted in all the Parts of a Man's Body, before his Birth; and that This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Heat, by communicating it ſelf ſucceſſively to the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of the Parts, as ſoon as it was received by them: Which indeed was ſo weak and ſuperficial an Account of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47305:18"/>
it, that it rather ſerved to pleaſe the Unlearned, then to ſatisfie the Curious, and more Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Others thought, that there was a ſort of Flame lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Heart, which kindled the Blood as it paſſed through it. But Moderns having learnt by a further and a deeper Inſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mens Bodies; that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of thoſe was rather the Effect; than the Cauſe; and by frequent Diſſections, that the Heart was altogether incapable of containing ſuch a Flame, and alſo that that which they ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Pabulum</hi> of it, to be clotted Blood; they have, with ſufficient Reaſon, rejected them both. Wherefore paſſing by theſe, I ſhall proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe Modern Opinions,

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47305:19"/>
the Heat of the Blood, takes Notice; that there are three Modes or Sorts of Cauſes, by which Liquids grow Hot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, à culido ad moto,</hi> or by applying them to ſomething that is Hot; as when Water boyls over the Fire. <hi>Secondly,</hi> when Saline Corroſives mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually act upon one another, or on ſulphureous Bodies mixed with them, by an intenſe and powerful Agitation. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> when a Liquor abounding with much Spirit or Sulphur, takes Flame from ſome other Body. And in the next Paragraph, he ſays, that there are other ways of Calefaction; as Fermentation, Putrefaction, and Attrition; but the ſeare only obſervable in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47305:19"/>The Deſign<note place="margin">And that the Blood grows Hot by Accenſion.</note> of which, is, to prove, that ſince the Blood hath not any other Body applied, to communicate Heat to it; and ſince it is not impregnated with Saline Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives; but is ſufficiently ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Sulphureous Particles; and ſince Fermentation, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, and Attrition are only the Cauſes of Heat in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Bodies: It muſt needs be preſerved in a continual Heat, by Accenſion of it's Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Pabulum.</hi>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47305:20"/>
appear, that in Philoſophy, there is but one way, by which all, whether Liquid or Solid grow Hot; and if ſo, then it will follow, that whether we ſay the Blood grows Hot, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of a hot Thing to it, or Saline Corroſives; whether by Fermentation, Accenſion, or Attrition, it will be equivalent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame.</p>
            <p>To make it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident<note place="margin">Several degrees of Heat differ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Degrees of a peculiar Power to cauſe Heat.</note> then, that there is but one way, by which all Bodies grow Hot; and that to ſay, that the Heat of it proceeds from the Application of other hot Bodies, Saline Corroſives, Accenſion, Fermentation, or Attrition, is but to expreſs the ſame thing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

ways; ſince they are all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalently performed the ſame way; we are to conſider, what is the Nature of hot Bodies, and wherein their Power conſiſts; either to cauſe Heat themſelves, or to communicate that Power to others: And becauſe ſeveral remiſs Degrees of Heat, differ only in Proportion from Fire, which is the moſt intenſe; and becauſe, That is free from thoſe Masks and Clouds, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene it and our Senſes, when it is in more remiſs Degrees; the beſt way to underſtand the Reaſons of Heat, will be to conſider, wherein the eſſential Nature of Fire conſiſts.</p>

that whatever rarifies Matter, and puts it's Parts into a brisk Motion, is the cauſe of Heat. And although according to the Diverſity of Subjects, that Heat is diſperſed through, it hath different Appearances to our Senſes, and in moſt, it's Light; which, when it exiſts ſeperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is always joyned with it, 'tis obſcured by the Interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Mixture of other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet if Heat depends Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially upon the Effects, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Matter in Motion hath upon our Senſes; it is undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably true, that Heat is cauſed only one way, Remotely and Proximately, with reſpect to Matter in Motion, and the Effect it then hath upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> By puting the Parts of Matter

            <p>But, before I proceed to a further Proof of what I have aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is but one Way in Philoſophy, by which all Things grow hot; it being a Controverſy, whether Heat be actually in the Body that cauſes it; or whether Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Motion only produceth ſuch an Effect as the Senſe of Heat, upon our Senſory; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not requiſite, I ſhould here Publiſh my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, yet it is neceſſary I ſhould explain what I mean, when I ſay, that Heat is only produced one Way; or that Heat is cauſed, by putting
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47305:22"/>
the Parts of Matter into a ſwift Motion; or that Heat depends on the Effects, which rarified Matter hath upon our Senſes, when it is in Motion.</p>
            <p>But if I were here to declare my Opinion of<note place="margin">Heat is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in the Body that cauſes it, but potentially, becauſe that Body hath a power to cauſe ſuch a Senſation.</note> this Point which is ſo differently held by various Philoſophers; I ſhould ſay, that as far as I can conceive of it, Heat is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in the Body that cauſes it to be perceived, by our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but potentially; in as much as that Body hath a Power to cauſe ſuch a Senſation.</p>
            <p>And although a great many may wonder; that Fire, which cauſes Heat, ſhould not be hot
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47305:23"/>
it ſelf; yet there is as much Reaſon to believe, that it is not; as that a Sword which will cauſe Pain, is not Pain it ſelf: For thoſe who think that Fire which cauſes Heat, is Heat it ſelf; take the Cauſe for the Effect, and affirm it to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Heat being only a Senſation; and it<note place="margin">Heat is only a Senſation which is actually where there is Senſe to perceive it.</note> being impoſſible there ſhould be a Senſation, where there is no Senſe; it is impoſſible there ſhould be Heat, where there is only Fire, and no Senſe for it to work upon: For Heat is not a Mode of Matter rarified and in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but an Effect of Matter ſo modified. But, ſay they, it is impoſſible for us to think ſo;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47305:23"/>
truly, if we are not directed in our Thoughts by Reaſon we may irrationally think, that Matter in Motion, which only cauſes Heat, is Heat; but if our Reaſon proceeds upon thoſe Mediums which our Senſes furniſh us with, and certainly we can on no other, we ſhall eaſily be induced to believe, that the Cauſe is not the Effect; there being a great deal of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for us to believe ſo; though, none to the contrary.</p>
            <p>When then I ſay, that Heat is only produced one Way; I mean that there is but one Way to modify Bodies, ſo, as to make them capable of cauſing Heat; when they affect our Senſory: And when I ſay, that Heat is cauſed by putting the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47305:24"/>
Parts of Matter into Motion, I mean, that a Power of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Heat is cauſed ſo: And when I ſay, that Heat depends on the Effect, that rarified Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath upon our Senſes, I mean, it is cauſed by thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting our Senſes.</p>
            <p>And becauſe, always when I have occaſion to mention the Cauſe of Heat, it would be too much Circumlocution to ſay, the Power of cauſing Heat is produced ſo, or otherwiſe; I ſhall uſe the Word Heat, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſignify that Motion of rarified Matter, which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to cauſe Heat; and ſhall call that Motion, Heat in reſpect of the Effects which it cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:47305:24"/>But, to proceed to a further and more evident Proof; That Heat,<note place="margin">That Heat is only produced one way further proved.</note> or a Power to produce it, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſed one Way; we are to conſider, how the Motion of Particles is carryed on in all thoſe, which Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> calls, different Ways of cauſing Heat, <hi>viz. per admotum Calidi,</hi> Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Corroſives, Accenſion, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Fermentation and Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> when Water is put over the Fire, and heated <hi>per admotum Calidi,</hi> the fine Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Fire penetrating the Veſſel, are imbibed into the Water, and being fettered up, and kept from flying away, by the Parts of the Liquor, put
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47305:25"/>
them alſo into a quick Motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence proceeds a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heat. In the ſame Manner, when Saline Corroſives are mixed together, the ſubtile Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, of each, firſt begin power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to oppoſe one another; and being by that means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberated and ſtruck back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Particles of thoſe Bodies, of which they are the Effluvia, put them into Motion; and as the Motion ſo begun, grows ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more violent, ſo the Degrees of Heat become more intenſe And when a Flame is apply'd to any Sulphureous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Particles of that Flame, being forcibly agitated againſt the Sulphur, put the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of it into a brisk and ſwift Motion; and they being by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47305:25"/>
that means rarified and expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are turned into Flame. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> it cannot be deny'd, but that when any thing grows hot by Putrefaction, that heat either proceeds from elaſtick and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative Particles within, working upon one another, or from ſomething from without.</p>
            <p>Now in all theſe ways, as he is pleaſed to call them, ſince Heat is produced by the ſame Method in Philoſophy; ſo it is reaſonable to affirm, that there is but one Way, by which all Things become hot, <hi>viz.</hi> By Attrition.</p>
            <p>For Water grows hot, becauſe the Particles of Fire are mix'd<note place="margin">Viz. <hi>by putting the Parts of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Motion</hi>
               </note> with it, and put it's Parts into a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47305:26"/>
ſwift Motion: And the Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums of Corroſives, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry volatile and in a ſtrong and powerful Motion, by an Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and grinding upon one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother cauſe Heat. So alſo the Particles of Flame, by Attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on turn Sulphur into Flame: And by Motion, only not ſo intenſe, a leſs violent degree of Heat is produced in Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; ſo that in all theſe ways, Heat only proceeds from rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Matter, put into a violent Motion by Attrition; and the conſequence of that Attrition, is Fermentation.</p>
            <p>After the ſame manner, Heat is produced in ſolid Bodies: For when Flint and Steel are violently ſtruck together, the Sulphureous Particles being
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47305:26"/>
ſcattered and diſſolved by that Force, are put into a brisk and ſwift Motion.</p>
            <p>But, although from hence it appears, that all Bodies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,<note place="margin">A ſeeming Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction anſwered.</note> grow hot by being put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Motion, by an inteſtin Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſion and Attrition of Particles; and conſequently but one way: yet ſome will be apt to think, that ſince there is ſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt Water, Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Salts, and Sulphureous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; that there muſt needs be ſome difference in their way of working upon one another.</p>
            <p>To which, all that I need to ſay more, is, That though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Bodies are differently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd together; yet it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47305:27"/>
that they only operate by thoſe Particles that are in Motion, and which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Motion to each other; and one may as well ſay, that Sulphur kindled by a Flame, is made hot <hi>per admotum Calidi,</hi> as that Water is: For as Flame is apply'd to one, ſo the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed Particles of Fire are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the other.</p>
            <p>This Learned Author, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid theſe Premiſes to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh<note place="margin">His Compariſon of the Bloods Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, with Flame conſidered.</note> a Rational Hypotheſis upon; and concluding that the Blood of a Man's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, could not become hot any other way, but by Accenſion, goes on to compare the Accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Blood, with the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47305:27"/>
burning of the Flame; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as he thinks, the ſame things are requiſite, to continue both, <hi>viz. Firſt,</hi> a free and continual Acceſs of Air. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> a freſh ſupply of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Sulphureous <hi>Pabulum. Thirdly,</hi> a perpetual Avolition of fuliginous Recrements; he concludes that it muſt needs be kept hot by a continual Sort of Flame.</p>
            <p>But, he might as well ſay, that Water over a Fire, could not<note place="margin">There are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral degrees of Heat produced without viſible Flame.</note> become hot, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it was put into a Flame, as that the Maſs of Blood, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grow hot without Accenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but ſince every Body knows that hot Water is not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47305:28"/>
Flame; there is no doubt, but that Blood may be hot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Accenſion too.</p>
            <p>That to produce Heat, there is no need of a Flame to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accended, is evident; ſince there are ſeveral degrees of hot Bodies, in which no Flame at all is apparent; and even Blood it ſelf, immediately as ſoon as it is extravaſated, ſeems ſo unlikely <hi>Pabulum,</hi> for a Flame; that Water will not ſooner extinguiſh it, but to produce ſeveral degrees of Heat in Liquids, it is ſufficient the Particles of thoſe Bodies that ſo affect our Senſes, be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſwift Motion; although not into ſo high a degree as to make a Flame. So by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of two Flint-ſtones toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47305:28"/>
moderately, is produced an evident Heat: and when they are moved againſt one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother more violently, the Heat is ſtronger; and by a Colliſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yet more violent, thoſe Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Particles, that before cauſed a gentle Heat, conſtitute a Flame</p>
            <p>He ſays, that a Flame may be continued, it ſhould always have a free Acceſs of Air; for all ſublunary Fire, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Flame is compoſed of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Particles, breaking out of the combuſtible Matter; and of Nitrous Particles which always abound in the Air, and theſe Nitrous Particles, he ſays, are ſo neceſſary to the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Flame, that in the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> if the Sun does but ſhine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47305:29"/>
upon the Fire, by driving it back and diſſipating the Nitre, it extinguiſhes it: Whereas, on the contrary if it be ſupply'd with a ſufficient Quantity, it burns more clear and brisk.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it is ſo manifeſtly certain, that Fire burns brisker and<note place="margin">Nitre makes up no part of the Flame.</note> fiercer, when it hath a ſufficient quantity of Nitre about it, than when it hath not; that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it would be to deny what is ſenſibly apparent; but yet it does not therefore follow, that Nitre makes up part of the Flame: For Sulphur and Oyl will flame as violently in the <hi>Summer</hi> as in the <hi>Winter,</hi> though Wood and Coal, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47305:29"/>
other combuſtible Matter will not.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if Nitre made any Part of the Flame, though it might readily mix with the outward ſide of it, I would willingly underſtand, how when a Flame is two or three yards Diameter, it is poſſible for it to be mixed with the middle of the Flame; which we perceive is more violent than the Borders of it, where Nitre abounds.</p>
            <p>But, the Reaſon why Flame will not burn without ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree<note place="margin">The Nitrous parts of the Air promote Flame by keeping i'ts Matter from diſperſing too ſoon.</note> of Nitre, is not that it makes up any Part of it, but becauſe the Particles of Fire are in ſo very ſwift and violent a Motion,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47305:30"/>
that they would immediately be diſperſed and fly away; if the Nitrous Particles of the Air did not prevent them, by cloſing round about them, and keeping them up to a Center; by which means Flame is not only made of a longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, but it's Power of heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us is more violent; thoſe moving Particles being reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and working mutually on one another, ſo as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Motion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently their Effects.</p>
            <p>And as the Rays of the Sun, collected into a Point by a Burning-Glaſs, makes 'em more violent, ſo do the Nitrous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles enereaſe the Vigour of the Flame: And again, as Banks caſt up about a Spring prevent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47305:30"/>
the Water from ſtreaming away till a greater Quantity is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, and it breaks out violently; ſo are the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Fire heaped up, and kept in till their Motion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers the Preſſure of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</p>
            <p>But Nitre does not only by reverberating the Rays, collect a great Number together, and by that means encreaſe their Vigour; but alſo by inverting their Motion, turns them back again upon, and cauſes them by ſtriking againſt, the combuſtible Matter to diſſolve, and put the Particles of it into Motion ſooner, wherefore it burns more briskly, and is conſum'd in leſs time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47305:31"/>And this is the Reaſon that Fire burns better in the <hi>Winter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wherefore Fire burns better in the</hi> Winter <hi>than in the</hi> Summer.</note> than the <hi>Summer:</hi> For in the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> for want of a cloſe condenſed Nitrous Air, to bind up and collect the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Fire, they are diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſcattered immediately; but in the <hi>Winter,</hi> being as if it were yok'd and lock'd up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they affect our Senſes more vigorouſly.</p>
            <p>To prove, That Nitre is Part of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum</hi> of Flame,<note place="margin">Why a Candle in a Glaſs. Globe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Air.</note> he inſtances an Experiment, from the Famous Mr. <hi>Robert Boyl, viz.</hi> That a ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Candle being put into a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47305:31"/>
large Glaſs-Globe, and the Globe being ſtoped, as ſoon as the Air is ſucked out, the Flame expires. But this is ſo far from proving, that the Air is part of the <hi>Pabulum</hi> of Fire, that it is the ſtrongeſt Proof of what I juſt now ſaid: for as long as the Particles of the Air clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing about the Candle, keep all the Rays together; and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting their Motion, cauſe them to turn upon the Fat, that they may, by diſſolving of it, and putting it's Parts into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, turn it into Flame, ſo long it burns; but as ſoon as the Nitre is exhauſted, the Rays being immediately diſperſed, and ſcattered by their own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility; fly away from, and ceaſe to convert the remaining
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47305:32"/>
Part of the Fat into Flame; and that which makes more for what I have ſaid, is, that as the Air is gradually drawn out, ſo the Flame is gradually dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: For when there is leſs Nitre to oppoſe the Motion of the Rays, they are ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed; and the Nitre by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them that liberty, leaves leſs flame about the Candle.</p>
            <p>He ſays further, as Flame is extinguſhed by taking away the<note place="margin">His Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of extinguiſhed Flame, compared with the Death of an Animal conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Nitrous <hi>Pabulum</hi> of it; ſo when the Breath of an Animal is ſtop'd, it dyes not ſo much becauſe it is choaked by a Retention of fuliginous Recrements, as by

robbing the Blood of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Pabulum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How an Animal comes to die by ſtoping Reſpiration, I ſhall hereafter give an Account, when I ſpeak concerning the Uſe of the Lungs; in the mean time, I ſhall here make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Nitre of the Air, is ſo far from promoting the Heat of the Blood; that the leſs Nitrous the Air is the hotter it grows.</p>
            <p>This is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manifeſt,<note place="margin">Nitre does not promote the Heat of the Blood but rather depreſſes.</note> if we do but take our Breath through a warm Woollen Cloath, which imbibes, as if it were, the Nitre; for we ſhall be ſo far from being cooler for it, that in warm Weather,

when our Bodies are a little prediſpoſed, it cauſes us to ſweat, whereas if Nitre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the Heat of the Blood, we ſhould rather be cold, the Flame of the Blood according to him being extinguiſhed for want of a Supply of Nitrous <hi>Pabulum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, although this would not be a ſufficient Argument to convince us; yet a cold Winter and a hot Summer would be Arguments ſtrong enough; for we always find, that in the Winter, when the Air is full of Nitre, we are much more cold, then in the Summer when in the Heat of the Sun, we want that Supply of Nitre: From whence it ſufficiently appears, that Nitre does not contribute to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47305:33"/>
Heat of the Blood, but rather depreſſes it.</p>
            <p>Neither, in Liquids is there<note place="margin">For in Liquids the volatile Parts are ſufficiently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Parts of the Blood and kept from flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> any accenſion as there is in Flame, for Nitre to lock up and keep the Heat from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing; for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be Hot, though it be placed in the Middle of a Fire, where no Nitre can come near it; the Particles which make up that Liquid Subſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient to reſerve thoſe Particles of Matter, which cauſe Heat upon our Senſory, from flying away ſo ſoon, by intangling and fettering them up.</p>

Aſhes of the Fuel, hurried along with them by their Motion and the Particles of Nitre: By which means, they looſe moſt of their Vigour, and are more eaſily overpowered by the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; and being fixed and joyned with thoſe Aſhes, makes up that which we call Soot; which the longer it lyes together, grows more Bitter, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Particles of the fixed Flame, being by an Inteſtine Sort of Motion, exalted, and overpowering the more dull and effete Parts of Matter.</p>
            <p>From whence it appears, that Soot is not altogether a Recrement of Fire; but is made up of effete Aſhes, Fire and Nitre.</p>
            <p>But though Soot were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47305:37"/>
a Recrement of Fire, yet it does not follow, that that Moiſture, which ſupplies the Lungs, is a Recrement of the Blood, though it were to be called a Recrement: For it is ſeperated, as a Part of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum and Lympha, and not of the Blood.</p>
            <p>FRom what I have ſaid, I think, it plainly appears, that neither the <hi>Simile</hi> he uſes, is in any conſiderable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances agreeable; nor can he from thence deduce the Reaſon of the Heat of the Blood; and being led as if it were by a Neceſſity, in Anſwer to his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, to conſider the Nature
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47305:38"/>
of Flame, and the manner of it's Production, more then I otherwiſe ſhould have done; I ſhall beg leave<note place="margin">A Digreſſion in which is given the Reaſon why Flame Aſcends rather then Deſcends.</note> to make a ſmall Digreſſion here, which though it may ſeem foreign to a Diſcourſe of the Heat of the Blood; yet it may not be improper, after what I have already ſaid of Fire, to endeavour to give a Reaſon, why Flame, when it is left to it's own Liberty, always aſcends.</p>
            <p>To underſtand then the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why Flame always aſcends, we muſt again remember, that Fire is, for as much as appears to our Senſes or Reaſon, a light rarified Body, whoſe minute and ſubtile Particles, are in a ſwift Motion, and in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47305:38"/>
ſome meaſure pinned in, by the ambient Air.</p>
            <p>Now though the ambient Air thus preſs<note place="margin">Which is becauſe it hath leſs Oppoſition in it's Motion that way.</note> upon it on every ſide; yet the Particles of Flame, being in too ſtrong a Motion, and alſo too ſubtile to be totally reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and altogether confined; muſt needs break out that way, which it forces moſt eaſily, and where it is leaſt powerfully reſiſted.</p>
            <p>That Flame is only a rarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body in ſwift Motion, I take for granted; and that it is preſſed upon on every ſide by Air, none ſure will deny; and it muſt needs be moſt reaſonable for us to believe, that it will be ſubject to ſpread and expand
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47305:39"/>
it ſelf that way it finds the leaſt reſiſtance: Therefore all that I need to prove, is, that Flame expoſed to the open Air, finds leſs reſiſtance in Aſcending then Deſcending.</p>
            <p>That Flame finds leſs reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Aſcending then Deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will eaſily be proved, if we will but allow, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> That the more ſolid and compreſſed any Body is, the more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully it repels thoſe Bodies that move againſt it; which plainly appears, if we ſtrike two peices of Mettle together, <hi>viz.</hi> Lead and Iron, for at the ſame time, that Lead eaſily yields to the Impreſſion of the Iron, it as powerfully reſiſts the former.</p>
            <p>If then, the Air, the nearer
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47305:39"/>
it is to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Becauſe the Air the nearer to the Center makes ſtronger Oppoſition than that above.</note> be more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and Firm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it will reſiſt the motion of Bodies that ſtrike againſt it, with greater Vigour; and when the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Flame are forcibly dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt it, they, being more ſtrongly reſiſted, by that Air, which is below, than the Air a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, with leſs difficulty make way for themſelves upward, and ſo aſcend.</p>
            <p>That the Air, the nearer it is to the Center, is thicker and more compact, conſequently will be abler to reſiſt the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Flame; we have a great deal of Reaſon to believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we conſider, what a vaſt and unaccountable Weight of incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47305:40"/>
Air, preſſes upon it; for, as in a Pillar of Stone, the nearer to the Foundation, the harder it is to force a Stone out of it, becauſe it is held faſter by the weight of thoſe that lie upon it; ſo we muſt needs conceive, that thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Air next the Center, will be made more compact and able to reſiſt the Flame by the weight of thoſe that lie upon them.</p>
            <p>But to prove it more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Which is proved by theſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> That the Air next to the Center, makes a ſtronger Reſiſtance; I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a common, yet very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, Experiment, which is this. If a Bladder be blown full of Air, at the bottom of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47305:40"/>
the Mountain <hi>Teneriff,</hi> and be carried up to the Top of that Hill, it will preſently burſt: The Reaſon of which is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, a great quantity of Air at the bottom of the Hill, being preſſed and ſquezed cloſe together, by the weight of all that condenſed Air, that lies upon it, the Springs of it being by that means, as if it were wound up, and made more compact, as ſoon as that weight is wanting to keep them cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at the Top, they fly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and expand themſelves, to a more lax and open Conſtitution of Parts; which Reaſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by another Experiment, <hi>viz.</hi> By blowing a Bladder full of Air at the Top of the ſame Mountain; for as it is brought
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47305:41"/>
down to the bottom of the Hill, it gradually ſubſides; and though it was as full as it could be blown at the Top of the Hill; yet at the bottom, it will ſeem not near fully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended, the Spring of the Air that was above expanded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now preſſed together by the weight of the Air above it.</p>
            <p>Another Obſervation, which I ſhall bring, for<note place="margin">It is alſo proved by the Expanſion of Gunpowder.</note> a Confirmation of it, is, That a Musket ſhot off at the Top of that Hill, makes no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Noiſe, compared with the Sound it cauſes at the bottom. The Reaſon of which difference can be no other, but this, that the Air being more compact and ſolid below, cauſes the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47305:41"/>
Colliſion of the ſmall Particles of Matter, to be more violent, by a ſtronger Oppoſition; and conſequently the Sound is by that means louder.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Particles of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded Gunpower fly away and diſſipate themſelves, a great deal more eaſily above then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; which confirms what I have ſaid before, of the Reaſon, why Nitre is beneficial to the maintanance of Flame; for if the Air, when it is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed, binds up and cauſes the Particles of Fire, to work more powerfully upon one another; and by that means a ſtronger Colliſion of Particles; and if when it is leſs condenſed, it more eaſily yields to them, and gives them Liberty to fly away
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47305:42"/>
with leſs Reſiſtance; it muſt needs be granted, that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it performs here below, in reſpect of Flame, is, to keep it's Parts from flying away too eaſily.</p>
            <p>But for a further Proof and Confirmation of the Reaſon I have given, why Flame flies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the Air yields more readily to it's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upwards, being leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact above then below; I ſhall produce two or three Inſtances, which prove, that if it had but leſs Liberty to aſcend, by the Oppoſition of ſome other Body then to deſcend it would as naturally fly downwards as it does now upwards, when it is otherwiſe; and I ſhall alſo
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47305:42"/>
prove, that if it had but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Reſiſtance on each ſide, it would expand orbicularly.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> that if Flame had but an equal Reſiſtance from ambient Bodies on each ſide, it would expand Orbicularly, will be proved by this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> fill a hollow Globe with Gunpowder, one ſide of which is a little thinner than the other; and whatever way that thin ſide is turned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther down, upwards, or hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon-ward, the Gunpowder will expand, and break out that way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> to prove that if there were but more liberty for the deſcent than aſcent of it, Flame would naturally fly downwards, we need but ſhoot
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47305:43"/>
a Gun off with the Mouth downwards; for the explauded Gunpowder finding an open and eaſy Paſſage downwards, and being reſiſted upwards, and on each ſide, it naturally deſcends.</p>
            <p>But ſome perhaps that do not throughly underſtand, why a Thing is ſaid naturally to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend or deſcend, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to believe, that when a Gun is ſhot downwards, the Motion of the Flame is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Motion, but may rather think it Preternatural.</p>
            <p>But that it may appear, that it is as truly a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Motion in<note place="margin">The Motion of Flame downwards is a natural Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Philoſophy.</note> Philoſophy, as the aſcending Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, I ſhall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47305:43"/>
conſider, why Flame may be ſaid naturally to aſcend.</p>
            <p>Flame then is ſaid naturally to aſcend, becauſe it is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, for the moſt Part to do ſo, which is as much as to ſay, the Nature of Flame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines it to aſcend; how the Nature of it inclines it to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, I have already ſhown, and that there are the ſame Reaſons, why the deſcending Motion, ſhould be termed Natural, will eaſily be proved; for as it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for it to aſcend, as long as it hath only the Air to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it's Motion, ſo it is it's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to deſcend, when the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Oppoſition is changed; and the latter is as much a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Motion, as the former; all that diverſifies the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47305:44"/>
of Flame, being thoſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Circumſtances which are about it; and as a Ball, caſt againſt the bottom of a Room, rebounds upwards; and when it is thrown againſt the top of it, as naturally flyes down; ſo Flame, being in a brisk Motion, naturally flyes up or down, as the Parts of Matter it ſtriks againſt reſiſt it, and cauſe it to fly back from them.</p>
            <p>HAving made this ſhort Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, I ſhall proceed next to<note place="margin">Diemerbroek's <hi>Opinion examined.</hi>
               </note> examin <hi>Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broek</hi>'s Opinion; who thinks that the vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by reaſon of it's Volatility,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47305:44"/>
always endeavouring to fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, does continually agitate thoſe groſſer Particles of the Blood; with which it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and detained from flight; and is diverſly vibrated and beat back, and ſo the whole Maſs being kept in a continual fermentative Motion; there is a Heat produced in it, which in a greater Agitation, is greater, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo differs, according to the different Degrees of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation.</p>
            <p>All that I ſhall, or need to take Notice of here, is, that that Agitation of Particles, which he ſays, cauſes the Heat of the Blood, rather produces a Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heat, by affecting our Senſes, in their Motion, than produce that, which we call
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47305:45"/>
Heat in the Blood. But to know the true Reaſon of the Heat of the Blood, we muſt underſtand how thoſe Particles are put into Motion; which by affecting our Senſory, cauſe ſuch a Senſation. So that he ſeems to me to ſay no more, then that that which hath a Power to cauſe Heat, is the Cauſe of that Power, when he ought in order to explain the Heat of the Blood, to have ſhown from whence that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proceeds, the Reaſon of which, I ſhould have taken in ſome meaſure, for the Reaſon of the Heat, potentially in the Maſs of Blood; but from what he hath ſaid, it appears, that he hath not explained the true Reaſon of the Heat of the Blood
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47305:45"/>
ſo plainly, that I need ſay no more againſt it.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Henſhaw</hi> thinks, that the Diſſimilitude betwixt the Chyle<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Henſhaw'<hi>s Opinion conſidered.</hi>
               </note> and Blood is ſo great, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes immediately the Cauſe of an extraordinary Ebullition, upon their mixture together, which is very much increaſed by the reciprocal Motion of the Lungs; whereby the Blood is wrought into a froth, by that time it gets into the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart. Which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Exceſs of Heat, he thinks, not unlike what happens upon the mixing of ſeveral Chymical Liquors together; for the Heat
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47305:46"/>
often becomes ſo great, that they often endanger the Veſſels that contain them.</p>
            <p>But he might as well have ſaid, that there is ſo great a Diſſimilitude betwixt hot Blood and cold Milk, that as ſoon as the Milk is mixed with it, it will cauſe an extraordiary Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition; and that by expoſing them to the Air, &amp; running them through Pipes, the Heat would increaſe; but this is ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, that it needs no other Arguments, but Reflection to convince the weakeſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>And he might equally as well conclude, that Water would kindle a Fire, and encreaſe the Flame of it, becauſe Oyl will, as that Chyle will put the Blood into a Heat, becauſe Oyl of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47305:46"/>
Turpentine and Spirit of Wine will grow hot when mix'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but the Concluſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſtly abſurd, I ſhall in the next Place, endeavour to ſhow the Reaſon of the Heat of the Blood as evidently as poſſibly I can.</p>
            <p>FROM what I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid, in Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>'s Opinion, it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appears; that, whether we ſay, the Blood grows hot <hi>per admotum Calidi,</hi> Accenſion, or any other way, it is no more then to expreſs the ſame Thing ſeveral ways; or to make Words
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47305:47"/>
different in Sound, to expreſs one and the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>But as all that have writ on this Subject, have made choice of a<note place="margin">Antient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writers have rather diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Words, than much difference obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> different Name to ſignify the Heat of the Blood by; whilſt ſome would have it done by Accen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, others by Attrition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo they have by that means, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſputed about Names and Words, than any real and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Difference in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. I ſhall not here enter into a diſpute, whether the Blood when it becomes hot, may moſt properly be ſaid to grow hot, or it's Heat expreſſed by any one of thoſe Titles, they have
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47305:47"/>
been pleaſed to ſignify it by; for as in diſcourſing about the conſtituent Parts of a Man, it is not neceſſary to fix any Name upon that Man; but whether it be <hi>Thomas, Robert</hi> or <hi>William,</hi> the conſtituent Parts of him, if he be a perfect Man, will ſtill be the ſame; ſo in diſcourſing concerning the Heat of the Blood, and conſidering the principal Cauſe or Agent, and the more remote and acceſſory Cauſes; it is no matter at all, whether the Conſequence of theſe Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be ſignified by the word Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, Attrition or Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; becauſe the Difference of the Title, does not at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſify the Action.</p>
            <p>But if any one would rather ſignify the Heat of the Blood,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47305:48"/>
by any of theſe different Words, I ſhall be equally pleas'd with them, or any of them; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they all meet, in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſignified by them, and do not deny that which ſeems to be true: That the Heat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a ſwift inteſtin Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it's Particles. Which Motion is the Reaſon why it affects our Senſory, ſo as to cauſe a Senſation of Heat.</p>
            <p>But as the Reaſon, why it affects our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory ſo, is not<note place="margin">The Reaſon why Heat affects our Senſory does not ſhew how it comes by that Power.</note> ſufficiently ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to explain what is the Cauſe, and how it comes by that Power of cauſing ſuch a Senſation. In making an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Cauſe of that, I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:47305:48"/>
ſhall beg leave to make Uſe of that Word, which I think to be moſt expreſſive, <hi>viz.</hi> Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>For ſince in every mechanical Action, there is an Agent and a<note place="margin">The Blood grows hot by Attrition the Conſequence of which is Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> Patient; and the Agent operates upon the Patient, by moving pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully againſt the Parts of it: And in that Motion, the Parts of the one ſtrike againſt, and rub upon, the other; ſo far it may be called Attrition: And if by the force of the Agent, the Motion, and conſequently Attrition, be more violent; and the conſequence of that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, be a Production of a Power to cauſe a Senſation of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47305:49"/>
Heat; ſo far it may be called Fermentation: If then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Heat of the Blood, there be ſuch a Motion and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and the conſequence of it be Heat; we may properly ſay, the Blood grows hot by Attrition and Fermentation.</p>
            <p>But becauſe, to ſignify the Heat of the Blood, by Attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Attrition and the conſequence of it both to be ſignified by the Word Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</note> and Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would be needleſs; I would ſignify all that Action by Fermentation: And when I ſay, the Blood grows hot by Fermentation, I would be underſtood to mean and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify both that Attrition of Parts, which is the Cauſe of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and alſo Fermentation,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:47305:49"/>
which is the conſequence of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, yet if any one would rather ſay, it grows hot by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion; they have my aſſent, provided they mean thereby, not ſo high a degree of Heat, as is uſually ſignified by that Word; but ſince it ſounds ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too harſh, and implies too high a degree of Attrition and Fermentation than that, which is commonly in the Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I more willingly make choice of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And ſince I have ſaid thus much of the Uſe of Words, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">How far the Heat of the Blood proceeds from Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Mixture.</note> to ſignify the Heat of the Blood; I ſhall here take Notice, of what was by way
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47305:50"/>
of Diſcourſe told me, by one, to whom I communicated, in ſome Meaſure, my Notion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Heat of the Blood; which was this. He ſaid he thought he could prove that it was done by Mixture and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and that he could explain the Heat of the Blood, by that Notion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here conceal the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Name, becauſe he hath not made it public upon this account, though upon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to very little purpoſe; and becauſe he told me, he intended to publiſh it, I ſhall for his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and alſo the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe, to whom he hath communicated it, ſay; that as I have ſhewn, that in mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Actions there is a Motion,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47305:50"/>
and by that Motion there muſt be implyed a Mixture, to any one that doth but underſtand the Circulation of the Humors in a Man's Body; and it will conſequently follow, that where there is a Mixture, and a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Humors, there muſt needs be alſo an Attrition of Parts, ſo moved; which Attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on implies a Preſſure: For there can be no Attrition, without a Preſſure; tho' Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure does not imply Attrition. This is all he told me, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all that I can Anſwer; but, for as much as I cou'd ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the remaining Part of his Diſcourſe, the moſt Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Part of his Notion; but from what he ſaid, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not what Preſſure he meant,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47305:51"/>
that is, a Preſſure of what, whether of the Particles of Blood with one another or not; and it being plain, that he did not believe, that Animal Spirits circulated through the Nerves; I not only concluded that his Preſſure was only of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Blood; becauſe there are none other except <hi>Serum</hi> to mix with it; but alſo, that what he had to ſay for it was rather about the Uſe of Words then any thing elſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I have ſhew'd him how far his Words are ſignificant in my <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>

ſanguiferous Veſſels are ſo ſmall, that they cannot be ſeen by good Microſcopes, but alſo the Nervous Fibers are ſo extreamly diminutive and fine, that they have been computed to be four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore times as Fine as a Hair, and conſequently the Liquor contained in each muſt be ſo little, that five or ſix Hundred Veſſels muſt be joyned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to make one Drop; ſo that, being ſeparated and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into very ſmall Portions, by the Intermixture of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, it is no ſooner expoſed to the Air, but is immediately chill'd and coagulated.</p>
            <p>Which we may more eaſily believe, when we take Notice, how thin and fluid the Maſs of Blood is, as long as it is in a

            <p>But it is not only evident, that theſe Spirits are in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Motion, but alſo highly neceſſary: For either they muſt be in Motion, or ſtagnate; and if they ſhould ſtagnate; they would in a ſhort time cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and putrify.

            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:47305:59"/>From hence it appearing that that oyly Subſtance in the Brain is ſeparated from the Maſs of Blood; being the ſweeteſt and moſt ſpirituous Part of it; and that it muſt needs circulate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through the Nerves; I ſhall now conſider the Nature of it, that we thence may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more clearly the Manner of it's Operation.</p>
            <p>Which preſently appears, if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult<note place="margin">The Nature of the Animal Spirits conſidered.</note> our Taſte, the Taſte of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oyly, ſweet and mucilaginous, that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance being made up of the moſt volatile ſulphureous and ſalt Particles of the Maſs of Blood, which are incorporated,

in ſome of the moſt digeſted and ripen'd <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, and by that means appear in the Form of a Mucilage.</p>
            <p>That theſe Spirits are made up of the fineſt Sulphureous Particles and the moſt volatile Salts of the Blood, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently proved by our conſtant Diet; for we always perceive our ſelves moſt full of Spirit after Meat that abounds with Sulphur, volatile Salts and Oyls; whereas all Acids, Auſteres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which thicken Oyl, and take of the Force of volatile Salt and Sulphur, depreſs our Spirits and keep them too low.</p>
            <p>That theſe Spirits are full of ſulphureous oyly Matter, is farther manifeſt, by expoſing the Brains of any Animal to

            <p>In carrying on of which, it is to be obſerv'd, that the Animal<note place="margin">How it's Heat is promoted.</note> Spirits being thus accidentally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded, and put into Motion, by the groſſer Parts of the Blood, and being thus held in, and ſtruck back, by them; does not only by that Means fly back and increaſe each others

            <p>It is further to be obſerved, that as theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits<note place="margin">The Heat of the Blood varies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Quantities of them.</note> are more or leſs in quantity, ſo (the groſs Parts of the Blood, grinding them together and putting them in Motion,) they more powerfully, or leſs vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly expand, and moving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, digeſt and rarify the Maſs of Blood to a higher or lower Degree; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47305:64"/>
Formal and Efficient Cauſes of it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Animal Spirits and Arterial Blood are both forcibly laid down in the Glandules; I have given ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reaſons to evince, in my Treatiſe of <hi>Muſcular Motion,</hi> and have given further Proof of it here.</p>
            <p>To prove then, that the Heat of the Blood does proceed<note place="margin">That the Heat of the Blood proceeds from Fermentation proved.</note> from that Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary to explain the mechanical Motion of the Parts of thoſe Liquors, that work mutually one upon another; I ſhall in the next Place ſhew, that the Heat of the Blood is cauſed by ſuch a

mechanical Motion of Parts, as I have before mentioned.</p>
            <p>That the Animal Spirits then are forcibly driven againſt the Arterial Blood, is ſo ſelf evident, that it needs no Proof; and if ſo, it muſt needs follow that the Particles of the one will be intimately mixed with the other; and it is undeniably True, that the Animal Spirits will by that means, be ground and rubbed betwixt the Particles of the Blood, which are in Motion, and amongſt which, they are mixed; and the Animal Spirits, being of an oyly Salino-Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Nature will conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be expanded and rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and put by that means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſwifter degree of Motion, is evident; whether we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47305:65"/>
the Effects, that ſolid or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Subſtances have on one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, when in Motion; for Amber, by a violent Attrition of it's Parts againſt a woollen Cloath, feels hot; the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous fat Effluviums being by that Attrition encreaſed, and cauſed to fly out in greater Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities. It is evident alſo, by ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a piece of Flint againſt Steel, that the ſulphureous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Flint, being, as if it were diſyok'd from the Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the more firm and ſolid Particles of the Stone, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rubbed and ground betwixt them are put into a violent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which cauſes them ſo much to rarify and expand, that whenever they affect our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory, they cauſe that Senſation

we call Heat; which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly violent, as their degrees of Motion are more or leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe; and ſo Amber, by a mild Attrition is moderately warm, and by a violenter, more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> It is obſervable in the turning of any large and<note place="margin">That Heat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on further proved.</note> weighty Wheel, where the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Weight makes ſuch a forcible Preſſure of thoſe Parts that lie about the Axle-tree, that by ſtrong and frequent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritions of the Parts together, the crude Sulphur, which is fettered up in the Subſtance of the Wood, is by degrees looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and diſſolved, and being put into Motion is rarified and

            <p>And now, ſince not only So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, but alſo Liquid, Bodies grow hot, by an Attrition of their more volatile and ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Particles, betwixt the more groſs ones, and ſince there
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47305:67"/>
appears from what I have before ſaid, but one way, by which all Bodies grow hot; we muſt needs conclude, that the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſalino-ſulphureous Particles of the Spirits grow hot, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground betwixt the groſſer Particles of Arterial Blood; and that thoſe, by putting the whole Maſs into a more violent Agitation, cauſe the Heat of the Blood.</p>
            <p>But ſome will perhaps ſay, that in all thoſe Phaenomena, I have mentioned, theſe groſſer Parts of Matter, which grind upon the ſulphureous Particles, are put into Motion by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: But they do not perceive, how the groſſer Parts of the Blood are put into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firſt.</p>

Veſſels; and ſo cauſes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to meet, and ferment a ſecond time, in the Glandules; and as Circulation is preſerved and carried on by the ſubtile Liquor, which is continually prepared in this Fermentation, ſo the Particles of the Blood are mixed with the Spirits, and preſerved in Motion by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhew'd, that the Heat of the Blood may as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably proceed from Attrition, as Heat in any other Bodies; ſince Heat is nothing elſe, in reſpect of that which cauſes the Senſation, than a quick inteſtin Motion of Parts, and ſince thoſe can be put into Motion no other way but by Attrition; I ſhould in the next Place prove,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47305:68"/>
that the Particles of refined and rarified Matter always expand and endeavour<note place="margin">That the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of refined and rarified Matter, are by an Inverſion of their Motion put into a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of it proved.</note> to fly away but, being reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of thoſe groſs ones, with which they ſwim, their Motion is inverted, and by that means much increaſed. But it is ſo evidently True, that it needs not; for we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerve, that where any two Bodies meet together, and ſtrike againſt one another, that which is leſs yields to that which is moſt ſolid, and makes the ſtrongeſt Oppoſition; this is manifeſt in Flame it ſelf, as alſo in the Expanſion of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47305:69"/>
for if a Gun be ſhot againſt a Wall, the Flame of the expanded Gun-powder ſtriking againſt it, preſently flyes back again, and, by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that, which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows it, encreaſeth the force of it; and for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Gun which is charged with a greater weight of Shot, more forcibly recoils; the Powder not finding free Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to expand, but flying backward with a greater Force: It is alſo further evident, from the Reaſon which I have given, why Nitre is beneficial-in continuing Flame, and making it more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:47305:69"/>The groſs Parts of the Blood, having thus put<note place="margin">How the Animal Spirits rarifie the Blood.</note> the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into a ſwift Motion, and by inverting them in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having cauſed them to encreaſe one anothers Motion; the Spirits at laſt, ſet upon the Maſs of Blood, and by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſſolving the Particles of it, rarifie them and cauſe them to expand alſo; ſo the Rays of the Sun, being in a ſwift Motion, and gathered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Point by a burning Glaſs, grow more vigorous, ſo as to diſſolve and burn even ſolid Bodies; and after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Flame, by the force of it, ſubtilizeth and attenuates the Sulphureous Parts of it's Fuel,

neither does it only rarifie and expand the Sulphureous Matter of it's Fuel, but alſo carries violently the Aſhes of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined Matter along with it, where it may be obſerved, that as the Particles of Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are not in ſo ſtrong a Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as thoſe of Fire, ſo the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Blood are moved with a more eaſie force, then Aſhes which are far more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</p>
            <p>But for a further Proof, that the Maſs of Blood grows hot, in a<note place="margin">That the Animal Spirits according to their different quantities diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently exagitate the Maſs of Blood prov'd.</note> Natural ſtate, by the Methods and Ways, which I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to explain; I ſhall in the next

place prove, that the Animal Spirits, being put into Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to their different Quantities, differently expand themſelves, and exagitate the Maſs of Blood, and put it's Parts in a more violent or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Motion, and conſequently encreaſe or diminiſh the Heat of it.</p>
            <p>And this is eaſily manifeſt, if we do but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that young<note place="margin">By the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of People of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ages.</note> &amp; healthful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe Nerves as well as the Fountains from whence they ſpring, are full of, and abound with, Spirits, are always of a more brisk and vigorous Heat then People of a declining Age,

whoſe Nerves are leſs plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtocked with them.</p>
            <p>But it is not only obſervable in People of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent<note place="margin">As alſo by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Conſtitutions.</note> Ages, but alſo in different Conſtitutions, that as the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulum</hi> of the Animal Spirits is more plentiful and yields a more conſtant and large Supply; ſo the Heat of the Blood is more powerful and intenſe; as in cold and Phlegmatick Conſtitutions, where the Maſs of Blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds, with dull Phlegmatick Humours, or Acid and Auſtere Juices, of too cloſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact Texture, and a large Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Spirits is denyed; the Blood is not of ſo hot a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as in Cholerick Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; whence it evidently
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47305:71"/>
appears, that the Heat of the Blood depends on the Vigour of the Animal Spirits; for if when the Veſſels are filled with Spirits and plentifully ſupply the Glands, that Fermentation is raiſed higher, and by that means the Heat of the Blood is accordingly encreaſed, it is a moſt certain Concluſion, that the Heat of the Blood depends upon the Effects, that the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits have in that Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
            <p>Which is further confirmed, by the common<note place="margin">And the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Part of Phyſick.</note> and conſtant Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians; for when the Natural Heat, as ſome call it, is lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid and weak, and almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; they give ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,

as increaſe the Heat of the Blood, by renuing the Vigour of the Spirits; whence to People that are almoſt a dying, their Spirits being dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or exhauſted, nothing is more uſual then to give them Spirits of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn<note place="margin">How Spirit of Harts-horn raiſes the Pulſe.</note> or of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monick-ſalt, or ſome other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line or Sulphureous Spirits, which preſently joyning with thoſe in the Nerves, encreaſe the Fermentation in the Glands, and by that means put the Maſs of Blood into a more ſwift Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation; and by raiſing the Fermentation, not only renue Circulation, but the Heat of the Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:47305:72"/>On the contrary, when the Animal Spirits are too high and<note place="margin">That the Spirits according to their different Degrees of Activity variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exagitate the Maſs of Blood.</note> volatile, or too much in Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they raiſe this Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo high, that the Blood is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put into a Preter-natural Heat; from whence proceeds that Preter-natural Heat in Fevers: And the way, that Phyſitians either do, or can take, in ſuch Caſes is, either to take down the Animal Spirits, by withdrawing Part of their <hi>Pabulum,</hi> and by Acids given internally, to harden the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Blood, and make it leſs ſubject to grow too Hot by Fermentation; or otherwiſe

               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That the more any rarified Sulphureous Body is expanded betwixt the more groſs and ſolid Parts of Matter, thoſe groſs ones are put into a ſtronger Motion, is evident from a Musket charged with Shot, which, with a ſmall quantity of expanded Matter, will ſcarce be moved; but by a greater quantity of exploded Matter, are put into ſo ſwift a Motion, that they fly forcibly a conſiderable way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:47305:73"/>Having thus far proved, what I propoſed, to be reaſonable<note place="margin">The ſharper the Particles of Blood are the more they corrode the Spirits and put them into Motion.</note> and likely, and nothing but what is conſonant to the Practice of moſt Rational Phyſitians; I proceed to ſhew, that the ſharper the Particles of the Blood are, they corrode and grind the Spirits into ſmall and minute Particles with a great deal more Violence, and by that means cauſe them to expand more vigorouſly, and by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into a ſtrong Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cauſe a higher Degree of Heat.</p>
            <p>This is ſufficiently proved
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47305:74"/>
by the Preter-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effects, that<note place="margin">The Keaſon of fluſhing heats, in the Scurvy.</note> Scorbutick Salts cauſe in ſome People; for when the Maſs of Blood is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Acid Acrid Humors, theſe, meeting with the Spirits, cauſe Preter natural fluſhing Heats; which appear in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts of the Body, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the whole; which are ſo violent, that thoſe, that are affected with them, complain; that they feel themſelves as Hot, as if they were in a Stew or a Bagnio.</p>
            <p>That this Preter-natural Heat proceeds from Corroſive Salt Humours, fermenting with the Spirits, is very manifeſt; ſince theſe Symptoms are only cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47305:74"/>
by ſuch Medicines as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Acidity and Acrimony of the Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> When it moſt partakes of <hi>Acrimony</hi> by ſweet diaphoretick <hi>Decoctions,</hi> or ſome ſort of Acids, which dull and take off their corroding Edges, or when they are more Acid, by volatile Salts that carry them off by Sweat or Urine; or by Acid Abſorbers, which by correcting the Acidities of the Pancreatick Juice, leave the Ferment of the Liver more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant; and the bitter Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, being by that means bred a great deal more plentifully, digeſts and carries off thoſe crude Humors, which by the aforeſaid means being made thin enough, to go off by Urin and inſenſible Tranſpiration, are

diſperſed and carry'd off thoſe ways; and the Maſs of Blood, being cleanſed of thoſe ſharp Humors, is reduced to a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful State.</p>
            <p>If then by conſidering the Nature of thoſe Medicines, that<note place="margin">Proved by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Nature of the Medicines that oppoſe it and correct it.</note> correct vitious Humors, we may learn to know what is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe Humors; we muſt conclude, that whatever is corrected by Medicines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to Acrimony, the nature of that Humor is Acrid; and when, by the Uſe of volatile Salts, the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Humors of our Bodies, are attenuated, and diſpoſed to Evacuation, and at the ſame
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47305:75"/>
time we know, that volatile Salts by volatizing and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſuperfluous fixed Acid Acrid Humors of the Maſs of Blood, diſpoſe them to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off, we have all the Reaſon imaginable to conclude, that when we find thoſe Medicines carry off ſuch Symptoms, that they are cauſed by ſuch Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,</p>
            <p>And that theſe fluſhing Heats in the Scurvey, proceed from Acrid Acid Humors is plain, becauſe all Salt Meat, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Acids; and all ſharp Acrid Bear, that hath an Acrid Fluid Salt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in it, as alſo Vinegar and ſuch like, make thoſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms more violent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:47305:76"/>If then, both from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure, and the Cauſe it ſelf augmented by ſuch Sorts of Juices, we gather they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſharp Acrid Acid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, we may be certain, that thoſe Symptoms are cauſed by ſuch Humors grinding and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding the Animal Spirits, and that by putting them into a Preter-natural Motion, they are the Cauſes of ſuch Senſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And that thoſe Senſations only proceed from thence, we may eaſily conceive; for ſince, as long as thoſe Humors circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with the Maſs of Blood, and forcibly meet with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits, they can only affect them, by moving amongſt them; they muſt needs put
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47305:76"/>
them into a more ſwift Motion, and an unuſual Expanſion, by corroding and grinding them more powerfully, betwixt their Particles, which is evident from the cauſe of thoſe fluſhing Heats I juſt now mentioned, and from the Reaſon I have before given of Heat.</p>
            <p>But that the ſharper the Maſs of Blood is, the more the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits are ground and expanded betwixt the Particles of it, is evident from Reaſon it ſelf; for it being proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Heat of the Blood proceeds from a ſwift in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtin Motion of the Particles of the Blood and Spirits, cauſed by Attrition; nothing is more Reaſonable than that the more ſolid the Maſs of Blood is, the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47305:77"/>
ſtronger the Attrition is, and conſequently the Motion of Particles, which upon our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory cauſe heat, muſt be more violent; and as in ſtriking of a Flint with a peice of Steel, the more firm and hard the Steel is, the more powerfully it looſneth the Texture of the Flint, and ſtrongly expanding it's Sulphureous Particles, puts them into that Motion, which conſtitutes Flame; ſo by Parity of Reaſon, we may expect, that the Particles of Blood will cauſe the Sulphureous vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Parts of the Spirits, to expand more powerfully, the more ſolid and compact they are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:47305:77"/>And that the Texture and Conſtitution of Saline Humors, is more Solid, and their Parts more Corroding, than of a ſweet Balſamick Liquor, I think, none can deny, who compares Vinegar and Spirit of Vitriol with Tincture of Sulphur, and although in Fevers, where the Blood abounds with too much exalted Sulphur, Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol and other Acids, cool the Blood, by fixing the Spirits, and Coagulating the Sulphur; yet when the Blood is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Scorbutick Salts, Acidity joyning with Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, cauſes Heat, by corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Spirits, when they want a Mixture of crude Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, to dull their Edges, of which it would be no difficulty
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47305:78"/>
to convince, thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably troubled with ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic Symptoms.</p>
            <p>But <hi>furthermore,</hi> I ſhall prove that the Maſs of Blood, the more<note place="margin">That as the Blood as more or leſs Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, it's Parts are put more or leſs eaſily into Motion proved.</note> it abounds with volatile Salts and Sulphurs, is more eaſily put into a violent Heat; and that it's Particles being more eaſily put into Motion, readily joyn with the Animal Spirits, and encreaſe theirs; and that on the contrary, the more dull and phlegmatic any Body is, the leſs apt are it's Particles to be put in Motion.</p>
            <p>And as it is commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, in all Bodies, ſo it is not leſs obſervable in the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47305:78"/>
Maſs of Blood; for we always find, that the leaſt quantity of any volatile Liquor inflames the Blood of thoſe, that are of a tender and open Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much ſooner then phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic and melancholly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and as the former is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in thoſe that are ſubject to Fevers; ſo the latter is not leſs remarkable in thoſe of cold Conſtitutions; for to encreaſe the natural Heat of their Blood, when it is too much depreſſed, it is not only neceſſary to take away ſome of thoſe crude Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which ſtuff up the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and too much depreſs the Spirits; but alſo, by volatile and ſpirituous Medicins, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Spirits; and at the

ſame time, to exalt and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualize the Blood, by abſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Acids, and exalting the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litile and ſubtile Parts, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them predominant.</p>
            <p>Moreover, that the Animal Spirits do not only according<note place="margin">And that it is differently promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to teir different De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Activity of the Spirits.</note> to their different Quantities, and the different State of the Blood, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly exagitate and encreaſe the Heat of it; but alſo, according to their different Degrees of Activity and Strength is put beyond Diſpute by the different Effects that <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirabilis,</hi> hath upon us from <hi>Sack</hi> which any one that does

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47305:80"/>
continual Circulation; for ſince all the Blood in a Man's Body, is allowed to circulate through the Heart, ſeveral times in an hour; and that the Blood from thence is continually forced and diſperſed through the Parts of the Body, and ſo great a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood is at one Pulſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, laid down in the whole Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the Body, and ferments at the ſame time, with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits; there muſt needs be raiſed in the Blood, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Heat, or in other Words, the Parts of the Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits muſt of neceſſity be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſo ſwift and intenſe a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Motion, as to enable them to produce an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Heat, when they ſtrike upon our Senſory. The whole
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47305:81"/>
Maſs then circulating thus, through the Extremities of the Veſſels, there is not only a great deal of Blood fermented, every Pulſation; but alſo by a continual Succeſſion of Pulſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Blood, being forced into a Fermentation, by the expanſive Motion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is by that Means preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a conſtant and continual Heat.</p>
            <p>But I know, here will ſome Difficulties offer themſelves, and<note place="margin">

down in the Glands, as well as in the Veins after Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they may think it reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to conclude, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ferments, there it's Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is cauſed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a great deal of Blood betwixt their Extremities, and the larger Veſſels; they may think, that the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Extremities, cannot be the Cauſe of the Heat of the Blood in the larger Veſſels; it being an old Maxim, that, <hi>tolle Cauſam tollitur Effectus;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, the Cauſe immediateley goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Effect.</p>
            <p>Another Doubt which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may ariſe will be, that ſince I affirm, that there is ſuch a mutual Action and Paſſion in

            <p>Now as ſoon as it is thruſt out of the Glands, thoſe Spirits which did ſo powerfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand before, and the remaining Part of them, which are not mixed with that ſubtile Liquor, that circulates through the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres; being yet further corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and exagitated by Pulſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtill continue to expand themſelves, and by that means, keep the Blood in a continual Heat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:47305:83"/>And the Animal Spirits being yet more expanded, do not only continue, but in a great Meaſure encreaſe the Heat of it.</p>
            <p>But theſe Spirits, being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently oppoſed<note place="margin">The Reaſon why the Heat of the Blood in time decays.</note> in their Expanſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by ſtriking againſt the Blood, looſe in a ſhort time a great deal of their Vigor, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles that before grund the Animal Spirits betwixt them, obſtructing their Motion; and the Animal Spirits, not being able any longer to keep them in a juſt Motion, ſufficient to continue the Heat, which is Natural to human Blood; they are, as if it were, linked and fettered up, betwixt thoſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47305:84"/>
groſſer Parts, &amp; are incorporated into one Subſtance with them, which is the Reaſon, that the Blood by frequent Circulations, is ripened and digeſted; and for this Reaſon the fleſh of a Hare grows tenderer, by being courſed along time.</p>
            <p>The Blood, being thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with Animal Spirits, and by that means wanting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in a free and ſtrong Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would by degrees grow cold; but the Intervals of time, while the Blood moves from the Extremities of the Veſſels to the Heart, and from the Heart to the Extremities of the Veſſels again, being very ſhort; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be any ſenſible or conſiderable Decay of it, the Blood is anew fermented in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47305:84"/>
Glands; and ſo by a continual Circulation, the Heat of the Blood is preſerved; and becauſe by this time the Animal Spirits mixed in the firſt Fermentation with the Blood, are almoſt ſpent, being incorporated with it; and becauſe Part of it is continually ſeparated in the Brain, it meets a ſecond time with new Supplies, and alſo by repeated Fermentations is more impregnated with Spirits as well as digeſted and ripen'd to a higher Degree of Maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, how the Heat of the Blood is carried on in the Veſſels, that it might more clearly appear, how the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47305:85"/>
Cauſe of Heat is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Glands.</p>
            <p>That the Animal Spirits are put into an ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick<note place="margin">And that Reaſon proved.</note> Motion in the Glands, I have before proved, by the groſſer Particles of the Blood; and that the Blood, ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, is ſucceſſively caſt out into the Veins, is plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to any one that does but underſtand Circulation; to prove then, that the Blood, being thruſt out of the Glands, does by a further Expanſion of thoſe Spirits, for a while in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Fermentation; and that, when the Vigour of the Spirits is ſpent, it will gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decay; we need but take Notice, how Fermentation is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47305:85"/>
begun and carried on in other Liquors; for when oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol and Spirit of Armoniac Salt are mix'd together, the Parts of each being in ſome meaſure mixed, and put into Motion, by dropping the one into the other, they preſently begin to ferment; which fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation is gradually exalted, till by a frequent Colliſion and Attrition, the moſt Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Parts fly away, or their Vigour is loſt; and then Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation gradually decreaſeth; and in like manner, all other Liquors, that for a time fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a ſenſible Heat.</p>
            <p>But if poſſible, it will further appear, that the Original &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſe of Fermentation is in the Glands, if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47305:86"/>
how Fermentation is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in a dying Body.</p>
            <p>For in a Body that is about to die, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour as well as<note place="margin">How Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is carried on in a dying Body, and the Reaſon why it ceaſeth when it is quite dead.</note> Quantity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diminiſhed, and thoſe too, being leſs vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly grund, betwixt the Parts of the Arterial Blood, expand ſo weakly, that they ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate the Maſs of Blood, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to preſerve it's Heat, but as ſoon as the Blood and Spirits ceaſe to circulate, the Heat of the Blood preſently grows milder, till at laſt it is quite extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:47305:86"/>Now, if when the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is weak, the Heat of the Blood is more remiſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and when Circulation is ſtoped, it conſequently cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; it muſt needs follow, that the Animal Spirits are the Cauſe of that Fermentation; and that it is promoted by driving thoſe two Liquors forcibly together; and that the Fermentation is chiefly cauſed in the Glands, is plain, becauſe when the Spirits and Blood ceaſe to be driven together, and there fermented, the Heat of the Blood decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; and that it is not in the Veſſels is evident, becauſe after Circulation is ſtoped, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently declines, whereas if it were cauſed in the Veſſels, it would continue after Death as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47305:87"/>
well as before; ſince, it then hath the ſame Matter, though it wants Circulation and a forcible Mixture; and what I have ſhewed to be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only bring one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more to prove, that the<note place="margin">Another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove, that the Heat of the Blood depends on, and is cauſed by, Attrition.</note> Heat of the Blood depends upon the Attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Glandules; which may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from this common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that the Heat of the Blood is encreaſed by all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Motion: For upon all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Motion, a larger Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Animal Spirits, being ſent to the Parts to be moved,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47305:87"/>
in order to prepare a greater Quantity of ſubtile Liquor, to diſtend and dilate the Fibres; the Fermentation is not only raiſed higher in the Glandules, but the Motion of the Heart, being thus accidentally increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, quickens the Circulation of the Blood ſo much, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vigorous Motion of it's Parts, which was raiſed in the precedent Fermentation is ſpent; it is again renued.</p>
            <p>But the Circulation of the Blood is not only quickened by the Contractions of the Heart; but alſo by the frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeated Contractions of the Muſcles: For the Heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting ſends it out into the muſculous Parts; and again, thoſe Muſcles drive it ſooner
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47305:88"/>
and more forcibly back upon the Heart; from whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that both the Heat of the Blood is encreaſed, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often fermented in thoſe Glandules, and conſequently, that it depends on the Mixture and Fermentation of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, and Arterial Blood.</p>
            <p>From hence it is manifeſt, how far Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is beneficial,<note place="margin">Fermentation &amp; Circulation mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally depend on one another.</note> in carrying on the Heat of the Blood; and if we conſider the Reaſon, which I have given of Muſcular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we ſhall ſee, that as Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation depends on Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Motion, ſo Muſcular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends on Fermentation; ſo that, as I ſaid before, there
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47305:88"/>
is a continual Chain and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of Cauſes as well as Humors in a Man's Body.</p>
            <p>To proceed therefore to the ſecond <hi>Objection,</hi> I ſuppoſed ſome<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The ſecond</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection <hi>anſwered,</hi> viz. <hi>That Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſo ſhort a time as the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of the Blood admits.</hi>
               </note> might raiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation can be carried on, in ſo ſhort a time as a continual and quick Circulation will admit: This does not only appear Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible from evident Matter of Fact; but alſo if we conſider, that in much leſs Time than what is allowed for Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Glandules, if a Spark of Fire be put to Gun-powder, it immediately puts it's Parts into an Exploſion; and that the Blood
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47305:89"/>
not only ferments in ſo ſhort a time, but that it may prepare that ſubtile Matter, which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates through the Muſcular Fibres, we may, with a great deal of Reaſon believe, if we do but take notice; that warm Milk, if it be but forcibly milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Vinegar, it preſently is ſeparated into two Parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> Curd and Whey. If then by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two Liquors, they cauſe ſo great a Change on one another; I cannot conceive any Reaſon, why Part of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, fermenting with the Blood, may not as ſoon be mixed with ſome Part of the rarified <hi>Succus Nutritius,</hi> and forced forward into the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:47305:89"/>But from what I have ſaid, it appearing, that<note place="margin">The Blood is more powerfully fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Heart than in any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Part of the Body beſides.</note> the Heat of the Blood Is cauſed in the Glandules by Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and how it is continued in the Muſculous Parts; I ſhall in the next Place conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in what Parts it is moſt vigorouſly fermented; which will appear only by conſidering where the Spirits are moſt plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully laid down; for if Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation depends on, and is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſed by, the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, as I have ſhewn; then it muſt needs follow, that the Heat of the Blood is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in thoſe Parts, where Animal Spirits are moſt predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47305:90"/>
And having proved that in order to prepare that ſubtile Liquor, which cauſes Contractions of the Muſcles, a greater Quantity of Animal Spirits is ſent there, it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Blood grows hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, being moſt vigorouſly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in thoſe Parts that are in Motion; and then it will follow, that the Heart being a Part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in conſtant Motion, and that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeding from a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Supply of Spirits, the Blood muſt needs acquire the moſt conſiderable Degree of Heat, in the Subſtance of it.</p>
            <p>But although I ſay that the Blood, for theſe Reaſons, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a greater Heat in the Heart, then in any other Part; I would not be thought to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47305:90"/>
mean, that it grows hot ſo in the Ventricles of the Heart: For the Uſe of the Heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to force the Blood out of it, and by dilating to receive it in again, for another Expulſion, and ſo to keep it in Circulation, it can get no great Heat there; ſince it wants Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to ferment with it; but I only mean, that conſidering the Subſtance and Dimenſions of the Muſcular Part of the Heart, and that ſmall Portion of Blood contained in the Arteries diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through it, that that Blood acquires a greater Heat than that Quantity of Blood does in another Part, that is not in Motion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:47305:91"/>But there being, beſides Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Parts, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Fermentation is not only promoted in the Muſcular Parts, but alſo in the internal Bowels.</note> conſiderable Internal Parts, in a Man's Body, in which a great Number of Blood Veſſels are diſtributed, it perhaps will be asked, whether Fermentation be carried on in theſe too? To which I anſwer, that Animal Spirits and Arterial Blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either mediately or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, laid down in them all, there muſt needs be a Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; which being proved, upon ſuch Premiſes, by what I have already ſaid, there is no need I ſhould repeat it again.</p>
            <p>But ſince Anatomiſts have not as yet diſcovered Nerves to be diſtributed through the

            <p>From what I have hitherto ſaid, it appears, what are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to continue the Heat of the Blood; and alſo, what is the Cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:47305:92"/>For <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Animal Spirits and Blood<note place="margin">Three things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to continue the Heat of the Blood.</note> ſhould be in a continual Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forcibly driven together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Particles might be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marely mixed one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

            <p>Having then explained the Heat of the Blood, and proved it agreeable to theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; I am for the Reaſons, before mentioned, perſwaded to believe, that the Heat of the Blood thus proceeds from Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>

            <head>OF THE USE OF THE LUNGS.</head>
            <p>FOR as much as appears from the Books of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Learned Men; the Uſe of the Lungs hath not been hitherto indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, no more than the Uſe of other Parts: For as there are ſeveral Opinions concerning
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47305:94"/>
others, ſo there are no leſs Diſputes about this; whilſt ſome would have it to be, only a ſort of Fan to cool and air the Blood: And others, that it was deſigned to kindle and put the Blood into a Flame, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſupplying it with Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</p>
            <p>Whether of theſe is moſt probable, may eaſily be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by conſidering the Effects that Air hath upon us: For ſince the Air is continually drawn in, and thruſt out again, in Reſpiration, any one that does but know, what Effects it hath upon himſelf, cannot be ignorant of the Uſe of the Lungs, in reſpect of the Heat of the Blood, evidently find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf cooled by it; and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47305:94"/>
if any one, that, by daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, finds that it cools him, can conclude thence, that it kindles and promotes the Heat of the Blood, he may be pleaſed with his Notion, but no Body elſe will with ſuch as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict ſelf-evident Truth.</p>
            <p>But that it may appear, how far the Lungs may be ſaid to be a Fan or <hi>Ventilabrum</hi> to the Blood; and whether the Air promotes the Heat of it or not; I ſhall take this Method; <hi>First,</hi> conſider the Uſe of the Lungs with reſpect to the Rational Soul; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:47305:95"/>The Uſe of the Lungs, with a more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Reſpect to<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Lungs in Reſpect of the Soul.</note> the Soul, appears to be nothing elſe, but as a large capacious Veſſel, endued with a Cavity, to contain a great Quantity of Air: ſo that it performs the ſame Office in the Body, as a Pair of Bellows to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: For as in Organs, the Bellows ſupply Pipes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſizes with Air, and that being driven through them, produces different Sounds; ſo the Lungs dilated and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Motion of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi> and being full of Air, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; and accordingly as the <hi>Pharinx</hi> and it's Parts are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently modulated; ſo the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:47305:95"/>
Air forcibly driven through them, cauſes different Voices.</p>
            <p>In which Action, the Lungs ſeem chiefly to be an Organ<note place="margin">Is to expreſs all it's Conceptions and Reaſoning.</note> made, on purpoſe, to be ſerviceable to the rational Soul, to expreſs all it's Conceptions and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and to form Voices or Articulate Sounds, to ſignifie thoſe Notions contained in, and apprehended by, it; that thoſe Things, which muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe remain in ſilence, might be communicated, to promote a mutual Commerce and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation amongſt Men.</p>
            <p>But here ſome may ask, if it be chiefly deſigned to form articulate Sounds, as it really ſeems to be, why do we take
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47305:96"/>
our Breath continually? Or why are our Spirits conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, by keeping the Part in a perpetual Motion? Since ſometimes we uſe it very little for a long time, to expreſs any Thing by; one half of our Lives, and the larger too, being paſſed away in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>To which it may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, the Lungs<note place="margin">Why the Lungs ought to be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Motion is becauſe.</note> ſhould be in a conſtant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Motion, that they might be kept in readineſs, to expreſs what and whenever, we have a Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:47305:96"/>Another Reaſon is, that ſince the Cavities of the Lungs, are<note place="margin">It carries off that Superfluous Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture that ſupplies them.</note> conſtantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, with a ſerous <hi>Lympha,</hi> to moiſten their Coats, and to moderate the Acrimony of the Air, it is neceſſary there ſhould be a conſtant and continual Reſpiration, to carry that ſerous <hi>Lympha</hi> off; which would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſtuff up the Bladders of the Lungs, that they would be incapable of receiving Air; but every Inſpiration, that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Moiſture being mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and incorporated with the Air, is by every Expiration carried off; which prevents thoſe ill Conſequences, which would otherwiſe follow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:47305:97"/>Another Reaſon why the Lungs ought to be always in<note place="margin">And that their voluntary Motion might leſs Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally affect our Bodies.</note> Motion, is, leaſt they ſhould Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and diſturb the Conſtitution of our Bodies, when put in Motion, as we have a mind to expreſs our ſelves; for if the Lungs were at other times quiet and ſtill, our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies would be put into ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, by violent and ſudden Motions, that we ſhould be as unfit to diſcourſe of any thing, as one that's in a Fit of the <hi>Epilepſie;</hi> but our Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſtomed to it, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made agreeable and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with Circulation of the Blood; becomes leſs trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47305:97"/>
when we have occaſion for Extraordinary Reſpirations.</p>
            <p>For theſe Reaſons it is plain, why the Lungs ought to be in a continual Reciprocal Motion, the firſt of which is ſelf-evident and needs no further Proof; and the ſecond is ſufficiently evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Conſequences, that follow, when this <hi>Lympha</hi> is not evacuated.</p>
            <p>When it is too thick, or too much in Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">What Effects it cauſes when too thick, and alſo why thick foggy Air is troubleſom to ſome People.</note> ſide, the Air, which we breath is too thick and moiſt; and it is not duly carried off; there follow Obſtructions of the <hi>Ducts</hi> of the <hi>Trachea</hi> from whence proceed Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms

            <p>For when it is too thick, it ſticks faſt to the Coats of the Lungs, and not being eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough mixed and incorporated with the Air, the Quantity of it encreaſes; till it ſtuffs up the Cavity of the Lungs; and when it is too much in Quantity, though it be thin enough; yet the Air being not able to carry it off faſt enough, it runs down the ſides of thoſe tender Veſſels, and by a gentle Irritation, raiſes a tickling Cough: <hi>Laſtly,</hi> when the Humor, that moiſtens the

            <p>But if we conſider further the Uſe of the Lungs, with reſpect to<note place="margin">The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Lungs in reſpect of the Body.</note> the Body; we ſhall find other Reaſons, not only why it ſhould be in a conſtant Motion; but
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47305:99"/>
alſo, we may underſtand, why we cannot live without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual and free Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>For in reſpect of the Body, the Lungs ſeem in ſome Meaſure<note place="margin">Seems to be to perform the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of another Heart.</note> to perform the Office of another Heart; and as the left Ventricle of the Heart contracting, ſends out the Blood into all the Parts of the Body, by the Ramifications of the Sanguiferous Veſſels, ſo the Lungs contracting, force the Blood, contained in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous Veſſels, which are diſtributed through their Lobes, into the left Ventricle of the Heart; and the left Ventricle being by that means more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47305:99"/>
dilated, and more plentifully filled with Blood: a larger Quantity of it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out into the <hi>Aorta;</hi> and conſequently the Blood in the Branches of the <hi>Aorta</hi> is more copiouſly preſſed by ſubſequent Matter into the Roots of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> and ſo forwards, into the right Ventricle of the Heart; ſo that by the help of the Lungs, the Dilation of the left Ventricle of the Heart is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and the Dilation of the right mediately promoted.</p>
            <p>That the Lungs thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Dilation of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of the Heart, it is very reaſonable to believe, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it is ſelf-evident, but becauſe, otherwiſe it will be very hard to conceive,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47305:100"/>
ſince the Motion of the Heart is only Contraction, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it's Ventricles only a Ceſſation from that Motion, how the Blood is forced into them with Vigour enough to diſtend their Cavities.</p>
            <p>For there is ſo little Reaſon to expect, that they ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late of their own Accord; that we ſhould rather believe, they would be continually contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince all the Weight of Blood contained in the whole Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Veſſels of the Lungs, could not poſſibly dilate them without ſome other force to help it, for the Subſtance of the Heart being contracted, and the Cavity of the left Ventricle ſo
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47305:100"/>
conſiderably diminiſhed, ſo ſmall a Portion of blood as hath Liberty to preſs againſt it's Orifice would make but a weak Preſſure and much too ſmall to dilate the Ventricle in ſo little time as intervenes the ſucceſſive Contraction, beſides the Heart having no Tendency at all to dilate it ſelf, ſince that would make it unapt to yield to Contractions, we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that a Part of ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance cannot eaſily be dilated but would require ſome Force greater then can be ſupplyed by an inconſiderable Preſſure of Blood faintly intruded by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing at all.</p>
            <p>But the Lungs being almoſt in a continual Contraction, in reſpect of the Sanguiferous
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47305:101"/>
Veſſels, and conſequently ſqueezing out the Blood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, help to dilate and extend the Left Cavity of the Heart, and conſequently the Right.</p>
            <p>That the Dilation of the Ventricles of the Heart is only a<note place="margin">By helping the Blood to force vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently enough into the Cavities to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend them againſt the next Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Reſolution or Ceſſation from Contraction, is allowed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon; to prove then, that the <hi>Venal</hi> Blood cannot return with Force ſufficient to dilate the Right Ventricle of the Heart; nor is ſufficiently able duly to extend the Left, in order to the next Contraction, by that force it received from, and was put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47305:101"/>
by the former Contraction, but is aſſiſted by the Lungs, we may eaſily perceive: For not only the Blood in it's Veſſels, but even any Liquor, being forced through Pipes, whoſe Cavities encreaſe the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they run from their nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſmall Original, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moves with leſs force the farther it goes: So that although in every <hi>Systole,</hi> the Blood ſhould be forced forwards from the left Ventricle, by a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Preſſure of ſubſequent Matter; and the Motion ſhould be ſtrong enough to make it circulate briskly through the narrow and capillary Twigs of the Arteries; yet when it
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47305:102"/>
came into the Veins, it would move much more ſlow, and by that time it came to the Heart again, would want Force ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to dilate the right Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and the right Ventricle being not duly dilated, ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Blood would be ſqueezed into the Lungs, that the Left would want a Supply of Blood to dilate it, and conſequently the Preſſure of Blood through the <hi>Aorta</hi> and <hi>Vena Cava</hi> would be ſo weak, that the next Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Right Ventricle would be weaker than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſo Circulation would gradually decreaſe.</p>
            <p>But that weak Motion of the Blood into the Right Ventricle, being encreaſed by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47305:102"/>
the Force of ſubſequent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Left, the Motion of the Blood into the Lungs is conſequently more plentiful, and as it paſſes through them is violently forced into the Left and ſo on; and by that means, as I ſaid before, the Lungs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend the Left immediately and conſequently the Right me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
            <p>That the Motion of the Blood is thus weakned by ſo long a Courſe in the Veins is further evinced; if a Vein and Artery be open'd at once; for the Blood runs out of the Artery much more forcibly; and indeed, it would be reaſonable to think it ſo, though it were not manifeſt by ſo plain an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment; for if Water in a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47305:103"/>
Ciſtern be put into a violent Motion at one end, the further it runs along, the leſs violent is the Force of it.</p>
            <p>And it is further evident, that the Motion of the Lungs does<note place="margin">How ſtopping the Breath of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal kills it.</note> aſſiſt the Dilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heart; as I have ſhewed by ſtopping the Breath of any Animal, which for want of free Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation preſently dies, and not becauſe the Flame of the Blood is by that means extinguiſhed; for as long as the Lungs duly perform Reſpiration, and the Heart violently contracts, and drives the Blood contained in it's Ventricles forcibly out, that Motion of the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a continued waving Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47305:103"/>
decreaſed, is enabled by the Aſſiſtance of the Motion of the Lungs, to dilate the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of the Heart, with a ſufficient Quantity of Blood, to be forced out the next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; but as ſoon as the Lungs ceaſe to aſſiſt the languid Motion of the Blood in dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Ventricles, it is not only leſs plentifully forced ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively thus into the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Heart, but by a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Preſſure of the Contents of them thruſt out, each ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pulſation; the Arterial Blood is leſs plentifully driven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; ſo that the whole Maſs circulates flower by degrees, and alſo the Animal Spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven leſs violently into the Muſcles (that Supply of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47305:104"/>
Spirits ſeparated in the corti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Part of the Brain, being not ſo powerfully thurſt after by an equal Succeſſion of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) the Fermentation in the Glands is weaker, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the following Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions gradually decline both in Number and Vigour, till at the laſt they<note place="margin">Why by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to breath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood is renued.</note> ceaſe. But if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood be quite ſtopped, that Animal be again permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to breath; the contractive Force of the Lungs drive Blood more forcibly into the left Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Heart; ſo that the next Pulſation a greater Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Blood is forced into the Arteries, which makes a more
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47305:104"/>
conſiderable Protruſion of Blood into the Muſcular Glands, and alſo of Spirits through the Nerves; by which means, the <hi>Thorax</hi> contracting more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, forces the Blood in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quantities into the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart; and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart at the ſame time increaſing, raiſes Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to it's natural Force, by ſqueezing Blood forwards into the Right and ſo ſucceſſively.</p>
            <p>From hence it appears, that the Blood is forced into the Ventricles of the Heart by the help of the Lungs; for if, when the Motion of the Lungs is obſtructed, the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the Heart ceaſeth in a ſhort time; it muſt needs follow, that it is in ſome
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47305:105"/>
meaſure preſerved in that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by them, and it is further proved, becauſe the Motion of the Heart, does not only ſooner ſtop, when Reſpiration ceaſes; but alſo, becauſe it is increaſed by a renued Reſpiration; and any one that would be further ſatisfied of the Truth of it, let him hold his Breath a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, and he will find his Pulſe gradually decay, which is again renued by reiterated Breathing.</p>
            <p>But though from hence it may appear, that<note place="margin">How the Motion of the Heart is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in an Infant unborn.</note> the Motion of the Heart is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Lungs; yet it perhaps may be a Queſtion, how this Defect is ſupply'd in
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47305:105"/>
unborn Infants; and how their Blood circulates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince then their Lungs do not perform the Office of Reſpiration.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that in an Infant before Birth, the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa</hi> ſupplys that Defect; for that additional Force which the Infants Blood receives, from the Motion of Nouriſhment, violently forced into the Umbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Veſſels, by the Pulſation of thoſe Arteries, that ſeparate it from the Mother's Blood in the Womb, do prove equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and ſupply the Office of the other; but as ſoon as the Circulation of the Blood cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be promoted by a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and Protruſion of that Juice, it immediately, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, dies; and after it is born
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47305:106"/>
hath a continual Neceſſity of Breathing, as long as it lives.</p>
            <p>Where it is to be noted, that as in one that breaths, the Lungs more immediately aſſiſt the left Ventricle, ſo in one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, the <hi>Placenta</hi> more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately promotes the Dilation of the right.</p>
            <p>Now although it from hence appears, that the Motion of the Heart is promoted, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal Motion of the Lungs, yet it does not wholly depend upon it, for if it did, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart would as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtop, as that of the Lungs; but ſince it does but partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, Circulation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines by degrees upon the ſtopping of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:47305:106"/>But that it may be better underſtood, how the Lungs, promote Circulation, I ſhall next ſhew, that the ſanguife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Veſſels in the Lungs, are not only contracted by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the <hi>Thorax;</hi> but alſo in every Inſpiration.</p>
            <p>And ſince it is known, that the Bladders of the Lungs are encompaſſed about with the ſmall Twigs and minute Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of ſanguiferous Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; every <hi>Syſtole</hi> of the right Ventricle of the Heart, theſe muſt needs be filled and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtended with Blood; and if ſo, conſequently that Blood muſt needs be forced by the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> through the <hi>Vena Arterioſa</hi> with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Force; and ſo be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47305:107"/>
into the left Ventricle of the Heart with more caſe, where we may by the way take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the Blood in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria Venoſa</hi> from the Orifice of the right Ventricle, is not only by that means thruſt into the minute Veſſels of the Lungs more eaſily, but alſo the Blood, that is to be forced forwards by the next Pulſation is more readily received by the <hi>Vena Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terioſa,</hi> and the Ventricle more eaſily contracting (when the Veſſels of the Lungs are thus emptied by a Contraction of the <hi>Thorax</hi> than if they were diſtended) that ſubſequent Matter in the depending Parts is received and driven after it with leſs difficulty, the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that diſtended Veſſels
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47305:107"/>
would make to the Egreſs of it, being thus prevented by the help of the Lungs.</p>
            <p>That the Blood is thus forced out of the Lungs into the Ventricle of the Heart, is not only evident from Reaſon, but alſo Experience; for in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Coughing, where the Lungs are almoſt in a continual Contraction, the Blood is more violently driven into the Habit of the Body; that it is forced into the Face viſibly appears; and that it alſo flows into the Habit of the Body is evident, in People that are let Blood, which by coughing much, is plentifully forced out of the Orifice; and that the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Lungs in cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can no otherwiſe force the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47305:108"/>
Blood into the Habit of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but through the left Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle is very plain, and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> that not only the left Ventricle is by that means further dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but conſequently the right, by the Aſſiſtance of the Lungs is manifeſt, becauſe Circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is preſently quickned by coughing; ſo that this one <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> proves all that I have aſſerted concerning the Uſe of the Lungs with reſpect to the Heart.</p>
            <p>But it may here alſo be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned; how the Lungs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Heart in Inſpiration, when the Cavities of the Lungs are dilated?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that though the Cavities of the Lungs are dilated in Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47305:108"/>
yet the Bladders which are ſwelled and dilated with Air, even then, make a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Preſſure upon, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Contraction of, the Blood Veſſels, that are about them.</p>
            <p>But though there were no ſuch Contraction upon Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet the Dilation of the <hi>Thorax</hi> is not ſo long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that the Lungs renue the vigorous Contractions of the Heart, before they are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly decreaſed; as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore explained it.</p>
            <p>From what I have ſaid, of the Uſe of the<note place="margin">The Office of the Lungs is partly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary.</note> Lungs with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Soul, as well as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47305:109"/>
of the Heart, it appears, that the Lungs perform a Sort of a mixed Action; partly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and partly involuntary; with reſpect to the Body, it is involuntary, being carry'd on whether we will or not, and when we are able to take no notice of it; and with reſpect to the Soul, voluntary, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Power to quicken or remit the Motion of them, differently to modulate our Voices, as occaſion and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity require, or our own Will inclines us.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe extraordinary Offices it performs in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both a Circulation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and of Diſcourſe; ſince there is ſuch a great Quantity of Air drawn in by every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47305:109"/>
it muſt needs produce ſome Effects in the Maſs of Blood; and thoſe Humors that circulate along with it; and ſince it is ſo minutely mixed with it, by the ſmall and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Windings of the Blood Veſſels about the Bladders of the <hi>Trachea;</hi> the Blood muſt needs be ſufficiently impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Nitrous Particles.</p>
            <p>But it being a Queſtion, how the Nitre of the Air comes to be mixed with the Blood, and whether the Air it ſelf be mixed with it alſo, before I proceed to ſhew how the Maſs of Blood is affected by it, I ſhall endeavour to ſolve theſe two Queſtions. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Air it ſelf is no otherwiſe mixed with the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47305:110"/>
Maſs of Blood, but as I have ſhew'd, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſtinct Veſſels in which each run is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we don't perceive the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it in that Maſs, and alſo we may probably gueſs ſo, becauſe Air would hinder Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation and much diſturb it: Air being always unapt to mix with Liquids and to fly from their Embraces, there being therefore theſe Reaſons, why it ought not to be mixed with the Blood, and none that it ſhou'd, nor any Sign of it being ſo, we have Reaſon to conclude that it is not. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That thoſe Nitrous Particles which ſwim in the Air, are mixed with it, we ſee manifeſtly by the Effects, which
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47305:110"/>
are cauſed by them, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Alterations in ſome Meaſure made in the Blood as it paſſes through th Lungs, as when expoſed to the open Air.</p>
            <p>But, the Queſtion then will be, how the Nitre of the Air is mixed with the Maſs of Blood, and by what means. To which it may be anſwered, that if we conſider what fine and ſubtile Bodies, thoſe Particles of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre are, which we draw in by Inſpiration; and through what minute and ſmall Pores, they are capable of paſſing, ſo that they penetrate the moſt ſolid Bodies in Nature; well may we ſuppoſe that they can find Pores fine enough to paſs through the Coats of the Veſſels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:47305:111"/>That they paſs through the moſt compact and ſolid Bodies; Bodies that are much more cloſe and leſs Porous, than the Veſſels of the Lungs are, is certain; for otherwiſe, hot Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in a brazen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel would never grow cold, and that the ſubſtance of Braſs is leſs porous than the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Lungs, no thing is leſs dubious.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ſince that the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Particles of the Air are conveighed into the Blood, is ſo plain from the Effects that are there cauſed by them, they muſt needs be conveighed through thoſe Pores, there being no other ways at all for them to paſs by. But,</p>
            <p>Another Queſtion which may
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47305:111"/>
perhaps be asked, will be, how the Nitrous Particles of the Air are forced through thoſe Pores; which will be eaſily underſtood, by taking notice, that when the <hi>Thorax</hi> is violently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, the Air contained in the <hi>Bronchia,</hi> being violently preſſed together, in order to an Expulſion of it, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Number of thoſe Particles of Nitre muſt needs be preſſed through thoſe Pores, that are wide enough to receive them, and that there are Pores wide enough, is viſible from what I have ſaid.</p>
            <p>It appearing hence, how the Nitre of the Air is mixed with the Blood, I ſhall next conſider how it affects it, and what Effects it produces in reſpect of Heat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:47305:112"/>To underſtand then the Effects that it hath upon all that Maſs of Humors, that circulates through the Veins and Arteries, to wit, Blood and ſerous <hi>Lympha,</hi> we are to conſider them both together, and apart; together, that it may appear how they influence each other; and a part, that we may know, for what end each is impregnated with thoſe Nitrous Particles; and becauſe when we are acquainted how it alters each ſingly, it will better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how they influence each other; I ſhall firſt conſider them apart.</p>
            <p>The Effects then, which we perceive the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre<note place="margin">What Effects the Air hath upon the Maſs of Blood.</note> of the Air hath upon our
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47305:112"/>
Blood, and the Alterations we are ſenſible it produces, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of it's Colour or Heat.</p>
            <p>That the Air alters the Colour of the Blood,<note place="margin">In reſpect of it's Colour.</note> and makes it more florid, is very plain in extravaſated Blood, and is ſo commonly known, that I need not take any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notice of it, but ſhall ſhew what other Effects it cauſes in the Blood, and how.</p>
            <p>Having therefore explained the Heat of the Blood, in the foregoing Treatiſe, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing that it is cauſed by a ſwift and violent Agitation of the Particles of the Spirits and Maſs of Blood; the way to underſtand, how Nitre affects
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47305:113"/>
the Heat of the Blood is to conſider how it promotes, or hinders, the Motion of thoſe Parts of Matter, which cauſe Heat, which, as I conceive, and as Reaſon ſeems to evince, is performed after this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>The Nitre of the Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,<note place="margin">Nitre depreſſes the Heat of the Blood.</note> not at all inclined to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but on the contrary, diſpoſing thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies they are mixed with to reſt, except by accident, when they are too powerfully reſiſted and oppoſed; Theſe, I ſay, being mixed with the Maſs of Blood, inviſcate and fetter up the moſt ſubtile Spirituous Parts, and hinder them from Motion; by
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47305:113"/>
which means, the more groſs ones are moved more ſlow, and the Heat of the Blood conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently abated; but when the Maſs of Blood is ſo Elaſtick, and the Parts of it move ſo ſtrong, that the Nitre cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them ſufficiently, and check them, the Heat of the Blood is increaſed; the Motion of thoſe Parts being inverted.</p>
            <p>That the Nitre of the Air inclines thoſe Bodies to reſt, with which it is mixed, and conſequently the Blood, is not evident only by expoſing hot Water, to a cold freezing Air, but even Blood; and nothing is leſs dubious than that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Cold extinguiſhes a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Heat.</p>

not powerful enough to check and extinguiſh the Heat of the Blood, does increaſe it, I have before explained, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it does it; and alſo, that it hath never thoſe Acci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dental Effects upon Liquids, except by hindring the fierce volatile Parts which ought to be diſſipated, from flying away through the Pores of the Skin, which being increaſed thereby to too great a Quantity, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate the Maſs of Blood too much,</p>
            <p>From hence it breifly, yet plainly, appears, that the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the Air alters the Colour of the Blood; and alſo ſerves to temper the Heat of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:47305:114"/>I ſhall now conſider, what Effects it hath upon the ſerous<note place="margin">

            <p>This is ſo ſtrongly proved, both by <hi>Non-Naturals</hi> and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that to deny it would be to contradict Reaſon, and plead Ignorance of thoſe Things it is almoſt impoſſible for us not to take notice of; for if we

            <p>How Beneficial Nitre is in Precipitating the <hi>Serum</hi> of the Blood, and what Advantages the
