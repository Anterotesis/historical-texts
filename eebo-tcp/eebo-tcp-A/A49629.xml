         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

they purſued them, and in the chaſe they killed ſome ſixty
of them, and if the musketiers had come in, there had beene

diſcerne a great body of the enemy making towards us
from old bridge, and as we came towards our main body,
which all the while remained entire, we could ſee a great
number of the enemy marching in good aray towards our
body; but before we could come up, though we road

Lord <hi>Moores,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> in the firſt; the horſe
had no ſooner retreated to the body, but we could diſcerne
Colonells <hi>Mac Brians</hi> men hard by us, the ſight of them
drew us to a beliefe that we ſhould have a hot fight now
with both the diviſions, thoſe that before had fled to Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
having rallied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves into a body again, &amp; that with
ſuch celerity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as was to be wondred at, but howſoever they
let us depart quietly, &amp; we came ſeaſonably into the town,
for had we ſtaied a little longer, ſome 800. of the enemy
had got betwixt us and the towne, and then we had been
engaged to fight with all their diviſions, which did conſiſt
of 1500. or 1600. men at leaſt.</p>
            <p>Upon the 24. being Saint <hi>Matthias,</hi> moſt hppily ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

hoped that famine ſhould force us to yeeld up the Towne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they had two peeces of Ordinance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a world of mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets

ſhips came up ſafely to the Key without the loſſe of one

<pb facs="tcp:64504:5"/>
500. of the enemy had entred the Towne of Tradagh,
and the whole groſſe of them without, making all haſte to
enter in at an old low doore, which by the treachery of
ſome of the towneſmen, who are not as yet certainely
knowne, was broken open for them; it was a ſtrange
thing to heare, for the aire ecchoed with their helliſh cries,
being entred, and the allarum taken, they were forthwith
encountred in ſeverall p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ces, a great number of them made
for the mill mount, the only ſtrength of the Towne, where
Captaine <hi>Cadogan</hi> kept his guard, it was darke, and a man
could not well diſtinguiſh betweene a friend and a foe;
the enemy immediately upon their advancing up the hill,
laid Captaine <hi>Cadogans</hi> out centries dead, which hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
from the hill, cauſed fire to bee given at them,
which they perceiving to be hot, faced about, and as they
were taking themſelves to their heeles, Captaine <hi>Cadogan</hi>
arreſted their leader with a musket from the mount, who
being pilladged, was found to be an officer, the reſt fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of their plot ran into orchards &amp; gardens, where they
were cut in peeces by Cap. <hi>Owens</hi> men, and their companies
being encountred by the governours owne men, and Sir
<hi>Thomas Lucas</hi> his horſe were quite broken and routed, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other companies comming in, they were ſlaine and
taken, or the greateſt part of them: one Captaine <hi>Conner</hi> a
Meath man was ſlain, &amp; amongſt others an old traiterous
ſervant of Captaine <hi>Cadogans;</hi> divers of the Captaines and
others are concealed by the Towneſmen in their houſes,
and although upon perill of their lives they were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to bring them forth, yet they have hitherto failed.</p>
            <p>It was a happy deliverance, for which we are bound to
give God thankes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for truly had any underſtanding ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

two or three footmen, and very few hurt, but ſo ſoone as
day appeared, with our great and ſmall ſhot were beaten
from our wales like dogges. Captaine <hi>Roper</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Morice</hi> had like to have beene taken by them, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the enemy upon their entrance to be our own men;
truly both officers and ſouldiers behaved themſelves like
men, they were both valiant and reſolute, ſo that wee
are confident the rebellious blades will not bee very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to come to ſuch another breakefaſt as this in haſte.</p>
            <p>This day came Sir <hi>Philemon Oneale</hi> from the f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

he was as we hope and beleeve very well beaten by the
Scotchmen, but we have no certainty of it as yet. As I am
a Gentleman all this is true, you may report this to the
whole world. So I take my leave, deſiring thee to pray
for us, and we will fight for thee and the reſt, not doubting
but that our God whom we ſerve, will ſtill ſo bleſſe us and
