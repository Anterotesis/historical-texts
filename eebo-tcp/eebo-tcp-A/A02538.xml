            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

a moderation, wherein

Chriſtianity giues not

his future eſtate, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
ſuch perhaps I was
borne, but ſince that time
I haue beene borne again
&amp; my ſecond natiuitie
hath croſſed my firſt.
The power of nature is
a good plea for thoſe that
acknowledge nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
nature. But for a
Chriſtian to excuſe his
intemperatenes by his
naturall inclination, and
to ſay I am borne
cholericke, ſullen, amo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous,
is an Apologie
worſe then the faulte.
Wherefore ſerues religion
but to ſubdue or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19617:37"/>
nature? Wee
are ſo much Chriſtians
as we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rule our ſelues,
the reſt is but forme, and

that (like vnto that

caſt into this ſea it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwayeth
thoſe inward
tempeſtes, that were

The vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate

capable of this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and therefore
through the continuall
mutinyes of his paſſions
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19617:38"/>
cannot but be ſubiect to
perpetuall vnquietneſſe.
There is neither remedy
nor hope in this eſtate:
But the chriſtian ſoule

exerciſes of true mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,

For inſtance; I

It is pittie that a bad

The ſumme of my

All the while I liue in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet

At laſt that I may bee

Before I coulde not bee

euill, is in this one

vs; that cannot
bee deceyued? But thou
knoweſt that other thou
deſireſt, better then what
thou haſt; Better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
for him that hath
it, not better for thee:
Libertye is ſweete and
profitable to thoſe that
can vſe it; But fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are better for the
frantick man: Wine is
good nouriſhment for
the healthfull, poyſon
to the aguiſh; It is
good for a ſound body
to ſleep in a whole skin,
but he that complains of
ſwelling ſores ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſleep

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
deadly; As in diets ſo
in eſtimation of good &amp;
euill, of greater and leſſer
good; there is much vari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ety:
All palats commend
not one diſh, and what
one commends for moſt
delicate, another reiects
for vnſauory. And if
thou know what diſh is
moſt pleaſant to thee, thy
Phyſician knowes beſt
which is wholeſome:
Thou wouldſt follow
thine appetite too much
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19617:108"/>
and (as the French haue
in their prouerb) woldſt
dig thy owne graue with
thy teeth; thy wiſe phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
ouerſees &amp; ouerrules
thee: He ſees if thou wert
more eſteemed, thou
wouldſt bee proude, if
more ſtrong, licentious, if
richer, couetous, if health
fuller, more ſecure; But
thou thinkeſt not thus
hardly of thy ſelfe Fond
man, what knoweſt thou
futur things? beleue thou
him that onely knowes
what would bee, what
will bee; Thou wouldſt
willingly go to heauen,
what better guide canſt
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19617:109"/>
thou haue, then him that
dwels there? If he lead
thee thorough deepe
ſloughes, and brackie
thickets, know that he
knowes this the neerer
way though more cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome:
can there be
in him any want of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
not to foreſee the
beſt? Can there be any
want of power not to
effect the beſt? Any want
of loue not to giue thee
what he knowes is beſt?
How canſt thou then
faile of the beſt? Since
what his power can doe,
and what his wiſedome
ſees ſhould be done, his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19617:109"/>
loue hath done, becauſe
all are infinite: He wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not things becauſe
they are good, but they
are good becauſe hee
wils them: Yea if ought
had beene better, this
had not beene; God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
what he doth, and if
thy will accord not with
his, whether wilt thou
condemne of imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>

to ſpeake freely, I haue

fatall vnquietnes, liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

no more ioy then if wee
were vnder no other

One droupeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

augments a ſmall ſorrow

cannot complaine of any

So wee liue not

onely for that wee want
either wiſedome, or

Let riches or honour

Yea there is no

to this end: VVee
abhorre the patience

our deſert and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

our aunſwers are
coy and ouerly, ſuch as
we giue to thoſe clients
that look to gaine by our
fauors. If our want were
through the ſcarcity of
good, we might yet hope
for pittye to eaſe vs, but
now that it is through
negligence, and that wee
periſh with our hands in
our boſome, wee are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19617:112"/>
