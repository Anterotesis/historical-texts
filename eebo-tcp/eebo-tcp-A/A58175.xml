         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Death of
that Reverend
and Worthy
Prelate, <hi>John</hi>
Lord Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> to
whom the Dedication of this
Work was intended, ſeveral
weighty conſiderations indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
me to recommend it to your
<pb facs="tcp:98511:3"/>
Patronage. As firſt, that I
might thereby take occaſion
publicly to own my Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to you, and profeſs my
gratitude. 2. Becauſe having
been much aſſiſted in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling
thereof by your Notes
and Communications; you have
ſo great intereſt in it, that
it's but equal I ſhould preſent
you with it. 3. Having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
conſtantly in your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
during my continuance
beyond the Seas, you are well
acquainted with moſt of the
particulars therein delivered,
and can atteſt the truth of
them if any one ſhould queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or deny it. As for the Work
it ſelf, my firſt deſign was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>outlandiſh</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:98511:3"/>
Plants <hi>of my own diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
ſuch as grew wild be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea, and were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to us in <hi>England.</hi> The
<hi>Engliſh Obſervations</hi> are but
an acceſſion to the <hi>Catalogue,</hi>
and intended only to help de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Preſs of that.
Wherefore being hudled up
in ſome haſte, upon a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
peruſal of them I find
the Phraſe and Language in
many places leſs ornate, and
in ſome ſcarce congruous. But
my main aim having been to
render all things perſpicuous
and intelligible (which I hope
I have in ſome meaſure effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted)
I was leſs attentive to
Grammatical and Euphonical
niceties. The <hi>Catalogue</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:98511:4"/>
have had already ſome years
by me, deferring the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, becauſe I ſtill
entertain'd ſome thoughts of
making another Voyage beyond
the Seas; and then I doubt
not but I ſhould have augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it by the addition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Plants, with their Virtues
and uſes. But now the Death
of Friends and other Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that have lately befallen
me beſides my Age having cut
off my hopes, and well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
not to ſay quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
my deſires of further
Travelling, I have ventured
it abroad as it is, and ſubmit
it to the cenſure of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
and Candid Reader.
If either <hi>Catalogue</hi> or <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:98511:4"/>
prove any ways uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the Public, by afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
matter of Information, or
if nothing elſe innocent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion

I have what I deſire, and as
much as I can reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
                  <p>But to detein you no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
I am not ſo ignorant of
my own Abilities, or ſo well
conceited of any Compoſition

Honour by this Dedication;

to my Book and procure it
acceptance in the World. Be

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I had Travelled
over the greateſt part
of <hi>England</hi> in ſearch
of Plants, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
informed
my ſelf what ſorts
my own Countrey naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
I grew deſirous to ſee what
Varieties Foreign Countries of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Soil and Temperature of Air
might afford. For which reaſon I
was eaſily induced to accompany
<hi>Francis Willughby</hi> Eſquire, <hi>Philip Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon</hi>
Eſquire and <hi>Nathanael Bacon</hi> Gent.
in a Voyage beyond the Seas. The
ſucceſs whereof, as to the number
of Plants found, exceeding my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
(notwithſtanding the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our ſtay in moſt places gave
<pb facs="tcp:98511:6"/>
me not leave to make an exact ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny)
I thought it might not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
for the ſatisfaction of the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and direction of thoſe who may
heerafter travel the ſame places with
like deſign, to publiſh a Catalogue
of all not native of <hi>England</hi> that I
had obſerved. But conſidering the
paucity of thoſe who delight in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and enquiries of this nature, to
advantage the Catalogue I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thereto a brief Narrative of our
whole Voyage, with ſome <hi>Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Topographical, Moral and Natural,</hi>
made by my ſelf and the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Gentlemen. I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to recommend them, but only
that what I write as of mine own
knowledge is punctually and in all
circumſtances true, at leaſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my apprehenſion and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I not giving my ſelf that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which many Travellers are wont
to take, and the common Proverb
ſeems to allow them. And for what
I write from the Relation of
<pb facs="tcp:98511:6"/>
others, though I will not warrant it
for certain, yet to me it ſeemed moſt
likely and probable. What Birds,
Beaſts, Fiſhes and Inſects I obſerved
abroad, whether common to us in
<hi>England,</hi> or peculiar to other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
I have forborn to ſet down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the taking notice and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of them was the particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
and buſineſs of that excellent
perſon Mr. <hi>Francis Willughby</hi> lately
deceaſed; and he having prepared ſtore
of materials for a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi>
and likewiſe digeſted them into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
method, that work (if God
grant leiſure and ability to bring it to
due perfection) is intended to be made
public, and the Reader may there find
what is heer omitted.</p>
                  <p>I might have been more large
concerning <hi>France</hi> but that we were
fruſtrated in our deſign of making
<hi>Grand tour</hi> (as they there call it) being
driven out thence by the <hi>Fr. Kings</hi>
Declaration, commanding all the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> to withdraw themſelves and
<pb facs="tcp:98511:7"/>
their effects out of his Dominions
within two months time. And yet
that Country being near us, much
travelled by and well known to thoſe
of our Nation, and there being many
Itineraries and Deſcriptions of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in Print, I thought it leſs needful
to write much concerning it.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Spain,</hi> it being a Countrey
out of the ordinary road of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and thoſe that have viewed it
gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ng others little encouragement to
follow their example, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
themſelves for their curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as having found nothing there
which might anſwer their trouble
and expence, that the Reader may
know ſomething of it without the
hazard and charge of travelling it, I
have added by way of <hi>Appendix</hi> a ſhort
account of Mr. <hi>Francis Willughby</hi>'s
Voyage through a great part of it,
collected out of his notes; which had
he himſelf publiſhed he would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
have enriched with more Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and cloathed with better Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:98511:7"/>
Now whereas in the <hi>Narrative,</hi>
diſcourſing concerning the petrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Shells, Fiſh-bones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
have delivered as my opinion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
that thoſe bodies, which are
commonly known in <hi>England</hi> by the
names of <hi>Star-Stones</hi> and <hi>S. Cutberts
Beads,</hi> were nothing elſe but the ſpines
and tail-bones of ſome Fiſhes, I muſt
own my ſelf to have been therein mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.
For my learned and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Friend Mr. <hi>Martin Liſter</hi> hath
lately adviſed me, that he hath found
of them ramoſe and branched like
trees: which doth ſufficiently evince
they were not of that original I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
Wherefore unleſs we will grant
them to be primary and immediate
productions of Nature, as they are
in the form of ſtones; we muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>'s opinion, that they
were the roots of ſome Plants;
though I confeſs I never as yet ſaw any
Roots or Branches ſhaped and joynted
in that manner. Poſſibly there may
be or have been ſuch kind of ſubma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
<pb facs="tcp:98511:8"/>
Plants or Roots which have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
eſcaped my knowledge. For
that the parts not only of Trees but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of Herbs themſelves may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
petrifie, the ſtalks of <hi>Equiſetum</hi>

when it was taken, till the laſt year

<hi>Anno</hi> 1596. it was taken by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under
Arch-Duke <hi>Albert</hi> in three days time, only the
Caſtle held out ſeven or eight. And laſt of all, <hi>Anno</hi>
1598. it was reſtored to the <hi>French</hi> upon the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

fortified after the modern faſhion with an impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
Wall and Baſtions of Earth, a deep Trench

The new Wall and Citadel were built about 44
years ſince. The old Stone-Wall and Ditch are ſtill

The Buildings of the Town are not tall, but hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom

exactly level and ſtreight. And it is no wonder
they ſhould be ſo, the preſent Town having been
contrived and ſet out all at once. For when it was

Siege of three years, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found nothing

a large <hi>Axis</hi> deeply furrowed, from which it hangs
down into a Well of Water, and being turned about
by the <hi>Axis,</hi> the deſcending Buckets have their
mouths downward, and take up Water as they paſs
through the Well; which (aſcending with their
mouths upward, but a little inclining from the

This kind of Machin is generally uſed in <hi>Italy,

their Gardens in Summer time. The deep Furrows
in the <hi>Axis</hi> are to catch hold of the Buckets, that the

                  <p>Near this City (as <hi>Boetius de Boot,</hi> who was Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
thereof relates) digging ten or twenty Ells deep
in the Earth, they find whole Woods of Trees, in
which the Trunks, Boughs and Leaves do ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear, that one may eaſily diſtinguiſh the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
kinds of them, and very plainly diſcern the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Leaves which have fallen yearly. Theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous
Woods are found in thoſe places which
500 years ago were Sea, and afterwards either left
and thrown up by the Sea, or gained from it, the
Tides being kept off by Walls and Fences. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fore-mentioned term of 500 years, there
is no memory that theſe places were part of the
Continent. And yet ſeeing the tops of theſe Trees
do for the moſt part lie Eaſtward, becauſe (as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
they were thrown down by Weſtern Winds,
which on this Coaſt are moſt boiſterous and violent,
it will neceſſarily follow that in the moſt antient
times and before all memory of man, theſe places
were Firm Land, and without the limits of the
Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Deſcriber of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> tells us, that in
<hi>Frieſfland</hi> and <hi>Groningland,</hi> there are great numbers
of theſe under-ground Trees found and digged up
in Moſſes and fenny Grounds where they dig for
Turves. In <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gland</hi> alſo there are found of them
plentifully in many places, the Wood whereof
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98511:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they uſually call <hi>Moſs-Wood,</hi> becauſe it is for the
moſt part digged up in the Moſſes or mooriſh boggy
Fens and Levels where they get Turves; though
ſometimes it be found in firmer Grounds, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the ſides of Mountains. The Queſtion is,
How theſe Trees came to be buried ſo deep under
ground? To which we may probably anſwer, that
many Ages ago before all Records of Antiquity, yea
before primitive Fame or Tradition itſelf, theſe
places were part of the firm Land, and covered
with Wood; afterwards being undermined and
overwhelmed by the violence of the Sea, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſo long under water, till the Rivers brought
down Earth and Mud enough to cover the Trees,
fill up theſe Shallows, and reſtore them to the firm
Land again. In like manner upon the Coaſt of
<hi>Suffolk</hi> about <hi>Dunwich,</hi> the Sea doth now and hath
for many years paſt very much encroached upon the
Land, undermining and overwhelming by degrees
a great deal of high ground; inſomuch that anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Writings make mention of a Wood a mile and
half to the Eaſt of <hi>Dunwich,</hi> which is at preſent ſo
far within the Sea. Now if in ſucceeding Ages (as
likely enough it is) the Sea ſhall by degrees be filled
up, either by its own working, or by Earth brought
down by Land-Floods ſtill ſubſiding to the bottom,
and growing up over the tops of theſe Trees, and ſo
this ſpace again added to the firm Land; the men that
ſhall then live in thoſe parts (if the World ſo long laſt)
will, it's likely, dig up theſe Trees, and as much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how they came there, as we do at the preſent
Moſs-Wood.</p>
                  <p>And now that I am ſpeaking of filling up and
atterrating (to borrow that word of the <hi>Italians</hi>) the
Skirts and Borders of the Sea, I ſhall take leave to
add by the by, that to me it ſeems very probable,
that all the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> have been in this manner
gained from the Sea. For <hi>Varenius</hi> in his Geography
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98511:14"/>
tells us, That ſinking Well in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> at near
an hundred foot depth they met with a Bed or Floor
of Sand and Cockle-ſhells, whence it is evident that
of old time the bottom of the Sea lay ſo deep, and
that that hundred foot thickneſs of Faith above the
Sand aroſe from the Sediments of the Waters of
thoſe great Rivers, which there emptied themſelves
into the Sea, and in times of Floods brought down
with them abundance of Earth from the upper
Grounds: Which yet is a ſtrange thing, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the novity of the World, the Age whereof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the uſual Account is not yet 5600 years.
That the Rain doth continually waſh down Earth
from the Mountains, and atterrate or add part of
the Sea to the firm Land, is manifeſt from the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gune</hi>
or Flats about <hi>Venice;</hi> the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>amdrg</hi> or Iſle of the
River <hi>Rhoſue</hi> about <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> in which we
were told that the Watch-Tower had in the memory
of ſome men been removed forward three times, ſo
much had been there gained from the Sea; and many
places in our own Land: only it is a received Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and may perhaps be true, that what the Sea loſes in
one place, it gets in another. That the height of the

rocks, doth continually diminiſh, is I think very likely,
not to ſay certain. I have been credibly informed, that
whereas the Steeple of <hi>Craich</hi> in the <hi>Peak of Derby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>
in the memory of ſome old men yet living
could not have been ſeen from a certain Hill lying
between <hi>Hopton</hi> and <hi>Wirksworth,</hi> now not only
the Steeple, but a great part of the Body of the
Church may from thence be ſeen: Which without
doubt comes to paſs by the ſinking of a Hill between
the Church and place of View. Hence it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that in proceſs, of time (but it would be many
thouſands of years firſt) all the Hills and Mountains
(except the rocky) would by Floods and Shots of
Rain be quite waſhed away and the whole Earth le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled.</p>

But to return to the Trees: One material Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt our Solution ſtill remains, and that is,
that a great many of theſe ſubterraneous Trees dig'd
up in <hi>England</hi> are thought to be Firs, whereas that
kind of Tree doth not at preſent, and conſequently
we have reaſon to believe never did, grow wild
in this Kingdom. To which I anſwer, that this
Exception would indeed much puzzle me, were
it certain and manifeſt, that this is Fir-Wood,
which is ſo generally reputed from its Grain, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammability

not clearly appear to me ſo to be, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite

The ſeveral Faculties are diſtinguiſhed by their
Habits: Divinity-Students wear conſtantly Gowns
and ſquare Caps; thoſe of other Faculties wear
none, except at their publick Exerciſes in the Schools.
The principal Colleges, called <hi>Pedagogies,</hi> are four.
In theſe only is Philoſophy taught by two Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
the one called <hi>Primarius,</hi> the other <hi>Secunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
Thoſe Students that are Gentlemen ſit in a
higher Form, called <hi>Scamnum Nobilium;</hi> and give
each of them ſix Gilders quarterly to the <hi>Primarius</hi>
Profeſſor, and two Patacoons to the <hi>Secundarius.</hi>
Thoſe of inſeriour rank who ſit in the lower Forms
give half ſo much to each. The <hi>Primarius</hi> reads in
the morning from half an hour after ſix of the clock
till half an hour after ſeven, then they go to Maſs
till eight, and after that to their private Studies
till ten, then the Profeſſor reads again till eleven.
In the afternoon the <hi>Secundarius</hi> Profeſſor reads
from half an hour after one, till half an hour after
two. He begins again half an hour after four and
reads till half an hour after five. All Students muſt
write after the Profeſſors in a large Note-Book, and
in the intervals of Lectures peruſe and ſtudy what
they wrote. The Profeſſors Readings are divided into
<hi>Dictata,</hi> which are Theſes or Propoſitions, and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notata</hi>
which are Solutions of Objections. The firſt
thing they require of Students when they come to this
Univerſity is to be matriculated, and ſwear their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of all the Doctrines of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. The
Cloſe or End of the Oath is the ſame with that of
our Univerſities, <hi>Ita me Deus adjuvet &amp; haec ſancta Dei
Evangelia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Young Students give their Names to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of their College or Pedagogy, and for every
time they are abſent from Lectures are puniſhed
a Stiver, which is ſomewhat more than a Penny
<hi>Engliſh.</hi> For every time they miſs a publick
Exerciſe in Law or Phyſick they pay three Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98511:19"/>
if they be to exerciſe themſelves and miſs,
they are mulcted twenty Stivers. The Students
are not allowed to wear Swords about the
Streets.</p>
                  <p>The Profeſſors of each Pedagogy chuſe yearly 12
of the beſt Scholars who are of two years ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Theſe 48 are publickly examined, and out of
them about 12 uſually choſen to Burſes or Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The Burſes ſignifie their Diet, Chamber
and a greater or leſs Stipend according as the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are. It is very creditable to be choſen to a
Burſe. He that is the firſt of the choſen hath a
Bell rung for him in his College 48 hours together
without intermiſſion. When they are thus choſen,
they may go into what College they will and ſtudy
what they pleaſe. They are commonly preferred
to Profeſſorſhips and afterwards to Canons Places.
The Degrees here conferred are <hi>Batchelour,</hi> Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
and <hi>Doctor.</hi> In <hi>Divinity</hi> after two years ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they may be <hi>Baccalaurei ourrentes,</hi> after another
year <hi>Baccalaurei formati.</hi> Seven years after this
they may be <hi>Licentiates</hi> in Divinity. They are
ſeldom created <hi>Doctors</hi> till they attain to 50 years of
Age, unleſs they be very eminent for Learning.
Every <hi>Batchelor</hi> is called <hi>Doctiſſimus: A Licentiate</hi> in
Medicine <hi>Peritiſſimus,</hi> in Law <hi>Conſultiſſimus,</hi> in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
<hi>Eximius: Doctors</hi> of Medicine and Law are
<hi>Clariſſimi,</hi> of Divinity <hi>Eximii</hi> Domini &amp; <hi>Magiſtri noſtri.</hi>
When any one goes out <hi>Licentiate,</hi> there is a Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>Hence <hi>May</hi> 5. we boated to <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Antwerp</note> a City for
Strength and Beauty comparable to any of its big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in <hi>Europe.</hi> For the latter in my opinion, it
much excels <hi>Florence,</hi> with which it is wont to be
put in competition. And for the former, it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98511:20"/>
with a Wall of Earth faced with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
of that thickneſs that there are ſeveral Rows
of Trees and broad Walks upon it; and with a
Ditch of water of a very great depth and breadth,
excepting on that ſide the River <hi>Scheld</hi> waſhes it.
So that, conſidering alſo the advantage of its Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in a low and level Countrey, it ſeemed to me
the ſtrongeſt City in all the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> The Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
firſt built by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and afterward
repaired by the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> of a Pentagonal
Figure, ſerves as well to bridle as defend the Town.
The Houſes of <hi>Antwerp</hi> are for the moſt part of
Brick, ſome few wooden ones of the antient Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here and there remaining, which the Owners
are not ſuffered to repair. The Chappel of the
<hi>Jeſuites</hi> College is very rich and ſumptuous. The
Steeple of S. <hi>Maries</hi> Church is ſo curiouſly built and
carved, that the Emperour <hi>Charles V.</hi> (as we were
told) was wont to ſay, that it deſerved to be kept
in a caſe and ſhewn only upon Holy-days. The
<hi>Exchange</hi> or <hi>Burſe</hi> was the Pattern after which our
old <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> was built, but in all reſpects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to it, the Copy excelling the Original. The
<hi>Stadthouſe</hi> is a magnificent Structure. Several

we reach'd <hi>Middleburgh</hi> before Sun-ſet, having
made in all this day about 54 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Flats we paſſed over, at a good diſtance

Sands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Middleburgh</hi> is the capital City of <hi>Zealand,</hi> large,<note place="margin">Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</note>
well-built, having ſpatious Streets, populous, full

as ſome have fondly imagined. From that
ſide the Iſland reſpecting <hi>Antwerp</hi> is an artificial
Chanel cut up to the Town, capable of Ships of
good burthen, which come into the Town, the
ſaid Chanel paſſing through and making Havens in
three or four of the Streets. There are (as we

in this City, the <hi>Lutherans, French, Anabaptiſts</hi> and
<hi>Jews</hi> being here tolerated and allowed places of

two Eagles kept, which we were told the Citizens
were obliged to by their Charter, by which they have
great Immunities granted them by the Emperour, as
Freedom from Arreſts any where but in their own

a Town for bigneſs inferiour to <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,

back through <hi>Armuyden,</hi> a ſmall Town con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of one Street, yet entrench'd about. Here
hath been formerly a good Trade driven. By the

kind of matting of Ruſhes or Flags ſtaked down as
high as the Tide uſually ariſes, to defend them
from being waſhed away by the Water.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 21. we travelled to <hi>Breda,</hi>

with very thick Walls and Mounts of
Earth and two Trenches full of Water, the one
broad and deep: At our Entrance in we paſſed
through two Ports, and over five Draw-Bridges.
It belongs to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who hath a
Caſtle and a fair Palace in the Town. Here are
maintained in Garriſon for defence of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Strength thirteen Companies of Foot, two

all Boats laden with Commodities that enter here
by ſtabbing them through in ſundry places with a
Spit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 22. we travelled from <hi>Breda</hi> firſt to S. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudenberg,</hi>

The Streets elegantly paved, in the middle with

ſet edgeways, ſo clean that a man may walk them
in Slippers without wetting his foot in the midſt

the Streets of all the Cities and great Towns in

                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 23. we took places in one of the Paſſage-Boats

ſome three Leagues diſtant from <hi>Dort,</hi> which

it to have been. It equals if not exceeds any City

It hath been lately much augmented by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

it turneth over a Leaf. The Citizens of <hi>Roterdam</hi>
exerciſe no Handicraft or Manufacture to trade
withal, but all their Riches proceed from their Sea-Trade

Port, Ships of great Burthen coming up in deep
Chanels into the very Town: where they lie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

they call the <hi>Vroetſchap.</hi> Theſe chuſe all publick
Officers out of their own number. Themſelves
continue in place during life, and when any one

but the Students live in private Lodgings in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98511:28"/>
the Town, where they can beſt provide themſelves.
No Scholaſtical Habits as Gowns or Caps worn by
any of the Students, but they walk up and down,
come to the Schools, and perform their Exerciſes
in Cloaks. The Profeſſors when they read Lectures
or preſide at Diſputations wear Gowns. No cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Profeſſors or Univerſity-Officers in the publick
Schools, but all the Students are covered both at
Lectures and Diſputations, not only in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
but in all the Univerſities we have been at
beyond the Seas. If an deſire to be admitted of
the Univerſity, they go to the <hi>Rector magnificus,</hi> who
gives them each a Seal, and then they are freed
from paying Exeiſe. The Students uſually liſt
themſelves under ſome Profeſſor, who reads to
them in private, running through a whole Faculty,
which they call <hi>Collegium inſtituere,</hi> and for this they
give a Gratuity to the Profeſſor. In conferring
Degrees here is no Reſpect had to Standing.
When any one intends to commence in any Faculty,
he makes <hi>Theſes</hi> upon the Subject he intends to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
which <hi>Theſes</hi> are printed, and theſe he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to defend againſt all Opponents. The Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
hath his Seat under the Proſeſſors, as in our
Schools: for the Opponents there is no particular
Seat, but in any part of the Schools where they
happen to be, they ariſe and there ſtand and oppoſe,
firſt asking leave of the Profeſſor that preſides at
the Act. Any one that pleaſes may oppoſe with
the Profeſſors leave. <hi>Liberalium Artium Magiſter</hi>
and Doctor are the only Degrees conferred here.
Each of the Profeſſors have 200 or 300 <hi>l. per an.</hi>
stipend allowed them by the States.</p>

Alarm. Below ſtands a Guard of thirty armed
Soldiers, and at each Port ten. Every hour of the
night a man goes about the Streets, and making a
noiſe with a Rapper, tells with a loud voice what
of the Clock it is. In the Anatomical Theater are

                  <p>Before we left <hi>Leyden</hi> we made a by-Journey to
<hi>Sevenhuys,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huys.</note> a Village about four leagues diſtant, to
ſee a remarkable Grove, where in time of year ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſorts of Wild-Fowl build and breed. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
there in great numbers (1.) <hi>Scholfers</hi> i. e.
<hi>Gracculi palmipedes,</hi> in <hi>England</hi> we call them <hi>Shags,</hi>
they are very like to Cormorants, only leſs. We
were much ſurpriſed to ſee them, being a whole-footed
Bird, alight and build upon Trees. (2.) <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelaers,</hi>
called by <hi>Geſner Plateoe ſive Pelecani,</hi> by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus
Albardeolae,</hi> we may term them in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Spoon-Bills. (3.) <hi>Quacks</hi> or <hi>Ardeae cinereae
minores,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> call this Bird the <hi>Night-raven,</hi>
becauſe it makes a noiſe in the Night, <hi>Nocte cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat
voce abſonâ &amp; tanquam vomiturientis.</hi> Geſner.
(4.) <hi>Reyers</hi> or Herons. Each ſort of Fowl hath its
ſeveral Quarter. When the young are ripe, they
who farm the Grove with an Iron Hook faſtned to
the end of a long Pole lay hold on the Bough on
which the Neſt is built, aud ſhake the young ones
out, and ſometimes Neſt and all down to the ground.
Beſides the fore-mentioned Birds there build alſo in
this Wood <hi>Ravens, Wood-Pigeons</hi> and <hi>Turtle-Doves.</hi>
This place is rented for 3000 Gilders <hi>per Annum</hi> of
the Baron of <hi>Pelemberg,</hi> who lives at <hi>Lovain,</hi> only
for the Birds and Graſs. By the way to this Place
we obſerved in the Ditches <hi>Lyſimachia lutea flore glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſo,</hi>
and <hi>Arum ſive Dracunculus aquaticus.</hi> All the
Countrey about <hi>Sevenhuys</hi> towards <hi>Leyden</hi> is a flat
or fenny Level, full of ſhallow Pools of Water;
there we obſerved their manner of making Turf.
They rake or fiſh up Mud from the bottom of the
Water with a Net like a Hoop-Net faſtned to the
end of a Pole, and fill therewith a flat-bottomed
Boat. Out of the Boat they throw this Mud with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98511:29"/>
a long Shovel or Scoop on an even piece of ground,
making of it a Bed of an equal thickneſs ſo near as
they can; there it lies to drain and dry: After a
while they tread it with broad Boards faſtned under
their feet to make it cloſe and ſmooth. When it
is moderately dry, they cut the whole Bed with a
kind of Spade into pieces of the bigneſs of a Brick.
Theſe they pile up in ſmall conical Stacks or long
Ranks, laying the Turves ſo, that a man may ſee
through the Stacks, and the Wind blow through
them, to be further dried. At laſt they houſe them
in Barns that are thatcht, the ſides not walled up
cloſe, but made of wooden Bars ſet at a little diſtance
one from another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> 6. we took Boat for <hi>Haerlem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Haerlem.</note> where we
arrived at four hours end. This is a large, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and pleaſant City, ſtrongly wall'd and entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
Water is brought through many of the
Streets. Without the Walls towards <hi>Leyden</hi> are
pleaſant Groves. In the Summer-Houſe in the
Garden of the Princes Court here, is a Picture of
<hi>Laurentius Coſterus,</hi> in a furr'd Gown, holding the

the Market-place, mentioned by <hi>Hegenitius,</hi> we
could not find, being as we were told, lately bought
and removed thence. The Butchery of this Town
is a handſome Building and covered with Lead,
which we thought not unworthy the notice-taking,
it having been the firſt publick Building that we ſaw
ſo rooft ſince we left <hi>England.</hi> The Citizens here
drive a great Trade of Weaving as well Silks, <hi>v. g.</hi>
Damask, Velvet, Sattin, Taffaty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Linen

                     <hi>June</hi> 8. From <hi>Haerlem</hi> we boated to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>

                     </gap> About the mid-way we paſſed
by two great Mears where we changed our Boat.
At the Port of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſtand two armed Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
one within, the other without. This is the
greateſt City in all the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and one of
the richeſt and beſt traded Empories of the whole
World. At our being there we judged it to be
about the bigneſs of <hi>Venice,</hi> and leſſer than one half
of <hi>London;</hi> but they had then taken in and enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with a ſubſtantial Wall and Trench, a great
ſpace of Ground, wherein they had deſigned and
ſet out Streets, with intention to make their City
for bigneſs alſo comparable with the beſt of <hi>Europe,
London</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> not excepted. I hear ſince, that
this void Ground is filled with Rows of ſtately and
beautiful Houſes. The publick Buildings we eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
took notice of were, (1.) The <hi>New Stadthouſe</hi>
lately erected, the old one having been burnt down
to the Ground in three hours ſpace (as we were
told) <hi>June</hi> 7, 1651. but (as I find it in the Printed
Deſcription of <hi>Amſterdam</hi>) in <hi>July</hi> 1652. This is
a magnificent Pile of Building, of a ſquare figure,
large and tall. The Outſide or Facing of the Walls
round about is of Free-Stone, the body of the
Walls of Brick. It is reported, that the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Structure under ground coſt as much as
the <hi>Superficies</hi> above ground, <hi>viz.</hi> 100000 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling.
The Deſcriber of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſaith, that it ſtandeth
upon 13659 great Maſts or Piles driven into the
ground. (2.) The <hi>Burſe</hi> or <hi>Exchange,</hi> like our old
Royal Exchange at <hi>London,</hi> but not a perfect Square,
being longer than it is broad. The firſt Stone of

                  <p>In this Church is a ſtately Pulpit ſaid to have coſt
1000 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling the building. We were told that
in this City there were 24 Miniſters penſioned by
the States.</p>
                  <p>The Government is by a Scout or Praetor,<note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
                     </note> four
Burgomaſters, nine and Scabins, and 36 Counſellors, or
Senators, which they call the <hi>Vroetſchap.</hi> The <hi>Scout</hi>
is Stadtholder of <hi>Holland,</hi> ad hath the firſt place in
the Bench of <hi>Scabins.</hi> He is choſen to this Office by
the <hi>Burgomaſters</hi> with the conſent and approbation
of the <hi>Vroetſchap</hi> for three years: though he may
continue in Office ſix or more, if they ſee good.
He muſt have been a Freeman at leaſt ſeven years
fore he be choſen. His Office is with the <hi>Burgomaſters</hi>
and <hi>Scabins</hi> to make Laws and Conſtitutions: to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and impriſon all Malefactors within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of the City. He, as chief Judge in civil as well
as criminal Cauſes, hears the Pleadings, and with
conſent of the <hi>Burgomaſters Scabins</hi> pronounces
Sentence, condemning the guilty to Death, if the
Cauſe require, and taking care that the Sentence
be executed. In other Cities the <hi>Praetor</hi> hath to do
only in criminal Cauſes, being no more than the
Commonwealths Solicitor or publick Accuſer and
Proſecutor of Malefactors.</p>
                  <p>The number of <hi>Burgomaſters</hi> is twelve, whereof
four are <hi>regent</hi> yearly. They muſt not be under
forty years of age. Every year by the major Vote
of all the Burgomaſters that have ever been Scabins,
three out of the twelve are choſen to be Regents,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98511:31"/>
which three newly elect take to themſelves a fourth
out of the three choſen the year before, who gives
the three new ones their Oaths, and hath the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency
the three firſt Moneths. Out of the other
eight are other Officers choſen, as Treaſurers, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Hoſpitals; one for the Convention of the
States at the <hi>Hague;</hi> one for the Council of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty
in <hi>Amſterdam, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Burgomaſters</hi> Office
is to govern the City, to arbitrate differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
man and man, to take care of the Streets,
Walls, Houſes and publick Buildings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When
one of the twelve dies, another is choſen into his
room by the <hi>Vroetſchap.</hi> As for the <hi>Scabins,</hi> the
<hi>Vroetſchap</hi> chuſe fourteen perſons, out of which the
<hi>Burgomaſters</hi> take ſeven; but ſo that none of them
be near of kin to the <hi>Scout</hi> or the <hi>Regent Burgoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
To theſe ſeven the new and old <hi>Burgomaſters</hi>
with the new choſen <hi>Scabins</hi> do by moſt voices add
two out of the ſeven that were choſen the laſt year;
the which two for that year are the firſt and ſecond
Preſidents. The Scabins are Judges in all Cauſes
civil and criminal.</p>
                  <p>The Council of 36 or <hi>Vroe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

during Life, and when one dies the reſt chuſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
into his room, but none under 25 years of
age. This Council chuſes the fourteen Scabins, and
is aſſembled upon important occaſions by the
Burgomaſters for their Advice and Direction in
the weighty Affairs and Concerns of the City.
The Supreme Power ſeems chiefly to reſt in
theſe.</p>
                  <p>Formerly none was capable of being <hi>Burgomaſter</hi>
except his Father had been a Freeman a year and
ſix weeks before he was born; but of late they
have made a Conſtitution, that he who will pay
five hundred Gilders, may be made free of the
City, and capable of being Burgomaſter after ſeven
years. Any one may be made a Freeman for fifty
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98511:32"/>
Gilders, but then he ſhall never be capable of being
choſen <hi>Burgomaſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Deſcriber of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſaith that there were
in that City 18 years ago 54000 Houſes, whereas
in <hi>Paris</hi> there were then but 46000, which is a
thing by no means to be credited.</p>
                  <p>The Militia of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> conſiſts of 54 Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
divided into five Regiments, each containing
eleven Companies, and every Company conſiſting
of 150 men, ſo that the whole amounts to 8250.
Two Companies watch every night for the guard
of the City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> 16. we took Boat for <hi>Vtrecht,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vtrecht.</note> where we
arrived at ſix hours end. This is a great Town
and the head of a Province, environed with a thick
and high Wall and a deep Trench. The Streets
and Buildings far ſhort of the Elegancy, Beauty
and Cleanlineſs of thoſe in <hi>Holland;</hi> much like the
Houſes and Streets of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Towns. Water
runs through many of the Streets in deep Chanels.
The <hi>Domo</hi> or Cathedral Church hath a great tall
Tower, aſcended by 460 Steps, from whence we
had a fair Proſpect of the City and Countrey round
about. Here is an Univerſity erected by the States
of the United Provinces in the year 1636. Who

                     <note place="margin">Creve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeur.</note>
and not much further another called <hi>Engelen,</hi>
and after four hours came to the <hi>Boſch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Boſch.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Hertogen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſch</hi>
the Dutch call it, and the French <hi>Bois le duc,</hi>
i. e. <hi>Sylva Ducis.</hi> Before we entred the Town, we
paſſed through a Water and over two Draw Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
This Place is ſituate on a Hill in the midſt of
a low fenny Level of a great extent, the greateſt
part whereof is (at leaſt now was) covered with
Water, ſo that the only Avenues to the Town are
upon artificial Cauſways. It is encompaſſed with
a ſtrong Wall and a deep Trench. At one end
ſtands a Citadel ſtrongly fortified, which commands
the Town. By reaſon of its Situation and Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
one would judge this Place impregnable,
yet hath it been taken in the late Wars. At our
being there were kept in Garriſon for the Defence
of this important Strength 21 Companies of Foot
and four Troops of Horſe. In the Quire of S. <hi>Johns</hi>
Church are painted the Arms of many of the Knights
of the Golden Fleece and over the upper Stalls or
Seats this written in <hi>French, Le treshaut &amp; tres puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant</hi>
Philip, <hi>dit le bon, &amp;c.</hi> which becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the Hiſtory of the Authors firſt Inſtitution
and Model of this Order, I thought fit to tranſlate
into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and here ſet down. <q>The moſt High
and Mighty prince <hi>Philip</hi> called the Good, by the
Grace of God Duke of <hi>Burgundy, Lorain</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi>
in the year 1429. in the City of <hi>Bruges,</hi>
did in imitation of <hi>Gedeon</hi> create and inſtitute to
the Honour of God and the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and
for the ſake of <hi>S. Andrew</hi> Protector and Patron of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> a Company or Society of Honourable
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98511:34"/>
Knights, into which might be received Emperors,
Kings, Dukes, Marqueſſes and other Perſonages,
as well of his own Subjects as of forein Countries,
provided they were of Noble bloud and good fame:
and called theſe great Perſons, <hi>Knights of the Golden
Fleece,</hi> to whom he gave for perpetual Chief, him
that ſhould be lawful Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and have
the Seigneury or Lordſhip of the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
their number to 24, comprehending alſo the
Chief. And for occurrences and uſe of the Order
he created four Honourable Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> A Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
a Treaſurer, a Secretary, and a King of
Arms. And for the Eſtabliſhment and well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
of this Order he made notable Statutes and
Ordinances</q>. The Houſes of this Town are of a
different make from thoſe of <hi>Holland,</hi> the outſide
being covered with Boards, like thoſe of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
in <hi>Scotland.</hi> We obſerved great ſtore of wild
Fowl to frequent the Waters hereabout; and found
growing wild <hi>Herniaria hirſuta</hi> on the ſandy and
gravelly Banks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> 20. We took a Wagon drawn by three
Horſes abreaſt, as is uſual in theſe Countries, which
in ſix hours time brought us to <hi>Eindhoven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eindho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> a ſmall
wall'd Town; and thence in four hours more to <hi>Haumont.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</note> a pitiful walled Town belonging to the
Biſhop of <hi>Liege. June</hi> 21. Three hours Riding
brought us to another little wall'd Town called <hi>Bry;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bry.</note>
the Houſes whereof were old and decaying. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Haumont</hi> and this place, we rode over Heaths
of great extent, called the <hi>Champagne.</hi> We then
left the level Countrey and aſcended ſome Hills,
from whence we had a pleaſant Proſpect of the
<hi>Moſe</hi> and <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht.</note> where we arrived this Evening,
though it be accounted ſeven hours diſtant from
<hi>Bry.</hi> This City is fortified with good Outworks,
beſides a ſtrong Wall and Trench, garriſoned with
31 Companies of Foot, and ſix Troops of Horſe,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98511:35"/>
it being a great Town and a Frontier. Half of the
Magiſtrates are Proteſtants and half of the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Religion. The greater part of the Citizens <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts.</hi>
There are in Town near 20 Cloiſters or
Monaſteries of both Sexes; and they have the free
and publick Exerciſe of their Religious Worſhip.
For the Proteſtants there are three <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches,
and one <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> which thoſe Nations
uſe alternately. The old Buildings of his City are
like thoſe of the <hi>Boſch;</hi> but ſince the States have
been Maſters of it, it is become a rich and thriving
place, and they are building fair new brickt Houſes
space. They were alſo ſetting up a large Stone
Stadthouſe, of a ſquare Figure, reſembling that at
<hi>Ameſterdam.</hi> The River <hi>Meuſe</hi> divides the City into
two parts, which are joined together by a broad
ſtone-Bridge of nine Arches. The leſſer part over the
Water is called, <hi>Wick.</hi> The Garriſon-Soldiers are
all Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>The Common People of <hi>Holland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and particular Cuſtoms of the <hi>Low-Dutch.</hi>
                     </note> eſpecially Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers,
Wagoners (Foremen they call them) Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Porters are ſurly and uncivil. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goners
bait themſelves and their Horſes four or five
times in a days Journey. Generally the <hi>Dutch</hi> men
and women are almoſt always eating as they travel,
whether it be by Boat, Coach or Wagon. The men
are for the moſt part big-boned are groſs-bodied.
The firſt Diſh at Ordinaries and Entertainments is
uſually a Salade, <hi>Sla</hi> they call it, of which they eat
abundance in <hi>Holland.</hi> Their Meat they commonly
ſtew and make <hi>Hotchpots</hi> of it. Puddings neither
here nor in any place we have travelled beyond Sea
do they eat any, either not knowing the goodness
of the Diſh, or not having the Skill to make them:
<hi>Puddings</hi> and <hi>Brawm</hi> are Diſhes proper to <hi>England.</hi>
Boil'd Spinage minc'd and buttered (ſometimes alſo
with Currans added) is a great Diſh all over theſe
Countreys. The Common People feed much upon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98511:35"/>
                     <hi>Cabiliau</hi> (that is Cod-fiſh) and pickled Herrings,
which they know how to cure or prepare better than
we do in <hi>England.</hi> You ſhall ſeldome fail of hung
Beef in any Inn you come into, which they cut into
thin ſlices and eat with Bread and Butter, laying
the ſlices upon the Butter. They have four or five
ſorts of Cheeſe, three they uſually bring forth and
ſet before you. (1.) Thoſe great round Cheeſes,
coloured red on the outſide, commonly in <hi>England</hi>
called <hi>Holland</hi>-Cheeſes. (2.) Cummin-ſeed Cheeſe.
(3.) Green Cheeſe, ſaid to be ſo coloured with the
juice of Sheeps Dung. This they ſcrape upon Bread
buttered, and ſo eat. (4.) Sometimes <hi>Angelot's.</hi>
(5.) Cheeſe like to our common Countrey Cheeſe.
Milk is the cheapeſt of all Belly-Proviſions. Their
ſtrong Beer, (thick Beer they call it, and well they
may) is ſold for three Stivers the Quart, which is
more than three pence <hi>Engliſh.</hi> All manner of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
both Meat and Drink are very dear, not for
the Scarcity of ſuch Commodities, but partly by
reaſon of the great Exciſe and Impoſt wherewith they
are charged, partly by reaſon of the abundance of
Money that is ſtirring here. By the way we may
note, that the dearneſs of this ſort of Proviſions
is an argument of the Riches of a Town or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
theſe things being always cheapeſt in the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
places. Land is alſo here ſold at 30 or 40 years
Purchaſe, and yet both Houſes and Land ſet at very
high annual Rents: So that were not the poor
Workmen and Labourers well paid for their pains,
they could not poſſibly live. Their Beds are for the
moſt part like Cabbins, inconveniently ſhort and
narrow, and yet ſuch as they are, you pay in ſome
places ten Stivers a night the man for them, and in
moſt ſix. There is no way for a Stranger to deal
with Inn-keepers, Wagoners, Porters and Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but by bargaining with them before-hand.
Their Houſes in <hi>Holland</hi> are kept clean with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98511:36"/>
ordinary niceneſs; and the Entrance before the
Door curiouſly paved with Stone. All things both
within and without, Floor, Poſts, Walls, Glaſs,
Houſhold-ſtuff marvellouſly clean, bright, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly
kept: nay ſome are ſo extraordinarily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as to take down the very Tiles of their Pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes
and cleanſe them. Yet about the preparing
and dreſſing of their Victuals our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſwives
are, I think, more cleanly and curious than they.
So that no wonder <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were formerly noted
for exceſſive eating, they having greater temptation
to eat, both from the goodneſs of their Meat, and the
curioſity of the dreſſing it, than other nations.</p>
                  <p>In the principal Churches of <hi>Holland</hi> are Organs,
which uſually play for ſome time after the Sermon is
done. The Collections for the Poor are made in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-time,
a Purſe with a Bell hanging at the bottom
of it and faſtned to the end of a Pole being by the
Collector reach'd to every one. The Pſalm to be ſung
is marked upon Slates, which are hung up and down
the Churches. The People of theſe Countreys buy and
ſell ſmall Commodities, and travel by Wagon or Boat
upon the Lords Days. Their travelling Wagons are
ſome covered and ſome open: few travel on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back.
No Beggars to be ſeen in all <hi>Holland,</hi> care
being taken to ſet on work all that are able, and
Proviſion made for the aged and impotent. There
are in this one Province of <hi>Holland</hi> three or four
and twenty walled Towns and Cities, and ſix of
theſe at leaſt, beſide <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> bigger than any
we have in <hi>England</hi> except <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam</hi>
by this time well approaches to the Bigneſs of
<hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe I ſhall add ſome Obſervations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

In all the Cities and Towns of Note throughout
the <hi>Vnited Netherlands</hi> there is a continual Watch
kept night and day upon the higheſt Steeple, for
the more ready and ſpeedy diſcovery of Fires, or
other things of a ſurpriſing nature, which we
have already noted in our Deſcription of the City of
<hi>Leyden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Differences ariſing between Skippers and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are decided by caſting the Die: this we
often obſerved them to do, when ſeveral of them
ſtrove who ſhould carry us.</p>
                  <p>The Rain that falls upon the Houſes is by Pipes
and Gutters conveyed into a Ciſtern, and there
reſerved for the uſes of the Houſe, as at <hi>Venice</hi> in
<hi>Italy.</hi> This particular we have alſo before taken
notice of in the Deſcription of <hi>Leyden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The generality of the <hi>Dutch</hi> from the better ſort
to the meaneſt, do much dread their Superiours:
I think the cauſe is, becauſe upon Complaint made,
there is ſpeedy care taken to do Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The generality of the People of all ſorts are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given to the humour of running up and down to
ſee any new or ſtrange thing. The Common ſort
have any thing that is rich or gay in great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
inſomuch that when my Lord <hi>Holles</hi> made his
Entry into <hi>Breda,</hi> the Coronets that were on the
top of his Coach were talkt of with wonder all the
Countrey over.</p>
                  <p>The People univerſally are great lovers of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
very covetous and greedy of Gain, yet in their
Bargains punctual and juſt. The Knowledge of
moſt of them extends no further than the Arts of
getting Money, and an ability to talk of State-Affairs,
wherein you ſhall meet with mean perſons
very well ſeen: I think the Reaſon may be,
becauſe the loweſt of them is not without hopes
of coming to be a Burger, and at laſt one of the
States.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:98511:37"/>
I cannot allow the <hi>Low-Dutch</hi> to be of a valiant
and couragious temper generally, notwithſtanding
they fight ſo well at Sea; For the Conſtitution of
their Bodies which is Phlegmatic, and the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
of the Air which is moiſt, and their Diet
which is groſs and foggy, forbid it.</p>
                  <p>Yet are there few or none in theſe Countries that
die of Conſumptions.</p>
                  <p>There is Liberty of all Religions and Profeſſions,
but abundance of Spies to watch them, that they
diſturb not the publick Peace.</p>
                  <p>I think it harder to be a Traitor under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Holland</hi> than under any other Kingdom
or State, becauſe they ſeem to be more watchful
and ſuſpicious.</p>
                  <p>The People ſay and print what they pleaſe, and
call it Liberty.</p>
                  <p>The better, much more the worſe, ſort have
little ſenſe of Honour, governing themſelves more
by the Rules of Profit and Advantage, than of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity
and <hi>Decorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Murder is not proſecuted with ſo much diligence
and concern as Felony or Theft.</p>
                  <p>The times of the day for Marriages and Burials
are limited, but with difference is reſpect of places;
for at <hi>Breda</hi> they muſt bury their dead before 12
of the clock, and at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> not till the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.</p>
                  <p>When any famous Deed or Exploit is done by
any of their Nation, it is repreſented to the People
with all inſinuating circumſtances, to make them
proud of the Honour of being Subjects in a State
where ſuch mighty deeds are done. Beſides, for
encouragement there is for the moſt part a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Statue erected to the memory of them who
do great things.</p>
                  <p>Their Solemnizations of <hi>Victoirs,</hi> as they call
them, ſeems to me of great uſe, like Triumphs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98511:37"/>
among the <hi>Romans.</hi> For thoſe Bonfires and other
expreſſions of Joy do make glad the People, and give
them better thoughts of their Governours, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them to their ſervice.</p>
                  <p>In the ſervice of God the People ſeem more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
and concerned in that part of Worſhip
which conſiſts in ſinging than any other, and they
provide more for it. For in their Churches there
are few other Books among them than Pſalters bound
up with the Church-Catechiſm.</p>
                  <p>The common ſort of Women (not to ſay all)
ſeem more fond of and delighted with laſcivious
and obſcene Talk than either the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or the
<hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Women are ſaid not much to regard Chaſtity
while unmarried, but when once married none
more chaſt and true to their Husbands.</p>
                  <p>The Women even of the better ſort do upon
little Acquaintance eaſily admit ſaluting with a Kiſs:
and it is familiarly uſed among themſelves either
in Frolicks or upon Departures and Returns though
never ſo ſhort.</p>
                  <p>The Women are in a ſenſe Privy-Counſellors to

privy to all their Actions: and the Men ſeldom do
any thing without their Advice and Conſent. Yet
doth not this Indulgence enamour them of their
own Nation; for it is ſaid, that if a Woman can

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> when they ſee their Friends at the

                  <p>In moſt of the Cities and Towns in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
there are a great number of chiming little
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98511:38"/>
Bells which ſeldom reſt, but were to us trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
with their frequent Jangling. But for Rings

<hi>England</hi> alone, ſo that it might well be called the

                  </p>
                  <p>A multitude of Storks frequent theſe Countries,
building upon their Chimnies in the Towns and
Cities as well as Villages; but not in the Territories
of Common-wealths only (as ſome imagine) but
of Kings and Princes alſo, as at <hi>Lovain</hi> and elſewhere

                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> 22. we travelled from <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> to <hi>Liege</hi>
four Leagues diſtant. In the ſide of a Hill we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
at ſome diſtance from <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> we ſaw
an arched Paſſage into a Vault (as we were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
ſome two hours in length. A good way within
under ground they dig Stone which here they bring
out in Carts. It being a wet ſeaſon we made no
ſtay to go into this Vault, therefore I have added
here the Deſcription of it out of the <hi>Philoſophical
Tranſactions</hi> Numb. 67. pag. 2051.</p>
                  <p>There is an excellent Quarry within Cannon-ſhot
of <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> upon the very brink of the River
<hi>Maſe,</hi> lying in a Hill, where there are about 25
Fathoms of Rock and Earth over head; the length
of the Hill being of ſome miles extending along the
River towards <hi>Liege,</hi> ſituate on the ſame River;
and towards <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> having in breadth ſome half
or quarter of a mile, but ſomewhat more further
off. This Quarry hath one Entry towards the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
where Carts can paſs with great caſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load
the Stones upon the brink of the River, the
Quarry within lying parallel to the Horizon or
Level, (which is a great advantage) and elevated
but very little above the River. This ſame Quarry
which hath well nigh undermined the whole Hill,
affords one of the moſt ſurpriſing Proſpects, when
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98511:38"/>
well lighted with many Torches, that one can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
For there are thouſands of ſquare Pillars in
large level Walks, and thoſe almoſt every where
above twenty, and in ſome places many more foot
high, and all wrought with ſo much neatneſs and
regularity, that one would think it had been made
rather with curious Workmanſhip for an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
Palace, than that thoſe Pillars and Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were made by Quarriers that did it only for
getting Stone to build above ground. This Quarry
ſerveth the People that live thereabouts for a kind of
impregnable Retreat when Armies march that way.
For being acquainted with all the ways in it, they
carry into it whatſoever they would have ſafe, as
well their Horſe and Cattel as their moveable Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
till the danger be over, there being ſo vaſt
a deal of room, that 40000 people may ſhelter
themſelves in it. And he that ſhould attempt to
ſeek them out in this vaſt Wilderneſs of Walks and
Pillars, without an expert Guide, would not only
be in hazard of loſing his way, but of being knockt
on the head at the corner of every Pillar, where
People lurking in the dark with their Carbines and
Fowling-Pieces would have fair opportunity of
ſhooting at them by the Light of their own Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<hi>&amp;c. vide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further upon the Downs we ſaw three or four
more of theſe Paſſages, and from hence had again
a very pleaſant Proſpect of <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
about the River <hi>Moſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Liege</hi> or <hi>Luyck</hi> is a large City,<note place="margin">Liege.</note> but not comparable
to the <hi>Holland</hi> Towns for Beauty or Riches; built
for the moſt part of Timber; ſome of the Houſes
being covered with boards after the <hi>Scotch</hi> faſhion,
and ſome with Slate [the Walls I mean,] the reſt
uncovered and of Clay. The Streets are neither
broad not clean-kept. The River <hi>Moſe</hi> here divides
itſelf, and runs through the Town in two or three
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98511:39"/>
Branches, over which are ſeveral Bridges. Here
is a convenient Key, and upon the River we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Boats of an extraordinary length, the like
whereto we had before ſeen at <hi>Vtrecht</hi> and <hi>Dort.</hi>
This City is pleaſantly ſituate and environed almoſt
round with Hills. On the Brow of a Hill which
hangs over it, ſtands a Fort or Castle which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
it. Upon the ſides of theſe Hills are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Orchards and Cherry-Gardens: On thoſe
near the City we firſt ſaw Vineyards; though there
are near <hi>Lovain,</hi> which we ſaw not. All Belly-Proviſions
are cheap here. A great many of Poor
and Beggars you meet with at every corner, but
they are not importunate if denied. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
People are civil, well-manner'd and kind
to Strangers. The Women are of a dusky Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and generally not ſo handſom as the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi>
They do a great deal of Drudgery, the
poorer ſort carrying Coals and other Burthens on
their backs in Baskets of a Conical Figure, to the
end or bottom of which they apply a ſtiff Baſton,
and ſo reſt themſelves without ſetting down their
Burthens. Near this City are gotten Coals in great
plenty, but they lie very deep under ground; ſome
of us went down into a Pit 150 yards deep. The
Coal are like our Stone-Coal. The arts they uſe
to get Air enough to ſerve them in the bottom of
theſe Delfs ſee in the <hi>Philoſoph. Tranſact.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At <hi>Luyck</hi> they uſe alſo for Fewel a ſort of round
Balls made of Clay mixed with a certain proportion
of Coal, beaten ſmall, tempered together, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Sun, which they call <hi>Hotſhots.</hi> Theſe we
never ſaw uſed any where but here, though the
making of them is deſcribed in many Books. They
ſerve to ſlake the Heat of the Fire, and keep the
Coals from burning out too faſt. Here and at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi>
(as we were told) are made Stone-Pots and
Jugs. The Cathedral Church is dedicated to S. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>

The <hi>Clergy, Gentry</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> ſend their ſeveral

of Monaſteries or Religious Houſes as they call
them. In the Garden of the <hi>Engliſh Jeſuites</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege

a pleaſant little walled Town, though called a
Village, indifferently well built for a place ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote

                     <hi>June</hi> 28. From the <hi>Spaw</hi> we travelled to <hi>Aken,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</note>
paſſing through <hi>Limbourg</hi> three hours diſtant, a
Town conſiderable for its Strength, being ſituate
on the ſide of a Hill, and encompaſſed with a ſtrong
Wall and Trench; not for its Bigneſs, it conſiſting
only of one ſhort broad Street, nor for its Beauty,
the Buildings being all of Wood. The Garriſon at
our being there was about 300 Soldiers. Before
we entred the Town we were met upon the way by
ſome of theſe Soldiers, who very inſolently ſtopt
our Horſes, demanding Money of us, which we
were forced to give according to their diſcretion,
before they would let us paſs, which though it were
no conſiderable Sum, yet was more than we were
willing ſhould be violently extorted from us. When
we were paſt the Town, we met alſo with many of
theſe Straglers, by whom (it was told us) many Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries
are committed hereabout.</p>

                  <p>This City (according to the beſt information we
could get there,) is governed by a Maior, two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls
or Burgomaſters, fourteen Scabins and about
120 Senators or Counſellors. The Maior is Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the Scabins and executes their Sentences;
he is put in by the Duke of <hi>Gulick</hi> and continues du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Life, <hi>modò bene ſe geſſerit.</hi> The Conſuls are

the City, and continue two years <hi>modò bene ſe geſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint;</hi>
every year there is one choſen. One that is
no Senator may be choſen Conſul or Burgomaſter,
and yet theſe have the chief power. The Scabins
are Judges and continue during Life; when one of
them dies, the reſt chuſe another in his place. The
Senators are choſen by the ſeveral Companies, of
which there are about fourteen or fifteen in this
City. Every Company chuſes eight. Half the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
are yearly choſen. The Territory of this City
is large, containing about 200 Villages, and is for
the moſt part encompaſſed with Mountains. We
ſaw here the manner of making Braſs of Copper,
by mingling and melting therewith <hi>Lapis Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris,</hi>
which changes the colour thereof from red
to yellow, and increaſeth the weight by thirty in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98511:41"/>
the Hundred. But that for which this Place is
moſt remarkable, and from which it took its Name,
are the Hot Baths, of which there are ſeveral with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Walls and others without, at <hi>Borcet</hi> a great
Village leſs than an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile diſtant. The
Waters of <hi>Borcet</hi> at the Sources where they iſſue
out of the Earth are much hotter than thoſe of the
<hi>Bath</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the Springs more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
The People there told us, and I can eaſily
believe them, that they will ſerve to boil Eggs in.
Their Taſt ſeemed to us ſaltiſh. They are uſed
outwardly for Bathing, and taken inwardly
for many Diſeaſes. As we walked to <hi>Borcet</hi> we
could not but take notice of a Pool whoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were almoſt tepid by reaſon of a little Stream
from the Hot Baths running through it, wherein
we were aſſured were bred and fed good ſtore of
Fiſh, which are put into cold Water for a moneth

Aken, collected out of an Epiſtolary
Diſcourſe Publiſhed in French by
Francis Blondel, M. D.</head>
                              <p>NOt to trouble the Reader with the various Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of Antient and Modern Philoſophers
concerning the Cauſe of the actual Heat of natural
Baths, our Authors accompt thereof in reference
to theſe of <hi>Aken</hi> is in brief as follows.</p>
                              <p>Theſe Waters (ſaith he) paſſing through a certain
argillaceous Earth, pregnant with a kind of nitrous
Salt, almoſt of the ſame taſt with the Waters of the
Baths (which is to be found in good quantity in
the lands about this City) charge themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and ſo become a <hi>menſtruum</hi> capable of diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuch Minerals and Metals as are conteined in
the Veins of the Earth through which they run.
This Solution he conceives is made by piercing
and corroding the Minerals after the ſame manner
as Spirit of Nitre and other <hi>Aquae Stygiae</hi> are wont
to do, which uſually cauſes a great Ebullition and
Heat. So then the actual Heat of theſe Springs
proceeds from the Mixture and Encounter of their
Waters (impregnate as is before intimated) with
the Mineral and Metallic Subſtances, Juices and
Spirits conteined in the Veins of the Earth through
which they have their Courſe. The nitrous Salt
fore-mentioned may perhaps be the <hi>Hermetic</hi> Salt
of Monſieur <hi>Rochas,</hi> or the <hi>eſurine</hi> Salt of <hi>Helmont.</hi>
Now the Water once heated, being conteined in
the Vaults of the Mountains as in a Stove, continues
hot a long time, the Eruption thereof being, it is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98511:42"/>
likely, at a good diſtance from the place where it
did at firſt conceive its Heat.</p>
                              <p>At the long continuance and duration of the Heat
of theſe Waters for ſo many ages paſt no man need
wonder: For (1.) It is generally taken for granted
that all ſorts of Mines do grow and increaſe by
addition, converting the more refined, ſubtile part
of the Earth, and which hath a ſeminal diſpoſition
of ſuch a change, into their own nature. (2.) The
nitrous Salts, the firſt Ingredients of theſe Waters,
are alſo reſtored in their <hi>Matrices,</hi> after the ſame
manner as we ſee it happens in the <hi>Caput mortuum</hi>
of Vitriol, which though the Vitriol hath been once
or twice extracted from it, will by being expoſed
to the Air again recover more; whether it be by
converſion of its <hi>Matrix</hi> into its own nature by a kind
of Aggeneration and Tranſmutation, or by imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
and retaining thoſe ſubtile and volatile ſaline
Exhalations, which continually aſcend out of the
Earth or wander up and down the Air.</p>
                              <p>As for the Ingredients of theſe hot Waters in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
he ſaith, That beſides a threefold Salt-Nitre
<hi>fixed, volatile</hi> and <hi>mingled</hi> or <hi>Armoniack,</hi> they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of a fixed and volatile <hi>Sulphur,</hi> a <hi>Manna</hi> of
Alum, ſome Vitriol, divers Metals, as Copper and
Iron, a very little volatile Earth, a certain <hi>Argilla,</hi>
Sand and Calaminary Flowers. That they parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
of Copper he proves in that the Territory of
<hi>Aken</hi> abounds in divers places with <hi>Lapis Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris,</hi>
which is as it were the Aliment of Copper:
For being mingled in the Furnaces with red Copper
it augments it by the addition of 30 pound weight
<hi>per Cent.</hi> and gives it a yellow or golden Tincture.
As for Iron, the many ferrugineous Springs that are
found within and without this City are an evident
teſtimony that there are plenty of Iron Mines here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about;
and therefore moſt likely it is, if not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that theſe hot Waters charge themſelves with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98511:43"/>
that Metal. That they contain a threefold nitrous Salt,
he proves from their natural Evaporations. (1.) The
fixed is found in the Wells of <hi>Borcet</hi> and the <hi>Emperor,</hi>
cryſtallized into ſmall ſhining ſquare grains, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with a little Flower of Sulphur, ſticking to the
Covers of thoſe Wells, which have not been of a
long time opened. It may be alſo found in the
Chymical examination of theſe Waters by Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Deſtillation. (2.) The <hi>Volatile</hi> is carried up
by the volatile Sulphur, as is hereafter ſhew'd in the
Deſcription of the firſt ſort of theſe Baths. (3.) The
<hi>mingled</hi> or <hi>Armoniac</hi> is daily ſeen in all the Waters
of the City and of <hi>Borcet,</hi> ſwimming in little Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linders
on the ſurface of the Water, and this is that
Cream or Scum which is ordinarily found upon
the Waters in the Baſins. That they contain the
reſt of the fore-mentioned Ingredients ſhall be
ſhewn in the Deſcription of the particular Baths:
the Waters whereof our Author reduces to four ſorts.</p>
                              <p>1. <hi>Nitro-ſulphureous,</hi> ſuch are thoſe of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors</hi>
Bath, the <hi>Little</hi> Bath, and S. <hi>Quirin</hi>'s Bath.
2. <hi>Sulphureo-nitrous,</hi> ſuch are thoſe of <hi>Compus</hi> or
the <hi>Poor-mens</hi> Bath, the <hi>Roſe</hi>-Bath and S <hi>Cornelius</hi>
his Bath. 3. <hi>Sulphureo-nitro-vitriolic,</hi> ſuch is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bath of the ſame S. <hi>Cornelius.</hi> 4. <hi>Salſo-alumino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitrous,
viz.</hi> thoſe of <hi>Borcet</hi> a Village adjoining to
<hi>Aken.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>I. As for the <hi>Nitro-ſulphureous</hi> kind, thoſe of the
<hi>Emperors</hi> Bath and the <hi>Little</hi> Bath are but one Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
coming from the ſame Source, and collected in
one and the ſame Well. That part reſerved in the
<hi>Emperors</hi> Bath is divided into five great Baſins or
Receptacles: that in the <hi>Little</hi> Bath into three.
All which might be renewed daily, if time would
permit, the Spring is ſo copious. But by reaſon of
the exceſſive Heat of the Waters, it is neceſſary oft-times
that they ſtand in the Baſin 16 or 18 hours to
cool, before they be fit for the Patients uſe. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98511:43"/>
when they are come to a juſt temper,
one may bath in them and endure them a long time,
as thoſe of <hi>Borcet,</hi> without any Inconvenience. This
Source hath that of peculiar to itſelf, that in its
Well one may find diſtinctly a quantity of <hi>Nitre</hi>
coagulated, and good plenty of Flowers of <hi>Sulphur</hi>
very light, purely fine and well ſented. The <hi>Nitre</hi>
ſticks to the ſides of the Well, and ſo do the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of <hi>Sulphur</hi> above that: The which ſometimes
whether by the extraordinary boiling up of the
Fountain, or by the impetuoſity of the aſcending
Vapours, or by their own weight are broken off,
and fall back into the Source; from whence being
no more diſſolved by the Water, they come forth
intire into the Baſins. If you take of this Water,
and let it ſtand in a Veſſel certain days, it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
of theſe yellow Flowers of <hi>Sulphur</hi> to the
bottom of the Veſſel. Beſides theſe <hi>volatile</hi> Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
theſe Waters contein alſo <hi>fixt</hi> Flowers of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
a competent quantity of <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>volatile,
fixt</hi> and <hi>mixt</hi> or <hi>Armoniac,</hi> a little <hi>Alum,</hi> leſs <hi>Vitriol,</hi>
the Spirits and Principles of <hi>Copper</hi> and <hi>Iron,</hi> a very
little volatile Earth, <hi>Argilla</hi> and Sand: no <hi>Bitumen,</hi>
for let them ſtand as long as you pleaſe, you ſhall
find no fatty ſubſtance ſwimming upon them as
upon the <hi>Spaw</hi> Waters. The volatile <hi>Sulphur</hi> eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porates
ſo ſtrongly that it carries up with it a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of <hi>Nitre,</hi> as one may ſee after the ſolution of
the Vapours congeled and frozen in Winter-time,
when it remains incorporated upon the Walls in
the places where the Iceicles were. Theſe Waters
are in weight equal to thoſe of the <hi>Spaw;</hi> coming
freſh out of the Source they appear whitiſh or blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,
but having ſtood a while and grown cold,
greeniſh. They are very pure and leave no kind of
Mud or <hi>Lutum thermale</hi> behind them; in cooling
they yield a ſmall Scum or Cream of Nitre. Far
from their Source, being wrought upon by the Air,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98511:44"/>
they let fall a little whitiſh Sediment, as thoſe of
<hi>Bor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                       <desc>•</desc>
                                    </gap>et</hi> do a blackiſh one. They preſerve the colour
of Roſes put into them and cauſe them not to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as doth common Water. The Vapours aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from them make Silver Plate black, as thoſe
of <hi>Boreet</hi> make it white. The other Source of
S. <hi>Quirin</hi>'s Bath differs from theſe in no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
ſave that the Water thereof is cooler. It is
reſerved in three Baſins. In this Well you find
neither <hi>Sulphur</hi> nor <hi>Salt-peter</hi> ſticking to the ſides,
probably becauſe it is open or uncovered.</p>
                              <p>II. The ſecond or <hi>Sulphureo-nitrous</hi> ſort of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, &amp;c.</hi>
though they ſpring up in ſeveral places
and have different Wells, yet is the Nature of them
all, their Compoſition and Mineral Ingredients the
ſame. The <hi>Poor mens</hi> Bath hath one great Baſin or
Receptacle, the <hi>Roſe</hi> Bath four, whereof two only
are uſed, and S. <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Bath of this Mine
two. Theſe Waters are fit for uſe at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
being of a temperate Heat, more efficacious
and of greater force in their Operations than the
firſt ſort; they weigh two <hi>per Cent.</hi> more than they,
and are of a ſtronger Sent. In theſe is never found
any <hi>Sulphur</hi> condenſed, no not in their Wells
though they be covered: but when they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied
and new Water let in (as in the <hi>Roſe</hi>-Bath) the
Water running down along the Walls and Seats into
the bottom of the Baſins or Conſervatories, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Air prevailing upon it ſo ſpread and in ſuch little
quantity arreſts, fixes and condenſes its <hi>Sulphur</hi> all
along the ſaid Walls and Seats, refreſhing the eyes
of the Spectators with its Beauty and Luſtre. But
the Water ariſing in the fore-mentioned Baſins, and
covering the Seats and Walls, the Sulphur again
unites and incorporates with its Diſſolvent, and
diſappears and hides itſelf therein. The Water of
theſe Sources conteins great quantity of Sulphur
very fine and ſweet, leſs nitrous Salt, a little Vitriol
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98511:44"/>
and leſs Alum, more of the other Minerals and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
than the firſt ſort or thoſe of <hi>Borcet.</hi> So that
they are more compounded, oleous and bituminous
than any of the other Sources; and though they
come out of the Earth very temperate as to actual
Heat, yet can ſick perſons hardly endure them for
any long time, for the moſt part ſcarce half an
hour.</p>
                              <p>III. The third ſort which I call <hi>Sulphureo-nitro-vitriolic,</hi>
and is alſo of S. <hi>Cornclius,</hi> differs from the
precedent in that the Taſt is a little more acid, the
Smell ſweeter and liker that of Spirit of Vitriol,
and the Touch leſs oily. It is of leſs Efficacy in uſe
than the ſecond ſort, and of more than the firſt.
Of this Source there are three Baſins, which with
the two others of S. <hi>Cornelius</hi> before-mentioned
make five in this Houſe. Theſe Waters do agree
much what in their Compoſition with the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
They are very pure and clear, eſpecially
in their Wells; and though they ſeem troubled
in their Baſins, yet taken in a Glaſs they appear
clear.</p>
                              <p>IV. The fourth or <hi>Salſo-alumino-nitrous</hi> kind are
thoſe of the Neighbourhood or <hi>Borcet.</hi>
                                 <note place="margin">Borcet Baths.</note> Theſe
come out of the Earth extreme hot, and in great
abundance, are all of the ſame Medicinal Quality,
have ſeveral Wells, and are reſerved in ten or twelve
Houſes, each whereof hath two Baſins or Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles,
beſides which there is a common Bath expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to the Air, for the uſe of poor people. Theſe
Waters caſt off a copious Excrement or Tartar,
which yet is not Stone, but only a Sand mingled
with and united to the nitrous and aluminous Salt
of the Water, coagulated by the beating of the
cold Air on its Superficies, to which alſo concurs
the cold of the Walls expoſed to the ſame Air.
Theſe Excreſcencies are found in the ſubterrancous
Conduits, not only of theſe but the other Baths in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98511:45"/>
the City; being held to the Fire they ſoon become
friable, and are nothing but a pure round Sand like
the common. The higher Houſes and Baſins have
the more of this Tartar, yet is it ſo little that it
is not to be ſeen or perceived in the Water. Theſe
Waters are of a different <hi>Species,</hi> Virtue and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from thoſe of the City; are very eaſie to
ſuffer, and ſerve often for Divertiſement and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
to perſons that are in health. The content
of them is a great quantity of Sea-Salt and Alum,
leſs nitrous Salt, a very little Sulphur and not much
of Metallic Subſtances.</p>
                              <p>Concerning the Virtues and Effects of theſe
Waters inwardly taken, he diſcourſes to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:</p>
                              <p>Theſe Waters taken inwardly are very available
againſt the Phthiſic, <hi>Aſthma</hi> or Difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
occaſioned by tough Phlegm lodging in the
branches of the Wind-Pipe; againſt the Weakneſs
of the Stomach, Indigeſtion, Crudities, Flatulencies,

diſſipate and dry up all manner of Catarrhs and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

                                 </gap>luxions; and are very proper to be drunk
by thoſe that are troubled with the Palſie, before
the uſe of the Baths. They quicken the Appetite,
cleanſe the Blood and open the obſtructions of the
Meſentery. They are of excellent uſe againſt Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal
Maladies, eſpecially in ſuch as have
weak and cold Stomachs. They mollifie the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Liver, Spleen and Meſentery. They
diſſolve and bring away the Gravel of the Reins
and the leſſer Stones: And here he produces many
Examples of ſuch as avoided Stones upon the
drinking theſe Waters, and among the reſt of ſome
that had drank the <hi>Spaw</hi> Waters, and came from
thence without reciving any Benefit. They cleanſe
the Ulcers of the Bladder, diſſolving not only the
groſs, phlegmatic and viſcous Humours which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98511:45"/>
the Stone, but even the Stone itſelf whilſt it
is yet tender. They have ſometimes cured inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent
Fevers of long continuance, and ſcrophulous
Tumors. They dry up and heal the Itch, Leproſie
and other Affections of the Skin. They ſtop the
immoderate Flowing of the <hi>Menſes</hi> in Women and
cure the Jaundiſe, the Paleneſs and Diſcolouring of
the Skin in Virgins: and finally they give eaſe and
relief in the Gout. Of all theſe Faculties he brings
Inſtances and Examples in Perſons that have been
cured. Particularly that theſe Waters drunk may
have a power of diſſolving the Stone, he proves by
this Experiment: Taking a Stone voided by a man
about two years before, and infuſing it in Water hot
from the Fountain for the ſpace of three days, we
found it (ſaith he) mollified and reduced into a ſoft
Phlegm. Which Virtue of the Waters was further
confirmed to us by a late Accident: for opening
the Vault of a Well there was found a certain Glue
or Mucilage, which it's to me probable, came from
the ſolution of the Morter of Lime and Sand in
long time, by the volatile and diſſolvent Spirits of
the Waters; eſpecially there being found no other
Cement between the Stones, and in that this ſame
Glue or Mucilage mingled itſelf intirely with the
Waters of the Fountains without any appearance
of Scum or Fat ſwimming on the top, ſo as Gum
of Cherry or the like is wont to do in Water, and
being caſt into the Fire burnt not, but dried up.
Theſe Experiments and Obſervations were made
upon occaſion of a Burgomaſter of <hi>Riga</hi> (who being
afflicted with the Stone drank theſe Waters) his
paſſing his Urine through a Linen Cloth, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therein a certain thick Phlegm left behind, which
being kept a while upon Paper hardned into a

                     <hi>July</hi> 13. we took Boat for <hi>Frankfurt,</hi> going up
the River <hi>Maonus</hi> which near <hi>Mentz</hi> runs into the
<hi>Rhene.</hi> By the way we took notice (1.) of <hi>Ruſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theim,</hi>
a handſom Fort on our right hand, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Lantgrave of <hi>Darmſtadt.</hi> (2.) A little
further up on our left hand a ſmall Village called
<hi>Eterſheim,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hocht.</note> and (3.) <hi>Hocht,</hi> a walled Town on the

Here we may note, that the Dominions of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Germany</hi> that border on the <hi>Rhene</hi> are ſtrangely
mingled one with another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Frankfurt</hi> is about five Miles or Leagues diſtant
from <hi>Mentz,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furt.</note> though the Houſes thereof are for the
moſt part built of Timber, yet is it fair, populous
and rich, very ſtrongly fortified and encompaſſed
with a deep Trench of water; the Walls and Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks
are kept very trim and in good repair. The
River <hi>Main</hi> divides it into two parts, the leſſer on the
South ſide is called <hi>Saxenhauſen.</hi> They are joyned
by a fair Stone-Bridge of about fourteen Arches. In
the great Piazza are three handſom Fountains. The
Emperor is now adays uſually choſen here in the
<hi>Curia</hi> or Senate-houſe; and crowned in the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate
Church of S. <hi>Bartholomew.</hi> There have been
about 25 or 26 Emperors here choſen. By the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of one of the Conſuls or Burgomaſters we ſaw
the Original Imperial Grant or Conſtitution, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the College of Electors is appointed, called <hi>Bullae
aurea.</hi> It had in place of the Seal a great Medal of
Gold hanging at it, on which was ſtamped or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven,
on one ſide the Figure of the Emperor
<hi>Charles</hi> IV. with this Inſcription round, <hi>Carolus

                  </p>
                  <p>This City is governed by 42 Senators, two Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomaſters,
a Praetor and 14 Scabins. The Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
are divided into three <hi>Scamna</hi> or Benches:
The higheſt is <hi>Scabinorum,</hi> the ſecond or middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<hi>Literatorum,</hi> and the loweſt <hi>Opificum.</hi> When
one of the Scabins dies or is removed, they chuſe
into his room one out of the <hi>Scamnum Literatorum.</hi>
Thoſe of the <hi>Scamnum Opificum</hi> can riſe no higher.
Theſe Senators chuſe yearly the two Conſuls or
Burgomaſters out of their own number. The People
have no part or intereſt in the Government of the
City or choice of the Senate. Many Jews live here
who have their <hi>Ghet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they are locked up every night. Their Trade
is only Brokage, and moſt of them are very poor.
They are forced to wear a piece of yellow Cloth
ſomewhere about them to diſtinguiſh them from
other people.</p>
                  <p>All the Magiſtrates and the greateſt part of the
Citizens are <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who have five Churches.
The <hi>Roman Catbolics</hi> are allowed the free Exerciſe
of their Religion, and have within the City two
Cloiſters of Men, and one of Women. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
had formerly a Church within the Walls,
afterwards, that being taken from them, they had
one juſt without, which being burnt down, whether
by Accident or Malice, their Church is now a good
diſtance from the Town. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, uſed
in Q. <hi>Maries</hi> days, goes to decay. The <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Houſe is made a Granary or Store-houſe. The
Countrey hereabout is pleaſant, and the Ground
rich. We found growing wild <hi>Gramen amoris di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum

ſome Hedges <hi>Alſine baccifera,</hi> which it was not my

                     <hi>July</hi> 17. we left <hi>Frankfurt,</hi> taking the Poſt-Coach
for <hi>Frankenthal.</hi> After one half-hours riding we
entred into Pine-Woods, the firſt we met withal:

we ferried over the <hi>Rhene,</hi> and at ſix miles
end came to <hi>Worms,</hi> a great old City, but meanly
built and in a decaying condition. It ſeems formerly
to have been richer and more populous. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
is choſen by the Canons of the great Church
being 20 in number. All the Magiſtrates are <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans.</hi>
After we had paſſed <hi>Worms</hi> one hours
riding brought us to <hi>Frankenthal</hi> or (as we uſually
pronounce it) <hi>Frankendale,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Franken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale.</note> a Town belonging to
the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> ſituate in a Level by
the <hi>Rhene,</hi> more conſiderable for its Strength than
Greatneſs. The Houſes are low built, the Streets
broad and ſtreight. The Wall, Mounts and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
neatly kept in good repair. The Garriſon
conſiſts of five Companies, whereof two are Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.
There are in it three Churches, one <hi>Almagne,</hi>
one <hi>Low-Dutch,</hi> and one <hi>French.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 20. we travelled from <hi>Frankendale</hi> beſide the
<hi>Rhene,</hi> through <hi>Oberskeim</hi> a ſmall walled Town to
<hi>Spier,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Spier.</note> two miles and an half diſtant. <hi>Spier</hi> though
it hath a Biſhop, yet is it a free City of the Empire,
and governed by its own Magiſtrates, of conſiderable
Strength and Greatneſs. The Houſes are moſt old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built
of Timber, rather vaſt than handſom or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.
We could not learn that there was any
conſiderable Trade driven here, ſo that were it not
for the Imperial Chamber (which draws much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
hither) we believe it would ſoon grow poor
and infrequent enough. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
moſt, yet have the <hi>Lutherans</hi> their Church. In
the Cathedral Church are the Monuments of ſeveral
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98511:50"/>
Emperors and Biſhops who lie interred there. The
Imperial Chamber conſiſts of 36 Aſſeſſors and a chief
Preſident appointed by the Emperor,<note place="margin">Imperial Chamber.</note> beſides whom
there are other three Preſidents choſen by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
out of the Delegates. Every Elector of the
Empire, and each of the ten Circles ſend two Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
or Aſſeſſors. There is another Chamber of
like power at <hi>Vienna.</hi> Theſe Courts determine all
Controverſies ariſing between the ſeveral Princes
and States of the Empire by majority of Vote. The
Subjects alſo of many of the Princes may appeal
from their own Princes to this Court; but it is not
prudent nor ſafe for them ſo to do, unleſs they firſt
withdraw themſelves out of their Territory. Some
Princes, as the Count Palatine, have <hi>Jus non appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landi.</hi>

moſt of them beaten down, but now they are rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

great Privileges, to invite Strangers to come and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit

of the greateſt Cities, yet is the chief of the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate,</hi>
and for its bigneſs populous; which is much
conſidering the Devaſtations made by the late Wars
in this Countrey. The Houſes are moſt of Timber,
yet handſom and in good repair; which argues the
Inhabitants to be induſtrious and in a thriving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
It is ſituate on the right bank of the River
<hi>Neccar,</hi> under Hills of conſiderable highth; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of which it cannot be made ſtrong, though
it be encompaſſed with a double Wall and
Trench.</p>
                  <p>In this City are five Juriſdictions, (1.) <hi>Aulica,</hi>
under which are all the Princes or Noblemen: of
this Juriſdiction the Marſhal of the Houſe is Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
(2.) <hi>Cancellaria,</hi> under which are all the
Councils and other Officers as Advocates, Doctors
of Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (3.) <hi>Bellica,</hi> or the Soldiery: the
General is their Preſident. (4.) <hi>Academica,</hi> in
which the <hi>Rector magnificus</hi> preſides, and (5.) <hi>Civica.</hi>
The Members of each Juriſdiction may refuſe to be
judged by any but their own Judge, before whom
the Plaintiff muſt implead them, according to the
Maxim in Law, <hi>Actor ſequitur forum rei.</hi> The City
is divided into four Quarters, and governed by
<hi>Praetor</hi> and <hi>Burgomaſters.</hi> It can raiſe two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Foot and one of Horſe. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98511:51"/>
permitted the Exerciſe of their Religion here, and
have lately built them a Church: There are alſo
<hi>Roman Catholics</hi> who have a Church without the
Walls.</p>
                  <p>About the middle of the aſcent of the Hill called
<hi>Koningſthall</hi> ſtands the Caſtle where the Prince keeps
his Court, a ſtately Pile and of great capacity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed
with a ſtrong Wall and a deep Trench
hewn out of the Rock, which upon occaſion may
be filled with Water. Over the Gate leading into
the Palace is a <hi>Dutch</hi> Inſcription, ſignifying the
building of it by <hi>Ludovicus</hi> V. in the year 1519. It
is not all of one Piece, but ſince the firſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſeveral Buildings have been added by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Princes. One part is called the <hi>Engliſh Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under one of the Towers ſtood the great Tun,
which almoſt filled a Room. It held 132 Fudders, a
Fudder (as we were informed) being equal to 4 <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Hogſheads. The old Tun is taken in pieces, and
there is a new one in building by the Princes Order,
which is to contain 150 Fudders or 600 Hogſheads.
Being invited by the Princes order we dined in the
Palace, where we obſerved all things carried with little
noiſe and great decency. After dinner his Highneſs was
pleaſed to call us into his Cloſet, and ſhew us many
Curioſities, among others (1.) a Purſe made of <hi>Alumen
plumoſum,</hi> which we ſaw put into a Pan of burning
Charcoal till it was throughly ignite, and yet when
taken out and cool, we could not perceive that it
had received any harm at all from the Fire. (2.) Two
Unicorns horns each eight or ten foot long, wreathed
and hollow to the top. By the way we may note,
that theſe are the Horns of a Fiſh of the cetaceous
kind, (two diſtinct <hi>ſpecies</hi> whereof you may find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
and figured in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and Deſcription of

richly adorned with pretious Stones. (4.) An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and well-digeſted Collection of antient and
modern Coins and Medals of all ſorts, in which the

could not but take notice of a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Doller of
Copper, about the bigneſs and of the figure of a ſquare
Trencher, ſtamped at the four Corners with the Kings
Image and Arms, of that weight, that if a man be
to receive ten or twenty pound in ſuch Coin, he

                  <p>The Government of this Univerſity is by a Senate,
which conſiſts only of 16 Profeſſors. The number

                  <p>The Prince Elector is abſolute in his own Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.
He can make Laws and repeal them, treat
with forein Princes, ſending Embaſſadors to them,
and receiving Embaſſadors from them, make War
and Peace, impoſe Tributes arbitrarily on his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
without the conſent of the States of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
The Emperor hath nothing to do with his
Subjects, they ſwearing Allegiance only to him.
He only can excommunicate, having reſerved to
himſelf the Epiſcopal Power. The Prince Elector
hath ſeven Councils or Courts, (1.) <hi>Concilium Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtum</hi>
or his Privy Council. (2.) <hi>Concilium Statûs.</hi>
(3.) <hi>Concilium Eccleſiaſticum,</hi> conſiſting of four, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
two are Lay men, and two Clergy. (4.) <hi>Dica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterium,</hi>
who judge Cauſes between man and man.
(5.) <hi>Concilium feudale.</hi> (6.) <hi>Concilium redituum
temporalium</hi> or <hi>rationum.</hi> (7.) <hi>Concilium redituum
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98511:56"/>
Eccleſiaſticorum.</hi> The Prince hath thought fit to keep
theſe two laſt diſtinct, partly that he may know how
to proportion the Miniſters Allowance; and partly
that if any of his Succeſſors ſhould happen to change
his Religion (as is ordinary for Princes to do in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>)
they may be able to diſtinguiſh clearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their own proper Temporal and the Church
Revenue.</p>
                  <p>The Prince in his own Territory is general Biſhop
and ſupreme Head in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. Formerly
this Countrey was under the Inſpection and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Biſhop of <hi>Spier,</hi> but ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
the Prince hath not only ſeized the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the Church into his own hand, but alſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to himſelf entirely the Epiſcopal Power and
Juriſdiction. He alſo is univerſal Patron, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
of all vacant Benefices as he pleaſes; indeed
the Council of four nominate and preſent two unto
him, of which uſually he chuſes one, becauſe it may
well be preſumed that he knows not ſo well as they
what perſons are beſt qualified and fit to be preferred;
but he is not obliged to confer the Benefice upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the perſons by them ſo nominated, but may
either put in another known to himſelf, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
them to nominate others, if he like not thoſe
preſented. The Religion of the Countrey is the
Reformed. The whole Palatinate is divided into
three <hi>Praefècturae,</hi> and ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> the greater of theſe
ſubdivided into leſs. Every <hi>Praefectura</hi> hath its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector
or Biſhop, who is Paſtor of ſome Church in
that <hi>Praefectura:</hi> He differs not from any other in
any Juriſdiction, but in that commonly he hath a
larger Stipend. His buſineſs is only to give Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
if he be of a leſſer Diviſion, to the Inſpector
of the whole <hi>Praefectura</hi> under which he is, if of a
greater, to the Council of foar. If need be every
<hi>Praefectura</hi> or great Town hath a Presbytery. The
Presbytery of <hi>Heidelberg</hi> conſiſts of the five Miniſters
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98511:56"/>
of the City, two Deputies from each Juriſdiction
except the <hi>Aulica:</hi> and two from each Quarter of
the City; ſo that at this time the number in all is
21. Theſe all have equal Suffrages the Lay-men
with the Miniſters, only one of the Miniſters always
preſides in his Courſe. This Presbytery aſſembles
once every week, at whoſe meeting is always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
a Delegate from the Prince, to ſee that nothing
be agitated there which it concerns not the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
to meddle withal. This Presbytery hath no
power to excommunicate or inflict any Church Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
but if any perſon be accuſed to them of any
Crime, they ſend him to the Juriſdiction to whom
he appertains, to enquire into his Offence. The
Court having received this Information from the
Presbytery, either neglect it if they pleaſe, or if they
ſee cauſe enquire into it, and puniſh the Delinquent
according to his Demerit, and in the cloſe of the
Sentence or Warrant for execution add this Clauſe,
<hi>Quod ad Scandalum Eccleſiae datum remittimus te ad
Presbyterium.</hi> Now at laſt, all they can do, is to

                     <hi>July</hi> 25. we hired a Coach for <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> which

which inſtead of Boards are floored with
whole Fir-Trees laid looſe acroſs, neither pinned
nor nailed down: I conceive that the Bridge might
upon any exigent be more ſuddenly thrown down
and broken. Soon after we were paſt the Bridges
we entred <hi>Strasburgh.</hi> In this Journey we obſerved

well built, rich and populous, encompaſſed with a
double Wall and Trench full of Water, beſides
the advantage of a good ſituation in a large Level,
very exactly fortified, and the Walls and Works
moſt regular, elegant, and ſcrupulouſly kept in
repair: ſo that it ſeems no eaſie thing by force to
take this City; neither was it I think once attempted
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98511:57"/>
in the late <hi>German</hi> Wars. It lies as a Block in the
<hi>Frenchmens</hi> way, and is as it were the Rampart of
the Empire in theſe parts. The Government is by
a greater Council of 300, choſen by the ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of Citizens, and a leſſer of 71, of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſix are <hi>Burgomaſters,</hi> ſix <hi>Stetmaſters,</hi> 15 <hi>Patres
Patriae</hi> and 13 of the <hi>Militia.</hi> The Women of this
City are well-favoured and of good Complexions.
The Inhabitants are moſt part <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who have
ſeven Churches: ſome <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who have one
Church and four Cloiſters, two for Men and two
for Women; and a few <hi>Reformed,</hi> who yet are not
allowed a Church in Town, but forced to go ſome
two miles to Church in the Territory of the Earl of
<hi>Hanaw.</hi> This City is an Epiſcopal See, the Biſhop
whereof is Lord of the lower <hi>Alſatia.</hi> He hath a
Palace in the City, but is not ſuffered to lodge therein
above three days together; in an Inn he is allowed
eight days at a time. Here is the faireſt, largeſt, beſt
furniſhed, and handſomelieſt kept Armory or Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
that we ſaw in <hi>Germany,</hi> or in all theſe reſpects
any where elſe. Here are alſo public Granaries,
Wine-Cellars and Store-houſes. The River <hi>Elle</hi> runs
through the Town. The <hi>Domo</hi> or Cathedral Church
is a fair Building of Stone, having a great pair of
Braſs Folding-Doors at the Weſt end. Herein we
viewed the famous Clock deſcribed by <hi>Coryat</hi> and
others, a Piece of excellent Workmanſhip, made,
as were told by one <hi>Iſaac Habrechtus</hi> of <hi>Strasburgh.</hi>
The Steeple of this Church is curiouſly built of
carved Stone, and incomparably the higheſt that
ever we yet ſaw. The number of Steps from the
bottom to the top is 662. We aſcended 640 Steps
to the place called the Crown, from whence we had
a wide Proſpect of the Countrey round about.
In this Steeple two men watch conſtantly by day and
four by night.<note place="margin">Sowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn.</note> Ten hours diſtant from <hi>Strasburgh</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Briſach.</note> a Town
ſeated on a Rock by the <hi>Rhene</hi> ſide, a place of great

built upon Hills, ſo that which way ſoever
you go you either aſcend or deſcend. The River
<hi>Rhene</hi> divides it into two parts, which are joined
together by a Bridge of 14 Arches. That part on
the North ſide of the River is called <hi>Little Baſil.</hi>
There are ſaid to be 300 Fountains in this City,
ſcarce a Street or Houſe of note but hath one. It
is one of the thirteen Cantons of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and
hath in its Territory about 100 Villages. It gives
Title to a Biſhop choſen by Canons, who yet is
not ſuffered to lodge in the Town one night. He
lives at <hi>Broudint,</hi> keeps the State of a Temporal
Prince, and coins Money, which is not current in
<hi>Baſil.</hi>

As to the Civil Government, the Citizens are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

                  <p>
                     <hi>Zurich</hi> is pleaſantly ſituate at the end of a Lake
call'd <hi>Zurich</hi>-Sea,<note place="margin">Zurich.</note> ſcarce ſo big as <hi>Baſil,</hi> but I think
more populous. The River <hi>Limagus</hi> which runs
out of the Lake divides it into two almoſt equal
parts, which are joined together by two Bridges;
one very broad for Carts and Horſes to paſs over.</p>
                  <p>The Houſes are built of Timber with Clay-Walls,
handſomly painted, many of them four or five Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
high. The Streets are narrow but well paved
with Flints and great Pebbles. This City is as well
fortified as the Situation of it will permit, beſides
the Wall, being encompaſſed round with good
Earthworks and Trenches after the modern faſhion.
The River <hi>Sele</hi> runs by and gives defence to it on
the South ſide, and a little lower empties itſelf into
the <hi>Limagus.</hi> The Citizens are given to Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
all very buſie and induſtrious. They either
are rich or at leaſt ſo eſteemed, and therefore envied
by their Neighbours of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion. Here
are no Guards of Soldiers at the City-Gates; no
Strangers examined or ſearcht either at coming in
or going out. We obſerved the colour of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Zurich</hi>-Sea to be greeniſh and well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to that of Sea-water. Afterwards we
found the Water of all the Lakes and Rivers near
the <hi>Alpes</hi> to be of the ſame colour, at which we
were not a little ſurpriſed. For we were wont to
attribute that colour in the Sea-water to the mixture
of Salt that is in it, whereas the Water of theſe Lakes
and Rivers diſcovers to the Taſt nothing of Salt or
brackiſh. But afterwards conſidering that theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
did conſiſt for the moſt part of Snow diſſolved;
and that Snow is ſuppoſed to contein good ſtore of
nitrous Salt, we thought it not altogether impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98511:61"/>
that this Colour may be owing to the nitrous
Particles remaining in the Water, though they be not
copious enough to affect our Taſt; and it would be
worth the while to diſtil good quantities of this
Water, to ſee whether it would leave any Salt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
                  <p>That theſe Lakes and Rivers do conſiſt for the
moſt part of Snow-water it is manifeſt, for that upon
the Mountains (excepting the lower parts of them)
no Rain falls in Winter-time, but only Snow, with
which the higher parts of them are covered to a
great thickneſs for at leaſt ſix moneths in the year;
and for that the Rivers that flow from the <hi>Alpes</hi> run
loweſt in Winter, and abound moſt with Water in
the Summer-time; ſo that ſometimes they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
their Banks in the hotteſt moneths of the year,
and when no Rain falls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as my ſelf can teſtifie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the River <hi>Rhodanus;</hi> becauſe the Sun at the
ſeaſon melts the Snow upon the Mountains. Hence
it appears, that their Opinion was not ſo abſurd
who attributed the yearly Increaſe and Overflowing
of the River <hi>Nilus</hi> to the diſſolution of the Snow
upon thoſe Mountains where it hath its firſt Riſe.
Though I do not think this to be the true Cauſe,
partly becauſe that part of the Earth where thoſe
Mountains lie is ſo hot by reaſon of its Situation
under the direct and ſometimes perpendicular Beams
of the Sun, that it's not likely any Snow ſhould fall,
much leſs lie there: chiefly becauſe Travellers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
agree, that in moſt parts of that Climate where
thoſe Mountains lie, there are at that time of the
year great falls of Rain, to which therefore the
Overflowing of <hi>Nilus</hi> is more probably attributed.</p>
                  <p>The Government of this City is by a greater and
a leſſer Council. The leſſer Council conſiſts of
50, <hi>viz.</hi> 24 Tribunes or Maſters of the Companies
choſen by the twelve Tribes or Companies, into
which the City is divided, two by each Company.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98511:62"/>
These 24 are called <hi>Zwelvers</hi> becauſe twelve of them
only are regent at once. Twelve Senators, choſen
out of the Companies, one out of each Company
by the greater Council according to our Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to <hi>Simler</hi> by the leſſer. Six, elected
by the ſame greater Council as we were informed,
but according to <hi>Simler</hi> by the leſſer, out of the
People indifferently where they pleaſe; four <hi>Tribuni
nobilium</hi> choſen by the Gentlemen; two <hi>Senatores
nobilium;</hi> and two <hi>Burgomaſters</hi> or Conſuls choſen
by the Council of 200. The Conſuls and half this
Council rule by turns, <hi>viz.</hi> 12 <hi>Zwelvers</hi> and 12 <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators</hi>
with one Conſul one half year and the other
half the next; and this half that rules is called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium
novum.</hi> All the 50 meet every week, and if
any Decree be to be made, it is dated in the preſence
of the <hi>Concilium novum &amp; vetus.</hi> All the 50 hear
Civil Cauſes, <hi>Simler</hi> ſaith eight choſen by the 50;
and the <hi>Concilium novum</hi> judge in Criminals alone.
The greater Council conſiſts of 200, <hi>viz.</hi> 144 elected
out of the Tribes, twelve out of each Tribe; 18 cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen

4 <hi>Tribuni nobilium;</hi> 2 <hi>Senatores nobilium;</hi> the
6 elected indifferently, and the two Burgomaſters.
Why the twelve choſen by the greater Council ſhould
be left out, we know not, and therefore ſuſpect our
Information was not good about the making up the
great Council; but of the 12 out of each Tribe, and 18
out of the Noblemen we are ſure. This great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

<hi>Sekelmaſters</hi> or Treaſurers either out of the twelve
Senators of the Companies or the twelve Tribunes of
the <hi>Concilium novum.</hi> Half the leſſer Council is
choſen every half year at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and <hi>Midſummer.</hi>
The <hi>Concilium vetus</hi> goes out, and then the <hi>Concilium

paſſing by a great Caſcate or Catarract of the River

<hi>Orobus ſylvaticus purpureus vernus</hi> and <hi>Hepatica

                     <hi>Schaffhauſſen</hi> is ſeated upon the River <hi>Rhene,</hi> over

part of Stone. All Boats or Flotes that come down
the River muſt here unload, there being no paſſing
further by reaſon of great Stones in the Chanel, and
the precipitious Deſcent of the water at <hi>Waſſerfall.</hi>
This Town is well-built, (the Houſes being moſt of
Stone) walled about and intrencht. It hath two
fair Streets handſomly paved, beſides many other
ſmall ones. Here as at <hi>Zurich,</hi> the Citizens when
they walk abroad wear their Swords. As to the
Civil Government, the Citizens are divided into
twelve Tribes or Companies. Each Tribe chuſes
two <hi>Tribuni Plebis,</hi> and theſe 24 make the leſſer
or ordinary Council. The great Council conſiſts of
theſe and ſixty more, choſen alſo by the Companies,
each Company chuſing five. The Father and Son,
or two Brothers cannot be together of the Council.
By the greater Council are choſen yearly two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls
or Burgomaſters, two Quaeſtors, one Proconſul,
and one <hi>Aedilis,</hi> but for the moſt part they chuſe the

here <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1417. at which <hi>John Hus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
hath made this place well known. For
what end this Council was aſſembled and what they
did, the following Inſcription on the Council-houſe
will acquaint the Reader:
<q>Gaude clara Domus, pacem populo generâſti<lb/>

                  <p>This Town is alſo famous for the Reſiſtance it
made to the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Forces commanded by <hi>Horn,</hi>
beſieging of it <hi>Anno</hi> 1598. vid. <hi>Galeazzo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet it ſeemed to me but ſlenderly fortified, having
toward the Water only a Wall, and toward the
Land an earthen Rampart or Wall and Ditch drawn
at a good diſtance from the Stone-Wall. It hath
indeed advantage by its Situation, having a Lake
on one ſide and a fenny Level on the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 15. we took Boat, and croſſed the <hi>Bodenzee</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Lindaw.</note> and by the way had
a fair Proſpect of the ſtrong Town of <hi>Oberlingen.
Lindaw</hi> ſtandeth in the middle of the Lake envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd
with Water. It is joined to the Land by a
Bridge of 290 paces, one half of it being Stone,
and the other (that is that next the Town) Wood,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98511:63"/>
which may upon occaſion eaſily be taken down and
removed. This City beſides its natural Strength by
reaſon of its Situation, is alſo artificially fortified
with ſtout Walls and Bulwarks ſtanding in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that ſide moſt which is neareſt the Land. On
that ſide toward the Lake are many Rows of great
Stakes driven into the ground, to hinder the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of any Boat or Veſſel to the Town. So that
a man would think this place impregnable. The
Streets and Houſes are not ſo ſpatious and fair as
thoſe of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> yet proper enough: Several
Fountains alſo there are in the Streets. Towards
the <hi>Bodenzee</hi> are two Walls, and between the Walls
a large vacant ſpace of Land wherein Vineyards are
planted, of the Grapes whereof are ſaid to be made
yearly 100 Fudders, that is 300 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hogſheads
of Wine. Eight Villages belong to this City, their
Territory extending about three hours.</p>
                  <p>For Plants we found not far from <hi>Lindaw</hi> in the
mountainous Woods, <hi>Erica procumbens herbacea,
Scahioſa latifolia rubro flore, Gentiana Aſclepiadis fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi>

examined at the Gate, their Names ſent in to the
the Governour, and they deteined till the return of
the Meſſenger with leave for their Admiſſion. This
City is very ſtrongly walled and fortified, and for
the bigneſs of it is the moſt ſplendid and beautiful
place we have ſeen in all <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo that well
might <hi>Cluverius</hi> term it <hi>omnium Germanicarum pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherrimam.</hi>
The Streets are broad and ſtreight, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with ſumptuous Churches and Cloiſters, and
ſtately Houſes. Above all the Dukes Palace deſerves
Reſpect, not to ſay Admiration, it being the moſt
magnificent and ſumptuous Edifice for a Houſe, that
we have any where hitherto ſeen beyond the Seas.
In the great Garden of this Palace we ſaw many
rare Plants, among the reſt we eſpecially took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the <hi>Aloe-trees</hi> (for ſo I may well call them
for the Greatneſs and Highth of their Stalks which
ſhoot up in one year) of which there were more, I
verlly think, in this one Garden than in all <hi>Europe</hi>
beſides; I mean of ſuch as came to Stalk and Flower.
In this City ſo far remote from our native Countrey
it ſeemed ſtrange to us to find a Cloiſter of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Nuns. We thought it worth noting that the Bodies
of the Churches here are filled with Pews and Seats,
as ours in <hi>England,</hi> whereas generally in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholics there are no fixed Seats,
or but very few; the People either ſtanding to hear
their Sormons, or ſitting on moveable Benches and

not inferiour to the beſt in <hi>Germany,</hi> though I am

ſome <hi>Erfurt</hi> the Preeminence. It hath under it a large

This Town wants not for Walls and

                  <p>Beſides all which places and others mentioned by
Writers I doubt not but in <hi>Italy, Germany, France,
England</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> there are many not
taken notice of where theſe Bodies might be found,
were diligent Search and Obſervation made. That
they have not been diſcovered or taken notice of in
other parts of <hi>Europe</hi> and in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to be attributed to the Negligence and Rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the People who mind nothing that is curious,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98511:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or to the want of learned Writers who ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the Hiſtories of them to the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> I come now to give an account of the Opinions of
the beſt Authors concerning the Original and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of theſe Stones.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and to me moſt probable Opinion is that
they were originally the Shells or Bones of living
Fiſhes and other Animals bred in the Sea. This
was the general Opinion of the Antients, inſomuch
that <hi>Steno</hi> ſaith, It was never made a Queſtion
among them, whether ſuch Bodies came from any
place elſe but the Sea. It hath of late times and is
now received and embraced by divers learned and
ingenious Philoſophers, as in the precedent age by
<hi>Fracaſtorius,</hi> and in the preſent by <hi>Nicolaus Steno</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Robert Hook,</hi> after whom I need name no
more to give it countenance and authority in the
World. In his <hi>Micrographia,</hi> Obſerv. 17. He thus
diſcourſes concerning theſe Bodies. Examining
ſome of theſe very curiouſly figured Bodies (found
about <hi>Keinſham,</hi> which are commonly thought to
be Stones formed by ſome extraordinary <hi>plaſtic</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
latent in the Earth itſelf) I took notice of theſe
particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that theſe figured Bodies were of very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Subſtances as to hardneſs: ſome of Clay,
ſome Marl, ſome ſoft Stone, almoſt of the hardneſs
of thoſe Stones, which Maſons call Fire-Stone,
others as hard as <hi>Portland</hi> Stone, others as hard as
Marble, and ſome as hard as a Flint or Cryſtal.</p>
                  <p>Next, they were of very differing Subſtances as
to Tranſparency and Colour; ſome white, ſome
almoſt black, ſome brown, ſome metalline or like
Marcaſites, ſome tranſparent like white Marble,
others like flaw'd Cryſtal, ſome gray, ſome of divers
colours; ſome radiated like thoſe long <hi>petrified drops,</hi>
which are commonly found at the <hi>Peak</hi> and in other
ſubterraneous Caverns, which have a kind of Pith
in the middle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:98511:70"/>
Thirdly, that they were very different as to the
manner of their outward Figuration: for ſome of
them ſeem'd to have been the Subſtance that had filled
the Shell of ſome kind of Shell-fiſh; others to have
been the Subſtance that had conteined or enwrapped
one of theſe Shells, on both which the perfect impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
either of the inſide or outſide of ſuch Shels ſeem'd
to be left, but for the moſt part thoſe impreſſions ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be made by an imperfect or broken Shell, the
great end or mouth of the Shell being always wanting
and oftentimes the little end and ſometimes half,
and in ſome there were Impreſſions, juſt as if there
had been Holes broken in the figurating, imprinting
or moulding Shell: ſome of them ſeem'd to be made
by ſuch a Shell very much bruiſed or flaw'd, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that one would verily have thought, that very
figured Stone had been broken or bruiſed whilſt a
Gelly as 'twere, and ſo hardned, but within the
Grain of the Stone there appeared not any ſign of
any ſuch bruiſe or breaking, but only on the very
uttermoſt Superficies.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they were very different as to their
outward covering, ſome having the perfect Shell
both in Figure, Colour and Subſtance ſticking on
its ſurface, and adhering to it, but might very eaſily
be ſeparated from it, and like other common <hi>Cochle</hi>
or <hi>Scallop</hi>-ſhells, which ſome of them moſt accurately
reſembled, were very diſſoluble in common Vinegar:
others of them, eſpecially thoſe <hi>ſerpentine</hi> or <hi>helical</hi>
Stones, were covered with or reteined the ſhining
or pearl-coloured Subſtance of the inſide of the Shell,
which Subſtance on ſome parts of them was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thin, and might very eaſily be rubbed off; on
other parts it was pretty thick, and reteined a white
Coat or flaky Subſtance on the top, juſt like the ſides
of ſuch Shells: ſome of them had large pieces of
the Shell very plainly ſticking on to them, which
were eaſily to be broken or flaked off by degrees:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98511:71"/>
they likewiſe ſome of them reteined all along the
ſurface of them very pretty kind of Sutures, ſuch as
are obſerved in the Skulls of ſeveral kinds of living
Creatures, which Sutures were moſt curiouſly ſhaped
in the manner of Leaves, and every one of them in
the ſame Shell exactly one like another; which I
was able to diſcover plainly enough with my naked
eye, but more perfectly and diſtinctly with my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope:
All theſe Sutures I found by breaking
ſome of the Stones to be the <hi>Termini</hi> or boundings
of certain <hi>Diaphragms</hi> or partitions, which ſeemed
to divide the Cavity of the Shell into a multitude of
very proportionate and regular Cells or Caverns:
theſe Diaphragms in many of them I found very
perfect and complete, of a very diſtinct Subſtance
from that which filled the Cavities, and exactly
of the ſame kind with that which covered the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
being for the moſt part whitiſh or <hi>mother of-Pearl</hi>
coloured.</p>
                  <p>As for the Cavities between thoſe <hi>Diaphragms,</hi> I
found ſome of them fill'd with Marl, and others
with ſeveral kinds of Stones, others for the moſt
part hollow, only the whole Cavity was uſually
covered over with a kind of <hi>Tartareous petrified</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which ſtuck about the Sides, and was there
ſhot into very curious regular Figures, juſt as <hi>Tartar</hi>
or other diſſolved Salts are obſerved to ſtick and
<hi>cryſtallize</hi> about the ſides of the conteining Veſſels;
or like thoſe little <hi>Diamants,</hi> which I before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to have covered the vaulted Cavity of a Flint;
others had theſe Cavities all lined with a <hi>metalline</hi>
or <hi>Marcaſite-like</hi> ſubſtance, which I could with a
<hi>Microſcope</hi> as plainly ſee moſt curiouſly and regularly
figured, as I had done thoſe in a Flint.</p>
                  <p>From all which and ſeveral other particulars
which I obſerved, I cannot but think, that all theſe,
and moſt other kinds of ſtony bodies which are found
thus ſtrangely figured, do ow their Formation and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98511:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Figuration not to any kind of <hi>Plaſtic Virtue</hi> inherent
in the Earth, but to the Shells of certain Shell-fiſhes,
which either by ſome Deluge, Inundation,
Earthquake or ſome ſuch other means came to
be thrown to that place, and there to be filled
with ſome kind of Mud or Clay, or <hi>petrifying</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or ſome other Subſtance, which in tract of time
hath been ſetled together and hardned in thoſe ſhelly
Moulds into thoſe ſhaped Subſtances we now find
them; That the great and thin end of theſe Shells,
by that Earthquake, or whatever other extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
cauſe it was that brought them thither, was
broken off; and that many others were otherwiſe
broken, bruiſed and disfigured; that theſe Shells
which are thus ſpirallied and ſeparated with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragms,
were ſome kind of <hi>Nautili</hi> or <hi>Porcelane-Shells;</hi>
and that others were Shells of <hi>Muſcles,
Cochles, Periwinkles, Scallops,</hi> &amp;c. of various ſorts;
that theſe Shells in many from the particular nature
of the conteining or incloſed earth or ſome other
cauſe, have in tract of time rotted and mouldred
away, and only left their Impreſſions both on the
conteining and conteined Subſtances; and ſo left
them pretty looſe one within another, ſo that they
may eaſily be ſeparated by a knock or two of a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
That others of theſe Shell-fiſhes according to
the nature of the Subſtances have by a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in that poſture, been petrified and turned into
the nature of Stone. That oftentimes the Shell
may be found with one kind of Subſtance within and
quite another without, having perhaps been filled
in one place and afterwards tranſlated to another,
which I have very frequently obſerved in <hi>Cochle,
Muſcle, Periwincle,</hi> and other Shells, which I have
found by the Sea-ſide. Nay further, that ſome parts
of the ſame Shell may be filled in one place, and ſome
other Caverns in another, and others in a third or
a fourth or a fifth place, for ſo many differing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98511:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have I found in one of the petrified Shells,
and perhaps all theſe differing from the encompaſſing
Earth or Stone: The means how all which varieties
may be caus'd, I think will not be difficult to conceive,
to any one that has taken notice of thoſe Shells, which
are commonly found on the Sea-ſhore: And he
that ſhall throughly examin, ſeveral kinds of ſuch
curiouſly form'd Stones, will (I am very apt to think)
find reaſon to ſuppoſe their generation or formation
to be aſcribable to ſome ſuch Accidents as I have
mentioned, and not to any <hi>Plaſtic Virtue.</hi> For it
ſeems to me quite contrary to the infinite prudence
of Nature, which is obſervable in all its works and
productions, to deſign every thing to a determinate
end, and for the atteining that end makes uſe of
ſuch ways as are (as far as the knowledge of man
has yet been able to reach) altogether conſonant and
moſt agreeable to mans reaſon, and of no way or
means that doth contradict or is contrary to human
ratiocination; whence it has a long time been a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Obſervation and <hi>Maxim,</hi> that <hi>Nature doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in vain:</hi> it ſeems I ſay contrary to that great
wiſdom of Nature, that theſe prettily ſhaped Bodies
ſhould have all thoſe curious figures and contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(which many of them are adorn'd and contriv'd
with) generated or wrought by a <hi>Plaſtic Virtue,</hi> for
no higher end than only to exhibit ſuch a form;
which he that ſhall throughly conſider all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of ſuch kind of figured Bodies, will I think
have great reaſon to believe, though I confeſs one
cannot be able preſently to find out what Natures
deſigns are. Thus far Mr. <hi>Hook.</hi> And <hi>Steno</hi> agrees
exactly with him, and is far more poſitive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident;
For (ſaith he) that theſe Shells were once
the parts of Animals living in a fluid, though there
never had been any teſtaceous marine Creatures, the
very view of the Shell itſelf evinceth, as may be
evident by the inſtance of <hi>bivalve Cochle-ſhells.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:98511:73"/>
                     <gap reason="missing" extent="4 pages">

                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:98511:74"/>
theſe Shells his Obſervations and Diſcourſes
are very conſonant with Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>'s. One or two
particulars not yet mentioned, which may further
confirm this Opinion, I find in him, <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) That
there was found a Pearl-bearing Shell in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi>
a Pearl yet ſticking to the Shell. (2.) A piece of
the greater Sea-nacre [<hi>Piuna marina</hi>] in which the
ſilk-like ſubſtance within the Shell being conſumed,
the colour of that ſubſtance did remain in that earthy
matter which had filled the Shell. (3.) That about
the City of <hi>Volterra</hi> there are many beds of earth not
ſtony, which do abound with true Cochle-ſhells
that have ſuffered no change at all, and yet they
muſt needs have lain there above 3000 years; whence
it is evident, that part of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> was of old time
covered with the Sea, and why then might not as
well all thoſe other places where theſe petrified Shells
are found.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this Opinion lie two very conſiderable
and material Objections, which I ſhall heer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it will hence follow that all the Earth was
once covered by the Sea, and that for a conſiderable
time: for there being found of theſe Shells in the
middle of <hi>Germany,</hi> at leaſt 200 miles diſtant from
any Sea, as my ſelf can witneſs, nay, upon the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Mountains of <hi>Europe,</hi> even the <hi>Alps</hi> themſelves,
(as may be proved by ſufficient Authority) the Sea
muſt needs have covered them, and conſequently,
the water keeping its level, all <hi>Europe</hi> and the World
beſides. Now that ever the Water ſhould have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Earth to that highth as to exceed the tops
of the higheſt Mountains, and for a conſiderable
time abode there, is hard to believe, nor can ſuch
an Opinion be eaſily reconciled with the Scripture.
If it be ſaid that theſe Shells were brought in by
the univerſal Deluge in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> when the
Mountains were covered. I anſwer, that that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98511:75"/>
proceeded from Rain, which was more likely
to carry Shells down to the Sea, than to bring any
upwards from it. But becauſe ſome may argue from
what the Scripture ſaith, [<hi>The fountains of the great
deep were broken up,</hi>] that the Deluge proceeded part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from a breaking forth and overflowing of the Sea,
and conſequently might bring in theſe Shells: To
that I anſwer, that had it been ſo, ſuch a Flood
would have been more likely to ſcatter ſuch Shells
as it brought in indifferently all over the ſurface of
the Earth, than to lay them in great beds in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
places: ſuch beds ſeem to have been the effect of
thoſe Animals breeding there for ſome conſiderable
time. If it be ſaid, that thoſe Mountains where ſuch
Shells are found might at firſt have been low places,
and afterwards raiſed up by Earthquakes, that ſeems
not likely, becauſe they are found upon ſo many
Mountains, unleſs it be ſaid, that all Mountains
were at firſt ſo raiſed, and then the former difficulty
will recurr, and it will follow, that before the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the firſt Mountains, the whole Earth was
covered by the Sea. Beſides, this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſeems
to me in itſelf improbable, for that though there be
mention made in Hiſtories of ſome ſuch Mountains
raiſed by Earthquakes, yet they are but very few and
of no conſiderable highth or greatneſs, compared
with thoſe chains of high and vaſt Mountains, the
<hi>Alps, Pyrenees, Appennine, Taurus, Caucaſus, Imaus,
Haemus, Atlas,</hi> &amp;c. In general ſince the moſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
times recorded in Hiſtory, the face of the Earth
hath ſuffered little change, the ſame Mountains,
Iſlands, Promontories, Lakes, Rivers ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and very few added, loſt or removed. Whence
it will follow, that if the Mountains were not from
the beginning, either the World is a great deal older
than is imagined or believed, there being an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
ſpace of time required to work ſuch changes as
raiſing all the Mountains, according to the leiſurely
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98511:75"/>
proceedings of Nature in mutations of that kind
ſince the firſt Records of Hiſtory: or that in the
primitive times and ſoon after the Creation the earth
ſuffered far more concuſſions and mutations in its
ſuperficial part than afterward.</p>
                  <p>II. Among theſe petrified Shells are many ſorts,
which are not at this day that we know of any where
to be found; nay ſome proceed ſo far as to affirm,
that there is not the like to any one of theſe ſuppoſed
petrified Shells to be found among our preſent Shell-fiſhes.
If it be ſaid, that theſe Species be loſt out
of the World: that is a ſuppoſition which Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
hitherto have been unwilling to admit,
eſteeming the deſtruction of any one Species to be a
diſmembring the Univerſe and rendring it imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
whereas they think the Divine Providence is
eſpecially concerned to preſerve and ſecure all the
Works of the Creation. Yet granting that ſome few
Species might be loſt, it is very unlikely that ſo many
ſhould, and ſtill more unlikely that ſuch as were ſo
diffuſed all over <hi>Europe</hi> and found in ſo many places;
but moſt of all that a whole <hi>Genus,</hi> of which there
were ſo many ſeveral Species, and thoſe ſcattered in
ſo many diſtinct and from each other remote places,
ſhould be ſo utterly extinct and gone, at leaſt out of
our Seas, that there ſhould not one in an age be found.
Such are for example the <hi>Serpentine</hi> Stones or <hi>Cornua
Ammonis</hi> ſuppoſed originally to have been <hi>Nautili,</hi>
of which I my ſelf have ſeen five or ſix diſtinct Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and doubtleſs there are yet many more. Add
heerunto the greatneſs of ſome of theſe Shells, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Cornua Ammonis,</hi> whereof there are found of about
a foot Diameter, far exceeding the bulk of any Shell-fiſh
now breeding or living in our Seas.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Opinion is of thoſe who imagine
theſe bodies to have been the effects and products of
ſome Plaſtic power in the Earth; and to have been
formed after the manner of Diamants and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98511:76"/>
Stones, or the Cryſtals of coagulated Salts, by
ſhooting into ſuch figures. Of theſe bodies my
very ingenious and learned Friend Mr. <hi>Martin Liſter</hi>
diſcourſes in a Letter of his inſerted in the <hi>Philoſoph.
Tranſact.</hi> Numb. 76. to this purpoſe, upon occaſion
of Mr. <hi>Steno</hi>'s <hi>Prodromus.</hi> We will eaſily believe,
that in ſome Countries, and particularly along the
ſhore of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, there may all manner
of Shell-fiſhes be found promiſcuouſly included in
rocks or earth, and at good diſtances too from the
Sea. But for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> inland Quarries, which
alſo abound with infinite numbers and great varieties
of Shells, I am apt to think there is no ſuch matter
as petrifying of Shells in the buſineſs (or as <hi>Steno</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
himſelf, Pag. 84. in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> verſion <hi>&amp; alibi,</hi>
that the ſubſtance of theſe Shells formerly belonging
to Animals, hath been diſſolved or waſted by the
penetrating force of Juices, and that a ſtony ſubſtance
is come in the place thereof) but that theſe Cochle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Stones ever were as they are at preſent, <hi>Lapides
ſui generis,</hi> and never any part of an Animal. That
they are ſo at preſent is in effect confeſſed by <hi>Steno</hi>
in the above-cited page; and it is moſt certain, that
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Quarry-ſhells (to continue that abuſive
name) have no parts of a different texture from the
Rock or Quarry they are taken, that is, that there
is no ſuch thing as Shell in theſe reſemblances of
Shells, but that Iron-ſtone Cochles are all Iron-ſtone,
Lime or Marble all Lime-ſtone and Marble, Spar or
Cryſtalline Shells all Spar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that they never
were any part of an Animal. My Reaſon is, that
Quarries of different Stone yield us quite different
ſorts or Species of Shells, not only one from another
(as thoſe Cochle-ſtones of the Iron-ſtone Quarries
of <hi>Adderton</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> differ from thoſe found in
the Lead-Mines of the neighbouring Mountains, and
both theſe from that Cochle-Quarry of <hi>Wansford</hi>-Bridge
in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> and all thee from thoſe
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98511:76"/>
to be found in the Quarries about <hi>Gunthorp</hi> and
<hi>Beauvo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r</hi>-Caſtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but I dare boldly ſay from any
thing in Nature beſides, that either the Land, ſalt
or freſh Waters do yield us. 'Tis true that I have
picked out of that one Quarry of <hi>Wansford</hi> very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances
of <hi>Murices, Tellinae, Turbines, Cochleae,
&amp;c.</hi> and yet I am not convinc'd, when I particularly
examined ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Shores for Shells, as
alſo the freſh Waters and the Fields, that I did ever
meet with any one of thoſe Species of Shells any
where elſe but in their reſpective Quarries, whence I
conclude them <hi>Lapides ſui generis,</hi> and that they
were not caſt in any Animal mould whoſe Species or
race is yet to be found in being at this day. Thus
far Mr. <hi>Liſter.</hi> The like Argument alſo <hi>Goropius
Becanus</hi> uſes to prove that theſe Bodies are not petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Shells. <hi>Scallop-ſhells</hi> (ſaith he) are ſo rare upon
the ſhores of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that they are brought thither
by Pilgrims from the coaſt of <hi>Gallicia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
ſhown for ſtrange things; and yet in the ditches
about <hi>Antwerp</hi> there is ſuch plenty of them, that in
digging there they throw up heaps of them like little
mountains, ſo that he that would gather of them
need not take the pains to travel to <hi>Gallicia,</hi> or ſo
much as to the Sea-ſhores. To theſe he adds ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Argument which yet to me ſeems of little force.
In ſome places about <hi>Antwerp</hi> digging for water,
they meet with in the earth a cruſt or Layer of two
foot thickneſs and in ſome parts thinner, wholly
made up of Sea-ſhells, whereas there was never
found ſuch a Maſs of Shells upon any of the Sea-ſhores;
ſo that no man can reaſonably aſſert that
they were thrown up by the Sea and there left, the
waters receding and forſaking them; for then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
queſtion we ſhould hear of the like heaps or beds
of them found on the coaſts of <hi>Holland, Zealand</hi> and
<hi>Flanders</hi> But to this I anſwer that the reaſon why
at this day there are not ſuch beds of them to be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98511:77"/>
found upon the ſhores, may be, becauſe they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
up and carried away by men, partly out of
curioſity, partly to burn for lime or other ways to
make uſe of. Beſides we know that in the bottom
of the Sea, theſe Shell-fiſhes many times lie in great
beds, and there breed in great abundance, and it
is not altogether unlikely, that the Sea might
on occaſion ſuddenly recede and deſert ſuch beds,
and they afterwards come to be buried in the Earth.</p>
                  <p>But to argue further in defence of this Opinion.
There are found in the earth many ſuch like figured
Stones which we know not whither to refer, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
neither any part of an Animal, nor of a
Plant: Such are thoſe that Naturaliſts call <hi>Lapides

                        </gap>eriae</hi> and others, to which if there be at preſent
any Shells, Bones, Fruits, Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> like, I am
as yet wholly to ſeek for them. And if there are
now no ſuch things in being, they that defend the
contrary Opinion muſt have recourſe to that gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous
ſuppoſition that ſuch Species are loſt out of the
World.</p>
                  <p>Beſides I have been told by a perſon of good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of a Stone of this nature reſembling a Cochle-ſhell
found in the ſtomach of a Beef; where in all
likelihood it muſt be bred and ſhoot into that figure;
which if true, there can be no reaſon to doubt, but
thoſe in the Stone-Quarries and other places are ſo
generated.</p>
                  <p>A third Opinion there is, that ſome of theſe
bodies are really Shells petrified, or the caſes of ſuch
bodies or their contents: and that others of them
are ſtones of their own kind reſembling ſuch Shells,
ſo ſhaped and figured by ſome Plaſtic power. That
Shells may be and are ſometimes petrified (as are
alſo Bones and Wood) cannot be denied, and I my
ſelf have gathered ſuch upon the Sea-ſhore; and on
the other hand, he that aſſerts that there are bodies
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98511:77"/>
naturally growing in the earth, which do imitate
Sea-ſhells, delivers himſelf from the trouble of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
the Arguments which urge the contrary
opinion. But yet methinks this is but a ſhift and
refuge to avoid trouble, there not being ſufficient
ground to found ſuch a diſtinction. For my own
part I confeſs I propend to the firſt Opinion, as
being more conſonant to the nature of the thing,
and could wiſh that all external arguments and obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
againſt it were rationally and ſolidly anſwered.</p>

                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 4. we proceeded on our journey to <hi>Ratiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> and paſſed through <hi>Nieumarkt,</hi> a little walled

                  </p>
                  <p>5. We paſſed through <hi>Heinmaw</hi> a ſmall walled

paſſing the River <hi>Danow,</hi> by a fair Stone-Bridge,
we entred <hi>Ratisbone</hi> or <hi>Regensberg</hi> ſo called from

after the <hi>Italian</hi> made. The <hi>Diet</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> is

governed by its own magiſtrates, though in the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Septemb.</hi> 10. we hired a Boat for <hi>Vienna:</hi> Firſt,
on our left hand as we went down the river, we
paſſed by a little village and a caſtle ſtanding on a
hill, called <hi>Thonaſtan.</hi> About three miles and half
below <hi>Regensberg</hi> we paſſed in ſight of <hi>Wert,</hi> a caſtle
belonging to the Biſhop of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> ſeated on a

the <hi>Danow.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Strau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing.</note> This night we lodged at <hi>Straubing,</hi> a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 12. in the morning we paſt <hi>Pogen</hi> where is
a Church ſtanding on a high hill. Four miles below
<hi>Straubing</hi> we rowed under a wooden bridge which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98511:81"/>
there croſſes the <hi>Danow.</hi> Heer on the left hand as
one goes down, ſtands <hi>Dreckendorf,</hi> a walled town
belonging to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> A little further
off we paſſed by the mouth of the river <hi>Iſer.</hi> Then
we had a proſpect of <hi>Oſterhoven</hi> on our left hand, and
not far thence a ſmall village called <hi>Hofkirchen,</hi> and
on the ſame ſide ſtill a little caſtle called <hi>Hilkersberg,</hi>
where the ſhores along the river began to be rocky.
This night we lodged at a pretty little walled
town built of ſtone,<note place="margin">Vilſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> called <hi>Vilſhoven,</hi> belonging to
<hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">Paſſaw.</note> At four miles diſtance from <hi>Vilſhoven</hi> we
came to <hi>Paſſaw,</hi> a conſiderable city for its ſtrength
and greatneſs, formerly well built with many fair
ſtone houſes. But about three quarters of a year
before our being there, a moſt dreadful Fire burnt
down, ruin'd and deſtroy'd almoſt the whole Town,
Churches, public buildings and all. It is ſituate
juſt at the confluence of the rivers <hi>In</hi> and <hi>Danow,</hi>
and ſubject to the Archduke of <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> who, we
were told, gave 50000 dollars towards the rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. Heer is a bridge over the river <hi>In</hi> to a
town called <hi>Inſtat.</hi> Hitherto the river <hi>Danow</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
gently down, but below <hi>Paſſaw,</hi> it began to be
ſtreightned by hills on both ſides and to run with a
ſwifter ſtream. Seven miles from <hi>Paſſaw</hi> we paſſed by
<hi>Nayhonſe</hi> caſtle, and this third night lodged at a
pretty little village belonging to the Emperor called
<hi>Aſch,</hi> ſtanding on the right ſide of the river.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 14. we had an open countrey again, no hills
being near the river. At four miles end we landed
at <hi>Lintz,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lintz.</note> and viewed the city, which we found to
be a very elegant place, well built with ſtone hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
flat rooft after the <hi>Italian</hi> faſhion; having a large
ſquare <hi>Piazza</hi> with two fountains in it, and on the
higheſt part a fair palace of the Emperor, whence
there is a pleaſant proſpect of the <hi>Danow</hi> and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
adjacent. About three miles below <hi>Lintz</hi> we
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98511:81"/>
paſſed a pretty village on our left hand, called <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſen.</hi>
Then we had a proſpect of a town on our
right hand ſituate upon the river <hi>Ens</hi> called <hi>Intz.</hi>
Seven miles below <hi>Lintz</hi> are hills again on both ſides
the river. Heerabouts is a village called <hi>Greine,</hi>
where the Earl of <hi>Lichtenſtein</hi> hath a houſe ſituate
on a hill. Below <hi>Greine</hi> on the left hand is a little
village, where we paſt a dangerous place in the river
called <hi>Strom,</hi> where the ſtream being ſtreightned by
hills on each hand runs very ſwiftly, and beſides is
full of rocks: a little further below a rock, which
jets a good way out into the river, we paſſed a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
whirtl-pool called the <hi>Werble.</hi> At ſome diſtance
further on the left hand ſtands a ſmall village under
a high hill, half whereof fell down about two years
before our being there, which made ſo great a noiſe
that it was heard two <hi>German</hi> miles off, at <hi>Ips,</hi> a
little town we paſſed by on the right hand. We lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
this fourth night at a ſmall village called <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pach,</hi>
11 miles from <hi>Lintz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 15. in the morning we went by a rich cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
called <hi>Melk</hi> on our right. At ſix miles diſtance
from our lodging we paſſed a fair houſe of the Earl
of <hi>Dernſtein</hi>'s on our left hand, and heerabout had
a proſpect of <hi>Ketwein</hi> a rich Abby ſtrongly ſituate on
a hill, attempted by the <hi>Swedes</hi> without ſucccheſs.
About nine miles from <hi>Marbach</hi> we paſſed under a
wooden bridge by a little walled town called <hi>Stein,</hi>
where the <hi>Swedes</hi> (they told us) were notably beaten
and driven out again after they had entred the town;
which repulſe they afterwards revenged, when they
took the place, by plundering and ſpoiling it. Not
far hence we landed to view <hi>Krembs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Krembs.</note> a conſiderable
city ſeated on the ſide of a hill, well-built, walled
about and trenched towards the river. From hence
we came into an open countrey, and the river being
at liberty, the chanel grew much wider. Six miles
below <hi>Krembs</hi> we paſſed by a ſmall walled Town oh
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98511:82"/>
the right hand called <hi>Deuln;</hi> then we had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of <hi>Greitenſtein,</hi> a caſtle ſituate on a hill at ſome
diſtance from the river on the left hand; next we
had a ſight of <hi>Cornberg,</hi> a wall'd town in a plain
not far from the <hi>Danow;</hi> taken by the <hi>Swedes</hi> in the
late wars and by them notably defended againſt the
Emperor. Heer and afterward at ſeveral other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
we obſerved mills built upon two boats, the
wheel lying between the boats, which are fixed at
a convenient diſtance one from another, and ſo the
ſtream coming between the boats, and by reaſon it
is ſtreightned by degrees, running more ſwiftly,
turns the wheel. One of the boats is by ſtrong cables
or chains at each end faſtned to the bank, and ſo
the boats, mill and all riſe and fall with the water.
About a mile and half before we reach'd <hi>Vienna</hi> we
went by a fair rich Abby called <hi>Claiſternaiberg,</hi> with
a little wall'd town of the ſame name; and at the
end of 19 <hi>German</hi> miles, which the ſwiftneſs of the
current aſſiſting us, we made this day, we arrived at
<hi>Vienna,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vienna.</note> the chief city of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and at preſent the
imperial ſeat, ſo called from the river <hi>Wien</hi> which
runs into the <hi>Danow</hi> no the Eaſt ſide of the Town.
It is for the bigneſs of it the moſt frequent and full
of people that we have yet ſeen beyond the ſeas. The
wall is not above four or five <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,
but there are large Suburbs at a little diſtance
from the town, thoſe houſes that were very near
being lately pull'd down to clear the wall and works
for fear of a Siege: The <hi>Tures</hi> at the time of our
being there having taken <hi>Neuhauſel,</hi> and news com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they were marching with their whole army
towards <hi>Presburg</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> not above 40 <hi>Engliſh</hi>
miles diſtant from <hi>Vienna.</hi> This City is regularly
and ſtrongly fortified with a high and impenetrable
wall of earth faced with brick, a broad and deep
trench, into which they can (as they told us) when
they pleaſe draw the water; Baſtions, half-moons
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98511:82"/>
and horn-words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it is juſtly reputed one
of the ſtrongeſt holds of Chriſtendom. The inner
wall, which was ſaid to be built with the ranſom of
<hi>Richard.</hi> I. King of <hi>England,</hi> is of little ſtrength or
conſideration in compariſon with the new and outer
one. The houſes are ſufficiently tall and well built
of ſtone, the roofs flattiſh after the <hi>Italian</hi> mode:
The ſtreets rather narrow than broad; the markets
well ſtored with all neceſſaries. Heer we firſt met
with tortoiſes to be ſold, at the rate of ſix pence
apiece: they are found in muddy ditches in theſe
parts. Heer alſo we firſt took notice of the fruit
of <hi>Sorbus legitima;</hi> and firſt ſaw in the fiſh-markets
the <hi>Silurus</hi> or Sheat-fiſh, the greateſt of all freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water

having ſtreight ſtreets and a fair ſquare market-place.
At three of the corners are mounts or baſtions, and
at the fourth a Caſtle. In the layes near this town
I firſt found <hi>Aſperula caerulea.</hi> Two miles beyond
<hi>Neuſtat</hi> we began to leave the open countrey and to
come among hills. We lodged this night at a village
called <hi>Gluknitz</hi> four miles diſtant from <hi>Neuſtat.</hi> The
houſes in theſe villages are for the moſt part covered
with ſhingles of wood: the hills clothed with woods
of Pine.</p>

came to a little fort in a village called <hi>Clauſen,</hi> where
are two draw-bridges, which we were not permitted
to paſs, till we had delivered our bill of health. Hence
we travelled along by the river, and obſerved tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-trees
floted down the ſtream, and when the
rocks ſtopped them, men with hooks put them off
and directed them into the force of the current.
This is the manner all over the <hi>Alps</hi> and other high
mountains, they fell trees and get them to any little
current of water and expect a good ſhot of rain,
and then flote them down to the greater rivers. This

                  </p>
                  <p>We paſſed by <hi>Limonia</hi> a wall'd town ſituate on

Some miles further we paſſed S. <hi>Danicle;</hi> then we

heerabouts in a time of rain or when the ſnow melts

brought us to S. <hi>Avogio,</hi> a village where we

                  <p>We rode along the plains and at ten miles end

                  <p>We rode a <hi>Dutch</hi> mile and then ferried over the

                     <note place="margin">6.</note> and at ten <hi>Italiam</hi> miles further
come to <hi>Treaviſo</hi> a large Town,<note place="margin">Treviſo.</note> the head of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
called <hi>Marea Treviſana,</hi> an important place

In <hi>Marea Treviſana,</hi> ſome part of <hi>Friuli,</hi> and
the greateſt part of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> we obſerved the
Corn-fields to be ſo thick ſet with rows of trees,
that if a man from an hill or high tower ſhould
look down upon the Countrey at a diſtance, he
would take it to be a Wood. Againſt every Tree
is planted a Vine, which runs up the tree, and
the branches of the neighbour-vines they draw
from tree to tree and tie together: So that their
Corn-fields are alſo Woods and Vine-yards, the
ſame land ſufficing for all theſe productions, and
not being exhauſted with ſo much ſpending (as
one would be apt to imagine) by reaſon of the
depth and richneſs of its ſoil. Neither in this
hot Countrey doth the Corn receive any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
from the ſhade or dropping of the Trees,
(which in our colder Climate would quite marr
it) but rather advantage, there falling little rain
in Summer-time, and the Trees keeping off the
ſcorching Sun-beams, which elſe might dry up and
wither it; the heat notwithſtanding ſufficing to
bring the Grain to perfect maturity. Whereas
with us all the Sun we can give it is little enough,
and the very graſs which grows under the trees
is ſowr and crude: for that uſually we have too
little heat for our moiſture, and they too much.
This part of <hi>Italy</hi> hath been deſervedly celebrated

                  <p>This City was firſt founded, according to the

theſe irruptions of barbarous nations, ſought refuge
for themſelves in theſe deſolate Iſlands, in the year
456 or thereabouts. Others make the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it to have been before that time in the year
421 or 423. But though in the times of former
irruptions many of the neighbouring people fled
hither to ſhelter themſelves from the preſent ſtorm,
yet I believe they did not think of ſettling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

The Sum total is 134871. <hi>Sanſovinus</hi> reckons
the number of ſouls in his time to have been 180000,
but, I ſuppoſe, he takes in <hi>Muran</hi> and the other
Iſlands, which in this ſurvey are left out. I am not
ignorant that ſeveral late writers make the preſent
number of Inhabitants to be at leaſt 300000, but I
believe they ſpeak at random, and by conjecture,
upon no good grounds; (as I have been often told,
that there are in <hi>Paris</hi> a million and half of people,
whereas it is well if there be half <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

total of the number of males to exceed the total of
the number of females in this ſurvey by above 3500,
which comes near to the account of the exceſs of
males in <hi>England,</hi> given us by Capt. <hi>Graunt</hi> in his
Obſervations upon the weekly Bills of Mortality in
<hi>London.</hi> And I doubt not but if exact, obſervations
were made in other places, there would be found
the like proportion between the number of males
and females born into the world in hot countries as
in cold. So that from this Topic the <hi>Aſiatics</hi> have
no greater plea for multiplicity of wives than the

you may convey your ſelf and goods from any

ſees his Miſtreſs before they go to be married, or if

an old Woman.</p>
                  <p>The Government is Ariſtocratical, but among

                     <p>The <hi>Great Council</hi> is as it were the <hi>baſis</hi> of the

and from which as well the Senate as all the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
derive their Authority. It is made up of all
the Gentlemen of the City who have paſſed the
25. year of their age; the number of which is about
2500 in all. But yet before they can be admitted
to give their ſuffrages in
Council they muſt before

Thoſe then that would appeal muſt firſt have recourſe to the <hi>Auvogadors;</hi> who are all diligently to examin the Cauſe, and conſider whether it ought to be brought in, and if they all agree that it ought not, then he that would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal hath no remedy, but to expect another ſet of <hi>Auvogadors;</hi> but if but one of them accepts it, it is enough to bring it in.</note> 
                        <hi>Auvogadori di Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune,</hi>
by the oath of their
fathers or mothers, or if
they be dead, of their near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

have atteined that age; and
by the teſtimony of two
witneſſes, that they are the
legitimate ſons of ſuch Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
as they profeſs or
pretend themſelves to be.
But to ſatisfie the longing
of ſuch young men as deſire
to taſt the ſweetneſs of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ſooner, there is a way fo ſome of thoſe
who are but twenty years of age complete to get
into the Council, <hi>viz.</hi> Before the fourth of <hi>December</hi>
being S. <hi>Barbara's</hi> day, all ſuch young men muſt in
the manner we have already mentioned, before the
<hi>Auvogadori</hi> prove themſelves to be full twenty years
old, and the legitimate ſons of Gentlemen. Which
done the Secretary of the <hi>Auvogadori</hi> gives to each
a Schedule ſealed by the three <hi>Auvogadori,</hi> ſignifying
ſo much. Theſe Schedules they carry to the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of the <hi>Quarantia criminale,</hi> who writes the
names of them who brought the Schedules, each in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98511:91"/>
a ſcroll by itſelf; and on the 4. of <hi>December</hi> carries
all theſe ſcrolls before the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Counſellors,</hi> in
whoſe preſence they are all put into one Urn, and
into another are put ſo many golden balls as are equal
to the fifth part of the number of ſcrolls, if it be leſs
than 30; if it be more than 30, there are yet put in
but 30 balls, and ſo many ſilver: ones as with the
golden ſhall be equal to the number of the young
men competitors. Theſe being ſhaken together,
the <hi>Duke</hi> out of the firſt urn draws a ſcroll and reads
the name, then out of the other takes a ball, which
if it proves to be a golden one; ſuch an one whoſe
name was written in the ſcroll is underſtood to be
admitted into the Council. And ſo he proceeds,
drawing out firſt a ſcroll and then a ball, till all the
golden balls are drawn out; and ſo without more
ado thoſe thirty whoſe lot it is to have the golden
balls may go into the Council and ballot: The reſt
muſt ſtay till another year and then take their chance,
if they are not before come to the age of 25. In
troubleſom times when the Common-wealth wants
money, they have alſo conferred this honour upon
ſuch as are under 25 years for aſſiſting the Public
with the gift or loan of a certain ſum of money.</p>
                     <p>At one end of the Great Council chamber (or Hall
as they call it, though it be an upper room) ſits the
Duke on a tribunal elevated above the level of the
chamber, with three of the Counſellours and one
of the heads or chiefs of the Court called <hi>Quarantia
criminale (Capi de Quaranta</hi>) ſitting on his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand;
and the other three Counſellors, and below
them the other two chiefs of the <hi>Quarantia</hi> on his
left; and on benches on each ſide the tribunal,
which make right angles with the end, ſit the Great
Chancellour and Secretaries. The faſhion of the
Hall and Benches on which the Gentlemen ſit, and
the places of the chief Officers and Magiſtrates, I
ſhall omit, as being hardly intelligible to ſuch as

                     <p>The Council is aſſembled every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and
ſometimes oftner, by the tolling of a bell, which
begins at noon and ceaſes not till one of the clock;
and elects the Magiſtrates and Officers in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
Firſt of all the Electors or Nominators are
drawn by lot. After that thoſe that are nominated
by ſuch Electors are balloted in the Council, and
thoſe that have above half the ſuffrages of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
preſent are underſtood to be elected.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe there muſt be at leaſt nine Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grates
created at every meeting of the Council, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is neceſſary to make at leaſt nine Electors:
and becauſe ſome Magiſtrates places may have but
two Competitors and ſome four, and in ſome days
are created of one ſort, in ſome of another, and in
ſome of both together; when there are only ſuch
created as can have but two Competitors (which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
happens) then there need be but two Sets or
Companies of Electors made: but when any ſuch
are to be created as muſt have four Competitors,
then there are four Sets of Electors made, of nine
in each Set. While the bell tolls, all the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that can with convenience are to repair to the
Council, which being once aſſembled, the doors
lockt up and the Keys brought and laid down at the
Dukes feet, none can afterwards be admitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
except he be a Counſellor, an <hi>Auvogador,</hi> one
of the heads or chiefs of the Council of ten (called

                     <p>
                        <hi>NB.</hi> (1.) For the creation of Magiſtrates there is
no <hi>Quorum</hi> or determinate number of Gentlemen
required to be preſent to make a Council; though
it ſeldom happens the Council-chamber not to be
full. For other buſineſs as the eſtabliſhing new

                     <p>The Duke; the chief Magiſtrates and Officers, and
all the Gentlemen being ſet down in their places;
before the Tribunal on which the Duke ſits, in the
plain of the Council-chamber, are placed on a
three urns called <hi>Capelli,</hi> upon ſtands ſo high above
the floor that no man can look into them, and yet
for greater ſecurity they are alſo covered, only the
two outermoſt have two holes in their covers to
put in the hand to draw out the balls. The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemoſt
that ſtands over againſt the Duke hath but
one hole. In each of the two outermoſt urns are
put about 800 balls made of copper and gilded over
with ſilver (which I ſhall take leave to call ſilver
balls, as thoſe that are gilded with gold, golden
balls) ſo that the whole number in both amounts
to about 1500 or 1600, for ſo many Gentlemen are
commonly preſent at each meeting of the Great
Council. Beſides in theſe urns together with the
ſilver are mingled 60 golden balls, 30 in each urn.
In the middlemoſt urn are put 60 balls, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
36 are golden and 24 ſilver. Then the Great
Chancellor (who is always a Citizen and no Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
goeth to his place appointed for that purpoſe,
and reads what Magiſtrates are to be created that
day, which done, he returns to the tribunal, and
calling the <hi>Auvogadors,</hi> the <hi>Capi de Dieci,</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
and the old and new Auditors, he adminiſters
to them an oath to obſerve the laws of the Council,
in which is conteined, that all ſhall ſit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that none
ſhall change his bench at prohibited times; that
none ſhall ſeek any Magiſtracy by diſhoneſt means, or
favour and abet any other in ſo doing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they
are ſworn, they return to their places, and the three
junior Counſellors riſing up, the eldeſt of them goes
and ſets him down over againſt the middlemoſt urn,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98511:92"/>
the next before that on the right hand of the Duke,
and the youngeſt over againſt that on the left. Then
there are lots drawn what bench ſhall come firſt up
to the <hi>Capello,</hi> (the whole Council being divided
into five benches of Gentlemen) and what end of
that bench, and what ſide of that end (for all the
benches are double) in this manner. There are put
into an urn ten ſilver balls, five of them marked with
the five firſt figures or the characters of the numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and by each number is written ſuch an
end and ſuch a ſide. The other five balls are marked
with the ſame figures, but on each of them is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the contrary end and contrary ſide. So that if
under the figure 1 in the firſt five be written, the end
towards the <hi>Broil</hi> and the ſide towards S. <hi>Georges;</hi>
under the figure 1 in the other five is written, the
end towards <hi>Caſtello</hi> and the ſide next S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s.
Then they draw out of the urn one of theſe balls,
the figure and inſcription whereof ſhews what bench
and what end and ſide of that bench is to come firſt
up to the <hi>Capello.</hi> Then they look into the urn and
take out that ball which is marked with the ſame fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
and the contrary end and ſide. After the ſame
manner they draw out by lot another ball, and ſo a
third, fourth and fifth, calling up the benches in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
till all the Electors are made. Of the bench
that is called firſt, each one in order comes up to one
of the exteriour urns, and draws thereout a ball,
which if it be ſilver, he puts it into another urn ſet
on the floor at the foot of that out of which he drew
it, and returns to his place, having obteined nothing;
but if it be a golden one, he delivers it into the hand
of that Counſellor who ſits by that urn, and goes
preſently to the middle urn, and thence alſo draws
out a ball; which if it be ſilver, having preſented
it to the Counſellor who ſits before the urn, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
to his place: but if it be gold, he delivers it
likewiſe to the Counſellor, and is underſtood to be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98511:93"/>
one of the Electors of the firſt ſet; and ſits down on
the bench on which the ſaid Counſellor ſits (which
ſtands acroſs the Dukes tribunal) with his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Duke, that none in the Hall may by any
nod or other ſign recommend themſelves to him.
Then a Secretary pronounces his name aloud, that
all of his family or near to him by affinity may take
notice of it. There he continues ſitting till all the
other eight of the firſt ſet of Electors be in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
by lot created. And if by chance two of one
family are drawn in the firſt ſet, the ſecond of them
is reſerved for the ſecond ſet or company, and he
that is firſt taken for the ſecond ſet comes in his
room into the firſt. And then for that day none of
that family nor any that are of near affinity to him
can come any more to the <hi>Capello,</hi> becauſe it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by the Laws, that in all the four ſets of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
which make up 36, there ſhall be no more than
two of the ſame family; and that thoſe two ſhall
not be in the ſame ſet, ſo that the nine that are of
the ſame ſet muſt be of nine ſeveral families. To
the youngeſt of the nine of this firſt ſet is by one of
the Secretaries delivered a Schedule ſealed by the
public Seal, wherein are written in order all the
Magiſtrates that are to be that day created. Then
all the nine take an oath, to chuſe thoſe whom they
ſhall judge moſt fit to ſerve the Common-wealth,
and go forth the Council-chamber into a private
room appointed for them. In like manner are the
other three ſets of Electors made, who being ſworn
do likewiſe take their Schedules, and withdraw into
their reſpective rooms. When all the four ſets of
Electors are choſen and withdrawn, then any of the
Gentlemen in the Council-chamber may change his
bench as he pleaſes. [<hi>NB.</hi> When there are only ſuch
Magiſtracies to be diſpoſed of as can have but two
Competitors, there are but two ſets of Electors
made.] When the firſt ſet is withdrawn, they ſit
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98511:93"/>
down, taking place according to their age. Then
a Secretary appointed for that purpoſe reads to them
the laws and conſtitutions which they are obliged
to obſerve in the choice of Magiſtrates: after which
he puts into an urn nine balls, marked with the nine
numeral characters or figures, and each Elector ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his age draws out one till they be all
drawn out. He that draws the ball marked 1, is
underſtood to have the nomination of the Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for the firſt Magiſtrates place ſet down in the
Schedule, and he who draws that marked 2, to have
the nomination of the ſecond, and ſo in order of
the reſt. When there are eleven Magiſtrates to be
made in a day, he that hath the nomination of the
firſt, nominates alſo the tenth, and he that hath
the ſecond the eleventh. [<hi>NB.</hi> One of theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
may nominate himſelf to any Office: they
may alſo change their Votes among themſelves, as
for example, he that hath the nomination of the
Competitor for the firſt place may change with him
who hath the nomination for the ſecond or third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and ſo of any other.] He then who hath by lot
obteined the nomination of a Competitor for the
firſt Magiſtrate, names one whom he pleaſes, who
is balloted among the nine, and if he hath two thirds
of the ſuffrages, he is underſtood to be elected; if
not, he names a ſecond and ſo a third, till he comes
to propound one that gets two thirds. His name
that is ſo approved is by the Secretary ſet down in
the Schedule under the name of that place to which
he is nominated, with the name of him who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
him, and the ſet of Electors he was of; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if the nominated be to a place wherein he is
entruſted with the management of public moneys,
he that nominates is ſurety for him, and is to make
good what he defrauds the Common-wealth of.
Then he that hath the ſecond voice names his man,
who is balloted and approved in like manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:98511:94"/>
The ſame order of nomination and approbation is
obſerved in the other three ſets of Electors. Only
in the third and fourth ſets when there are ſome of
thoſe places to be diſpoſed of which can have but
two Competitors, its neceſſary that ſome of the
Electors, to whoſe lot the nomination to ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
falls, nominate not at all; becauſe the Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
to ſuch places are already nominated and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
in the two firſt ſets. Yet is not their being
Electors altogether uſeleſs and inſignificant, becauſe
they have power to ballot thoſe that are nominated
by the other Electors. If any difficulty ariſes
among the Electors about any perſon nominated,
<hi>v. g.</hi> whether he may be balloted or the like, one of
the <hi>Auvogadors</hi> and one of the <hi>Capi de Dieci</hi> go
into the room where thoſe Electors are and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
it.</p>
                     <p>The Competitors being in this manner choſen,
none of the Electors returns any more into the
Council-chamber, unleſs he be one of the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
or one of the <hi>Capi di Dieci,</hi> or of the <hi>Auvoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,</hi>
or of the Cenſors. The Secretaries then of
the ſeveral companies of Electors preſent to the
Great Chancellor the Schedules in which are written
the Magiſtrates to be elected, and under every one
the Competitors, for it. Now it may happen that
one and the ſame Gentleman may be choſen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor
for a Magiſtracy by two or three or all four
of the ſets of Electors, and then though he hath
no Competitor he may be balloted, becauſe he is
underſtood to be Competitor to himſelf. But if for
one place there be choſen in each of the ſets a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor,
then they look firſt whether he be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of ſuch a place, either by reaſon he hath
had ſome Magiſtracy lately, and the time not yet
expired that is required by the law before he be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of another, or becauſe ſome of his kinred is
in an incompatible place; or bacauſe he is indebted
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98511:94"/>
to the public or the like. Now if of four Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
three are found uncapable, the fourth remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without a Competitor cannot be balloted. But
if one be elected in two ſets and his two Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
uncapable of ſtanding, yet may he be balloted,
for the reaſon before alleged.</p>
                     <p>The Great Chancellor having received the Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules,
reads aloud the names of all the Magiſtrates
places with their Competitors; and then beginning
from the firſt he propounds the Competitors for
that, and firſt him that was nominated by the firſt
ſet, and if he were nominated by any other of the
ſets, he mentions that alſo. And when he hath
read the names of all the Competitors for one place,
they all that are nominated and all of their family
and near affinity go out of the Council-chamber into
a private room, where they ſtay till they have been
all balloted, and the ſecond place propounded with
its Competitors; and then they return again and
ballot. As ſoon as they are withdrawn, the Great
Chancellor with a loud voice -puts all in mind, that
both by the Divine and humane law every one is
obliged to favour him whom he judges to be beſt of
all and fitteſt to ſerve the Common-wealth in ſuch
place as they ſhall chuſe him to. Then he nominates
the firſt Competitor, and little boys appointed for
that purpoſe (having firſt delivered to every Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
a ball) run about the chamber with balloting
boxes in their hands to gather the ſuffrages. The
balls are made of linen that they may make no noiſe
when they fall into the boxes. The boxes are made
double, the one painted white, the other green.
The white is marked with <hi>Si,</hi> i. e. Yea, into which
they that accept put their balls; and the green with
<hi>No,</hi> into which they that refuſe the party propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
put theirs. The boxes are made in that manner
with a hole in the ſide to thruſt in the hand, that no
man can ſee into which box you let fall the ball.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:98511:95"/>
Theſe little boys as they go along gathering the balls,
repete ſtill aloud the name of the perſon that is then
balloted. When they have gathered up the balls,
they carry them to the Dukes tribunal, and put the
<hi>Yea's</hi> in a white veſſel there ſtanding, and the <hi>No's</hi>
in a green. The Affirmative or <hi>Yea's</hi> are told over
by the Counſellors ſitting on the right hand of the
Duke, and the Negative or <hi>No's</hi> by them ſitting on
the left; and if the <hi>Si's</hi> are leſs than half the whole
number of ſuffrages, ſuch a perſon hath loſt it; but
if they be more he may obtein it; and therefore the
number by which it exceeds the half is ſet down. In
the mean time the other Competitors are named and
balloted in like manner, and at laſt he whoſe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative
ſuffrages or <hi>Si's</hi> exceed the half by the greater
number, is underſtood to be choſen to that place. The
like method of proceeding is obſerved in the choice
of the ſecond, third and all the reſt of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
for that day. When the balloting and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is done, the Great Chancellor gives notice who
are elected, commanding them to preſent themſelves
before the Cenſors, who take an oath of them that
they have not done any thing contrary to the laws to
obtein thoſe places; which done the Council is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt.
<hi>NB.</hi> If none of the Competitors for any place
have above half the number of ſuffrages, there is none
as yet underſtood to be choſen to that place. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
by an antient Law the Great Council is to break
up before Sun-ſet, if it happens any of the Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
are not before that time come to the ballot, the
names of ſuch Magiſtrates and Officers as are choſen
are read, and they that remain to be balloted loſe the
benefit of their nomination, becauſe the next Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-day
all is begun anew and there are other Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
made. It is permitted to any ſtranger to be
preſent at the meetings of the Great Council (as we
were ſeveral times) to ſee the manner of proceeding
there, and there is a particular bench appointed for
them to ſit on.</p>

all the great and weighty affairs of the

conſiſted of no more than 60. Afterwards they
began to add thereto ſometimes 25, ſometimes 20,
inſomuch that it was at laſt concluded, that there
ſhould be made an addition to it (<hi>Aggiunta</hi> they call
it) of as many more. The cauſe of ſuch additions
was, I ſuppoſe, the greatneſs and importance of
the affairs then to be conſidered and treated of, that
ſo a greater number of Gentlemen being preſent at
ſuch conſultations and debates, matters might be
better diſputed, and more throughly ſcanned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.
In the number of the 60 <hi>Pregadi</hi> there can

                     <p>The <hi>Pregadi</hi> were ſo called, as ſome think, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
anciently they were aſſembled by public Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
and by them as it were prayed and entreated
that they would come and conſult of the affairs of
the Commonwealth. The <hi>Pregadi</hi> properly ſo called
are choſen by the Gr. Council, as the other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
are, in the manner before related. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
ſo ſoon to chuſe them that all of them may be
elected by the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> at which time
they enter upon their Office. The <hi>Giunta</hi> or other 60
are choſen both by the Council of the old <hi>Pregadi</hi> and
the Great Council in this manner. Upon <hi>Michaelmas</hi>
day the Council of the old <hi>Pregadi</hi> is aſſembled,
wherein each one of thoſe that have ſuffrages nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
the perſon whom he would have to be of the
<hi>Giunta.</hi> All the nominated are written down. The
next day the Great Council is convened, and the
names of all the perſons nominated by the <hi>Pregadi</hi>
having been firſt read, are put into an urn, and thence
one by one drawn out be one of the Secretaries, and
balloted by the Council; and he that obtains above
half of the ſuffrages is reckoned to be one of the
<hi>Giunta.</hi> The other Magiſtrates comprehended in this
Council, it matters not at what time they be created;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98511:97"/>
becauſe when the <hi>Pregadi</hi> enter upon their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
thoſe who at preſent exerciſe ſuch offices
are numbred among them as members of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
and if their offices determine before the <hi>Prega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di</hi>'s,
their ſucceſſours enter in their places. Beſides
thoſe who aſſiſt the Commonwealth in a time of
need with their eſtates, lending ſuch a ſum of mony
as the Law determines, have liberty granted them to
be preſent in this Council, and to underſtand the
management of public affairs (yet without power
of balloting) till ſuch time as their moneys be repaid,
and ſometimes longer. For the Law preſcribes them
ſuch a time to enjoy this honour, though their mony
be repaid them before. By this conſtitution the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
reaps a double benefit. Firſt, it ſeldom
wants mony upon any exigent, many being willing
to lend, that they may enjoy this privilege. Secondly,
it trains up young men to the knowledge of State-affairs,
and qualifies and enables them to manage
public buſineſs when they ſhall be thereto called.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pregadi</hi> are aſſembled as often as it pleaſes the
<hi>College.</hi> A Council is alſo granted to the Magiſtrates
when they would confirm any Law, and to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogadors,</hi>
when they have any difficult caſe to bring
in to be determined. The time of their meeting is
ſignified by the tolling of a Bell; it is alſo a cuſtom
to ſend to give notice and invite them by public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants
or Miniſters. They cannot enter into any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation
about public buſineſs, unleſs there be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
four of the Counſellours, and 60 at leaſt of ſuch
as have ſuffrages. In this Council are conſultations
had, and reſolutions taken about Peace and War,
truces and agreements, and ways of providing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for the neceſſities and uſes of the Commonwealth.
How theſe affairs are treated of will appear when we
ſhall come to ſpeak of the College. Laws are alſo
confirmed in this Council, which are firſt conſidered
by thoſe Magiſtrates, who are over that buſineſs to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98511:97"/>
which ſuch Laws appertain, Such Magiſtrates come
firſt to the College, and there ſhew either the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or the benefit and utility of ſuch Laws as they
would introduce; and if the College approves of
them, then they are permitted to bring them into the
Council of <hi>Pregadi;</hi> and if they paſs there, then are
they valid, and publiſhed by public <hi>bando</hi> or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation;
after which every one is obliged to take
notice of them and obſerve them: and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
that introduced them is to ſee that they be put
in execution. They uſe alſo ſometimes to get their
laws confirmed, not only in the Council of <hi>Pregadi,</hi>
but alſo in the Great Council. The which thing (ſaith
my Author) is I ſuppoſe principally in the power of
him who brings in the Law to do, and is uſually done
to gain more reputation, and add ſtrength to the
Law. Beſides in the Council of <hi>Pregadi</hi> is choſen a
Captain of the <hi>Armata,</hi> in caſe the Commonwealth
hath occaſion to make war by Sea; and a Provedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the Camp when they make war by Land: thoſe
three kinds of Magiſtrates, which they call, <hi>i. e.
Savi grandi, Savi di Terra ferma &amp; Savi di mare:</hi>
which elections are made after this manner. Each
one of the <hi>Pregadi</hi> nominates one whom he pleaſes.
All that are ſo nominated are balloted, and he that
obtains more then half the number of ſuffrages is
underſtood to be choſen to that office or dignity. But
becauſe it may often happen that he who is judged
fitteſt for ſuch or ſuch an office may be known to be
unwilling to accept it, and no man for fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
him may dare publicly to nominate him;
therefore to avoid that inconvenience, each of the
<hi>Pregadi</hi> writes down in a paper the name of him
whom he would chuſe to ſuch a place; which Scrolls
are all together put into an urn, and drawn out by
the Great Chancellor one by one; and the names
written therein being openly read, they are put to
the ballot, and on him who hath more then half the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98511:98"/>
ſuffrages is ſuch Office or Dignity conferred. But
when there is a Captain of the <hi>Armata</hi> to be made,
he that is in this manner choſen in the Council of
<hi>Pregadi</hi> muſt be afterwards ballotted in the <hi>Great
Council,</hi> and have Competitors given him by the
four ſets of Electors in manner before related, and
he who hath moſt ſuffrages above the half is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
to be elected. The Counſellours alſo, and the
Cenſors are elected partly by the Council of <hi>Pregadi,</hi>
and partly by the Great Council.</p>

mare.</hi> The number of the <hi>Savi grandi</hi> is ſix; of
each of the other, five; in all ſixteen. And beſides
theſe of the <hi>Signoria,</hi> that is the Duke, the ſix Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
and the three heads or chiefs of the 40 Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Judges, called <hi>Capi di Quaranta.</hi> The <hi>Savi</hi> of
the Sea, who are otherwiſe called <hi>Savi à gli ordini,</hi>
take care of all maritime affairs, as well ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
peace and war as other matters. The <hi>Savi</hi> of the
Land manage and govern Land affairs, ſuch as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to peace and war, and their eſpecial charge is
to keep account of all Souldiers that are in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
pay. The <hi>Savi grandi</hi> over-ſee and take
care of both, as well at home as abroad. And their
particular charge is to make proviſion both for Peace
and war, to write to and anſwer Princes Letters,
and finally to counſel and govern the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
It is to be noted that anciently the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi
grandi</hi> did include the authority and adminiſtration
of the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Land, whence the <hi>Savi grandi</hi>
might intermeddle with the affairs belonging to the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98511:98"/>
Land, though not excluding the <hi>Savi</hi> of the <hi>Land.</hi>
In the ſame manner the <hi>Savi</hi> of the land included
thoſe of the Sea, but were not included by them, and
therefore with the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Sea could take into
their conſideration Sea-affa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rs. So that the <hi>Savi
grandi</hi> included both the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Land, and the
<hi>Savi</hi> of the Sea; the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Land only thoſe
of the Sea. But in our times, and not many
years ſince the way of managing ſuch affairs is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
altered. For that by Law it is determined, that
the Authority and adminiſtration of the <hi>Savi</hi> of the
land ſhall be equal to that of the Grand <hi>Savi;</hi> only
that of the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Sea remains in the ſame terms
it was. In old time there were no other then the
Grand <hi>Savi;</hi> afterward the naval power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
at Sea being encreaſed, it was found neceſſary
to create a Council for Sea affairs or <hi>Savi di mare.</hi>
The like happened afterward when the Republic
began to grow great on the Land, the Senate being
conſtrained to create <hi>Savi di terra ferma,</hi> which was
preſently after that <hi>Treviſo</hi> came under their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Anciently the <hi>Savi di mare</hi> were of greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
then thoſe of the <hi>terra ferma,</hi> but after
that the Dominion of the Commonwealth began to
encreaſe upon the Land, they bent their counſels and
endeavours that way, and ſo the <hi>Savi di mare</hi> loſt their
reputation, and thoſe of the <hi>Terra ferma</hi> gained it.
Theſe three kinds of Magiſtrates are choſen by the
Council of <hi>Pregadi</hi> in the ſame manner as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor
of the Camp. None can be made <hi>Savio
grande</hi> unleſs he be of mature age, and reputed of
the greateſt abilities. The <hi>Savi</hi> of the Land are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
men of reputation for prudence, but not ſo great
as the <hi>Savi grandi;</hi> the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Sea are ſtill of leſs
eſteem then they. And at preſent this Magiſtracy
ſerves rather to give young men occaſion to exerciſe
themſelves in State-buſineſs, then for any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
becauſe in matters of moment the <hi>Savi grandi,</hi>
                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:98511:99"/>
and <hi>Savi di terra ferma</hi> are always employed. Each
of theſe companies of Magiſtrates chuſe one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>Praepoſitus,</hi> or Prevoſt, who is chief of that
Magiſtracy for one week; he propounds matters in
the College and Records thoſe things which are to
be executed which appertain to his Magiſtracy. The
manner of proceeding and tranſacting public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in the <hi>College</hi> is this. Every morning two hours
after Sun-riſing the <hi>College</hi> is convened. [<hi>N. B.</hi>
whenever we ſpeak of the <hi>College</hi> we underſtand the
three Societies of Magiſtrates before-mentioned, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Duke, the Counſellors, and the three
<hi>Capi de Quaranta,</hi> that is with the <hi>Signoria,</hi> who
have their places not only in this <hi>College,</hi> but alſo in
the Grand Council, the Council of <hi>Pregadi</hi> and the
Council of ten: So that nothing is debated without
their preſence and intervention.] The <hi>College</hi> being
aſſembled, all thoſe Letters are read that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſince their laſt meeting: Audience is given to
publick Oratours and Embaſſadours, if any require
it; and each of the three Societies of <hi>Savi</hi> diſpatch
ſuch buſineſs as appertains to them, and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
and recorded by their <hi>Provoſt.</hi> If therefore
there be any buſineſs to be debated appertaining to
the Grand <hi>Savi,</hi> the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Land, and of the
Sea may be excluded: but if it be not of very great
importance, they do not uſe to prohibit them to be
preſent at ſuch deliberations, but their part is only
to hear and hold their peace: or if they do deliver
their opinions, yet are they not noted down to be
brought into the Council of <hi>Pregadi,</hi> but only the
opinions of the Grand <hi>Savi,</hi> the Counſellors, the
<hi>Capi de Quaranta,</hi> and the Duke. And to the end
that the whole method and order of this adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be the better underſtood by an example,
let us ſuppoſe there is a conſultation to be had about
ſome affairs appertaining to the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Sea, they
cannot exclude the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Land, and the <hi>Grand
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98511:99"/>
Savi,</hi> if they pleaſe to interpoſe and meddle with
that affair. After conſultation had thereupon, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Sea, but they of the Land, and
the <hi>Grand Savi,</hi> the Duke alſo and the Counſellors
and <hi>Capi de Quaranta,</hi> may deliver their opinions if
they pleaſe, and according as they are of one or
more different opinions, make one or ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
[by parties we mean nothing but propoſitions
or ſentences.] For that each <hi>Savio</hi> and Counſellour,
much more the Duke, when they do not agree to the
opinions of others, may each bring in a party (that
is, propound his ſentence or judgment about a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
alone. All theſe parties are noted by a Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
each one with the name of that <hi>Savio</hi> or other
perſon that was the Author of it. And becauſe no
matter belonging to the public adminiſtration can
be determined without the approbation and conſent
of the Council of <hi>Pregadi;</hi> therefore that Council
being aſſembled, the aforeſaid Magiſtrates come with
their parties or propoſitions noted, and propound
them in order. If the parties be more then one (as
ſuppoſe four) they are all propounded together, but
that is firſt read the Author whereof is the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Magiſtrate, and therefore thoſe of the
Duke and Counſellors ought to precede the reſt,
thoſe of the <hi>Savi grandi,</hi> them of the <hi>Savi</hi> of the
Land; and theirs thoſe of the <hi>Savi di mare.</hi> And if
any of the three Societies of <hi>Savi</hi> in matters apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to their charge have taken ſeveral parties,
that party ought firſt to be propounded, of which
he is Authour, who in that Society is moſt honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
The parties being propounded, if any of the
<hi>Savi</hi> will ſpeak againſt them, he ought to precede
the reſt of the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> and among them firſt that
<hi>Savio</hi> who is of greateſt Authority. After that any
of the <hi>Pregadi</hi> hath liberty to do the ſame. After ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
debate upon all the parties, they are all balloted
together in this manner. Suppoſe the parties to be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98511:100"/>
four, then there are four Secretaries come in, having
each a white box in his hand: after them another
Secretary follows with a green box, and after him
ſtill another with a red box. The firſt of the four
goes from perſon to perſon, repeating the name of
him that was author of the party firſt propounded:
the ſecond, third, and fourth in like manner repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the names of the ſecond, third, and fourth, and
each one of the <hi>Pregadi</hi> puts his ballot into what box
he pleaſes. So that if he approves not the firſt party,
he puts his ballot in his box that gathers the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for that party that pleaſes him. If he approves
none of the four, then he puts his ballot in the green
box: but if the matter be not yet clear to him, and
he be not fully ſatisfied about it, he puts his ballot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the red box that comes laſt, and is called the box of
the <hi>Non ſinceri,</hi> i. e. ſuch as neither approve or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
The Suffrages being thus gathered, the ballots
of each party are told over, and that which exceeds
the half by moſt ſuffrages is underſtood to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and ratified; but if none come up to the half,
then that which hath the leaſt number of ſuffrages
being laid aſide, the other three are balloted after the
ſame manner, with three boxes, and after them a
green and a red one. If none of the three get half
the number of ſuffrages, then that which hath feweſt
being again laid aſide, the remaining two are ballo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in like manner; and if neither of theſe paſſeth
the half, then that which hath the moſt ſuffrages is
balloted alone: and if the ſuffrages for that exceed
not the half, none of the parties balloted is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
to be confirmed: in which caſe new parties
muſt be brought in, if the matter treated of be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
which may be done the ſame day, becauſe
the Duke, any one of the Counſellors, <hi>Capi di Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranta,</hi>
or <hi>Savi</hi> may bring in new parties. Such a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
may alſo be referred to another day. But it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
happens that of ſo many parties no one is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98511:100"/>
When none of them is confirmed, and the
matter requires further debate, we ſhall declare what
order is taken when we come to treat of the Council
of Ten. But it is to be noted, that the firſt time all
the parties are balloted together, it may happen that
there are more then half the ſuffrages in the box of
the <hi>Non-ſinceri,</hi> i. e. ſuch as ſuſpend, being not clear
in the point; and in ſuch caſe none of the parties
can be balloted, but the matter requiring new debate,
new parties are to be brought in. And becauſe it may
happen that ſome one of the Council of <hi>Pregadi</hi> may
have upon ſome matter under conſideration a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to make, which may be for the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the Commonwealth, which came not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the minds of the <hi>Savi</hi> or others who have power
of propounding their judgments or opinions in
Council, that ſuch advantage be not loſt, it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that ſuch opinion or ſentiment be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to one of thoſe who have power to propound,
and by him propounded to the Council. But that
none but the <hi>Savi</hi> and others before-mentioned
ſhould have liberty to bring in parties, is ordained to
avoid prolixity and confuſion; it being alſo unlikely
that what comes not into the thoughts and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the College, in which are the wiſeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the City, ſhould be imagined or found out
by other men. But granting this might ſometimes
happen, yet it would be ſo ſeldom, that no great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
ought to be made of it; and ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
becauſe in every conſtitution the leſſer conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
ought to give place to the greater. To every
of theſe three Societies of <hi>Savi,</hi> the ſame time of
ſix months determines their office: but yet are not
all the perſons in each choſen at the ſame time. For
the grand <hi>Savi</hi> are choſen at two ſeveral times, three
at once; and from the choice of the firſt to the choice
of the ſecond intercedes three months time. The <hi>Savi</hi>
of the Land, and the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Sea are alſo choſen at
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98511:101"/>
two times, three the firſt time, and two the ſecond;
with the ſame interval between. To the grand <hi>Savi</hi>
there is ſometimes, great affairs requiring it, added an
<hi>Aggiunta</hi> of three more, and theſe we call <hi>Savi ſtraor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

three days; and there are twenty Gentlemen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
who being clothed with Scarlet, accompany
it when it is carried down, and ſit round about it
till night, returning again the next morning, and
this they continue to do for three days. Then is the
Funeral celebrated with all the Pomp and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
which the Dignity of ſuch a Magiſtrate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
The next day after the Funeral the Great
Council is convened, and given to underſtand by the
Great Chancellor, that being to give beginning to
the Election of a new Duke, they are firſt to make
choice of five Correctors and three Inquiſitors. The
Vice-Duke then ſtanding up, makes a Speech to the
Council, and having commended the Life, Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and Government of the Duke deceaſed, exhorts
and ſtirs up every one to make choice of a perſon to
ſucceed him, that may be uſeful and honourable to
the Commonwealth. Then doth he cauſe the Laws
to be read, which preſcribe the manner and order of
electing the new Duke: and laſt of all the Council
proceed to elect the ſaid five Correctors and three
Inquiſitors after the ſame manner they uſe in the
choice of other Magiſtrates. The office of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors
is diligently to examine the life and actions of
the deceaſed Prince, and if they find that he hath in
any thing erred or done amiſs, they are obliged to
accuſe him; and look what puniſhment he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
is inflicted on his heirs. But ſuch puniſhments
are never corporal, but only pecuniary mulcts. And
ſuch a Cauſe, by reaſon it is a buſineſs of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
is not finally determined by the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
but agitated in the Great Council, and may
alſo be examined in the <hi>Quarantia criminale.</hi> Theſe
Inquiſitors have a years time to finiſh their Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in.
The office of the Correctors is to ſee and
conſider well if any new Law to be obſerved by the
ſucceeding Prince is needful to be introduced: and if
there have been any error diſcovered in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98511:103"/>
of the Precedent Duke that ought to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
For the doing of which ſo ſoon as they are
created they are brought into a certain Chamber,
where they meet ſo often till they be agreed upon
what to them ſeems needful to be amended, or ſit to
be newly introduced; and this commonly takes up
three or four days. When they have finiſhed their
conſiderations, they therewith acquaint the <hi>Signoria,</hi>
who cauſe the Great Council to be convened, in the
accuſtomed place and manner; whither the ſaid Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors
come, and there cauſe all ſuch Laws and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
as they judge fit to be made, to be publicly
recited; which being balloted one by one in the
great Council, are either confirmed or rejected. This
done, the Great Council the day following is again
called, to which meeting none can come but ſuch as
have paſſed the 30 year of their age. The doors being
ſhut at the appointed time, all that are preſent in
Council are numbred over, and in an urn or <hi>Capello</hi>
of that ſort which have but one hole in their cover,
are put 30 golden balls, marked with a certain note,
and as many ſilver ones as together with the golden
are equal to the number of the Gentlemen preſent.
After this the junior Counſellor goes out into St.
<hi>Marks</hi> Church, which is faſt by, and having made
his reverence to the Altar, takes a little boy which he
finds there, and brings him along with him into the
Council; who is to draw the ballots out of the urn
for the Gentlemen who they come up to the <hi>Capello,</hi>
they not being permitted to draw them out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to avoid fraud. This boy is called the <hi>Ballo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino,</hi>
and is he that in proceſſions goes before the
<hi>Duke,</hi> who is bound ſo ſoon as the boy comes to be
of convenient age to make him one of the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
The <hi>Ballotine</hi> being brought in before the <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noria,</hi>
one Counſellor and one <hi>Capo de Quaranta</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
by lot, go and ſet themſelves down before the
<hi>Capello,</hi> Then they draw lots which Bench is to come
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98511:103"/>
up firſt. [<hi>N. B.</hi> Becauſe there is but one <hi>Capello,</hi> the
Benches do not come up by two and two, as in the
creation of Magiſtrates, but one by one; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there are put in ten lots into the urn and drawn
out as before, and the benches come up accordingly.]
If one of thoſe five benches on the ſide towards St.
<hi>Georges</hi> be drawn, they are to begin to come up at
that end that is toward the <hi>Broil;</hi> and if one of thoſe
five that are toward S. <hi>Marks</hi> be drawn, they are to
begin to come up at the end toward <hi>Caſtello.</hi> The lots
being drawn, that Gentleman that ſits firſt at that
end of the bench which is to begin, ariſes and goes
up to the <hi>Capello.</hi> Then the <hi>Ballotine</hi> in his name draws
out a ball, which if it be a ſilver one, he puts it in
another <hi>Capello</hi> ſtanding at the foot of that out of
which he drew it, and he for whom it was drawn
goes preſently out of the Council-chamber. But if
it be gilded and marked, he delivers it to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor
ſitting by, and the Great Chancellor pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
aloud the name of him for whom it was drawn:
who preſently between two Secretaries is carried into
a room out of the Council Chamber. Then all
thoſe who are of his Family, his Uncles, Couſins,
Father-in-law, and they that are of near affinity to
him are called, and being come up to the Tribunal,
numbred by one of the Secretaries, and ſo many
ſilver balls taken out of the <hi>Capello</hi> as are equal to
the ſum of them, and ſo they depart the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-chamber.
In the ſame order all the reſt of the
benches are called by lot, till all the golden balls are
drawn out of the <hi>Capello.</hi> And after thoſe who have
obtained them are withdrawn into the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
room the Council is diſmiſt: and the 30 come all
before the <hi>Signoria,</hi> and ſit down on two benches
there ſtanding, half on the one, and half on the
other. Then in a certain <hi>Capello</hi> there placed are
put 21 ſilver Balls and 9 golden; and theſe 30 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
being called according to the order they were
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98511:104"/>
choſen in, come up one by one to the <hi>Capello,</hi> and the
<hi>Ballotine</hi> draws out a ballot for each one, till all the
golden balls are drawn. Thoſe then for whom the
ſilver balls were drawn depart, and thoſe nine who
obtained the golden withdraw into the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
room; where when they are all come together
they are by the <hi>Signoria</hi> conducted into another
room, where are ſet ready all neceſſary accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for them: and having given oath to make a
good election, they continue there locked up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
till they have choſen 40 of 40 different Families:
in which election they thus proceed. So ſoon as they
are ſhut up they draw lots among themſelves, who
ſhall nominate firſt, who ſecond, who third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
accordingly in that order nominate. Thoſe nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
are balloted among the nine, and if they have
ſeven ſuffrages they are underſtood to be of the 40.
The election being finiſhed, they ſignifie ſo much to
the <hi>Signoria.</hi> The which the ſame day, or if it be
too late the day following, cauſe the Great Council
to be called; which when it is aſſembled, the Great
Chancellor with two Secretaries goes to the nine for
the Schedule in which the 40 Electors are written;
and returning therewith into the Council by the
command of the <hi>Signoria</hi> reads over the names of
them that are choſen; who one by one coming before
the Tribunal are ſent out of the Council into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Chamber; and if any one of the 40 happens not
to be preſent in Council, one of the Counſellors and
one <hi>Capo de Quaranta</hi> go to ſearch him out, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving him leave to ſpeak to any body, bring
him into the Council-chamber, and afterwards into
the room where his companions are withdrawn.
When the 40 are all met together the Council is
diſmiſt, and then after the manner of the former 30,
theſe 40 come before the <hi>Signoria,</hi> and being ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the two benches in the middle, they are likewiſe
by lot called up to the <hi>Capello,</hi> wherein are put 28
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98511:104"/>
ſilver balls, and 12 golden. Thoſe for whom the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
balls are drawn depart the Hall; and thoſe for
whom the golden are brought by the <hi>Signoria</hi> either
into the Chamber where the former nine were, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another as they pleaſe; where having taken oath
to make a good election, they are locked up, and by
way of ſuffrage chuſe 25 of 25 ſeveral Families, in
the ſame manner as the nine choſe the 40; to which
Election 9 ſuffrages of the 12 are neceſſary. The
Election being made, they acquaint the <hi>Signoria</hi>
therewith; which if the time permits, cauſes the
great Council to be aſſembled the ſame day; if not,
the day following, and after the ſame manner the
Great Chancellor reads the names of the 25: and
thoſe that are choſen when they hear their names
read, come up to the Tribnnal, and are ſent out of
the Council into a room by themſelves as were the
40: and if any one be not preſent, he is ſearched
out and brought in like wiſe. When all the 25 are
met, the Council is broken up, and the 25 come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Signoria,</hi> and ſitting down, are called by
lot, and come up to the <hi>Capello,</hi> into which are put
16 ſilver balls, and nine golden. Thoſe for whom
the <hi>Ballotine</hi> draws the ſilver balls depart; thoſe that
get the golden remain; and being lockt up together,
they do in the ſame manner as the former 12, by 7
ſuffrages chuſe 45 of 45 ſeveral Families; who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
being called by the <hi>Signoria</hi> into the Great
Council, the preſent and abſent being all come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as we ſaid before, the Council is diſmiſſed.
And the 45 being ſet before the <hi>Signoria</hi> in form a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
and called by lot, come up to the <hi>Capello;</hi>
into which are put 34 ſilver balls, and 11 golden.
Thoſe for whom the ſilver balls are drawn go at their
pleaſure, thoſe for whom the golden, remain; and
having given oath to make a good Election, they are
ſhut up as the former, and by way of ſuffrage chuſe
41 of ſo many ſeveral Families, of whom each muſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98511:105"/>
have 9 ballots, and theſe are the Electors of the
<hi>Duke.</hi> After theſe 41 are thus elected, and in the
Great Council pronounced, and alſo all met in the
room appointed, in manner aforeſaid; firſt of all
the Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt is celebrated, then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of the Electors promiſes by ſolemn oath to
lay aſide all humane paſſions, and to chuſe for <hi>Duke</hi>
him whom to chuſe in his conſcience he ſhall judge
to be moſt for the intereſt and honour of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
as like to do it moſt credit and beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
and that with the profoundeſt ſilence he will
keep ſecret whatever is ſaid or done among them.
After this they are lockt up together alone, without
any other Miniſters or Secretaries, ſo cloſe that no
perſon can be admitted to ſee them: and firſt of all
among themſelves of the ancienteſt they chuſe three
heads or chiefs which they call <hi>Priors;</hi> and alſo of the
youngeſt among them they chuſe two who perform
the office of Secretaries. The Priors ſit down, having
before them a table upon which are placed two bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loting
boxes of that ſort that are uſed in the Great
Council; in one of which are put 40 balls, marked
with a certain mark, that no deceit may be uſed. The
reſt of the 41 ſit alſo down, each where he pleaſes.
The two Secretaries make 41 Schedules, and having
folded them up give to each perſon one, they take
alſo the ballots and diſtribute them to all. Then they
are called one by one before the three Priors, and
each one writes in his Schedule the name of him
whom he would have to be Duke, and leaves it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the table. The two Secretaries note the names of
them that are written in the Schedules, and by how
many each one is named. [The names in all the
Schedules ſeldom paſs 6 or 8, becauſe there are never
more who can be judged ſit to be promoted
to ſuch a Dignity.] After which all the names ſo
noted are put into an urn, and thence by lot drawn
out. And he that is firſt drawn, if he be one of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98511:105"/>
the Electors is preſently ſent out into the Chamber
of the <hi>Quarantia,</hi> and there ſhut up; and liberty is
then given to any one of the Electors to ſpeak any
thing he hath to object againſt him, why he is not
fit for ſo great a place. And if any thing be by any
one objected, it is ſet down by the Secretaries: and
he being called in, all that hath been ſpoken againſt
him is read to him, and if he will ſtand upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
he may make his anſwer; which when he hath
done he returns into the ſame Chamber again. The
ſame order is uſed till there be none left who will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
any thing againſt him, or till he will defend
himſelf no longer; after which he is preſently bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loted,
and as ſoon as that is done all the Electors go
up before the Priors, the eldeſt of which with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſtaff numbers over thoſe that are in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
box, and alſo thoſe that are in the negative;
and if the affirmative amount to 25, the perſon bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loted
is underſtood to be choſen Duke; and there
can be no other balloted. This order hath been ſince
changed, and notwithſtanding the firſt or any other
have come to 25 ſuffrages, yet have the reſt been bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loted;
and he that hath obtained moſt ſuffrages hath
been made Duke. But if the affirmative ſuffrages
do not amount to 25, there is taken by lot another
out of the urn, in which the names ſet down each
with the number of its nominators were put, and
the ſame order of proceeding obſerved till they come
to one who gets 25 ballots. It may happen that
none comes up to that number, in which caſe the
Electors continue ſhut up, and name and ballot the
nominated ſo often, till one comes to get the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
number of ſuffrages. The Duke being on this
wiſe created, many Ceremonies are wont to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
Firſt of all the 41 by the Great Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
ſend word to the <hi>Signoria</hi> who it is that is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Duke, who firſt of all go to congratulate him,
and give him joy; and if it be in the day time,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98511:106"/>
cauſe all the Bells to be rung. Then his Kinred and
Friends come to viſit him, and at the ſame time there
is money coined with his name upon it. After
which the 41 Electors with the <hi>Duke</hi> go into St.
<hi>Mark</hi>'s Church, and having done reverence to God,
all mount up a Scaffold, and the ancienteſt of them
tells the people (who by this time have filled the
Church) that they have choſen a Duke in the room
of the deceaſed; and commending the Election,
ſhews him to the People, who in token of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and joy give him loud acclamations. The Duke
then ſpeaks to the People, and encourages them to
hope well of his Government; which done, they go
down the Scaffold, and bring the Duke before the
Altar; where by the Procurators of the Church an
Oath is tendred him to obſerve the Laws and a
Standard put into his hand by the Vicar of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micerius</hi>
of St. <hi>Marks.</hi> After this, having made an
offering at the Altar, he comes to the door of the
Choire, where he is placed upon a little low move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Scaffold (<hi>Pergoletta</hi> they call it) accompanied by
one that carries the Standard, and by another of his
near Friends or Relations, who carries a cup full of
gold and ſilver money ſtamped with his name; and
by the mariners of the Arſenal he is drawn out of
St. <hi>Marks,</hi> and carried round about the <hi>Piazza,</hi> he
that carries the cup ſcattering money among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as he goes along. When he hath rounded the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azza,</hi>
he enters in by the principal gate into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace;
where being arrived at the foot of the ſtairs
he goes off the <hi>Pergolette</hi> to go up. In the midſt of
the ſtairs he finds the Counſellors and <hi>Capi de Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranta</hi>
who there wait for him. When he is got up
to the top of the ſtairs, the eldeſt Counſellor puts
upon his head the Ducal Cap; and thence he is lead
into the<note n="*" place="margin">To put him in mind of his mortality, becauſe that is the place where the Corps of the deceaſed Dukes lie in state.</note> 
                        <hi>Sala de Pioveghi,</hi> and after he hath ſitten
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98511:106"/>
a while there in a ſeat appointed for that purpoſe, he
is conducted by them to his Lodgings; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
being reſigned to him, they all go to their own
homes. His habit much differing from the common
renders him venerable. On his head he wears a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Cap, called <hi>il Corno,</hi> becauſe it hath an <hi>Apex</hi>
or horn ariſing above the top of it on the hinder part,
and under that a white coif, with little ſtrings, which
from the ears hang down backward upon his neck.
On his back a looſe veſt or mantle without ſleeves ſo
long that it draws upon the ground, of velvet, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſk,
Scarlet, or any other rich cloth. When he goes
abroad the Bells of St. <hi>Marks</hi> are rung: there are
certain Banners carried before him, and Trumpets of
an extraordinary greatneſs ſounded: then follows
the Cuſhion or Pillow, and the ſeat of Gold, and after
that the Duke himſelf under an <hi>Vmbrella,</hi> between
two of the principal forein Embaſſadors or Agents
then in town, and the others behind him. After him
follow about 30 couple of the chief Gentlemen, all
in cloth of Scarlet; and he that hath the right hand
in the firſt couple carries a Sword upright in his
hand.</p>

                        <pb n="188" facs="tcp:98511:107"/>
for each of theſe makes one Competitor; who
is afterward balloted in the Great Council. So then

the Great Council is aſſembled, and after
that the four ſets of Electors are made, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
into their ſeveral rooms, to make their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
after the order before ſet down, one of the
Secretaries gives notice to all who have votes in the
Council of <hi>Pregadi,</hi> that they withdraw into the
Chamber adjoyning to the Great Council-chamber,
where the Council of <hi>Pregadi,</hi> uſes to meet. Where
when they are all met, the Duke with the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
and <hi>Capi de Quaranta</hi> goes in to them; and it
being by lot determined for what <hi>Seſtiero</hi> a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
ſhall be firſt choſen, every one names him whom he
would have to be Counſellor. All the perſons nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
are written down, and afterwards balloted; and
he that hath more then half the number of ſuffrages is
cohſen Competitor: and this manner of chuſing in
the Council of <hi>Pregadi</hi> is called <hi>Scrutinio.</hi> The
Council of <hi>Pregadi</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> being returned into
the Great Council, and the Competitors made, they
are all balloted after the manner fore-mentioned, and
he that hath moſt above half the number of ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

happen that in the Great Council one only may come
to be nominated Competitor, and ſometimes the

for the moſt part that he is choſen who was made
Competitor by the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> becauſe of the Dignity
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98511:107"/>
and Reputation of that Council.] The ſix Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
ſit with the <hi>Duke,</hi> and with him adminiſter all
affairs, and diſpatch eſpecially all private buſineſs:
as for example, give Audience, read publick Letters,
grant Privileges, and the like; which things cannot
be done by the <hi>Duke,</hi> if there be not four Counſellors
preſent; and yet the Counſellors may diſpatch any
the like buſineſs, though the Duke be not with them.
They have power of propounding in the Great
Council, the Council of <hi>Pregadi,</hi> and Council
of Ten; which he <hi>Savi</hi> who have power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
matters in the Council of <hi>Pregadi,</hi> and
the <hi>Capi di Dieci</hi> who have privilege of propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Council of Ten, have not; ſo that the
the Authority of the Counſellors is greater then that
of the <hi>Savi,</hi> or <hi>Capi di Dieci.</hi> [<hi>NB.</hi> That any one
Counſellor, though no other concur with him, may
propound in the Council of <hi>Pregadi,</hi> but not in the
Council of Ten, unleſs three more concur with him
in the ſame opinion.] This Magiſtracy continues
for a whole year, but is exerciſed but 8 months;
the other four months being ſpent in the <hi>Quarantia
criminale,</hi> wherein three Counſellors continually
ſit, who during that time are called <hi>Conſiglieri da
baſſo, i. e.</hi> lower Counſellors. They may ſit in this
Court either the firſt 4 months, or the laſt 4, or the
two firſt and two laſt, And therefore it is neceſſary
that there be always nine Counſellors, ſix who ſit
conſtantly with the Duke, and the three now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
and when theſe are to go ſit with the Duke,
or go out of their office, three of thoſe which ſit
with the Duke come down to ſit in the <hi>Quaranatia</hi> or
finiſh their office, and there are three new ones crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Moreover it is to be underſtood, that with
the Duke and ſix Counſellors do alſo ſit three of the
<hi>Quarantia criminale,</hi> i. e. the 40 Judges in criminal
cauſes, whom they call <hi>Capi de Quaranta,</hi> who hold
this Dignity two months: ſo that by the <hi>Signoria</hi>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:98511:108"/>
is underſtood the <hi>Duke,</hi> the ſix Counſellors, and the
three <hi>Capi di Quaranta.</hi> Anciently the Duke with
his Counſellors was wont to be preſent at the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Quarantia;</hi> but <hi>Marcus Cornarus</hi> who
was made Duke in the year 1365. by reaſon of the
multitude of buſineſs which daily encreaſed in the
Commonwealth, left that care to thoſe Counſellors
we have been ſpeaking of. The three <hi>Capi de Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranta</hi>
ſit with the Duke and Counſellors, that as the
<hi>Quarantia</hi> participates with the <hi>Signory,</hi> having three
Counſellors joined with them; ſo the <hi>Signory</hi> may
partake of the <hi>Quarantia,</hi> the three <hi>Capi de Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranta</hi>
ſitting with them. And ſo the <hi>Signory</hi> comes
to intermeddle with the buſineſs of the <hi>Quarantia,</hi>
and the <hi>Quarantia</hi> with the affairs of the <hi>Signory.</hi>
And now to acquaint the Reader with all the Dukes
management. Firſt, he with the Counſellors inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes
in, and is part of the College, the Council of
<hi>Pregadi,</hi> and the Great Council, as we have already
ſignified. He is alſo preſent in the Council of Ten,
and hath power of propounding in all theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils;
ſo that no affairs can be cannot treated of without his
preſence, though alone he cannot diſpatch any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Public Letters are written in his name, as
alſo all Privileges and publick Writings, as though
he were the Author of them. All Letters that come
from Forein Princes and Embaſſadors, and Agents
ſent abroad by the Commonwealth, are directed to
him. When the <hi>Savi</hi> of the Land or Sea, or other
Magiſtrates write Letters to their Proveditors, they
ſubſcribe them with the Dukes name thus, <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Contarenus Dux Venetiarum.</hi> And this mode is
obſerved in all other ſorts or public Writings, as
Patents, Privileges, Obligations, Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
Council of Ten varies this form and ſubſcribes in
two manners, for either the whole Council writes
and then they ſubſcribe <hi>Dominicus Contarenus Dux
Venetiarum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cum noſtro Concilio Decem;</hi> and thoſe
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98511:108"/>
that anſwer ſuperſcribe accordingly. Or only the
Heads or Chiefs of the Council of Ten, called <hi>Capi
di Dieci,</hi> write; and then the Subſcription is, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus
Contarenus Dux Venetiarum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cum Copitibus
Concilii Decem.</hi> And thoſe that return anſwer ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
accordingly. Every eighth day, that is on
Wedneſday weekly, the Duke is wont to go down
and viſit the Courts of Juſtice, making a tour round
the two <hi>Corridores,</hi> where the Magiſtrates ſit, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
a while at each Court, and ſtirring up and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
the Judge or Magiſtrate that preſides there
to adminiſter Juſtice impartially. And if there be
any one that thinks he hath not right done him, he
recommends himſelf to the <hi>Duke,</hi> acquainting him
with his cauſe; and if the Duke judges that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
by falſe judgment, he preſently commands
that Magiſtrate or Judge to do him right; but if the
contrary appears to him, he reproves him that
thought himſelf agrieved, and goes on in his Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Some Dukes have changed this order, not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
always on the ſame day, that they might come
upon the Mgiſtrates unexpected. Multitude of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
ſometimes conſtrains the Duke to intermit this
uſage for a week or two. All the money of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
is alſo ſtamped with the Dukes name,
but not with his face or image. That he may be the
better enabled (ſaith my Authour) to maintain his
port, and live with that magnificence ſuch a place
requires, he hath an allowance from the Public of
3500 Ducats <hi>per annum;</hi> a ſorry Revenue for one
that hath the ſhew and Title of a Prince, being leſs
than ſo many <hi>French</hi> Crowns. And yet he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to keep a Family that may be honourable and
ſuitable to ſuch a Dignity; and moreover to make 4
Feaſts yearly at 4 ſeveral times, <hi>viz.</hi> upon St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>'s
day, St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s day, <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> day, and St.

only differs in that the Commonwealth is never

equal to that of the Council of <hi>Pregadi,</hi> and the

tranſact any State-affairs as it pleaſes, without appeal,
or being accountable to any Superior Power. Though
this power be not uſed by it, except only in caſes of

remedied or provided for: as for example, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

or conſpire againſt the Commonwealth, thoſe
that coin counterfeit monys, thoſe that commit ſins
againſt Nature, as Sodomy and beſtiality. It alſo
diſpoſes of certain moneys which are aſſigned to it by
the Chamberlains and other Officers: it hath the
command of certain Galleys in the Arſenal, marked
with theſe two letters, C and X, ſignifying that ſuch
Veſſels are in the power of the <hi>Capi de Dieci.</hi> It alſo
takes care of the Artillery. When any of theſe things
are to be conſidered of, then only thoſe Ten that are
of the Council of X with the Duke and Counſellors
are aſſembled; and this is called abſolutely and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Council of X. The ten of this Council are
choſen in the Great Council like the other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
for one year; out of which are taken by lot
every month three, who are called the Heads or
Chiefs of the ten [<hi>Capi de Dieci</hi>] and of theſe one
preſides every week, which is he who in the Great
Council-chamber takes place over againſt the Duke.
The office of theſe is to convoke the Council of X,
and propound their opinions therein; yet not ſingly
but all three together, or at leaſt two; and they are
obliged to call the Council every 8 days, and oftner
if occaſion require. Anciently there was no deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
time for aſſembling this Council, but becauſe
every time it was convened the whole City was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and troubled, as judging that it was not without
ſome great reaſon; therefore to avoid and prevent
ſuch diſturbance and diſquiet of mens minds there
was a time determined for its meeting. When they
are to paſs ſentence upon any offender that is in their
hands for the forementioned crimes, he cannot ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by himſelf or any other perſon plead his cauſe
or defend himſelf but appears before the Council
and is examined, and there are notes taken of all he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98511:110"/>
ſaith. And when the <hi>Capi di Dieci</hi> bring in ſuch a
cauſe into the Council, either one of them muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
his defence and plead for him, or elſe he
cannot be defended at all. From the Sentence of
this Council there is no appeal, neither can it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
or changed but by themſelves or ſucceſſors,
if the matter be ſuch as is capable of change. Thoſe
of this Council ſo ſoon as they go out of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
may preſently enter upon another. For all theſe
places, the Grand <hi>Savi,</hi> the Savi of the Land and
Savi of the Sea, the Counſellors, the ten of this
Council, the Auvogadors and Cenſors give no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
one to another; but ſo ſoon as a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
hath finiſhed one of theſe Offices, he may enter
upon another. If it happens that any one while he
is exerciſing a leſſer Magiſtracy be choſen to a greater,
he may if he pleaſes relinquiſh the leſs, and take the
greater.</p>

                     <head>The Procurators of St. MARK.</head>
                     <p>The Office of Procurator is of great reputation
in this City. Though it be not of the number of
thoſe which have to do with the adminiſtration and
government of the Commonwealth: yet is it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
becauſe, as that of the Duke, it continues
for life; and is beſides ancient, and hath maintained
its Reputation to the preſent times. There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Gentleman of great eſteem in the City, but
he was adorned with this Dignity: ſo that very few
have been Dukes ſince this Magiſtracy was ordained
but they have before been <hi>Procurators.</hi> Anciently
there was but one Procurator made, to take care of
the Church of St. <hi>Mark</hi> and its treaſure; but after
the death of <hi>Sebaſtian Ciani,</hi> he having left a great
Legacy to St. <hi>Marks,</hi> the Revenues whereof were to
be diſtributed by the Procurator; one perſon not
ſufficing for ſo much buſineſs, it was found neceſſary
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98511:111"/>
to create another; whoſe charge it ſhould be to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintend
and manage the Legacy of <hi>Sebaſtian Ciani.</hi>
Afterwards Legacies being multiplied, in the year
1270. in the time of <hi>Rinieri Zeno,</hi> a third was thought
fit to be created; and they did ſo divide the buſineſs
among them, that one took care of the Church, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
of the Legacies bequeathed by them that dwelt
on this ſide the great Chanel; and the third of their
Legacies who dwelt on the other ſide of the great
Chanel. In the ſame Dukes time there was a fourth
created to be Collegue with him that governed the
Church and its Treaſures. For the ſame reaſon two
more were added when <hi>John Soranzo</hi> was Duke.
Afterwards in the year 1423. when <hi>Francis Foſcaro</hi>
was made Duke there were three more created anew;
ſo that then the whole number was nine; three of
whom took care of the Church and its Treaſures;
three of the Legacies of the three <hi>Seſtieri</hi> on one ſide
the great Chanel; and three of the Legacies of the
three <hi>Seſtieri</hi> on the other ſide. In the year 1509.
when the Republics Armies were broken and routed
at <hi>Addua</hi> by <hi>Lewis XII,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> they were
conſtrained to create ſix for mony, conferring that
honour upon ſuch as would lend the Commonwealth
ſuch a certain ſum. Theſe Procurators have power to
compel Heirs to perform the Wills of the Teſtators.
They wear Ducal habits, and carry ſervants about
with them; and have the precedence of all other
Magiſtrates. In proceſſons the Counſellors and
three <hi>Capi de Quaranta</hi> take place of them. They
have either an habitation aſſigned them, or 60 Ducats
<hi>per annum</hi> allowed. They all enter into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Pregadi,</hi> but not all into the Council of Ten,
but only nine choſen by the ſaid Council, three for a
Procuracy. They are not capable of any other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy,
except that of <hi>Savio grande</hi> and the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unta</hi>
of the Council of X. When there is a Captain
of the <hi>Armata,</hi> or a Proveditor of the Camp to be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98511:111"/>
choſen, there is a Law made in the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> that any
one that is Procurator may obtain that Dignity.
They cannot go to the Great Council, but only in
the Election of the Duke; which licenſe is then
granted them by an eſpecial Law. They were wont
anciently upon all thoſe days the Great Council met,
during all the time the Council ſate, to continue in
the Court of the Palace, and never to depart thence
till the Great Council was riſen; that if any unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
or ſuddain accident ſhould happen they might
be ready to remedy or aſſiſt. And this perchance was
the reaſon that it was forbidden them to go to the
Great Council. But in our time this uſance is not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
becauſe of that quiet and tranquility the
Commonwealth enjoys: Which is ſuch, that no
man thinks there can any accident happen in the City
which ſhall require the preſence of the Procurators
more is one place than in another. There is no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy
or Dignity in the City of much deſired by the
Gentlemen as this of Procurator: Yet I think that
it hath loſt much of its ancient reputation. For
whereas formerly it was not wont to be granted to
any but ancient men, and great repute; in our
times we have ſeen many adorned therewith, who
were neither of mature age, nor great eſteem and
credit.</p>
                     <p>Of the other Officers and Magiſtrates (whereof
this Republic hath good ſtore) I ſhall ſay nothing, they
belonging rather to the adminiſtration of Juſtice
and particular civil affairs, then the Government of
the Commonwealth. Only it is worth the notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
that they have ſo many Offices divided among
the Gentlemen, to buſie and employ the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them, that ſo having ſomething to entertain
their time with, they may not be at leiſure to think
upon innovating in the Government, or any way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
and practice againſt the conſtitution of the
Commonwealth, to the diſturbance of the peace.</p>

                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:98511:112"/>
The Gentlemen while they are in the City wear
black Gowns with narrow ſleeves, and caps; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which habit they never appear in the ſtreets, or
any public place. In the <hi>Piazza</hi> of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> that ſide
next the Great Council-chamber is appropriated to
them to walk in, where no others mingle with them.
This walk, or rather the company of Gentlemen
walking together there; they call the Broil [<hi>Broglio.</hi>]
The principal diverſion of the Gentlemen, Citizens,
and Strangers is to walk in this <hi>Piazza.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The preſent Citizens of what quality or eſtate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
have no ſhare or intereſt at all in the Govrern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Commonwealth. Probable it is, that
when the Creat Council was ſhut up (as they phraſe
it) that is, determined to ſuch a number of Families
excluding all the reſt, that all the Citizens of any
quality were therein comprehended; becauſe before
that time the Government having been common to
all, it is not likely the preſent eſtabliſhment would
have taken place without commotion and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
if there had been a conſiderable number of
Citizens of faſhion and intereſt left out. Formerly
this honour hath been given to many Citizens of
eminent merit. Lately ſince the Wars with the
Turks in <hi>Candy</hi> for 100000 Ducats any Citizen
might be created Nobleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> By which means the
State raiſed millions of Ducats there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

that Dignity.</p>
                     <p>They put not weapons into the Citizens hands,
but chuſe rather to make uſe of mercenary Souldiers
in their Wars.</p>
                     <p>There is no Law that prohibits any Citizen to be
choſen to any place or Office by the Great Council,
nor doth there need it: For that they are as ſure not
to be coſen as though there were ſuch a Law, the
intereſt of the Nobility being as ſtrong a bar to ſuch
a choice as Law would be. And yet <hi>Gianotti</hi> ſaith,

made like the Picture of the Devil (though a glaſs-bubble
would ſerve the purpoſe as well or better)
which being put into a cylindrical glaſs-tube full of
water they could make aſcend, deſcend or reſt in any
part of the tube at pleaſure. The manner thus, They
prepare an <hi>icuncula</hi> or glaſs-bubble hollow and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the heavier end of it a little hole of ſuch a
poiſe as juſt to aſcend and ſwim in water, and having
put it into a glaſs-tube ſtopt cloſe or ſealed at one
end, and almoſt full of water, they clap their hand
on the mouth of the tube, and preſs down the air
upon the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> of the water. The water being
thus preſt, preſſes upon the air in the <hi>icuncula</hi> or
bubble; which giving place, part of the water thruſts
into it by the little hole. The bubble thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
heavier ſinks in the water. Then taking up
the hand and removing the force, the air in the
<hi>icuncula</hi> or bubble by its elaſtic power expands it
ſelf, and expelling the water again, the <hi>icuncula</hi> or
bubble aſcends; and ſo by proportioning the force
they can make it not only aſcend and deſcend from
top to bottom, but reſt at what point of height or
depth they pleaſe. Of this and other ludicrous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
concerning the motion of theſe bubbles,
I ſhall not think much heer to ſet down what Doctor
<hi>Cornelius</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> hath delivered in his <hi>Progymnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata
Phyſica,</hi> Epiſt. de <hi>Circumpulſione Platonica</hi> I

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98511:113"/>
invented at <hi>Florence, viz.</hi> Two glaſs-bubbles
being put into a veſſel of water were ſo alternately
moved, that in cold water the one ſank to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
the other ſwam on the top; but putting in a
little hot water they changed places, that at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
aſcending up to the top, and that on the top
ſinking down to the bottom. Being taken with the
novity of the thing, I applyed my mind to conſider
what might be the Phyſical reſon of it, and ſoon
found out how it might be effected, to wit, one of
theſe Glaſs-bubbles was perforated with a little hole
on the heavier ſide, and blown ſo light as to ſwim in
water: then ſome of the air being ſuckt out, there
was ſo much water let in in the room thereof, as to
make the bubble ſink in cold water, which upon fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Veſſel with hot water would mount up to the
top. For the air in the bubble being rarefied or dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the heat of the water preſently expells the
water contained in the bubble, and ſo the bubble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
lighter aſcends, The other glaſs-bubble is
imperforate and made of that poiſe as to ſwim in
cold water and ſink in hot. He goes on.</p>

                     <p>A Nobleman of this City ſhewed us a Boy, who
had a faculty of charging his belly with wind, and
diſcharging it again backward at pleaſure; which we
ſaw him perform. When he charged himſelf he
lay upon his hands and knees, and put his head on
the ground almoſt between his legs.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Nobleman ſhewed us the experiment,
and gave us the receipt of a fulminating powder,
which will do almoſt as well as that chargeable one
made of gold. Take of ſalt of Tartar one part, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Brimſtone two parts, of Nitre or Salt-peter three
parts; put theſe three all at once into a Mortar, beat
them fine and mingle them well together. Take of
this powder and put it on a plate of iron, or in a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan
or other veſſel, and hold it over a flame of fire
or a pan of charcoal: When the powder begins to
melt, it will explode with a very ſmart crack like to
<hi>Aurum fulminans.</hi> The ſame or the like fulmina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
powder hath been ſince ſhewn us by Mr. <hi>Fiſher</hi>
of <hi>Sheffield.</hi> It is not unlikely that there may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſorts of powder made, which ſhall explode
and fulminate after this faſhion.</p>
                     <p>The ſame Gentleman alſo ſhew'd us the whole
proceſs of making <hi>Venice-Sope,</hi> which is very like
and nothing inferiour to <hi>Caſtile-Sope.</hi> It is made
of the beſt Oil Olive, and a <hi>lixivium</hi> or Lye. The
<hi>lixivium</hi> is thus made. They take of the aſhes of
<hi>Kali,</hi> made in <hi>Spain,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> known by the
name of <hi>Beriglia,</hi> two thirds, of <hi>Kelp, i. e.</hi> the aſhes
of the ordinary Sea-wrack one third. Theſe they
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98511:114"/>
break into ſmall pieces with a mallet or hammer,
and mingle well together. This done they put them
into a mill, ſuch as we grind apples in to make Cider,
and grind them to powder, and then ſift them. This
powder they mingle with a little ſlaked lime, and
make it up into pellets, which they put into letches
or troughs, and pouring water upon them make
the <hi>Lixivium.</hi> The Cauldrons wherein they boil their
Sope are very large. The bottom of them is a copper
veſſel, but the ſides are made up of ſtone cloſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
together, bound about with iron hoops, and
encloſed in a caſe of Wood. Into theſe Cauldrons
they put a great quantity of Oil, it may be one
third part of the meaſure, or more or leſs as they
pleaſe: then they fill them up with the <hi>lixivium,</hi> and
putting fire under it, cauſe it to boil continually; as
the <hi>lixivium</hi> boils away ſtill filling it up with new, till
all the oil be conſumed or boiled out of it. For the
oil uniting it ſelf with the ſalt of the <hi>lixivium</hi> riſes
continually up to the top in the form of a ſcum or
froth, which by degrees grows thicker and thicker,
and by reaſon of the cold of the air condenſes into
that body we call Sope. This ſcum continues to riſe
ſo long as there is any oil remaining in the veſſels;
the cremor or coat of Sope growing ſtill thicker.
Thoſe that are practiſed can tell by the ſmell when
all the oil is boiled away. The <hi>lixivium</hi> they account
ſtrong enough ſo long as it will bear an egg. This
<hi>lixivium</hi> they make of Sea water, but they told us
they might as well make it of freſh water. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite
the making the <hi>lixivium,</hi> they take ſome of
the boiling <hi>lixivium</hi> out of the Cauldrons; to which
purpoſe there is a pipe comes out of the Cauldron in
the region of the <hi>lixivium,</hi> whereby they let out the
boiling <hi>lixivium</hi> into a trough; and this together
with cold water they pour upon the aſhes to promote
the ſeparation of the ſalt. When the oil is boil'd
away they let all cool, and taking the <hi>cremor</hi> or cruſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98511:115"/>
of Sope off the ſuperficies of the liquor, ſpread it
upon a floor, and ſmooth it, and ſo let it dry in a
bed of more then a bricks thickneſs. When it is
dried they cut it long ways and croſs ways into ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
parallelograms, or the figure of oblong bricks,
there being nicks in the borders of the beds on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to direct the inſtruments to cut it. This done
they pare theſe pieces from any impurities that may
adhere to them from the bottom of the bed, (For the
beds are all ſtrowed with Lime-duſt to hinder the
ſticking of the Sope to the floor) and run them over
a plane, to ſmooth them. Theſe large pieces they
ſubdivide into leſſer, and ſeal them with a Seal.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why they mix <hi>Kelp</hi> with the <hi>Beriglia,</hi>
is becauſe <hi>Beriglia</hi> alone would make the Sope too
ſoft, and <hi>Kelp</hi> alone too brittle.</p>
                     <p>To colour the Sope green they take the juyce of
Beet, a good quantity, and put it into the Cauldron
with the <hi>lixivium</hi> and oyl. The <hi>Germans</hi> will have
it thus coloured, and perhaps the Nitre which is in
this juyce may add ſome vigour to the Sope.</p>
                     <p>The fire is continually kept burning, and ſo the
liquor boiling till the operation be finiſhed.</p>

others, who walk up and down the Streets moſt

i. e. Who goes there? and if they anſwer, they bid
them turn back; which if they do not ſuddenly do,
they ſhoot at them. When two parties of theſe Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars

the hot baths. The Springs ariſe in a rocky hillock,
conſiſting of a porous ſtone, and are ſo plentiful that
one of them drives an overſhot mill. The water is ſo
hot, that in one of the ſources, the Countrey-people
uſually ſcald their hogs to get off the hair. It contains
a copious white ſalt which ſhoots upon the earth
where the water runs. This the common people
heerabout gather, and uſe with their meat, which

the ſalt it contains actuated by the heat, it diſſolves
and imbibes in the ſtone quarries it paſſeth through)
that it ſuddainly precipitates it on the bottoms and

ſupport them, and when they ſtand or ſettle in any

what we ſee in daily experience, the hardeſt ſtones
being worn and hollowed by a conſtant dropping of
water upon them: much more will water be able to
do this, when impregnate with ſalt, and that ſalt
actuated by heat. The waters of <hi>Albano</hi> are not
made uſe of to drink, but only to bathe in, as at
<hi>Aken, Baden,</hi> &amp;c. though <hi>Schottus</hi> ſaith that they
uſually drink of one of the ſources.</p>
                  <p>We travelled to <hi>Vicenza,</hi> a City leſs in circuit than
<hi>Padua,</hi> as being but 4 miles round, but more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
containing between 30 and 40 thouſand ſouls.
It is encompaſſed with a Brick-wall, but of no great
ſtrength. It ſtands upon the River <hi>Bacchilio,</hi> and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
watered by the <hi>Rero</hi> or <hi>Eretenus,</hi> beſide two little
Brooks called <hi>Aſtichello</hi> and <hi>Seriola.</hi> It is full of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, being ſaid to have 200 Families
worth 1500 crowns <hi>per annum</hi> each, and better. So
that there is a Proverb in <hi>Italy, Quanti ha Venetia de

                  </p>
                  <p>Of the ſeveral changes of Government which
this City hath undergone I ſhall ſay nothing, but for
that refer the Reader to <hi>Schottus</hi> and <hi>Leander-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus:</hi>

Only it is worth the notice taking, that when
they were ſet at liberty, and abſolved of their Oaths
of Allegiance by <hi>Catharine</hi> relict of <hi>Galeazzo Viſconte</hi>
firſt Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> they did of their own accord
deliver up themſelves to the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> for
which reaſon they enjoy great privileges and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.
The Theater of the Academy called the <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pici</hi>
is a pretty building and deſerves to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.
The Inhabitants of this City drive a great
trade in breeding and feeding of Silk-worms, and
in winding, twiſting, and dying of ſilk. The Wines
of this Territory are very rich and guſtful, eſpecially
that ſort called <hi>Dolce &amp; piccante.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence we made an excurſion of about 6 miles, to
ſee the famous Cave of <hi>Cuſtoza,</hi> ſaid by ſome to be
ſeven miles in length; but more truly by <hi>Jo. Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Triſſinus</hi> (who himſelf meaſured it, and gives an
account of it in a Letter to <hi>Leander Albertus</hi>) no
more then 650 perches, which make about 4000
feet in length, 490 perches or 3000 foot in breadth,
and about three miles in circuit. We took it to be
nothing elſe but a Cave left from the digging of
ſtone; as the ſame <hi>Triſſinus</hi> by ſufficient arguments
proves it to be. 1. Becauſe the ancient buildings of
<hi>Padua</hi> and <hi>Vicenza</hi> are of the ſame kind of ſtone.
2. Becauſe to ſupport the roof they have every where
at diſtances ſometimes greater, ſometimes leſs, left
huge pilaſters of the quarry, of 3 perches ſquare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece;
of which pilaſters in the whole cave there are
thought to be about 1000. 3. There are ſome great
ſquare pieces of ſtone cut round about, in order to
taking them up and carrying them away. 4. There
remain manifeſt prints and tracks of cart-wheels;
whereas no man living can remember that ever cart
went in there.</p>
                  <p>We obſerved many Bats clinging to the roof and
walls of this Cave; and in ſome ſtanding waters a
kind of fiſh or rather inſect, which they called

                     <hi>Squillae Venetianae</hi> i. e. Venice-ſhrimps, but they are
of that ſort which naturaliſts call <hi>Pulices marini</hi> or
<hi>aquatici,</hi> i. e. Sea-fleas or water-fleas.</p>
                  <p>At this Village we ſaw the ſo much talked of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiduct
belonging to one <hi>Tridentus</hi> a Nobleman of
<hi>Vicenza,</hi> ſerving to cool the rooms of his Palace in
Summer time. From a large high-rooft ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
grot or cave there are Chanels cut out of the rock
to the Palace. When they would have a cool air in
any of the rooms, they ſhut up a gate in the cave,
and open a door at the end of the Chanel, which lets
in the <hi>freſco,</hi> every room having a hole in the wall

of choice ſimples growing thereon, of which <hi>Joan.

                  <p>We travelled from <hi>Verona</hi> to <hi>Mantua</hi> 24 miles,<note place="margin">Febr. 9.</note>
by the way paſſing through ſome large Villages, but
no conſiderable Town.<note place="margin">Mantua.</note> Six miles ſhort of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
at a place called <hi>Marmirola,</hi> we viewed an elegant
palace of the Dukes, richly furniſhed and adorned
with pictures and ſtatues. The City of <hi>Mantua</hi> is of
great antiquity, ſtrong by ſituation, as ſtanding in
the middle of a lake, and well fortified. <hi>Schottus</hi>
ſaith that it is 4 miles in circuit, hath 8 gates, and
about 50000 ſouls. It ſeemed to us a great City, but
not anſwerably populous, having not yet recovered it
ſelf of the loſſes it ſuſtained when it was miſerably
ſackt by the Emperor <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. his Army in the
year 1630. A little out of the City ſtands a pretty
houſe of the Dukes called <hi>Palazzo del Te,</hi> wherein
there is a ſquare room having the roof arched round
in form of <hi>Cupola,</hi> called the <hi>Giants-hall,</hi> ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
that if two ſtand in the oppoſite corners,
one laying his ear to the wall may hear what the
other whiſpers with his face to the corner, which he
that ſtands in the middle of the room or in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
on the ſame ſide ſhall not. The like room we
were told there is in the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Palace at
<hi>Caprarola.</hi> Our whiſpering place in the Cathedral
Church of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> is of ſomewhat a different make.
In a Village near <hi>Mantua</hi> called <hi>Ande,</hi> now <hi>Petula,</hi>
was born the Prince of <hi>Latine</hi> Poets, P. <hi>Virgilius
Maro.</hi> In this City are two Societies of <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> (Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies
they call them) the one ſtile themſelves <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſi,</hi>
the other <hi>Timidi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City hath according to the fate of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
undergone ſeveral changes of Government.
In the year 1328. <hi>Lewis Gonzaga</hi> by the favour of the
people made himſelf Lord of it, from whom the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98511:124"/>
preſent Duke is deſcended. In the year 1433. <hi>John-Francis
Gonzaga</hi> was created Marqueſs of <hi>Manina,</hi>
by the Emperor <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> IV. In the year 1530.
<hi>Frederic Gonzaga</hi> was created Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> by the
Emperor <hi>Charles V.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Dukes yearly revenue is ſaid to be 400000
crowns, according to the account we had of it in
particulars ſomewhat leſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the mills pay 4000
crowns <hi>per annum.</hi> The Jews (who are about 6000
in number, and wear no badge of diſtinction) give
20000 crowns <hi>per annum.</hi> The reſt of the Citizens
of <hi>Mantua</hi> 70000 crowns. The Countrey yields
60000 piſtols; and <hi>Montſerrat</hi> 13000, in all 386000
crowns the year. Yet is the preſent Prince, through
ill husbandry not proportioning his expences to his
income, become very poor, being indebted to the
<hi>Venetians</hi> (as <hi>Leti</hi> ſaith) four millions of crowris.
To advance his Revenue at the time of our being
there he was put to that pitiful ſhift of debaſing his
coin, ſo that none of his money would paſs further
then his own Territory. His name was <hi>Carolus Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga</hi>
II. ſince dead, and his Son <hi>Caroulus Ferdinandus</hi>
ſucceeds him in his eſtates. There are beſides of this
Family 4 or 5 ſmall Princes, feudatory of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
but Sovereign Lords having <hi>Jura Regalia</hi> in
their petty States, <hi>viz.</hi> The Princes of 1. <hi>Novellara.
2. Bozolo.</hi> 3. <hi>Guſtalla.</hi> 4. <hi>Sabionetta,</hi> in which
the male line is failed. 5. <hi>Caſtiglione.</hi> We were told
that theſe Princelets were obliged to attend the Duke
of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Court three months in the year. The
Dukes Council of State or Privy Council conſiſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of ſix of the chief Nobility.</p>
                  <p>In theſe parts all the children of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have equal ſhares of their Parents Eſtates, at leaſt
their moveables. The wife when her husband dies
carries her dowry back with her: if ſhe dies firſt,
then her children (if ſhe leaves any) divide her dower
equally among them. If ſhe die childleſs her dower
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:98511:124"/>
is divided, half goes to her husband, and half to her
next kindred. If a woman hath had children by one
husband and he dying ſhe marries again and hath
children by her ſecond husband, her eſtate is divided
into equal parts, one moiety goes to her firſt huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
children, and the other to her ſecond's.</p>
                  <p>We took boat for <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which brought us firſt
into the lake, then into the chanel of the River Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,
[which runs out of the <hi>Lago di Garda</hi> (called
in <hi>Latine Lacus Benacus</hi>) at a ſtrong Fort of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
called <hi>Peſchiera,</hi> and coming to <hi>Mantua</hi>
ſpreads it ſelf into a lake of 5 miles long.] At 16
miles end we came to a Bridg and Sluce at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Governo,</hi> where we entred the River <hi>Po;</hi> going
down ſtream we paſſed by <hi>Oſtia</hi> 10 miles diſtant
from <hi>Governo;</hi> and 10 miles further down <hi>Maſſa,</hi> both
on our left hand; and 7 miles below <hi>Maſſa</hi> came to
<hi>Stellata,</hi> a large Village on our right hand, under
the Pope. Heer the Territory of <hi>Mantua</hi> ended.
Eight miles beyond this place we left the River <hi>Po</hi> at
a Village called <hi>Il Ponte,</hi> and ſtruck up an artificial
Chanel of 4 miles long, which brought ſtreight to
the Gates of <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City is very conſiderable as well for its
greatneſs as its ſtrength. It is ſaid to be about 7
miles in compaſs, and beſides the advantage of its ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruation
in a fenny level it is ſtrongly fortified with
walls an bulwarks, and ſurrounded with a broad
and deep trench full of water; ſo that I look upon
it for a City of that bigneſs as the ſtrongeſt in all
<hi>Italy.</hi> It had formerly a Prince of its own, but is
now, with all its territory, ſubject to the <hi>Pope.</hi> From
<hi>Ferrara</hi> we went with the <hi>Procaccio</hi> or Courrier to
<hi>Bologna,</hi> ſhifting our boat at a place called <hi>Mal-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergo,</hi>
ſome 17 miles from <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where we went
up into a higher chanel, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Rhenus Bononienſis,</hi>
and paſſing through 9 locks or <hi>ſoſtegni,</hi> we arrived
at <hi>Bologna,</hi> diſtant by water from <hi>Ferrara</hi> 45 miles.

A great part of the Countrey we paſſed through be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Bologna.</hi> is a perfect level, and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bononia</hi> is a large City,<note place="margin">Bologna</note> of a round figure, and yet
7 or 8 miles in circuit. The houſes not tall, fair por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico's
on each ſide the ſtreets, convenient to walk in,
as well in Summer to defend one from the ſcorching
beams of the Sun, as in Winter to ſhelter form the
rain. Many Gentlemens houſes (palaces they call

                  <p>At <hi>Bononia</hi> we ſaw the formerly famous exerciſe
of Juſting or Tilting, which is there ſtil uſed in
Carneval time. The combatants being mounted on
horſeback, armed cap-a-pee, and adorned with
huge Plumes of Feathers and Scarfs, with Launces
in their hands, run one at another a full gallop, one on
one ſide and another on the other ſide of a low rail.
They aim at one particular part (I think it is the eye)
and he that comes neareſt is the beſt Juſter. We
ſaw ſeveral Launces broken but no perſon diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
nor any hurt done.</p>
                  <p>Heer by the favour of Dr. <hi>Ovidio Montalbano</hi> one
of the Profeſſors, we had a ſight of the <hi>Muſeum</hi>
of <hi>aldrovandus,</hi> which by his laſt Will he left as a
Legacy to the City. It is kept in the Cardinal Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
Palace commonly called <hi>Palazzo del Confalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niero.</hi>
Among many natural and artificial Rarities
therein preſerved we took more eſpecial notice of 10
Volumes of the pictures of Plants, and 6 of Birds,
Beaſts, and Fiſhes, drawn exactly in colours by the
hand.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Dr. <hi>Montalbanus</hi> very civilly brought

The crude ſtone is like a kind of ſparre or <hi>fluor;</hi> it
acquires this quality by being calcined (ad he told us)
in any ſmall furnace, laying the pieces of ſtone upon
an iron grate over a fire of wood. But we believe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98511:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is ſomewhat more of myſtery in it; for ſome of

The prepared ſtone in time loſes its vertue and ceaſes
to ſhine, as we found by experience in thoſe pieces we
bought and brought along with us. Heerabout and all
along as we rode in <hi>Lombardy</hi> we ſaw now in flower

about with a thick wall and broad ditch, and
tolerably well fortified with baſtions and outworks.
Heer as at <hi>Bononia, Padua,</hi> and ſeveral other Cities
in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Friuli,</hi> are <hi>Portico's</hi> or Cloyſters,
(Rows they call them at <hi>Cheſter</hi>) on each ſide the
ſtreets to walk in. The houſes are moſt built of brick,
and but of mean height, as we obſerved them to be
in all thoſe Cities where the ſtreets cloyſtered
on both ſides, which we conjecture was the manner
of building of the <hi>Goths</hi> or <hi>Lombards</hi> that invaded
<hi>Italy,</hi> and ſetled themſelves in theſe parts.</p>
                  <p>Heer we ſaw the Dukes Palace, which though it
be not vaſt, nor makes any great ſhew outwardly;
yet are the rooms within very elegant and richly
adorned with gilding, hangings, and Pictures of
the beſt Maſters. What we moſt minded was the
Cabinet or <hi>muſeum,</hi> furniſhed with choice of natural
Rarities, Jewels, ancient ad modern Coins and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,
ancient and modern Entaglia's, curious turn'd
Works, dried Plants paſted upon ſmooth boards
whitened with ceruſs, which may be put in frames
and hung about a room like pictures; and a great

collection of deſigns of the beſt Painters. Among
other things we took notice of a humane head pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified;
a hens egg having on one ſide the ſignature
of the Sun, which I the rather noted, becauſe ſome
years before Sir <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> ſent me the

It is more extended in length, and makes a fairer
ſhew, having one broad and long ſtreet. Heer there
are many Sculptors who make pretty carved works
in Ivory, and wood, for which this Town is noted.
Ten miles onward we paſſed a long Bridge over the

built of brick, though the houſes be not tall. The
ſtreets broad and well paved, but no <hi>porticos</hi> under

building more ſlight and weak, the exterior of good
ſtrength, and thickneſs, with a broad trench before
it. The inhabitants are very buſie and induſtrious,
driving a great trade of making Guns and other iron
ware. The <hi>Breſcian</hi> Guns are much eſteemed not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Italy,</hi> but all over <hi>Europe,</hi> as well for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the iron and temper, as the excellency and
neatneſs of the workmanſhip. The Markets are well
ſtored with all things neceſſary for humane life. The
territory of this City is in length from <hi>Moſo</hi> near

100 miles, in breadth from <hi>Limone</hi> upon the <hi>Lago

in <hi>Italy</hi> have ſo large and ſo rich a territory, ſo

and was for a long time miſerably torn in
pieces, and waſted by inteſtine quarrels and fightings
between the Factions of the <hi>Guelfs</hi> and <hi>Ghibellines.</hi>
The <hi>Viſconti</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> made themſelves maſters of

keep in Garriſon for the ſecurity of this City 800
Souldiers, and 300 more in the Caſtle, which ſtands

On the ſides of this hill we found Serpent Stones or

are narrow, but the houſes fair. Upon the top of
the hill above the City ſtands the Caſtle, which
though it be but a ſmall place is ſtrongly ſituate, and
commands the Town. They told us that there was a

                  <p>
                     <hi>MILAN</hi> is one of the four principal Cities
of <hi>Italy;</hi> the other three being <hi>Rome, Venice</hi>
and <hi>Naples.</hi> It is called <hi>la grande,</hi> and well may it
be ſo, being ten <hi>Italian</hi> miles in circuit: and yet
(which is more) the figure of it approaches to a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
It conteins 11 Collegiate Churches, 71 Pariſhes,
30 Covents of Freres, 8 of Regular Canons, and
36 of Nuns. The number of Inhabitants of all ſorts
is ſaid to be 300000, but I believe they who report
it ſpeak by gueſs and at random. All proviſions for
the belly are very plentiful and cheap heer: ſo that
it is a proverbial ſaying, <hi>Solo in Milano ſi mangia,</hi>
They eat well only at <hi>Milan.</hi> The <hi>Domo</hi> or Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
Church is next to S. <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> the greateſt,
moſt ſumptuous ad ſtately pile of building in <hi>Italy.</hi>
It is 250 cubits long, and 130 broad, according to
<hi>Schottus,</hi> and of an anſwerable highth. A more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
deſcription whereof may be ſeen in <hi>Schottus.</hi>
The great Hoſpital is the largeſt and moſt magnificent,
I think, in <hi>Europe,</hi> more like a ſtately Cloyſter or
Princes Palace than an Hoſpital. There is one great
ſquare Court, ſurrounded with a double <hi>portico,</hi> the
one below, the other obove flairs; beſides four or
five other ſmaller Courts. The Revenues of this
houſe amount to more then 50000 crowns yearly;
and there are maintained in it about 4000 poor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and ſick perſons. In this City are many fair

ſtore of Good Books, and free for all perſons, as
well strangers as Citizens, to enter into and make
uſe of. It was founded by Cardinal <hi>Carolus Borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi>

                  <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Milan</hi> is eſteemed one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Fortreſſes of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well for its ſtrength
(having never been taken by force) as for its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and beauty. This Caſtle ſince its firſt building
hath been twice enlarged; for the ancient Caſtle,
built by the <hi>Viſconti</hi>(which is now the Palace of the
Governour, and before which is Court having a
round ſtone-tower at each corner;) the <hi>French</hi> taking
in a great ſpace of ground, encloſed with a ſquare
wall of a very great highth and thickneſs, and a deep

being of a pentagonal figure, and having at

Cryſtal, making drinking-glaſſes and other veſſels,
caſes for tweezers, ſeals, and an hundred pretty knacks

not better than thoſe of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Towns: but
there is one long ſtreet of new buildings tall and
uniform; and about the midſt of it a large ſquare
Piazza, having on each ſide a fair Cloyſter, very

another Piazza before the Dukes Palace, a fair build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but not yet finiſhed. Heer is a Citadel with 5
baſtions ſerving as well to bridle as defend the Town.
Heer we met with ſome of the Proteſtants of the
Valleys of <hi>Lucern</hi> and <hi>Angrona,</hi> who told us that by
the interceſſion of the Cantons of <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Bern,</hi>
the <hi>Duke</hi> hath at preſent made an accord with them,
permitting them ſtill to enjoy the liberty of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

They dwel in 14 <hi>pagi</hi> or Villages, have no
Town, are in number about 15000 ſouls, and of
them about 2000 fighting men. Theſe are divided
into 14 Companies under ſo many Captains, among
whom <hi>Jean Janneville</hi> is noted for a valiant man
and a good Souldier. The Papiſts call theſe men
<hi>Barbetti</hi> and <hi>Genevrini.</hi> They are the only Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and have maintained the purity of
their Religion all along theſe 1200 years. They run
over the mountains like <hi>chamois,</hi> never ſhooting (if
themſelves may be believed) but they hit. They
boaſted to us that in the late War they had not loſt
above 40 or 50 men, and had killed 500 of the
<hi>Dukes;</hi> nevertheleſs the <hi>Duke</hi> hath built a ſtrong for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
at a place called <hi>La torre</hi> in the middle of them.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Turin</hi> hath an Univerſity, and boaſts
to have been the firſt that brought the uſe of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>Italy.</hi> All proviſions are plentiful and cheap
there, the Countrey round about being very rich
and fertile. Indeed the whole Principality of <hi>Piemont</hi>
is eſteemed inferiour to no part of <hi>Italy</hi> for pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and plenty of Corn, Cattel, Wine, Fruit, Hemp,
Flax, Metals, and almoſt every thing neceſſary for
humane life: and withal it is ſo populous, that the
<hi>Italians</hi> uſe to ſay, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> hath only
one City in <hi>Italy</hi> of 300 miles in compaſs. It hath 8
Epiſcopal Cities and 150 Towns. The Inhabitants are
more given to Husbandry than Merchandiſe, ſo that
the land is no where better cultivated then in <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
They are alſo very affectionate to their Prince,
and for his honour and ſafety ready upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to venture their lives and fortunes. <hi>Leti</hi> ſaith
that they are good Souldiers, expert in warlike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
and ſo valiant that they will rather die than
turn their backs. Of the riches of this Countrey we
may (ſaith he) take an eſtimate by the late Wars
which continued for 23 years, during which time
were maintained by the Duke in Garriſon, and in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98511:137"/>
the field between 25 and 30 thouſand Souldiers, for
the moſt part without any aſſiſtance or ſupplies of
money or men from any other place but <hi>Piemont;</hi>
which beſides all this contributed to the <hi>Duke</hi> in 15
years 11 millions. The ſame Author ſaith, it is not
in <hi>Piemont</hi> as in other Countreys, wherein there are
ſome perſons exceſſive rich, but the generality of the
people extremely poor: but on the contrary the
<hi>Piemonteſe</hi> are generally well to live, and there are
very few among them of extraordinary eſtates.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Duke</hi> he by all mens confeſſion keeps a
ſplendid and regal Court, anſwerable to his Title
of Royal Highneſs. His annual Revenue is ſaid to
be a million of gold: according to <hi>Leti</hi> 1800000
crowns; of which <hi>Piemont</hi> alone yields 1400000.
He is able to bring into the Field 30000 Foot, and
5000 Horſe, and yet leave enough at home to guard
the Countrey. The States which the <hi>Duke</hi> poſſeſſes
in <hi>Italy</hi> are, The Principality of <hi>Piemont,</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſates
of <hi>Saluzzes</hi>(which he had of the <hi>French</hi> in

                  </p>

<hi>Non,</hi> and another which had formerly been walled,
called <hi>Felizan:</hi> then <hi>Alexandria,</hi> an large Town upon
the River <hi>Tanar,</hi> of more ſtrength than beauty; the
buildings both public and private being generally
but mean. It was ſo called in honour of Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>

River (which ſeemed to me as large as the <hi>Po</hi> at <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>)
divides the City in two parts, which are joyned
together by a fair brick-bridge. In our paſſage

where there is a ſtrong caſtle on a hill over the

Then we deſcended conſtantly till we came to the

Mules and Aſſes going to and returning from <hi>Genua,</hi>

certainly the moſt ſtately and, according to its Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thete,
ſuperb City in all <hi>Italy.</hi> The houſes are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
tall, ſcarce a mean houſe to be ſeen in Town.
The <hi>New-ſtreet</hi> anſwers the fame that goeth of it. It
is but ſhort, conſiſting only of 8 or 10 Palaces, built
of marble, very ſumptuous and magnific, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of them) as <hi>Cluverius</hi> ſaith) being able to receive
and lodge the greateſt Prince and his Retinue. The
only deformity of this City is the narrowneſs of
the ſtreets unanſwerable to the tallneſs of the houſes;
and yet they are made ſo on purpoſe, partly to ſave
ground, which heer is precious; and partly to keep
off the ſcorching beams of the Sun in Summer time,
for the conveniency of walking cool; for which
reaſon I have obſerved many of the ancient Towns
of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis</hi> to have their ſtreets
made very narrow. This City lies under the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
expoſed to the South, ſo that it muſt needs be
very hot in Summer, as witneſs the Orange and
Olive trees which grow ſo plentifully heer, that they
can afford thoſe fruits at eaſie rates, and drive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
a great trade, furniſhing with Oranges <hi>Florence</hi>
and a good part of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and ſometimes ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into <hi>England.</hi> It is built in form of a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or Creſcent, encompaſſed with a double wall
toward the land. The exterior or new wall of a
great highth and thickneſs paſſes over the top of
mountains, and takes in a great deal of void
ground.</p>
                  <p>The famous new mole, which now makes this a
ſecure Harbour, is ſaid to have coſt as much as the
new wall: for a work of that nature I believe it is
not to be parallel'd in the whole world. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Inhabitants are not anſwerable to the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98511:139"/>
beauty of their houſes; they being noted among
their own Countrey-men the <hi>Italians</hi> for proud, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful,
revengeful, uncivil to Strangers, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
exacting. There goeth a proverbial ſaying of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> that it hath, <hi>montagne ſenza alberi, mare ſenza
peſce, huomini ſenza fede &amp; donne ſenza vergogna,</hi> that
is, <hi>Mountains without trees, a Sea without fiſh,
Men without faith, and Women without ſhame.</hi>
The number of the Inhabitants muſt needs be
great, they having loſt in the laſt great Plague (as
we were credibly informed) to the number of
80000 ſouls. The chief Trade of the Town is Silks
and Velvets; they make alſo prety turned works of
Coral.</p>
                  <p>The Government of it according to the new
laws made by the Popes Legate, and the Emperors
and King of <hi>Spains</hi> Embaſſadors, not long after the
time of <hi>Andreas Doria,</hi> is on this wiſe. There is
1. a <hi>Duke,</hi> who continues in office 2 years. 2. Two
<hi>Collegia;</hi> one of <hi>Governatori</hi>(as they term them) the
other of <hi>Procuratori.</hi> The <hi>Governatori</hi> 12, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatori</hi>
8, all elected, beſides thoſe that of courſe
come in for their lives. 3. A greater <hi>Council</hi> of 400.
4. A leſſer <hi>Council</hi> of 100. 5. A <hi>Seminary</hi> for the
2 <hi>Collegia</hi> of 120. The 2 <hi>Collegia</hi> of <hi>Governatori</hi> and
<hi>Procuratori,</hi> are as it were the chief Senate or Privy
Council or Houſe of Lords; and are choſen twice a
year, <hi>viz.</hi> about the middle of <hi>June</hi> and about the
middle of <hi>December,</hi> after this manner. All the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarium</hi>
of 120 have their names together with
their ſurnames and fathers names written in little
ſcrolls of parchment, an put into an iron box,
which is kept very ſecurely under many locks. When
the time of election comes this box is brought forth
before the Duke, the 2 <hi>Collegia,</hi> and the leſſer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
Then a boy, who muſt be under ten years of
age, puts his hand into the box, and draws out 5
ſcrolls, which are read, and the 3 firſt, if they be
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98511:140"/>
capable, are <hi>Governatori,</hi> the 2 laſt <hi>Procuratori.</hi> If a
man be 100 miles off the City he is uncapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
elected for that time. Likewiſe two of the ſame
family cannot be <hi>Procuratori</hi> or <hi>Governatori</hi> together.
Therefore if the two firſt that are drawn out or the
two ſecond be of the ſame family, the firſt is <hi>Governa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
and the ſecond <hi>Procurator:</hi> if the two laſt be of the
ſame family, the firſt drawn out is a <hi>Procurator,</hi> and
the ſecond is returned into the box again, and the
boy draws out another. So that every ſix months five
are choſen into the <hi>Collegia,</hi> and five go out, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one ſtays in office two years. In the <hi>Collegium
Procuratorum,</hi> beſides the 8, are all thoſe who have
been <hi>Dukes,</hi> and are gone out of office, who (<hi>modò benè
ſe geſſerint</hi>) continue <hi>Procuratori</hi> during their
lives.</p>
                  <p>To ſupply or make up the <hi>Seminarium</hi> 120, every
year in the ſtead of thoſe who are dead, made unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
or choſen into the 2 <hi>Collegia,</hi> the leſſer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
chuſes a double number, all which muſt have 3
ſuffrages of 5. And out of theſe the greater Council
chuſe half by the major vote.</p>
                  <p>For chuſing the <hi>Councils</hi> both <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>leſſer,</hi> the

The <hi>greater Council</hi> is aſſembled upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
occaſions, and with the <hi>Duke</hi> and 2 <hi>Collegia</hi>
makes the ſupreme power: The <hi>leſſer Council</hi> takes
care of the leſſer and ordinary concerns of the City
and Common-wealth. Thoſe who are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
choſen into the <hi>greater Council</hi> muſt be 25 years
of age; only the 30 Electors may, if they pleaſe or
ſee it expedient, chuſe to the number of 60 who
are but 22 years old. Of the <hi>leſſer Council</hi> the one
half muſt be 30 years of age, the others at leaſt 27,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98511:140"/>
excepting Doctors of Law and Phyſic, who if they
be well qualified may be choſen two years younger.
Thoſe who are capable of being choſen into the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarium</hi>
muſt be 40 years of age.</p>
                  <p>The choice of the Duke is in this manner. The
<hi>great Council</hi> being aſſembled there are put into an
Urn 10 golden balls marked with 10 ſeveral letters.</p>
                  <p>One of theſe being drawn out is ſhewn to the
Conſervators of the Laws, who thereupon put
into another Urn ſtanding by the Dukes throne 50
golden balls marked with the ſame letter<note n="*" place="margin">This is done to prevent fraud, for if the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den balls were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not marked at all, or with any ſign or letter known before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, any one of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil might bring ſuch a ball with him, and taking it in his hand make ſhew as if he drew it out of the Urn.</note>, and 50
ſilver balls. Theſe being ſhaken together, the <hi>leſſer
Council</hi> of 100, excluding the 2 <hi>Collegia,</hi> draw out
each man a ball. He that draws out a golden ball
ſhews it to the <hi>Cenſors,</hi> who ſit by, and preſently
writes in a ſcroll of paper the name of him whom
he thinks fit to nominate for Duke and goes out of
the Council. When all the golden balls are drawn
out, the two <hi>Collegia</hi> bring them into order, and
count them over, and if the number of the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
amount to 20 then they are propounded to the
<hi>greater Council,</hi> who out of them by major vote
chuſe 15. Out of theſe 15 the <hi>leſſer Council</hi> chuſe 6
by 3 ſuffrages of 5. Out of theſe 6 again by major
vote the <hi>greater Council</hi> chuſe the Duke. Theſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
are all occult, that is, given by putting of balls
into balloting boxes. If in the <hi>greater Council</hi> for any
perſon the negative and affirmative ſuffrages are
equal, then 5 by lot are to be put out of the Council,
and the reſt to ballot again. Many other proviſions
there are in caſe of equality or diſagreement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Nothing can be propounded in <hi>Council</hi> but by the
Duke, who during the time of his regency lives in
the Palace, and hath (according to <hi>Sanſovinus</hi>) a
guard of 500 <hi>Suitzers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Office of S. <hi>George</hi> is (as far as I underſtand
it) nothing but a company of Bankers, which lend
money to the Common-wealth, for which they are
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98511:141"/>
allowed ſo much <hi>per cent.</hi> and have aſſigned to them
the publick gabells and other revenues, and for their
further ſecurity have alſo the Iſland of <hi>Corſica</hi> enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to them. This company chuſe yearly out of their
own number 8 protectors, who are to take care of
and manage the affairs of all the Creditors. Into this
bank ſtrangers uſually put in money and ſo become of
the Company, for which they receive yearly intereſt,
proportionable to the improvement made of the
whole ſtock of moneys then in bank.</p>
                  <p>The public Revenue of this State is ſaid by ſome
to be 120000 crowns <hi>per annum,</hi> and yet ſcarce ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to defray the public expences.</p>
                  <p>There are many private Citizens heer very rich.
The Republic is thought to be able to raiſe an Army,
of 30000 men, and to ſet out to Sea 12 Gallies and
20 Ships of War. They hold good correſpondence
with all Chriſtian Princes and States excepting the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> by reaſon of his pretence to the City
of <hi>Savona.</hi>

                     <hi>Luca</hi> is no great City, <hi>Sanſovinus</hi> ſaith 2 miles
round, (but I take it to be three or more) yet is it
very populous, containing within its walls in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovinus</hi>
his time about 34000 perſons; which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
I believe is now much encreaſed by reaſon of the
freedom and eaſe the ſubjects enjoy under this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
above their neighbours of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> It is
ſituate in a pleaſant Valley, well fortified, the walls
and bulwarks both very ſtrong and in good repair;
the mounts and platforms ſtored with great Guns;
ſeveral half Moons of earth without the walls: The
walls themſelves planted with rows of trees, and
we permitted to walk them without ſcruple or que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
The buildings of the City good; the Churches
though not great, yet as well kept and handſomely
adorned within ſide as a man ſhall ſee any: The
ſtreets cleanly and well paved; in a word all things
both within and without the City very trim and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite.
Both Citizens and Countreymen are very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and well manner'd, and ſeem both by their
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98511:142"/>
habit and addreſs, and the chearfulneſs of their
looks, to live more freely and in better condition,
and to have more ſpirit and courage then the other
people of <hi>Italy.</hi> That they live more freely and in
better circumſtances then their neighbours, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are ſenſible, and thereupon ſo well affected to
their Governours, and ſtudious to maintain their
liberty, that upon giving them a token by making a
fire upon one of the towers all the Countreymen run
preſently to the City, ſo that in 2 or 3 hours time
they can have ready 30000 men in Arms: And
withal they are ſo couragious and ſtout, that they
ſeem to have no fear at all of the Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>
their potent neighbour, but told us, that if their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
would lead them, they would not fear to
march up to the very Gates of <hi>Florence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That liberty doth naturally beget courage and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and on the contrary ſlavery and oppreſſion
break and debaſe mens ſpirits, is ſo clear in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that I need not go about to prove it. And yet
were it not ſo, it is no wonder that men who find
themſelves well at eaſe, and have ſomething to loſe
or are at leaſt in a capacity of growing rich if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſo, ſhould be very loth to change their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a worſe, and ſtoutly defend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any that ſhould endeavour to bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the yoke; whereas thoſe that are oppreſſed and
aggrieved having nothing to loſe, and being already
in as bad a condition as they are like to be under any
other Government, muſt needs have little heart to
fight for their Princes, and be indifferent which way
things go.</p>
                  <p>The women are not ſo ſtrictly guarded and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as in other Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> but walk up and
down more freely. They are many of them hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and well-favoured, and notwithſtanding their
liberty I think more modeſt then their neighbours:
in their habit and attire they imitate ſomewhat the
French faſhions.</p>

This City is very vigilant and careful to preſerve
its liberty: Though they have 3 Gates they permit
ſtrangers to enter in and go out only at one, that ſo
they may more eaſily know what number are in the
City, for fear of a ſurpriſe. They permit none to
walk about the ſtreets ſo much as with a Sword, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

                  </p>
                  <p>The Government is by a great Council of 160 an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
choſen out of the Nobility, (the commons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no intereſt or ſhare therein) who muſt be all at
leaſt 25 years old, nine <hi>Antiani</hi> and a <hi>Gonfaloniere.</hi>
The <hi>Antiani</hi> and <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> are choſen anew every
two months. Theſe are called the <hi>Signoria,</hi> and muſt
live in the Palace during the time of their office and
authority. They have a guard of Switzers in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of about 80. The <hi>Gonfaloniere</hi> is the ſupreme of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
yet hath little advantage above the reſt more
then his title and precedency; and we were told
that during his office he is exempted from all taxes
and gabels, which the Noblemen pay equally with
the Commons. The City is divided into 3 parts cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Terzieri,</hi> each <hi>Terziero</hi> hath its Arms or Banner
called <hi>Gonfalone;</hi> whence the name <hi>Gonfaloniere.</hi> At
the corners of each ſtreet are painted both the Arms
and name of the <hi>Terziero,</hi> and the Bulwark they are
to defend. Out of each <hi>Terziero</hi> are choſen by the
Council three <hi>Antiani.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The public revenue is thought to be 100000

ſtands in an open level, without mountain or hillock
within 5 miles of it on any ſide. It is well-fortified
with walls and baſtions, and a deep trench round
except on the Sea-ſide; and ſecured with a good
Garriſon, being one of the moſt conſiderable and
important places in all <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> Since the Great
<hi>Duke</hi> made it a free port it hath encreaſed mightily
in trading and riches, great numbers, of Merchants
from all Nations reſorting hither, and moſt of the
bargains for the commodities of the whole <hi>Levant</hi>
being heer driven. The greateſt part of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
are Strangers and Jews, which laſt are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one third of the whole number of people, and
thought to amount to 5000 perſons and upward.
Before theſe privileges granted to <hi>Ligorn,</hi> when it
was thin of Inhabitants, it was accounted a very bad
air and an unhealthful place, by reaſon of the fens
and marſhes adjoyning; but now ſince it is become
populous, the multitude of fires (as is ſuppoſed)
hath ſo corrected the air, that people enjoy their
health as well and live as long heer as in any other
Town or City of <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Near the Haven is a very magnificent ſtatue of
<hi>Ferdinand</hi> I. Great Duke, about the pedeſtal where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are 4 braſs Statues of ſlaves chained of a gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

bulk and ſtature. The haven within the mole is
but ſmall, but heer is good riding for Ships without.
The <hi>Great Duke</hi> in <hi>Lent</hi> time uſes to make his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in this Town; heer being great variety of good
fiſh taken in the Sea near hand, and to be ſold at
reaſonable rates; all other proviſions being dear
enough. In <hi>Ligorn</hi> we ſaw workmen filing of mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſtones,
called in Latine <hi>Lapis galactites &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochthus,</hi>

                  <p>At <hi>Ligorn</hi> finding a good <hi>Dutch</hi> Veſſel ready to ſet
ſail for <hi>Naples,</hi> we put our ſelves aboard her: The
wind not favouring us we ſpent five days in this
paſſage before we reached our Port. The Captain of
the Ship told us that heerabouts uſually in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
the wind blows from the Land, and in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
from the Sea; ſo that it is Eaſterly in the
forenoon, and Weſterly in the afternoon. We alſo
obſerved in this Voyage, that about Sun-ſet the wind
fell; ſo that ſoon after Sun-ſet there was little or no
wind ſtirring: and likewiſe ſeveral days about Sun-riſing
we had but little wind. In our return back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
from <hi>Meſſina</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> and from <hi>Naples</hi> to
<hi>Ligorn,</hi> we obſerved that the wind for the moſt part
ſate contrary to us. And the Sea men told us that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98511:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this was general in Summer time. So that you have
a much quicker paſſage from <hi>Ligorn</hi> to <hi>Naples,</hi> and
thence to <hi>Meſſina,</hi> than backwards. We obſerved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that the wind follows the Sun, ſo that every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we could make ſome uſe of the wind to ſail
with, but in the afternoon none at all; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
exactly with our Captains obſervation, the
land lying Eaſtward, and the Sea Weſt. Our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
alſo told us that when they made a Voyage from
<hi>Holland</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> they ſailed down the
Coaſt of <hi>Africa</hi> as far Southward, as the place in the
<hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> whither they intended to go lay, and
then ſteer'd directly Weſtward; both the wind
blowing conſtantly from the Eaſt, and the Sea alſo
running the ſame way. Which relation of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with the general vogue of Mariners (if true)
doth much confirm the opinion of the diurnal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the earth. When they return backwards from
thence into <hi>Holland,</hi> they go round about the Bay of
<hi>Mexico,</hi> and up a good way northward, and then ſtrike
over to <hi>Europe,</hi> the water being reflected (as he ſaid)
that way, and the wind alſo often blowing that way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Naples</hi> lies by the Sea ſide under hills,<note place="margin">Naples.</note> in form of
a Theater; for its figure and ſituation much like to
<hi>Genua,</hi> but ſomewhat bigger, and much more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous;
ſo that before the laſt great Plague (which
ſwept away as we were credibly informed at leaſt
120000 ſouls) one might well reckon the number of
Inhabitants to have been about three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.
The circuit of the walls is not above ſeven
<hi>Italian</hi> miles, but it hath large Suburbs. The Town
is well built of ſtone; the houſes tall and maſſy;
for the moſt part flat rooft, and covered with a kind
of plaſter, which fences out the rain, and endures
the weather well. Notwithſtanding this City lies ſo
far South, and under hills, yet is not the heat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme,
but ſuch as may well be endured even in the
middle of Summer, they having for the moſt part
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98511:146"/>
about noon-tide a brize of wind, which cools and
refreſhes much. Two or three hot days we had, but
the reſt temperate enough. They told us that there
uſes to be very little rain there in Summer time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
at our being there (which was in the latter end
of <hi>June</hi> and beginning of <hi>July</hi>) it rained every other
day, and ſometimes ſo plentifully, that the water
ran down like a river in the ſtreets. When they have
no rain, to cool the ſtreets in the afternoon they
draw about a tun filled with cold water, and bored
with ſeveral holes, whence the water guſhes out as
it goes along. The Dialect of the common people is
much different from the <hi>Tuſcane,</hi> and not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
but by one who hath a long time converſed
with them. This City is well ſerved with all provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
eſpecially fruit which is very cheap heer. In
this place we took firſt notice of the <hi>Cucurbita an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guina,
Cucumis anguinus, Mala inſana, &amp; Limoncelle,</hi>
to be ſold in market. <hi>Macarones</hi> and <hi>Vermicelle</hi> (which
are nothing but a kind of paſte cut into the figure of
worms or thongs) boil'd in broth or water, are a
great diſh heer as well as at <hi>Meſſina,</hi> and as much
eſteemed by the vulgar, as Frumenty by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
people in <hi>England.</hi> All the <hi>Neopolitans</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians,</hi>
and genenrally the <hi>Italians</hi> drink their Wine
and water ſnowed; and you ſhall ſee many ſtalls in
the ſtreets where there is ſnowed water to be ſold:
many alſo you ſhall meet, with a barrel at their
backs and glaſſes in their hands, crying<note n="*" place="margin">

that before the laſt great Plague the very gabel

                  <p>
                     <hi>NB.</hi> To cool the water or wine they do not put
the ſnow into it, but round about the veſſel wherein
it is contained: ſo they have a veſſel conteining the
ſnow or ice, and into that they ſet the veſſel contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wine or water.</p>
                  <p>There are in this City an incredible number of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98511:147"/>
Monaſteries or Religious houſes (as they call them.)
<hi>Beltrano Deſcript. Neap.</hi> gives us a Catalogue of 160
of all ſorts, whereof 121 of men and 39 of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
the number of the perſons contained in them
being 1242.</p>
                  <p>Four Caſtles there are to ſecure and bridle the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
withal, 1. <hi>Caſtel d'Ovo,</hi> built on a rock in the
Sea, having an artificial Cauſſey or mole leading to
it from the ſhore. 2. <hi>Caſtel S. Elmo</hi> or S. <hi>Hermo</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on a hill above the City. 3. <hi>Caſtel Novo</hi> by the
water ſide, near the Haven where the Gallies lie.
4. <hi>Torrione di Carmine,</hi> made uſe of by <hi>Maſſaniello</hi>
and <hi>Aneſe</hi> in the time of the Rebellion. This is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a tower belonging to the <hi>Carmelites</hi> Cloyſter.</p>
                  <p>The Churches in this Town are generally very
handſome within ſide; many of them richly gilt
and ſumptuouſly adorned; ſome of them not only
paved with marble of divers colours, but their walls
encruſted all over with marble inlaid. Of all the
Cloyſters I have any where ſeen that of the <hi>Carthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
cloſe adjoyning to the Caſtle S. <hi>Elmo,</hi> is the
moſt ſplendid and magnific, where there is a large
ſquare Court compaſſed about with the faireſt <hi>peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtylium</hi>
or Cloyſter that I ever ſaw: All the pillars and
all the pavement (of the Portico I mean) being of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of ſeveral colours well wrought, poliſh'd and laid,
and ſo cleanly and elegantly kept, that one cannot ſee
a more pleaſant ſpectacle of this nature. For my own
part I was much taken with the ſight of it. Heer is a
fair Arſenal to build Gallies in, now made but little
uſe of. The public Granary deſerves notice taking,
it being the greateſt and beſt furniſhed of any we
have ſeen. They told us there was Corn enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in ſtore to ſerve the whole City ſome years up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any exigency. There are great Vaults made under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
to keep it in in Winter time, and large
rooms above to keep it in Summer. A great number
of men they hire to turn all the beds of Corn every
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98511:147"/>
day. The Bakers of the Town are obliged to take
every month 25000<note n="*" place="margin">A to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molo is a meaſure bigger then an Engliſh Buſhel.</note> 
                     <hi>tomoli</hi> out of this Granary,
that ſo there may be a ſucceſſion of new Corn yearly.
This they paying a good rate for, is the reaſon why
bread is dearer in <hi>Naples</hi> than otherwiſe it would be.</p>

                  <p>Every hearth (fires they call them) in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Naples</hi> pays 15 Carolines the year to the
King, which is about ſix and ſix pence or ſeven ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<hi>Engliſh.</hi> The number of fires in the whole
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:98511:148"/>
Kingdom is 475727, beſides 5804 which are exempt
from payment. In which number are not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the fires of the <hi>Albaneſe</hi> and <hi>Illyrians</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called <hi>Sclavonians</hi> who pay no more then
11 Carolines the year, are numbred every year, and
are permitted to remove from place to place in the
Kingdom. The number of theſe extraordinary fires
is 4451. So then the whole ſum of the Hearth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
is 719095 Ducats 4 Carolines, from which
deducting what is to be abated for places privileged
and exempt from payment, that which comes clear
into the Kings treaſury will be 654873 Ducats, and
ſix Carolines.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Adogo</hi> or tax which feudatories pay to the
King in lieu of perſonal ſervice amounts in the whole
Kingdom to 120568 Ducats: They alſo pay Reliefs
after Deaths one half of a years Revenue. Beſides
theſe there are abundance more taxes and gabels
paid by the Subject; an account of all which in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
may be ſeen in <hi>Scipio Mazzella</hi> his Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> written in <hi>Italian</hi>
and printed 1601. So that one would think it were
impoſſible for poor Peſants to pick up ſo much money
as they pay to the King only: and yet I believe the
gabels and payments are ſince that time much encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
The wholeſum of all the Kings <hi>Entrata</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
yearly accruing from this Kingdom then was
2996937 Ducats, 3 Carolines and 14 grains.</p>

they had ſtudied and compoſed about parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ſubjects, which were appointed them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the week before: and after ſome objections
againſt what was delivered and reaſonings to and
fro about it, the company was diſmiſt. A man could
ſcarce hope to find ſuch a knot of ingenious perſons
and of that latitude and freedom of judgment in
ſo remote a part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and in the communion
of ſuch a Church. They are well acquainted with
writings of all the learned and ingenious men of the
immediately preceding age, as <hi>Galileo, Cartes, Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendus,
Harvey, Verulam;</hi> and of the preſent yet ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving,

<hi>Willis,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> Monſieur
<hi>Pecquet,</hi> &amp;c. We were very much pleaſed and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the converſation and diſcourſe of ſome of
them. Amongſt the reſt Dr. <hi>Thomas Cornelius</hi> hath
made himſelf known to the world by his Writings.</p>
                  <p>We went by water to <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> anciently <hi>Puteoli;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">April 24 Pozzuolo</note>
there ſo ſoon as we were come into our Inn many
Sea-men and Countrey people came about us, ſome
bringing Shells, others <hi>Hippocampi</hi> dried, others an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
medals and <hi>Entaglie,</hi> others pieces of coloured
glaſs raked out of the Sea, (as they told us) about
<hi>Argenteria.</hi> Near this Town are ſeveral arches of
ſtone [13 peers] reaching a great way into the Sea.
Some are of opinion that this was the beginning of
<hi>Caligula</hi>'s Bridge over this Bay, and that from the
end of this pile as far as <hi>Baiae</hi> the reſt of the Bridge
was made of veſſels locked together and faſtened
with Anchors on each ſide. But more probable it is
that this was intended for a mole or peer to ſecure
the Harbour, and for Ships to lie behind, becauſe
upon every peer a great ſtone perforated ſtands jet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of tie veſſels unto. That it was an ancient
<hi>Roman</hi> work the manner of the Arches, the figure of
the bricks, and the ſtatelineſs of it do ſufficiently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</p>

From <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> we paſſed over the Gulf to <hi>Baiae,</hi>
where are ſo many Antiquities, that to diſcourſe fully
of them would require a volume alone. And others
having written at large of them both in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Latine,</hi> I ſhall not ſo much as mention any thing ſave
only the ſweating vault being one of the grots called

                     <hi>Bagne de Tritoli.</hi> It is a long and narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
like the entry into ſome room, the upper part
whereof is ſo hot, that a man cannot endure to walk
upright, being then in danger to be ſtifled by the
hot and ſuffocating vapour with which the upper
part of the Vault is filled: the lower part though
not cold is yet tolerable. Indeed one would not think
there could be ſo great a difference in ſo ſmall a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
He therefore that goes in there is neceſſitated
to ſtoop low; for if you do but hold up your hand it
ſweats ſuddenly. We obſerved that of the lower
part of this vault where it was cool the ſides were a
firm ſtone, but of the upper part where it was hot,
a ſoft, friable, yet unctuous yellow clay. It ſeemed to
us to have a mixture of ſulphur and fixt ſalt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
in it, but we made no trial of it by fire or
otherwiſe. Where this <hi>ſtratum</hi> or region of clay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
there preciſely doth the heat begin; ſo that
where the region of clay goes lower there you muſt
ſtoop lower to avoid the heat. In this hot ſteam
there is a watery vapour conteined, as appears by
the drops notwithſtanding all the heat condenſed on
the ſides of the vault as on an Alembic head. As we
returned we viewed the new Mountain, called by
ſome<note n="*" place="margin">i. e. The Mountain of aſhes or cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> 
                     <hi>Monte di cenere,</hi> raiſed by an Earth-quake
<hi>Septemb.</hi> 29. 1538, of about an hundred foot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
altitude; though others make it much
higher, according to <hi>Stephanus Pighius</hi> it is a mile
aſcent to the top, and 4 miles round at the foot. We
judg'd it nothing near ſo great. The people ſay it bears
nothing; nothing of any uſe of profit I ſuppoſe they
mean, elſe I am ſure there grows <hi>Heath, Myrtle,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98511:150"/>
Maſtich-tree,</hi> and other ſhrubs upon it. It is a ſpungy
kind of earth, and makes a great ſound under a mans
feet that ſtamps upon it. The ſame Earthquake threw
up ſo much earth ſtones, and aſhes as quite filled up
the <hi>Lacus Lucrinus,</hi> ſo that there is nothing now left
of it but a fenny meadow. In our return from <hi>Poz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuolo</hi>
we viewed the mountain called <hi>Solfatara,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<hi>Campi Phlegraei,</hi> which continually burns.
On the top of the mountain is a large excavated oval
place like an Amphitheater, in length 1500 foot, in
breadth 1000; where the burning is. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
holes or vents where the ſmoke iſſues out, as
out of a furnace. We gathered perfect flowers of
ſulphur to appearance, and ſalt-Armoniac ſticking to
the mouths of theſe vents. If you thruſt a Sword or
any iron inſtrument into one of the holes where the
ſmoke comes out, and ſuddainly draw it back again,
you ſhall ſee it all over bedewed or thick ſet with
drops of water. Whence it is manifeſt that this ſmoke
is not only a dry exhalation, but hath alſo good
quantity of the vapour of water mixt with it. We
obſerved that theſe <hi>flores</hi> of <hi>Sulphur</hi> would not burn,
nor eaſily melt over the fire, by reaſon of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of ſome heterogeneous body with them.
The ſtones and earth of this mountain are cruſted
over with theſe flowers of Brimſtone, which they
gather and diſtil Brimſtone out of. As one walks
heer the earth makes a noiſe, as if it were hollow
underneath, and one may perfectly hear as it were
the hiſſing and boiling of ſome melted mineral, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
or other liquor juſt under ones feet. One that
ſhould ſee this ſmoke, hear this noiſe and feel the
heat would wonder that the mountain ſhould not
ſuddenly break out into a flame. This great hollow
above was I ſuppoſe excavated partly by force of the
burning, the earth ſinking down, and partly by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
away the top to diſtil for Brimſtone.</p>

                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:98511:150"/>
Five miles diſtant from <hi>Naples</hi> is the mountain
<hi>Veſuvius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Veſuvius.</note> ſo famous in all ages for its burning. The
ground all about the ſides of it we found covered
with cinders and pumice ſtones, which had been caſt
out in the time of the burnings. We obſerved alſo
great channels, like gulls made by ſuddain torrents
and land-floods, which they told us were made by
water thrown out at the top of the mountain in the
conflagrations. Toward the top grew very few
plants. <hi>Acetoſa ovilla</hi> where nothing elſe was to be
ſeen: A little lower grew <hi>Colutea Scorpioides</hi> and
ſome ſhrubs of <hi>Poplar.</hi> Near the top the aſcent was
ſteep, and very toilſome to get up. Upon the very
top is a great pit or hollow in form of an Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater,
of about a mile round, cauſed by the fires
blowing up the upper part of the mountain ſeveral
times with great violence. There are ſtill about the
bottom of this great cavity ſome ſmall <hi>ſpiracula</hi> of
ſmoke, but inconſiderable and which ſeem'd not
to threaten any future eruption. We viewed the
cave called <hi>Grotta di cane</hi> near the <hi>Lago Agnano.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta di cane.</note> This
Grot is narrow and ſhort. Whatever others have
written or ſaid to the contrary, a man may without
any great prejudice go into and continue in it a long
time, even in the further end of it, as ſome of us
did above an hours ſpace. The venenoſe vapour
(whether it be purely ſulphureous or alſo Arſenical)
aſcends not a foot from the ground, but ſo high as
it aſcends one feels his feet and legs hot. If you hold
your head down near the ground where the vapour
is, you ſhall preſently find a fierce ſulphureous twinge
in your noſe, juſt as if you held your head over
burning brimſtone, or more violent, which makes
a man ſtagger at firſt ſtroke, and ſtifles before one be
aware. We carried with us a dog, which by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his noſe down we almoſt killed ſuddainly; and
then throwing him into the lake to try whether that
would recover him (as is generally believed) the dog
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98511:151"/>
being not lively enough to ſwim was there drowned.
I believe if we had left him in the air he would have
recovered. We then put in a pullet, which was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
immediately; next a frog, which held not
out long; and laſt of all a ſerpent, which lived about
half an hour. The ſteam, if you hold a candle where
it comes, preſently puts it out. I believe this vapour
ariſes not only in this grot preciſely, but alſo all
heerabout, as I am confident would be found were
there other grots dug out of the hill near it.</p>
                  <p>Going to this grot;<note place="margin">The Grot or Hole through Mount <hi>Pauſilypus</hi>
                     </note> we paſſed through the vault
or artificial high-way wherewith the mountain <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilypus</hi>
is perforated, made by one <hi>Cocceius</hi> in 15 days.
It is ſaid to be a mile in length, but we judged it not
above half an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile. It is higheſt at each end,
and loweſt in the middle, and yet there about 12
foot high; broad enough for two carts meeting to
paſs one another. About the middle of the Vault it
is ſo dark (no light now coming in but at the ends)
that thoſe who meet cannot ſee one another; and
therefore leſt they ſhould juſtle or fall foul one upon
upon another, they that go toward the Sea cry <hi>Alla
marina,</hi> and they which go into the Countrey cry
<hi>Alla montagna,</hi> ſo each take their left hand, and paſs commodiouſly.
The ports may be ſeen from end to
end, and any where in the mid-way; but in cloudy
weather it is ſo dark in the middle that a man can
ſcarce ſee his hands held up to the light. This road
is much frequented; though the bottom be ſtone
yet is it very duſty. Near the end toward <hi>Naples</hi>
we ſaw a window at the top. They that write of
this grot mention two windows made by <hi>Alphonſus</hi>
the firſt King of <hi>Naples;</hi> but we ſaw only this,
which doth yield but little light.</p>

when they ſee any Veſſel coming go out in boats to
meet it, and offer their ſervice to guide it into the
Harbour, for which they will be well paid; our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain
being forced to give ten pieces of Eight. The
Haven of <hi>Meſſina</hi> is very commodious and ſecure,
compaſſed almoſt round with the City on one ſide
and a narrow languet or neck of land on the other,
reſembling a large Fiſhpond. The City makes a

[<hi>Regni caput</hi>] and will be no means give place to
<hi>Palermo.</hi> The Vice-roy is obliged to reſide 18 months
heer, and 18 at <hi>Palermo.</hi> They ſtand much upon
their privileges granted them by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth
Emperor; and one privilege they have, not to ſhew
their privileges. They contend earneſtly to have the

There is a great emulation and enmity between the

proud, and ready to expel the Vice-roy if he

ſo that its free for any man to enter in and go out at

by ſix <hi>Jurats,</hi> four of the Gentry, and two of the

year there is a certain number who do <hi>ambire ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtratum,</hi>
or (as they phraſe it) concur to come in
cap; ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
chuſe by themſelves, and the Citizens by
themſelves. The names of all the Gentlemen of
aboue 25 years of age, and likewiſe of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſans
and Tradeſmen, are written in little ſcrolls of
paper, and thoſe rolled up and caſt upon a table.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98511:153"/>
Then comes in the Kings delegate and takes up of
each heap of theſe ſcrolls to the number of 36, and
thoſe are the Electors. Theſe Electors are brought
into a room where are boxes ſet according to the
number of Competitors, and have balls given them
blue and white; the blue affirmative, and the white
negative; and they give to every one of the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
their ſuffrages as they pleaſe. Thoſe eight of
the Noblemen and four of the Citizens which have
moſt ſuffrages are elected, and come in cap. Now on

little ſcrolls of paper put in a cap; and a little boy puts
his hand in, and takes out one by one to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſix; and thoſe ſix are the Jurats for that year.
The Jurats for the Nobility though they be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
number, yet can they do nothing without the
conſent of one of the Jurats for the Citizens. After
all this ſtir theſe Jurats have but little power, nothing

the Northern miſs, whereas the Northern have but

reaſon is obvious, becauſe there are places in Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Countreys which agree with the Northern in
the temperature of the air; as for example, the
ſides and tops of mountains: but no places in the
Northern which have like temperature of air with
the Southern. Form this experiment I have made
in comparing <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Sicily</hi> I am induced to
believe, that there are are ſcarce any two Countreys
in this Continent ſo far remote the one from the
other, but they have ſome common plants, however
it be thought there be none common to <hi>America</hi> and
this Continent; which I cannot but wonder at, and

It is at preſent but a ſmall City, indifferently well

vaulted or arched walks hewn out of the Rock, and
on each hand all along other vaults at right angles
with them, the floor or bottom of which lateral
vaults was ſome foot and half higher then the floor
of the main walk, and all hewn into troughs or <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi,</hi>
wherein they depoſited their dead bodies; in

huge extent: ſo that I believe there were many
thouſands of bodies laid up heer. Theſe <hi>cuniculi</hi> or
vaulted walks are in many places earth'd and ſtopt

with as little noiſe as they can poſſibly they
bring their boat up cloſe to him; then they either
catch him with their hands and draw him up into
the boat, or if they cannot get near enough to do
ſo, one leaps out of the boat into the Sea, and turns
the Tortoiſe on his back, and then with eaſe drives
him before him up to the boat; the Tortoiſe being
not able to turn himſelf or ſwim away on his back.
They ſay (and it is not unlikely) that the Tortoiſe
while he flotes thus upon the water ſleeps; which is
the reaſon why they are ſo ſtill and make ſo little
noiſe in bringing their boat up to him.<note place="margin">Bernacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells growing upon the back of a Tortoiſe.</note> One of theſe

                  <p>THE Iſland of <hi>Malta</hi> is 20 miles long, 12
miles broad, and 60 miles in circuit; diſtant
from the <hi>primo terreno</hi> or neareſt part of <hi>Sicily</hi> 60
miles; from the Cape of <hi>Calipia</hi> anciently called
<hi>Promontorium Mercurii,</hi> the neareſt point of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
of <hi>Africa,</hi> 200 miles, (as divers of the
moſt skilful and experienced Pilots did affirm to
<hi>Abela</hi> for an undoubted truth) from the Cape of
<hi>Spartivento</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> but 190. So that upon account
of vicinity it is rather to be attributed to <hi>Europe</hi>
than <hi>Africa;</hi> eſpecially if we allow <hi>Sicily</hi> to have
been of old time united to and ſo part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.
The reaſon why others make it a member of
<hi>Africa</hi> is becauſe the preſent Inhabitants of the
Countrey ſpeak a kind of <hi>Moreſco</hi> or <hi>Arabic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The old City, called <hi>Città notabile,</hi> ſituate about
the middle of the Iſland, hath 35 degrees, 15 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
of Northern latitude, and the longeſt day
there is of 14 hours, 52 minutes.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that <hi>Heylin</hi> and others, who
reckon this among the Iſles of <hi>Africa,</hi> place it nearer
the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> aſſign it leſs latitude, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the longeſt day no more then 14 hours; but I
do in theſe and other particulars follow the more
accurate obſervations of <hi>Johannes Franciſcus Abela,</hi>
a learned man and native of this Iſland, in his <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
illuſtrata,</hi> written in <hi>Italian</hi> and publiſhed in <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,
Anno</hi> 1646. in <hi>folio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The whole Iſland from the ſhallowneſs of its ſoil,
there being in few places above two foot depth of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:98511:160"/>
of earth before you come to firm ſtone; and from
the lowneſs of its ſituation, not much elevated above
the level of the water and having no conſiderable
hill in it, ſeems to have been in the moſt ancient
times nothing elſe but a great Rock, wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
and covered with the Sea; eſpecially if
we conſider the multitude of Sea ſhells of all ſorts,
Sharks teeth, vertebres of Thornbacks and other
fiſh bones petrified found all over the Iſland even in
the higheſt parts of it, and moſt remote from the
ſhore. For that theſe were formed by ſome plaſtick
power in the ſtone-quarries, being nothing elſe but
the effects or productions of nature ſporting her
ſelf in imitation of the parts and ſhells of theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
I can hardly be induced to believe; nature
(which indeed is nothing elſe but the ordinary power
of God) not being ſo wanton and toyiſh as to form
ſuch elegant figures without further end of deſign
than her own paſtime and diverſion. But a very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing it is, that the Sea being ſhallow above this
Rock for ſome ages before it came to be uncovered,
there ſhould great beds of Shell-fiſh harbour and
breed in ſo convenient a place, and the water leaving
them their ſhells remain and petrifie. I confeſs its
hard to imagine, how the carcaſſes of ſo many
Sharks ſhould come to be lodged heer as by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of teeth that have been for ſo many years paſt,
and are ſtill daily digg'd up, we muſt needs grant;
unleſs perchance they remain of the heads of ſuch
Sharks as were caught and eaten by the Fiſher-men,
who it is likely after the diſcovery of this Rock fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
heer and made it a ſtation for fiſhing before
it came to be inhabited.</p>
                  <p>To this difficulty Mr. <hi>Steno</hi> returns anſwer in theſe
particulars, 1. That ſuch Sharks or Sea dogs have
each of them 60 teeth and more, and that all the
time they live they breed new teeth. 2. That the Sea
agitated by the winds is wont of protrude thoſebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98511:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it meets with towards ſome one place, and
there heap them together. 3. That Sharks ſwim in
great troops or ſholes, and conſequently that the
teeth of many of them may have been left in one
place. 4. That in the <hi>Malta</hi> earth beſides theſe
Sharks teeth are found alſo ſundry Cochle-ſhells;
ſo that if the number of teeth ſhould encline a man
to aſcribe their production to the earth, on the other
hand, the make of the ſame teeth, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of them in every animal, and the earth like
the bottom of the Sea, and other marine bodies
found in the ſame place do favour the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

                  <p>The air is clear and healthful, and the people long

water to feed their ſprings; of which there are
ſeveral in the high grounds, or ſmall hills about the
middle of the Iſland.<note place="margin">The ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Springs.</note> That theſe Springs proceed
from rain-water only my Author doth very well
prove, becauſe they are found only at the foot of
little hills, conſiſting of a certain porous ſtone
which the <hi>Malteſe</hi> call <hi>Giorgiolena,</hi> or a chalky earth
which eaſily imbibes the rain. And to ſpeak in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
that all ſprings and running waters owe their
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:98511:161"/>
riſe and continuance to rain, ſeems to me more than
probable; 1. Becauſe I never yet ſaw any ſpringing
or running waters breaking out, either on the top of a
hill or ſo near the top, but that there was earth enough
above them to feed ſuch Springs, conſidering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of high mountains, which are almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
moiſtned with clouds, and on which the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams
have but little force: and yet I have made it
part of my buſineſs in viewing the higheſt hills in
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> to examine this particular. Nor
have I yet ever obſerved ſuch ſpringing and running
waters in any plain, unleſs there were hills ſo near,
that one might reaſonably conclude they were fed by
them. 2. Many ſprings quite fail in dry Summers,
and generally all abate conſiderably of their waters.
I am not ignorant that ſome make a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
failing ſprings and enduring ſprings, and
would have the former to proceed from rain, and the
latter from the Sea, but I ſee no ſufficient foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for ſuch a diſtinction, and do think that both the
one and the other are to be attributed to rain; the
failing and enduring being to be referred either to
the different quantity and thickneſs of earth that
feeds them; or to the different quality, the one more
quickly the other more ſlowly tranſmitting the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or ſome ſuch like accident. 3. In clay grounds,
into which the water ſinks with difficulty, one ſhall
ſeldom find any ſprings, but in ſandy, gravelly, rocky,
ſtony or other grounds into which the rain can eaſily
make its way; one ſeldom fails of them. 4. They
who would have fountains to ariſe from and to be fed
by the Sea have not as yet given a ſatisfactory account
of the aſcent of water to the tops of mountains and
its efflux there. For though water will creep up a
filtre above its level, yet I queſtion whether to ſo
great an exceſs above its <hi>aequilibrium</hi> with the air,
whereas in pumps we ſee it will not riſe above two
or three and thirty foot; or if it ſhould, whether it
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:98511:162"/>
would there run out at the top of the filtre, we not
having as yet heard of any experiment that will
countenance ſuch a thing. For the aſcent and efflux
of ſap in trees I ſuſpect may be owing to a higher
principle then purely mechanical. As for the <hi>Sabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Quellem</hi> or <hi>Arena bulliens</hi> of <hi>Helmont,</hi> I look upon
it as an extravagant conceit of his; and yet ſome
ground there is to believe, that there is a kind of
earth lying up and down in veins, which doth like
a filtre retain the water and carry or derive it along
as it lies from place to place, till it brings it to the
<hi>ſuperſicies</hi> of the earth, where it runs out. In other
places there are ſubterraneous channels like the veins
in animals, whereinto the water ſoaking into the
earth is gathered, and wherein it runs as above
ground out of ſmaller rivulets into greater ſtreams:
and where one of theſe veins opens in the <hi>ſuperficies</hi>
of the earth there is a ſpring greater or leſſer accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the magnitude of the vein. Nor need we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that ſprings ſhould endure the length of a dry
Summer, for in many ſorts of earth the water makes

many hours before it gets all through the aſh, and
the Lech ceaſes to drop; and in many Chymical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations

                  <p>Some attribute the original of fountains to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
vapours elevated by ſubterraneous fires, or at
leaſt by that generally diffuſed heat which Miners
find in the earth when they come to 50 or 60 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
under ground; and condenſed by the tops and
ſides of the mountains as by an Alembick head, and
ſo diſtilling down and breaking out where they find
iſſue. And in reaſon one would think, that generally
the deeper one digs in the earth the colder one ſhould
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98511:162"/>
find it, ſith the Urinators affirm that the deeper
they dive in the Sea the colder ſtill they find the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And yet were there ſuch ſubterraneous heats,
they are not ſo great as that it is likely they ſhould
elevate vapours ſo high, through ſo thick a coat of
earth, which it muſt be an intenſe heat indeed will
carry them through, which heat none ſay is found
near the ſuperficies of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>'s account, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſalt water being hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
than freſh, by reaſon of its preponderancy it may
drive up the freſh as high above the ſurface of the
Sea as are the tops of mountains before it comes to
an <hi>aequilibrium</hi> with it, is very ingenious, and would
be moſt likely, were there continued cloſe channels
from the bottom of the Sea to the tops of mountains,
not admitting the air, which I believe will not be
found in many places.<note place="margin">Ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Well<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been inhabited by ſeveral Nations and often changed
maſters. The moſt ancient Inhabitants are by <hi>Cluve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
taken to have been the <hi>Phaeaces</hi> mentioned by
<hi>Homer,</hi> who were expelled by the <hi>Phaenicians.</hi> The
<hi>Phaenicians</hi> were moſt of them driven out by the
<hi>Grecians.</hi> After this is changed Maſters rather than
Inhabitants, being firſt ſubdued and held by the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians;</hi>
then for a long time by the <hi>Romans:</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the <hi>Goths</hi> came hither, who were driven out
by the <hi>Eaſtern Emperours.</hi> Next the <hi>Saracens</hi> poſſeſt
themſelves of it. The <hi>Normans</hi> expelled them and
got the dominion. Then the <hi>Germans</hi> or <hi>Suevi</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Lords of it; then the <hi>French;</hi> then the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonians,</hi>
and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and now laſt of all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Knights Hoſpitallers. The Hiſtory of all
which changes if any man deſire to be fully and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
acquainted with, let him conſult <hi>Abela.</hi> In
all theſe changes it followed for the moſt part the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of <hi>Sicily,</hi> as having little ſtrength to reſiſt any
foreign power invading. It is now ſo well fortified
and manned that it would prove a very difficult mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the greateſt Prince or Potentate in the world
to take it by force; having when it was in far worſe
condition then now it is reſiſted and baffled the Arms
of one of the greateſt Emperours the <hi>Turks</hi> ever had.</p>
                  <p>It is very populous,<note place="margin">The number of the villages and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> containing betwee 30 and
40 great <hi>Caſales</hi> or Villages, ſome of them of above
500 houſes, more like to great Towns than Villages,
and 26 Pariſh Churches, beſide thoſe of <hi>Gozo.</hi> The
number of fighting men was ſaid to be about a 5000,
but I believe there are ſcarce ſo many, for according
to a ſurvey taken in the year 1632 the whole number
of ſouls upon the Iſland beſides the Knights was but
50112; of which we cannot reckon much above
one fifth part to be fighting men. And though ſince
that time the number of Inhabitants be much encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
yet I think ſcarce doubled.</p>

The language of the Natives is a corrupt <hi>Arabic</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Great Maſter</hi> of the Order is now Prince and
ſupreme Governour of the whole Iſland,<note place="margin">The Gr. Maſter Prince of the Iſland.</note> which
with <hi>Gozo</hi> and the adjacent iſlets, after the loſs of
<hi>Rhodes</hi> was granted to this Order by the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> V. in the year 1530. The Government is
managed with that prudence and juſtice, that the
Iſland is now in a very flouriſhing condition, the
Inhabitants enjoying a great deal of freedom and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity;
being alſo in their carriage and converſation
among themſelves and to Strangers ſince the coming
in of the Order very civil and courteous, however
formerly they have been branded for the contrary: ſo
that few ſubjects live more happily then they do.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Great Maſter</hi> when he goeth abroad it atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by many of the Knights, and 2 or 3 Pages, of
which he keeps (as we were told) about 24. The
Knights of the Order are always uncovered in the
preſence of the Great Maſter, excepting thoſe 16
which are of the <hi>Gran Croce:</hi> they take place, of
what birth or quality ſoever they are, according to
their ſeniority from the time of their admiſſion; ſo
that there is never any difficulty or queſtion about
precedency. All the Knights are of noble or gentile
extraction, none being capable of admiſſion but
ſuch as can prove their Gentility for three or four de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents.
The <hi>Great Maſter</hi> wears a black ſhort Gown
with hanging ſleeves, the reſt of the Knights are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
as they pleaſe at home, but when they go <hi>in
Curſo</hi> (as they call it) upon the Gallies they wear
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:98511:167"/>
the proper habit belonging to their Order. The
number of Knights was ſaid to be between 2000 and
3000, of which for the moſt part reſide in the City
the major part, except when the Gallies are abroad.
The name of the Great Maſter at our being there
was <hi>Nicolaus Cottoner</hi> of <hi>Majorca,</hi> and I ſuppoſe he

                  <p>About 5 miles diſtant from <hi>Malta</hi> Weſtward lies
the Iſland <hi>Gozo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gozo.</note> called by the ancients <hi>Gaulos,</hi> 12
miles long; 6½ broad, and about 30 in circuit. The
ſoil like that of <hi>Sicily</hi> very deep and fruitful of
Wheat and other grain. This Iſland is mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
yet all cultivated, furniſhed with ſtore of freſh
ſorings. It maintains upon it 3000 perſons, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of houſes being about 500. It was much more
populous before the <hi>Turkiſh Armata</hi> moſt inhumanely
waſted it in the year 1565, carrying away priſoners
6000 perſons.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtreight betwixt <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Gozo</hi> lies a little
Iſland called <hi>Comina,</hi> anciently, according to <hi>Cluve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,
Hephaeſtia,</hi> about 5 miles in compaſs and well
cultivated; for the defence whereof the Gr. Maſter
<hi>Wignacourt</hi> cauſed a Fort to be built oppoſite to that
on the other ſide the ſtreight in <hi>Gozo,</hi> to ſecure the
ſtreight and hinder any veſſels paſſing between the

That there is great plenty of ſhells and fiſh-bones
petrified found in <hi>Malta,</hi> I have already intimated. I
ſhall now therefore only name thoſe which are not
at all or but rarely found with us in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Gloſſopetrae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified ſhells in <hi>Malta,</hi> &amp;c.</note> which are nothing elſe but Sharks
teeth, of ſeveral ſhapes and ſizes. Theſe the <hi>Malteſe</hi>
call <hi>Serpents Tongues.</hi> 2. The Vertebres of Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs
and other cartilagineous fiſhes. 3. <hi>Cats heads</hi>
(as they call them from their likeneſs to a little skull.)
4. <hi>Serpents eyes</hi> of ſeveral figures and colours. The
moſt of them red and like to thoſe they call <hi>Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones;</hi>
the exteriour ſuperficies being a ſegment of
a ſphaerical, and ſhining as if it were poliſhed, ſo
that they are commonly ſet in rings. I have ſeen
great lumps or maſſes of theſe cemented together.
That the <hi>Toadſtone</hi> is nothing elſe but the jaw-tooth
of a fiſh called <hi>Lupus marinus</hi> by <hi>Schonfeldius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What the Toad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone ſo called is.</note> Dr.
<hi>Merret</hi> in his <hi>Pinax</hi> hath firſt publiſhed to the world;
and I doubt not but theſe have the ſame or like ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
5. <hi>Serpents teeth,</hi> which are ſmall, oblong,
ſtriate ſtones of a polite ſuperficies, but no certain fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
Whither to refer theſe as yet I know not, as
neither 6. Thoſe they call <hi>Serpents eggs,</hi> which
are ſomewhat like the former but not ſtriate with
lines. 7. <hi>Baſtons of S. Paul</hi> [<hi>Baculi S. Pauli</hi>] having
the reſemblance of ſmall ſnagged ſticks. 8. <hi>Petrified
Lentils,</hi> becauſe for colour, figure and magnitude
ſomewhat like to that pulſe. Beſides, I found among
the ſtones I bought there ſome exactly figured like the
fore teeth of a man, and doubtleſs many other ſorts
by diligent ſearch might be found, which have not
as yet been named or taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>As for Plants I found heer very few ſorts but
what I had before obſerved in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> viz.
<hi>Cucumis aſininus; Hypericum tomentoſum; Conſolida
regalis peregrina parvo flore</hi> J. B. <hi>Carduus lactens pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinus</hi>
Cam. There are but few trees growing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Iſland, the greateſt want they have being of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:98511:169"/>
fewel, to ſupply which defect they have of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to make uſe of Sea-wrack to burn in their ovens,
prepared after a certain manner invented by a peſant
of <hi>Malta,</hi> for which he is highly commended by
<hi>Abela</hi> as a great benefactor to his Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Heer I firſt noted the cuſtom of ſlitting up the
notrils of Aſſes; becauſe they being naturally
ſtreight or ſmall, ſuffice not to admit air enough to
ſerve them when they travel or labour hard in theſe
hot Countreys. For the hotter the Countrey is, the
more air is neceſſary for reſpiration and refreſhment
of the body; there being leſs of that <hi>menſtruum</hi>
which ſerves to nouriſh or continue fire and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he vital heat of Animals (which hath great
likeneſs thereto) in hot air then in cold; whence we
ſee that fire burns furiouſly in cold weather and but
faintly in hot. Whether it be becauſe the air is thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in hot weather and hot Countreys, or becauſe
the reflected Sun-beams ſpend and conſume a good
part of the forementioned <hi>menſtruum,</hi> or from both
theſe cauſes. That the air is thinner and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>menſtruum</hi> alſo more diffuſed in hot weather is
clear in experience. I need mention no other expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
to demonſtrate it then the air encloſed in the
ſhank of an ordinary weather-glaſs, which in hot
weather dilates its ſelf, and in cold contracts very
conſiderably. So then to give an account of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of fire in the coldeſt weather, we need not
have recourſe to the inſignificant term of <hi>Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis;</hi>
the true reaſon thereof being the denſity of
the ambient and contiguous air containing plenty of
that <hi>menſtruum</hi> which nouriſhes the fire.</p>
                  <p>I omitted to mention the ancient <hi>Coemeteria,</hi> or
ſubterraneous burying-places called <hi>Catacumbe,</hi> of
which there be many in <hi>Malta,</hi> becauſe of theſe we
have already had occaſion to diſcourſe in our deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> in <hi>Sicily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this Iſland produces or nouriſhes no Serpent
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98511:169"/>
or other venemous creature, the common people af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm;
but becauſe I find no mention heerof in <hi>Abela,</hi>
I give little credit to their report: ſhould it be true, it
would be to me a great argument that this was not
the Iſland upon which St. <hi>Paul</hi> was caſt when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
Shipwrack, but rather that <hi>Melita</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
upon the Coaſt of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> for which there
is alſo ſome ground in the Scripture, which ſaith
<hi>Acts</hi> 27. 26.</p>
                  <p>For that St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon the Vipers faſtning on his
hand did by his Prayers obtain of God, that all the
Serpents in <hi>Malta</hi> ſhould be turned into ſtones, and
the Iſland for the future wholly free from all vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
beaſts, is a Monkiſh fancy, grounded upon
the forementioned petrified fiſh-bones, which they
fondly imagined were ſometime parts of Serpents:
whereas in other places where plenty of ſuch ſtones
are found there is no lack of Serpents. I confeſs it is
difficult to imagine how Serpents ſhould come at firſt
to breed heer, if the whole Iſland were once (as we
conceive) a ſubmarine Rock covered with the Sea;
and there be no ſpontaneous generation of animals,
as wel alſo believe: becauſe it can ſcarce be imagined
that any man ſhould on purpoſe bring over Serpents
hither; unleſs perchance to ſhew them for a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
Whether there be venemous beaſts or no I am
ſure there are venemous inſects heer, the very biting
ox ſtinging of the Gnats (with which the City is
much infeſted) being more virulent then in other
places. For my part I do not remember that in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
the biting of a gnat did ever cauſe a ſwelling, or
leave a mark behind it in the skin of my face (though
I know in ſome it doth) but there it both raiſed a
ſwelling, and left a mark behind it that was not out
for a month after. The <hi>Malteſe</hi> eaſily defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the annoyance and bitings of this inſect,
keeping them out of their beds by large linnen cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
lapping over one another. At firſt we were
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:98511:170"/>
not aware of the trouble theſe Animals were like to
give us, and left our curtains open.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Malta</hi> we returned the ſame way to <hi>Meſſina;</hi>
ſtaying a day at <hi>Catania;</hi> where we hired horſes and
took a Souldier to guide us up Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mount <hi>Aetna.</hi>
                     </note> now
called <hi>Mon-Ghibello.</hi> The top of which at <hi>Catania</hi>
was told us to be 30 miles diſtant. We aſcended for
the moſt part all along from <hi>Catania,</hi> and we found
the ground rich, and well cultivated, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
well inhabited; for the ſlag and cinders caſt out
of the mountain, being in proceſs of time diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the weather, doth mightily fatten and enrich
the ſoil. We rode up ſo high till we came to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatories
of ſnow; and ſeeing the mountain above
us all covered with ſnow; we did not, nor indeed
could we aſcend any higher. The trees heerabout
had at this time ſcarce put out their leaves. As we
went up we found in one place the ground covered
for a quarter of a mile broad, and 4 or 5 miles in
length, with cinders, which had been thrown forth
by the mountain, and was cartainly the relique of a
huge ſtream of melted coals, iron, ſtones and ſulphure
poured out in the time of the laſt eruption, nothing
as yet growing among theſe ſtones and cinders. This
mountain haſh in former times thrown forth ſtones
and ſlag as far as <hi>Catania</hi> it ſelf, as we could mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
ſee; but of all the eruptions that ever were I
believe this laſt which happened [<hi>Anno</hi> 1669.] ſince
our being there was the greateſt and moſt horrid;
for a full deſcription and exact account wherof I
refer the Reader to <hi>Borellus</hi> his learned Treatiſe <hi>De
incendiis Aetnae.</hi> This mountain is of a very great
height, and we were told by credible perſons, that
one might ſee it at Sea over the whole Iſland any way
one came thither. We could clearly diſcern the top
of it as far as the Iſland of <hi>Malta,</hi> which in a right
line muſt needs be at leaſt 100 miles diſtant. One
thing we could not but wonder at, that there ſhould
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98511:170"/>
be a ring of ſnow about the top of <hi>Aetnas,</hi> but the
higheſt top it ſelf bare, without any ſnow upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Sicily</hi> are noted for churliſh
and uncivil to Strangers,<note place="margin">Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and Cuſtoms of <hi>Sicily.</hi>

The <hi>Italians</hi> have a Proverb, <hi>Omnes inſulani

a very ill place to travel in, by reaſon of the

to the good Government, which takes no more care
to cleanſe it of ſuch vermine. Theſe Bandits will not
be content with your money, but will alſo ſeize your
perſon and detain you priſoner in the mountains till
you give them a good ranſom for your deliverance.</p>
                  <p>We took notice of ſome Laws and Cuſtoms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to <hi>Sicily</hi> during our ſtay heer.</p>
                  <p>1. It is unlawful to carry out of this Iſland in
money more then ten crowns a perſon; if any one
carries out more and be taken, all is forfeited. But
the ſearchers are not ſo ſtrict, but that if you give
them a little money they will let you paſs, eſpecially
if you be a ſtranger and traveller, without any
ſearching at all.</p>
                  <p>2. It is unlawful to kill any Calves in this Iſland,
ſo that no Veal can be procured heer. And yet at

or <hi>sicily:</hi> And S. <hi>Pauls.</hi> pillar which burned, of
which they have but a ſmall fragment remaining.
They told us many ſtories and legends of it, which
we gave little heed to.</p>
                  <p>We took boat and went as far as <hi>Scylla,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">May 29. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of catching the Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh.</note> to ſee the
fiſhing of the <hi>Peſce Spada</hi> or Sword-fiſh. The maner
whereof is thus. On the top of the Cliffs by the
Sea-ſide ſtand <hi>Speculatores (Huers</hi> our Fiſher-men
call them) to eſpy the Fiſh, who ſo ſoon as they ſee
them, either by voice if they be near, or by known
ſigns if at diſtance, give notice to the Fiſhing-boats
whereabouts the fiſh are. The boat preſently makes
towards the place; then one gets up to the top of a
little maſt in the boat, made with ſteps on purpoſe,
and there ſtands to obſerve the motion of the fiſh and
direct the rowers, who accordingly ply their oars.
When they are come very near him, he upon the
maſt comes down, and taking the harping iron in
his hand, if he can ſtrikes it into him. The fiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wounded, plays up and down and wearies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and when he is faint and ſpent they draw him
up into the boat: This is much like the Whale-fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The harping iron is put on a ſtaff or pole of
wood. The point of it is ſharp and hath beards on
each ſide like a barbed arrow, ſo joynted that if you
hold the point upward they clap cloſe to the ſhaft, if
downward they fall off from it on each ſide, ſo that
they reſiſt not the going in of the iron but only the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98511:171"/>
drawing out. This fiſh is held a great dainty by
the <hi>Meſſaneſe,</hi> as much longed for and as greedily
bought up by them as <hi>Soland</hi> gooſe by the <hi>Scots;</hi>
ſold in <hi>Meſſina</hi> at firſt coming in for ſix pence <hi>Engliſh</hi>

be no rocks or cliffs hanging over the Sea, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a large boat or brigandine, and pitch up in it a

top of which the <hi>Speculator</hi> or Huer ſtands.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>June</hi> yearly is celebrated at
<hi>Meſſina</hi> a great Feſtival called The Feaſt of our Lady
of the Letter: it continues near a weeks time with
great ſolemnity. During this time all the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers
hang out in all the ſtreets a multitude of
lamps, candles, and tapers, and ſet their windows as
full of lights in paper-lanthorns as they can hold,
which burn all night, ſo that the ſtreets are as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
almoſt by night as by day. Nay the light was
ſo great, that at a good diſtance from the Town as
we came thither late at night, the reflection thereof
from the clouds and atmoſphere appeared to us like
the <hi>Aurora</hi> or <hi>Crepuſeulum,</hi> though we ſaw not the
lights themſelves, and it was no dark night, the
moon as I remember ſhining. They call it the Feaſt
of our Lady of the Letter, becauſe it is held in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of a Letter written to them (as they ſay) by
the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> which how ſorry and ungrounded

the famous enchantreſs <hi>Circe</hi> is reported to have
dwelt. This Promontory ſtands out a great way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Poſſibly they might fly out a great way further to Sea;

in many other Towns of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Gallia Narbonenſis</hi>
to keep off the ſcorching beams of the Sun in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time, which reflected from theſe broad ſtones
would elſe make them more than ſufficiently hot.
The Paper-windows and they too for the moſt part
broken and tattered, do very much diſgrace the fair
ſtone-houſes. The River <hi>Arno</hi> divides this City into
two parts, which are joyned together by 4 fair ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges;
one of which, called <hi>Ponte vecchio</hi> or the
old bridge, hath on each ſide it a row of Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths-ſhops.
All of them, but eſpecially the two
middlemoſt, are remarkable for the breadth and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their arches. The circuit of the walls is ſaid
to be 6 <hi>Italian</hi> miles: but therein is comprehended a
great deal of waſt ground, [I mean not filled up
with buildings] the gardens and walks of the <hi>Great
Dukes</hi> Palace being at leaſt a mile in compaſs; beſides
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:98511:175"/>
on the other ſide the River are ſome hundreds of acres
of land taken up in vineyards and gardens belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to private perſons. The number of Pariſhes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the 12 Priorates is 44, the number of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
according to <hi>Schottus</hi> 85000 ſouls, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he exceeds in his account, though ſome make
them 90000, and other 100000. There are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
number of Nunneries: <hi>Schottus</hi> ſaith 54;
we were told 56, whereas there are but 24 Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
of Freres. But that which is moſt ſtrange is
the multitude of Hoſpitals and Alms houſes, of
which there are ſaid to be 37: one of which, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>Orphanotrophium</hi> maintains 900 perſos, and
hath 70000 crowns yearly revenue.</p>
                  <p>This City is of no great ſtrength, being encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
only with an old-faſhioned wall: but the
<hi>Great Duke</hi> hath 3 Caſtles or Cittadels in it, I think
rather to bridle then defend it; one on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
held by a good Garriſon, neatly kept and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
watcht, wherein are laid up Arms for 30000
men. Another is a ſmall Fortreſs in lthe <hi>Gr. Dukes</hi>
garden, to which he may retire in caſe of any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
danger or exigent: heer they ſay his treaſure
or a good part of it is kept. The third we viewed
not.</p>
                  <p>The Churches in <hi>Florence</hi> though they be not ſo
richly gilded as ſome we have ſeen,<note place="margin">Churches in Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo or Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral.</note> yet for their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture
they excel moſt, eſpecially the <hi>Domo,</hi> or
Church of <hi>S. Maria Florida,</hi> which is ſome mens
opinion is the compleateſt ſtructure that ever was ſet
upon the earth. The pilaſters the ſupport the <hi>nave</hi>
or body of the Church ſtand at ſo great a diſtance,
and are withal ſo very ſlender, that they do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
the Iſles, but at one view you enjoy the whole
Church. Beſides the <hi>Cupola,</hi> though the firſt and
pattern of all the reſt, is the largeſt and talleſt of any
in <hi>Italy,</hi> excepting that of S. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Rome:</hi> under
which is the Quire, of an octagonal figure. The
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:98511:176"/>
walls of this Church are cruſted over on the out-ſide
with marble of ſeveral colours, cut into ſmall pieces
and variouſly checquer'd; which though the <hi>Italians</hi>
now deſpiſe and count but a toy, yet makes a pretty
gaudy ſhew. Within this Church beyond the Quire
are 4 inſcriptions; one concerns the building to the
Church, and is as follows.</p>

to come into ſtand many ancient and ſome alſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Statues. Round about on each ſide this walk
hang the pictures of many Princes and other perſons,
who have been famous in the world for learning or
valour. Among the reſt we noted the Pictures of
<hi>Queen Elizabeth, King James, Oliver Cromwel</hi> and
<hi>Joannes Acutus</hi> before remembred.</p>
                  <p>The chief Rarities are lockt up in Cloſets of
which we ſaw four. The things which in our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient
view we took more eſpecial notice of were, a
huge terreſtrial globe and a <hi>Sphaera armillaris,</hi> bigger
then that. A brancht Candleſtick including many
little figures of ivory or white wax appearing
through the tranſparent Amber: An Engine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
a perpetual motion, like thoſe of <hi>Septalius</hi>
at <hi>Milan.</hi> Seveal ſtone-tables ſo curiouſly inlaid
with ſmall pieces of precious ſtones of divers colours,
as to compoſe figures of plants, fruits and flowers,
birds, beaſts, and inſects, ſo natural and to the life,
that ſcarce any picture drawn by the hand can excel
them. One of theſe, the beſt and richeſt that we have
any where ſeen, both for the excellency of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,
and coſtlineſs of the materials, being ſet
with many Rubines and Pearl, they valued at 100000
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:98511:179"/>
                     <hi>Florence Scudi,</hi> which is more than ſo many <hi>Engliſh</hi>
crowns, Several rich Cabinets. That of the greateſt
value, which they rated at 500000 <hi>Scudi,</hi> was
thick ſet with Gems of the firſt magnitude; a pearl
of an enormous greatneſs, but not perfectly round;
ſeveral Topazes almoſt as big as Walnuts, large Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
and Emeralds, beſides other ſtones of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
note, ſtuds of Amethyſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heer we alſo ſaw
the nail pretended to be one continued body, half
iron, half gold, part of the iron having been turned
into gold by one <hi>Thurnhauſſerus</hi> an Alchymiſt of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi>
before mentioned. To us it ſeem'd counterfeit
and not neatly neither, the iron and the gold being
but bunglingly joyned together. A large topaz as
big as a pullets egg. An entire image made of one
<hi>Turchois</hi> ſtone: Many ancient <hi>Roman</hi> idols of braſs;
old <hi>Roamn</hi> lamps found in Sepulchres of ſeveral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions:
A preſs full of turn'd work of ivory very
fine and ſubtil: Rhinocerots horns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I omit ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
pictures and ſtatues wherewith the rooms were
adorned, made by the beſt Maſters, and much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by thoſe that have judgment in ſuch things.</p>
                  <p>In the Armory we ſaw ſeveral remarkables,<note place="margin">The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> as the
Armour of many great perſons of <hi>Europe,</hi> among
others of <hi>Henry</hi> IV King of <hi>France</hi> and (<hi>harles</hi> V
Emperour: <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s head-piece (as they called
it) It had engraven on it many ancient <hi>Morcſco</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters:
A ſuit of <hi>Perſian</hi> Armour for a man on
horſeback; made of little ſcales of iron. A Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
having its poles at the greateſt diſtance I ever
ſaw any: Several <hi>Indian</hi> Royal Veſts, made of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Five great Swords ſuch as the Pope uſes to
bleſs on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day, and ſend to Princes. A King
of <hi>China</hi>'s Armour made of Fiſh-bones, and a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Sword. This ſure they miſtook for an <hi>Indian</hi>
King's, the <hi>Chineſe</hi> having of a long time had the
uſe both of iron and guns: <hi>Japan</hi> Arms and Swords
without point and broad at the top. Divers <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:98511:180"/>
ſcymitars; <hi>Scanderbeg</hi>'s Sword: The hair of a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
mane 7 yards in length; the skin of this horſe
ſtuft up, ſent by the Duke of <hi>Lorain:</hi> ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
guns: Piſtols on whoſe muzzles were ſcrew'd
heads of Halberds, or Pole-axes. Nine Piſtol-bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
ſo laid on a frame, that by letting down one
cock they were all diſcharged, making 18 ſhot, for
each is double charged, and a train of powder leads
from the touch-hole of the middlemoſt to the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes
of all the reſt in channels made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
An Engine made like a hat; with ſeveral pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols
in the crown; this they called the <hi>bona notte,</hi>
being to be diſcharged upon your enemy when you
complement him and bid him good-night: A long
gun and alſo a piſtol whoſe barrels are of beaten
gold. Several round bucklers, one with <hi>Meduſa's</hi>
head painted upon it by <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> an highly
eſtèemed piece. <hi>Italian</hi> Jocks for ſuſpected wives:
Ancient <hi>Baliſtae</hi> (as they called them) which are no
other then great Croſs-bows. A thong cut out of
the hide of a Buffle, 250 yards long. A preſs full of
rich prizes of Arms taken from the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Argenteria</hi> or Wardrobe we saw ſeveral

plate.<note place="margin">The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteria</hi> or Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe.</note> In one all manner of veſſels of beaten gold.
In another a ſumptuous Altar of the ſame metal (as
they told us) ſet with Diamonds and other precious
ſtones of the higheſt value. On it was inscribed in
great Capitals (the letters all made up of Rubines)
<hi>Coſmus II, Dei gratia magnus Dux Etruriae ex voto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſome by-rooms we ſaw the skin of a <hi>Morſſe</hi> or
Sea-horſe ſtuft; the skin of an <hi>Elk</hi> ſ the skin
and Sceleton of an Elephant, which was ſhown in
<hi>Florence</hi> ſome 8 or 10 years ago, and died there.</p>
                  <p>I might ſpend many words in deſcribing the <hi>Gr. Dukes</hi>
new Palace, and Gardens ſtored with great
variety of trees and ſhrubs valuable for ſhade, beauty,
fruit or ſent; adorned with a multitude of Statues
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:98511:180"/>
thick ſet up and down the walks and knots: plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
fountains and water-works; ſtately and delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
walks both cloſe and open; goodly flowers aud
choice plants. We took notice of Dictamnus Creticus,
Quamoclit Indorum; Tragoriganum; Stramonium
peregrinum <hi>Ger. i. e.</hi> pomo ſpinoſo rotundo; Piſum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datum,
Balſamina cucumerina, Chamaerrhiphes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Heer in an encloſed place were kept two male Oſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and one female.</p>
                  <p>In the Dukes <hi>Theriotrophium</hi> we obſerved theſe
ſorts of wild beaſts, <hi>Lion, Tiger, Leopard, Bear, Wolf,
Porcupine, Wild Boar.</hi> The ſnout of this was longer
in proportion than that of tame or domeſtic Swine:
the ears rounder and ſhorter and of a black colour,
as were alſo the feet and tail. Theſe wild Swine are
conſtantly of the ſame colour, which is a griſly or
iron-grey. Its worth the obſervation that moſt wild
Animals keep to the ſame colour both Beaſts and
Birds; but thoſe that are kept tame vary infinitely,
which is (I ſuppoſe) to be attributed partly to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of their food, and partly to the highneſs of
their feeding; to which the difference of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
and Soil may contribute ſomething. So we ſee
that upon the <hi>Alps</hi> and other high mountains cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the moſt part with ſnow, ſeveral animals, as
<hi>Bears, Foxes, Hares, Partridges,</hi> &amp;c. change their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
colours, and become white, whether by reaſon
of the coldneſs of thoſe mountains, or of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
intuition of ſnow.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Florence</hi> many of the Palaces are made of great,
rough-hewn ſtones, not laid ſmooth, but each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberating
above the <hi>ſuperſicies</hi> of the wall: which
faſhion of building the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>maniera ruſtica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City at preſent is rather in a decaying than
thriving condition, there having not been (as we
were credibly-informed) a new houſe built there
theſe 40 years: the Citizens generally being but
poor. This comes to paſs partly by the great decay
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:98511:181"/>
of their trade; for whereas formerly they ſerved
<hi>France</hi> with Silks, now the <hi>French</hi> themſelves work
them as well or better than they; partly by reaſon
of the great exactions of the <hi>Great Duke,</hi> who lays
immoderate gabels upon all commodities that are
bought and ſold. The greateſt Foreign trade they
have at preſent is with our nation; and that is not
much, we having moſt of our Silk from <hi>Meſſina,
Aleppo,</hi> and other places in the <hi>Levant</hi> and working
it at home. This City is well ſituate in a good air,
only ſomewhat ſharp in winter time; the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
are ingenious and quick-witted. It hath bred
more excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects
then any one City in <hi>Italy</hi> beſides: and for Scholars
and great wits it may vie with moſt.</p>
                  <p>It's the faſhion heer for Gentlemen to ſell their
own wine by retail. Yet no body goes into the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
to drink; but there is a hole made in the Cellar
or Buttery-wall, to give in and take out flasks or
other veſſels; and there is a ſervant attending for the
moſt part ſo long as there is wine to ſell. At the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
gate or wall they uſually hang up the hackles of
old flasks to give notice that there is wine to be ſold
there.</p>
                  <p>The Gentlemen think it a diſparagement to them
to practiſe Phyſic; ſo that none of them bring up
their children to the ſtudy of medicine; but they
think it no diſparagement to exerciſe merchandiſe;
and for this they have the example of the <hi>Great
Duke</hi> himſelf, who is the greateſt Merchant in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
nay <hi>Leti</hi> ſaith, That it is reported, he trades
for more then all the Merchants in <hi>Genoa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Great Duke</hi> is both heer and in all his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſupreme and abſolute Lord, and may <hi>pro arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trio</hi>
impoſe what taxes and gabels he pleaſes; and
therein he is not ſparing. Every houſe pays to him
the tenth of its yearly rent. No houſe or land ſold
but a good part of the price (at leaſt one tenth) goes
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:98511:181"/>
to him. No woman married but he hath 8 <hi>per cent.</hi>
of her portion. Every one that goes to Law pays
2 <hi>per cent.</hi> of what he fues for. Every young Heifer
that is ſold pays a crown; Not ſo much as a basket
of eggs comes to market but it pays ſomewhat for
toll. So that his Revenue muſt needs be great:
ſome ſay a million and half, others two millions of
crowns yearly. His expences amount not to one
million; and conſequently, conſidering alſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of his trading, he muſt needs have an immenſe
treaſure; by <hi>Leti's</hi> reckoning more then 60 millions
of crowns: but its well if it amounts to half that
ſum. And though ſome at <hi>Florence</hi> would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
us that the world was miſtaken in this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his great riches, yet we sew good reaſon to
continue in that belief; he uſing all ways of thrift
and ſparing as well as getting; keeping no houſe but
allowing his ſervants board-wages, and being at a
ſet rate with his Cook, and his Baker, who for the
monopoly of fine bread (<hi>Pane di bocca</hi> they call it)
furniſhes his private table, and pays 1000 <hi>Scudi per
annum</hi> beſides. Moreover it was a maxime with
him, that a good treaſure of mony is the greateſt
ſtrength and ſecurity of a Prince, and he would
often ſay of our late King <hi>Charles</hi> I, that want of
money ruined him, and therefore it may well be
preſumed himſelf would take care to fill his Coffers
with that.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the territories of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> called
the old State, of which he is abſolute Lord and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign;
and the territory of <hi>Siena,</hi> called the new
State, for which he is feudatary of the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> He is alſo poſſeſſed of part of the iſle of <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>

of the Emperour. <hi>Radicofani</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> and
<hi>Borgo ſan Sepolchro</hi> in <hi>Vmbria,</hi> for which he is feuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of the <hi>Pope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Citadels and Fortreſſes, eſpecially thoſe on the
borders, are thought to be the beſt fortified and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with Ammunition and victual of any in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
for the guard of which he keeps four or five
thouſand Souldies in conſtant pay. The 3 principal
offices of truſt are the Governours of <hi>Siena,</hi> of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorn</hi>
and <hi>Petigliano.</hi> He hath always about his perſon
a guard of <hi>German</hi> Souldiers. He is able to ſend
into the Field 40000 footmen and 3000 horſemen.
<hi>Leti</hi> ſaith, that he hath 40000 footmen enrolled,
who are obliged to ſtand ready at every call; and
1000 horſemen liſted and divided into 12 Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and theſe laſt have the priviledge not to be
impriſoned for debt. He can alſo put forth to Sea
upon oceaſion 12 gallies, 2 galeaſſes and 20 ſhips of
war.</p>
                  <p>He entertains and diverts the Citizens of <hi>Florence</hi>
in Summer-time with ſports and ſhows, eſpecially
races for prizes (<hi>Pallio's</hi> they call them) ſometimes
<hi>Barbary</hi> horſes, ſometimes ordinary horſes running
through one of the ſtreets of the Town (which
thence they call the <hi>Curſo)</hi> without any riders. To
make them go they faſten little flaps of leather ſtuck
with prickles upon their backs.</p>
                  <p>The Great Duke holds good correſpondence and
amity with all Chriſtian Princes and States; except
the Pope [upon account of <hi>Borgo San Sepolchro,</hi> to
which the Pope pretends; the Marquiſate of <hi>Monte
feltre,</hi> to which the Duke hath ſome pretenſions in
right of his Wife, who was heireſs to the late Duke
of <hi>Vrbin;</hi> and the buſineſs of <hi>Caſtro:</hi>] and the Duke
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> between whom and him there hath been
an ancient emulation about precedency.</p>

                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:98511:182"/>
The <hi>Duke</hi> hath the nomination of the Biſhops and
Governours of all the Cities in his Dominions.</p>
                  <p>The Eccleſiaſtical Revenues of the Dukes whole
State, according to a Survey taken in the year 1645,

For this <hi>Leti</hi> is my Author.</p>
                  <p>The Family of the <hi>Medici</hi> have had two Dukes
beſides thoſe of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> viz. <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
and <hi>Laurence</hi> Duke of <hi>Vrbin;</hi> two Arch-Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſes

daughter of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II, wife of <hi>Coſmus</hi> II: four
<hi>Popes,</hi> viz. <hi>Leo</hi> X. <hi>Clement</hi> VII, <hi>Pius</hi> IV, and <hi>Leo</hi> XI:
two Queens of <hi>France,</hi> viz <hi>Katharine</hi> wife of <hi>Henry</hi>
II and <hi>Mary</hi> wife of <hi>Henry</hi> IV, mother to our late
Queen-mother, who died in <hi>Collen</hi> 1640. Their
greatneſs began to exceed the meaſure of other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
(ſaith my Author) by the death of Pope <hi>John</hi>
XXIII, depoſed in the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> in
the
year 1414, who died in the houſe of <hi>John Medices,</hi>
and made him his heir.</p>
                  <p>The Gentlemen and Citizens of quality keep not
their daughters at home after they be 8 or 10 years
of age, but put them into Nunneries, where they
are bred and taught all manner of womens work. Out
thence they come not till they be married. He that
makes love to any of them may with the parents
conſent ſee and ſpeak with them at the grate of the
Nunnery. This is not only a ſecure but alſo a cheap
way to bring up their daughters. For they pay not
to the houſe above 16 pounds a year for diet and
all.</p>

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:98511:183"/>
from <hi>Florence;</hi> and when we had proceeded 4

before we came at it.<note place="margin">Siena.</note> 
                     <hi>Siena</hi> is a fair City, ſome 4
miles in compaſs. The Piazza or Market-place is
compaſſed about with good buildings, and for the
figure of it not unfitly reſembled to a cochle or ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop-ſhell.
This fancy had they who paved it, for on
one ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> that next the Palace, they have placed
the figure of the heel of a cochle-ſhell made in ſtone,
and from thence have drawn rayes or ribs of ſtone
(anſwering to the ridges or <hi>ſtriae</hi> of a cochle-ſhell) to

a ſtately edifice of marble, having a beautiful front;

covered with a moveable floor of boards to preſerve
it. Had it been finiſhed as intended, all <hi>Europe</hi> could
not have ſhown the like; but there is not a fourth
part done. The painting of the Library walls in this
Chruch, containing the Hiſtory of <hi>Alneas Sylvius</hi>
afterwards <hi>Pope Pius</hi> II, half by the hand of <hi>Petrus
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:98511:184"/>
Peruginus,</hi> and half by <hi>Raphael Vrbin,</hi> is in my
judgment the moſt excellent painting that ever I
beheld, and ſo freſh and lively as if it had been done
but yeſterday. Heer are alſo other good Churches
and handſome Palaces. We aſcended the Tower cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Torre di mangio,</hi> from whence we had a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the whole City, which runs out into 3 an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.
The walls encloſe much void ground, which
is made uſe of for Gardens and Vineyards. All the
ſtreets and <hi>Piazza</hi> are paved with brick ſet edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
after the manner of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the ſides of
the ſtreets of the <hi>Holland</hi> Towns. The whole Town
is well built and ſituate upon a hill, and by that
means always clean. They heer make no uſe of ſnow
or ice to cool or refreſh their Wines, their cellars
keeping it cool enough. In the Palace of the <hi>Podeſtà</hi>
we ſaw a room, the walls and roof whereof were
painted by <hi>Micherino Saneſe,</hi> valued at more then
the whole Palace beſides. We took notice alſo of
the Theater for Comedies, a fair brick building;
and the <hi>Studium,</hi> called the <hi>Sapienza,</hi> where are
the public Schools, a mean building much like that
of <hi>Piſa.</hi> This City is counted a very good place to
ſojourn in for a Stranger that would learn <hi>Italian,</hi>
as well becauſe the Citizens heer ſpeak the pureſt
language, as for that they are very civil and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Foreigners. Beſides by reaſon of its ſituation
the air is temperate even in Summer time; Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

                  <p>We travelled from <hi>Radicofani</hi> to <hi>Viterbo</hi> 38 miles.<note place="margin">Sept. 4.</note>
About 10 miles from <hi>Radicofani</hi> we paſſed over a
ſmall River called at a place called
<hi>Ponte Argentino,</hi> which divides the State of the <hi>Gr.
Duke</hi> and of the <hi>Pope.</hi> It is to be noted that in all
this Countrey the Towns and Villages are generally
ſet upon the tops of hills, for coolneſs I ſuppoſe.
We obſerved alſo that the Countrey ſubject to the
Great Duke, at leaſt that part we travelled this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
was craggy and bare of trees, and ſeem'd to
us to be but dry parcht and barren land. But ſo ſoon
as we came into the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical State</hi> the world
was well amended; for the hills were for the moſt
part covered with trees, and the valleys very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Fourteen miles from <hi>Radicofani</hi> we paſſed <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendente</hi>
a large old Town,<note place="margin">Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendente.</note> 
                     <hi>ex re nomen habens,</hi> for

a little Town on the edge of the lake of <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinii</hi>
now called <hi>Bolſena,</hi> and rode along the brink of

that we took notice of there was 2 or 3 handſome
Fountains, and the monument of Pope <hi>John</hi> XXI in
the <hi>Domo.</hi> There are Sulphure-wells and hot ſprings

its breadth as much. The roof was vaulted in form
of a <hi>cupola,</hi> and all the light it received was by
a large round hole of 3 yards diameter juſt in

                  <p>This Temple was covered with copper-plates or
tiles, taken away by Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> VIII; whence
that Paſquinate, <hi>Quod non fecere barbari fecere Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berini.</hi>
He thereupon (as was thought) to ſilence and
appeaſe the clamour of the people, cauſed thereof to
be made the 4 famous wreathed pillars and Canopy
of the high Altar in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church. Of the very
nails [<hi>clavi trabales</hi>] which faſtned the tiles of the

it had an aſcent of 7 ſteps which encompaſſed it

Indeed a great part of old <hi>Rome</hi> lies buried under

not in books, that is, that the lintel and ſide-poſts of

the great door of this Church (which is of a huge

There are yet ſtanding part of 3 vaults or arches;
and the plant of the whole may eaſily be diſcerned.
The great ſtriate pillar ſet up before the Church of S.
<hi>Maria maggiore</hi> was taken hence, and was one of
eight which ſupported the nave or body of this

outer.</p>
                  <p>16. <hi>Templum Herculis Callaici,</hi> now <hi>Galluzzo.</hi> It
ſtands in the vineyards near <hi>S. Bibiana;</hi> a very tall
building of brick not exactly round but decagonal.
The roof of it is a vault or <hi>cupola</hi> not ſo great as
that of the <hi>Rotonda</hi> and yet not much leſs. It had
two doors diametrically oppoſite, and in the other
ſides were 8 niches for ſtatues.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>Templum Bacchi extra portam Piam,</hi> one mile
without the City walls: now the Church of S. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanza.</hi>
This alſo is a round ſtructure. The walls
are of brick and of a great thickneſs: within it hath
a leſſer round or concentrical circle of 12 large pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
There ſtands an ancient monument of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry
of the faſhion of a huge cheſt or trough, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:98511:188"/>
a ſtone to cover it. This is curiouſly engraven
with ſeveral figures of branches of trees, boys tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of grapes, of birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They call it the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> In ſeveral places of the roof are
to be ſeen very freſh the pictures of bunches of grapes
and ſeveral things belonging to the vintage. The
freſhneſs of the colours and rudeneſs of the figures
makes me doubt whether this was ancient <hi>Roman</hi>
painting or no.</p>
                  <p>18. <hi>Templum Solis.</hi> Of this there was lately a
piece ſtanding in the Garden of the <hi>Columnae</hi> upon
<hi>monte cavallo,</hi> called <hi>Frontiſpicium Neronis</hi> and <hi>Torre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
Nerone</hi> by the vulgar. It is now quite thrown
down; only there remain in the Garden vaſt marble
ſtones, the greateſt that ever I ſaw, and ſome of
them curiouſly carved which came from the top of
this building.</p>
                  <p>19. <hi>Templum Romuli &amp; Remi ſub monte Palatino,</hi>
now dedicated to S. <hi>Theodore.</hi> This is a round brick
building, into which you deſcend by many ſteps as

                  <p>Secondly, For <hi>Amphitheaters</hi> and <hi>Theaters</hi> there are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
yet remaining great ruines of the Amphitheater of
<hi>Titus</hi> now called the <hi>Coliſeo,</hi> round without, and of
an oval figure within; capable of 85000 men to ſit

of <hi>Statilius Taurus,</hi> near to the Church
of S. <hi>Croce in Gieruſalemme;</hi> and laſtly a good part
of the walls of the Theatre of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> upon which
the <hi>Savelli's</hi> Palace is built.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Of <hi>Circi</hi> there is 1. a good part of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of <hi>Antoninus Caracalla,</hi> a mile out of the City. 2. Of

Fourthly, For Baths there are great ruines of
thoſe of 1. <hi>Diocletian,</hi> wherein there were ſeats for
3200 perſons to bathe themſelves without ſeeing or
hindering one another; in the building of which he is
ſaid to have employed 40000 Chriſtians for 15 years
together. 2. <hi>Antoninus Caracalla,</hi> in which were
1600 ſeats or cloſets of poliſhed marble. Theſe were
thoſe <hi>Thermae in modum Provinciarum extructae.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
there are ſome ruines remaining of 3. The
<hi>Thermae</hi> of <hi>Titus.</hi> 4. Of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> near the <hi>Rotonda,</hi>
called <hi>Ciambella.</hi> 5. Of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> near S. <hi>Sylveſters.</hi>
6. Of <hi>Nero</hi> near the Church of S. <hi>Euſtachius.</hi> 7. Of
<hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> at the foot of <hi>Monte cavallo,</hi> called
<hi>Magnanapoli.</hi> Many others there were anciently of
which now ſcarce any foot-ſteps to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Of Aquaeducts the Author of <hi>Roma an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica
&amp; moderna</hi> mentions 4, of which ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
<hi>viz.</hi> that of 1. the <hi>Aqua Martia</hi> brought 37
miles, 2. the <hi>Aqua Claudia,</hi> brought 35. Upon the
gates called <hi>Porta di S. Lorenzo</hi> and <hi>Porta maggiore</hi>
there are ancient inſcriptions ſignifying what Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
reparied and built theſe Aquaeducts. 3. The
<hi>Appia,</hi> brought 8 miles. 4. The <hi>Aqua Virginis</hi>
brought alſo 8 miles, which was repaired by Pope
<hi>Nicholas</hi> V, and is yet made uſe of, being called
<hi>Fonte di Trivio.</hi> Of new Aquaeducts there are two
very ſtately ones built by late Popes, of which the
two following inſcriptions will give the Reader an

It ſeems to be but a ſmall piece of the top of an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk
broken off; it is engraven with hieroglyphics,

                  <p>7. That in the Garden of the <hi>Medici:</hi> it is full

been only the top of a broken one.</p>
                  <p>8. That in the Garden of the <hi>Mattei,</hi> given them

ſmall one, and broken in two pieces, whereof the
uppermoſt hath toward the top ſome hieroglyphics,
the lower piece hath none.</p>
                  <p>9. In the Court of the Palace of the Prince of
<hi>Paloeſtrina</hi> of the family of the <hi>Barberini</hi> lieth an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk
broken in 3 pieces, engraven with hieroglyphics,
which its like was longer.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Roma antica</hi> mentions another ſtanding at

the foot of the ſtairs in the Palace of the <hi>Vrſini</hi> in the
<hi>Campo di fiore:</hi> but this we ſaw not.</p>
                  <p>11. We were told of an obelisk lying in the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
Martius</hi> under a row of houſes, as big if not big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then any of thoſe already erected, and ſuppoſed
to continue intire and unbroken.</p>
                  <p>Theſe obelisks, all that are engraven with hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphics,
are of one and the ſame kind of ſtone, <hi>viz.</hi>
a marble of a mingled colour red and white, which
ſome call very hard, and which
hath not in ſo many ages ſuffered the leaſt by the
weather. As for the figure of them they are made
taper-wiſe, leſſening from the baſis to the <hi>vertex</hi> by
little and little, ſo that indeed they are not much
unlike a ſpit, from whence they took their name.
Yet are they not continued till they terminate in a
point; but when they are become too ſmall to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave
more hieroglyphics upon, the tops are cut into
the form of an obtuſe pyramid. It is ſaid, and I think
truly, that the hieroglyphics engraven upon theſe
obelisks are from the bottom to the top greater and
greater by degrees; ſo that the lowermoſt and the
reſt all along to the uppermoſt appear to the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

which ſtood in the <hi>Forum Romanum,</hi> as it

This pillar is marked toward the top with this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meral
letter I, of a great bigneſs, ſignifying one or

                  <p>This pillar is not conſiderable for its greatneſs but

It is 128 foot high beſide the baſe, which is of

urns, ancient lamps, rings, <hi>fibulae,</hi> and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements,
<hi>teſſerae hoſpitalitatis,</hi> weights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeveral
antiquaries there are in town, who have likewiſe
made collections of them; as <hi>Leonardus Auguſtinus</hi>
the then Popes Antiquary, and <hi>John Petro Bellori,</hi>
a very ingenious perſon and skilful in Antiquities,
who ſhew'd us a great number of theſe things and
very well conſerved. That worthy and ingenious
Gentleman Cavalier <hi>Carlo Antonio dal Pozzo</hi> ſhew'd
us ſome 20 volumes in folio, wherein were the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
of moſt of the Antiquities in and about <hi>Rome,</hi>
drawn exactly by the hand. In one of theſe were
all the veſſels and inſtruments uſed about ſacrificing.
In others of them we noted the <hi>Crepundia antiqua,</hi>
which were little images made of earth like children,
hares, apes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> found in urns. The <hi>Siſtrum</hi> of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier

ancient weights. Of theſe ancient weights we
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:98511:193"/>
ſaw in the <hi>muſeum</hi> of <hi>Leonardus Auguſtinus</hi> ſome
made of a dark red ſtone handſomely poliſhed, of
the figure of Holland cheeſes, and of ſeveral mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes,
marked on one ſide with the number of
ounces or pounds which they weighed. Of theſe
weights I have ſeen two in the Church of S. <hi>Maria in
Coſmedin,</hi> called <hi>Schola Graeca,</hi> and two in the
Church of <hi>S. Maria in Traſtevere</hi> of the bigneſs of
good large Holland cheeſes, which they have a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and have inſcribed on the wall where they
were hung up, that they were ſtones that the
heathens hung at the feet of Chriſtian Martyrs when
they ſuffered, to ſtretch and torment them. A medal
with the figure of a <hi>talus</hi> on one ſide and on the
other this inſcription, <hi>Qui ludit arrham det quod ſatis
ſit</hi> The ancient <hi>Fritillus</hi> or dice-box, like thoſe now
in uſe. The ancient <hi>Strigiles:</hi> A medal of that ſort
that was uſed to be hung about ſlaves necks, having
on the one ſide the figure of the wolf with <hi>Romulus</hi>
and <hi>Remus</hi> hanging at her paps; on the other in 3
concentrical circles theſe words, <hi>Tene me nè fugiam
&amp; revoca me in foro Trajani purpuretica ad Paſcaſium
Dominum meum.</hi> A drinking glaſs made like a <hi>Priapus,</hi>
which explains that of the Poet, <hi>Vitreo bibit ille Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apo.</hi>
The ancient timbrel, like thoſe we have ſeen
uſed now a days. It is made in faſhion of a ſieve, the
bottom of it on which they ſtrike, of vellum, the
rim of wood, having ſeveral long holes or crannies
in it, wherein are hung round pieces of braſs like
great medals upon their centers; beſides there is a
ſtring croſs the inſtrument hung full of bells.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> is a large City, but ſeemed to us not ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
as either <hi>Venice, Milan</hi> or <hi>Naples:</hi> they reckon
the number of inhabitants to be about 120000 ſouls
beſides ſtrangers, of which there are a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
always heer. The extent of the walls is greater
than of any City in <hi>Europe, viz.</hi> 13 miles; but they
take in a great deal of waſt ground. The City is now
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:98511:193"/>
crept down from the hills (upon which the chief of
it formerly ſtood) into a valley by the rivers ſide ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with hills. It is generally well built; many
of the ſtreets ſtraight and adorned with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſtately palaces ſcattered up and down all over
the town; full of Monaſteries and Churches, of
which they ſay of all ſorts there are above 300. It is
well ſerved with all proviſions for the belly: yet are
not things generally ſo cheap there as either at <hi>Naples</hi>
or <hi>Florence.</hi> Their beef (as I intimated before) is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good, not much inferiour to ours in <hi>England.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they kill their beaſts they put them in a great
heat and chafe, for the ſame reaſon I ſuppoſe that we
hunt Deer and bait Bulls in <hi>England, viz.</hi> to make
the fleſh eat more tender and ſhort, which yet ſpoils
the colour of the meat, and in ſome mens judgment
the taſte too, diſpoſing it to putrefaction. Their ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
veal, which they call <hi>vitella mungana,</hi> they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
all <hi>Europe</hi> cannot parallel for goodneſs and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.
Their kid or <hi>Caprette</hi> is alſo accounted very
good meat; and ſo is their Swines-fleſh. Their Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
is the leaſt commendable, as being for the moſt
part tough and dry. Tame fowl they have as good
and ſavory as in any place, <hi>v. g. Hens, Capons, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys,
tame Pigeons.</hi> Geeſe are ſeldom heer to be ſold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Plenty alſo there is of wild foul of the beſt ſorts, and
cheap enough, as Partridge of two kinds, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and red legg'd Partridge, Wood-cocks, Snipes,
Duck and Mallard, Wigeon, Teal, Gray, green and
baſtard Plover, Curlews, Quails. Of ſmall birds
the greateſt plenty that I have any where ſeen, as
Thruſhes in winter time an incredible number, Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds
ſtore, Larks infinite. One would think that in
a ſhort time they ſhould deſtroy all the birds of theſe
kinds in the Countrey. For beſides that you never
fail of great numbers of them in all the Poulterers
ſhops, there is every afternoon a market of ſmall
birds wherein they are ſold by the Countrey people.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:98511:194"/>
Beſides the forementioned there are ſometimes to be
ſold <hi>Cranes, wild Geeſe, Shell-drakes, Avoſettae, Water
Hens, Berganders</hi> and ſeveral other ſorts of wild fowl.
I have ſeen lying frequently in the Poulterers ſhops,
and therefore I preſume ſome people eat them, ſuch
Birds as in <hi>England</hi> no man touches, <hi>viz.</hi> Kites, Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards,
Spar-hawks, Keſtrels, Jayes, Magpies and
Wood-peckers. Nothing more commonly ſold and
eaten heer and in all <hi>Italy,</hi> than Coots and Stares.
They ſpare not the leaſt and moſt innocent birds,
which we account ſcarce worth the dreſſing, much

                  <p>No want of fiſh either of freſh or ſalt water,

brought a great way. Scarce any fiſh to be found
any where on the coaſt of <hi>Italy</hi> but ſome time or
other it may be met withal heer. Thoſe that are the
moſt frequent in the markets are, of River or Freſh-water
fiſh, Pike, Carp, Tench, Trout, Eel, Barble,
Chevin, Dace. I do not remember that I ever ſaw a
Perch to be ſold in <hi>Rome.</hi> Of Sea-fiſh, <hi>Mullus antiquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>

of the wines are ſweet and full-bodied, and will
bear half water. Sweet wines they call <hi>abboccati</hi> and
rough wines <hi>aſciuti.</hi> They have little wine ſo harſh
and rough upon the palate as our <hi>French</hi> Claret and

(ſome being in compaſs 3 or 4 miles) excel the
orchards, gardens and walks of any Prince in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom
that I have ſeen. Of theſe there are a great
number, but the chief of all are 1. The <hi>Villa Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſe,</hi>
of which family was Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. This is
eſteemed the beſt of all the <hi>villae</hi> and gardens about

of which family was Pope innocent X. This
is on the <hi>Janiculum</hi> without S. <hi>Pancras</hi>'s gate and is
ſaid to be 4 miles in compaſs. 3. The <hi>Villa Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſia</hi>
belonging to the Prince <hi>Ludoviſio;</hi> of which
family was <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. 4. The Popes garden at
the Vatican called <hi>Belvedere.</hi> 5. The Popes garden
at <hi>monte cavallo.</hi> 6. The garden of the Grand Duke
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:98511:195"/>
or the <hi>villa de Medici.</hi> 7. The garden of <hi>Montalto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
8. The garden of the <hi>Mattei.</hi> In all which there are
little palaces furniſhed and adorned with excellent
ſtatues, <hi>baſſi rilievi,</hi> pictures and other curioſities,
which I forbear to enumerate and deſcribe at large,
that I may not ſpend time, and waſte paper in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what few will think worth their while or pains
to read; and which hath already been publiſhed by
Mr. <hi>Laſſels</hi> in his <hi>voyage</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> to which I refer
the curious for further ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Of the palaces and public buildings I ſhall ſay
nothing, only I cannot forbear a word or two of S.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Church,</hi> which is in my opinion the moſt
ſtately, ſumptuous and magnificent ſtructure that
now doth, or perhaps ever did ſtand upon the face
of the earth. This was the only building that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
me and exceeded my expectation, being for
a work of man the moſt pleaſant and goodly, not to
ſay raviſhing object that ever I beheld. The whole
pile of that majeſtic bulk and greatneſs that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in all dimenſions the moſt famous Temples
mentioned by the ancients: being in length 520 foot
(as Mr. <hi>Laſſels</hi> tells us) and 385 in breadth: and in
ſome, the greateſt Chriſtian Churches; for though it
be not ſo long as S. <hi>Pauls London,</hi> yet is it much
broader, and in that reſpect much handſomer; the
breadth being more proportionate to the length.
The <hi>cupola</hi> of that marvellous highth and compaſs
(the diameter thereof be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng equal to that of the
<hi>Pantheon</hi>) and ſuſtaining on the top a huge ſtone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthorn,
with great pillars of ſtone about it, that
it may well be accounted the boldeſt piece of Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture
(as he ſaith) that I think the world hath ſeen.
The Roof arched or vaulted, and the vault divided
into great ſquares or panes like wainſcot after the
old <hi>Roman</hi> faſhion; the ribs and tranſverſe borders
which terminate thoſe ſquares or pannels being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled
and richly gilded, and the <hi>area</hi> of each ſquare
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:98511:196"/>
almoſt fill'd up with a gilt roſe. The oval Portico
encompaſſing a large <hi>area</hi> before the Church, conſist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of 4 rows of great ſtone pillars ſtanding ſo thick
that they ſhow like a grove of great trees: The
ſtately porch to which you aſcend out of this <hi>area</hi>
by 24 ſteps; not to mention the incruſtation of ſome
part of the walls with poliſhed marble; the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſtatues, ſtately Altars, rare pictures and other
ornaments, render this Church truly admirable,
and in all reſpects I will not ſay comparable to but
excelling the beſt in the world.</p>
                  <p>During our ſtay at <hi>Rome</hi> we rode forth to ſee 1.
<hi>Freſcati 12 Italian</hi> miles diſtant, anciently called
<hi>Tuſculum,</hi> where <hi>Cicero</hi> had a <hi>villa</hi> or Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
of which as yet they ſhew ſome remains.
Heer are at preſent 3 noted ville, 1. That of the
<hi>Borgheſi</hi> with the palace called <hi>Mondragone,</hi> and two
others. 2. The <hi>Villa Aldobrandina</hi> or <hi>Belvedere</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Prince <hi>Pamphylio.</hi> 3. The <hi>Villa Ludoviſia;</hi>
all of them for walks, groves, Labyrinths, gardens
and other ornaments not inferiour to the beſt about
<hi>Rome,</hi> and for caſcates or falls of water, wetting
ſports and other ingenious water-works, beyond
them. What we took more eſpecial notice of, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
not before ſeen, was the imitation of a tempeſt
or ſtorm of thunder and rain. This artificial thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
they call <hi>Girandola.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Tivoli,</hi> anciently <hi>Tibur,</hi> 18 Italian miles off
<hi>Rome.</hi> Of this City <hi>Horace</hi> was much enamoured,
praying that it might be the ſeat and retirement of
his old age. <hi>Tibur Argeo poſitum colono, Sit meae ſedes
utinam ſenectae, Sit modus laſſo maris &amp; viarum mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaeque.</hi>
It ſtands like <hi>Freſcati</hi> on the brow of a hill
and overlooks the Campagna of <hi>Rome.</hi> Heer are
ſome remains of ancient temples and other build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and a remarkable caſcate of the river <hi>Aniene</hi>
or <hi>Teverone.</hi> The villa of <hi>Eſte</hi> for gardens and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,
walks and groves, the <hi>Girandola</hi> and other
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:98511:196"/>
water works is nothing inferiour to thoſe at <hi>Freſcati.</hi>
About 5 miles diſtant from <hi>Tivoli</hi> we paſſed over the
Sulphur-river, the water whereof is warm, of a
blewiſh colour and noiſom ſmell, much like to that
of the Sulphur-well at <hi>Knareburgh</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> It
encruſts the channel it runs in with a whitiſh kind of
friable ſtone, which in many places in the bottom
and ſides of the channel congeals in the figure of
confects or ſugar-plums which they call <hi>Confetti de
Tivoli.</hi> Of theſe you have boxes full to be ſold at
<hi>Rome,</hi> ſo exactly reſembling confects both for fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
and colour that no man can diſtinguiſh them;
but they are not naturally found ſo figured, as they
would make ſtrangers believe, but artificially made
ſo by caſting in moulds. About <hi>Freſcati</hi> we found
great ſtore of <hi>Styrax arbor</hi> growing wild in the hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which we found no where elſe beyond the Seas.</p>
                  <p>The Campagna of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeems to be good land,
but is eſteemed a very bad air and unhealthful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
to live in, which is the reaſon it is ſo deſolate
and thin of inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>I had almoſt forgot one natural Phaenomenon we
obſerved at <hi>Rome,</hi> which did a little ſurpriſe us. In
ſharp <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>roſty weather in the middle of Winter, the
water which the ſervants brought up to waſh with
in the morning was hot to that exceſs that we did
verily believe they had heated it over the fire; nor
could we be perſwaded of the contrary till we went
down to the fountain, and found it there of equal
temper with what was brought up. It was formerly
taken for granted by the Peripatetic Schools, that
fountains of ſpringing water are hotter in cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or winter and colder in hot or ſummer than at
other times; the reaſon whereof they aſſigned to be
an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> ſatisfying themſelves with that,
and ſeeking no further. Later Philoſophers who
could not content themſelves with the notion of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiperiſtaſis,</hi>
choſe rather to deny the truth of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:98511:197"/>
and affirmed that fountain-water was not
really warmeſt in the coldeſt weather, or coldeſt in
the hotteſt, but only ſeemed ſo to our ſence; the
temper of which is much altered according to the
difference of the weather: So that what is much
colder than our temper in hot weather, is not much
colder in cold weather, and ſo ſeems not ſo cold,
and on the contrary. Or thus, We judging of the
heat and cold of other things by the proportion they
bear to the temper of the air about us, when the air
is very cold, though the water hath the ſame degree
of cold it had before, yet it may be hotter then the
air, and conſequently ſeem to us actually hot, and
<hi>vice verſa.</hi> But for my part whatever the reaſon be, I
muſt needs aſſert the truth of the experiment, being
very confident that the water, at leaſt of ſome ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
doth not only ſeem to be but really is much hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in cold froſty weather than at other times; elſe
this water could not poſſibly have ſeemed to us, as
it did, more than luke-warm.</p>
                  <p>Great ſtore of rain falls heer in winter time to
make amends for the extraordinary heat and
drought of the ſummer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> is a place not only well worth the ſeeing, but
very convenient to ſojourn in, there being where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to entertain and divert men of all ſorts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
and tempers.</p>
                  <p>The preſent <hi>Romans</hi> ſeemed to me in their houſes
and furniture, particularly their beds and lodging,
in their diet, in their manners and cuſtoms and in
their very pronunciation (ſo liquid, plain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct)
more to ſymbolize and agree with us <hi>English</hi>
then any other people of <hi>Italy,</hi> whether it were that
we learned of them or they of us or both mutually

                  <p>
                     <hi>January</hi> 24. 1664. We departed from <hi>Rome</hi> and
began our journey to <hi>Venice;</hi> riding along the <hi>Via
Flaminia,</hi> and paſſing the <hi>Tiber</hi> again by the <hi>Ponte
Molle</hi> or <hi>Pons Milvius.</hi> At 7 miles diſtance from <hi>Rome</hi>
we paſſed a ſmall village called <hi>Prima porta.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prima Parta.</note> Some
ſuppoſe that anciently the City extended thus far:
which conjecture I conceive is grounded upon the
name of this place. Eight miles further riding
brought us to a ſmall town called <hi>Caſtel novo,</hi> where
we lodged. All this afternoon we rode near the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
upon the <hi>Via Flaminia,</hi> which reaches as far as
<hi>Rimini.</hi> It is paved with broad flints, and pebbles,
and hath on each ſide a border of ſtone, and in that
border at every ſecond or third pace a ſtone ſtanding
up higher than the level of the border. We obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the fields we paſſed through this day great
ſtore of vernal <hi>crocuſes</hi> now in flower.</p>
                  <p>We proceeded on to <hi>Arignano</hi> or <hi>Ariano,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">25. Ariano.</note> a little
town and a poſt-ſtage 8 miles. Heer we left the <hi>Via
Flaminia,</hi> and rode round a high hill (which ſtands
ſingle,<note place="margin">Civita Castella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> and may be ſeen 20 miles forward) to <hi>Civita
Caſtellana</hi> a little town ſtanding on a hill and a poſt-ſtage,
9 miles. Not far from hence we had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of <hi>Caprarola</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Palace,<note place="margin">Capraro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note>
[where we were told is a whiſpering room like that
in the Palace of <hi>Te</hi> at-<hi>Mantua]</hi> which ſeemed not
to be more than two or three miles diſtant in a right
line, but we were aſſured that as the way lay it was
ten or twelve miles thither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="370" facs="tcp:98511:198"/>
Four miles further we came to a poor ſmall town
called <hi>Borgetto;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Borghetto</note> a little below which we paſſed the
<hi>Tiber</hi> by a bridge called <hi>Ponte Felice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ponte Felice.</note> begun by <hi>Sixtus</hi>
V and finiſhed by <hi>Vrban</hi> VIII, for the benefit of
Travellers and Pilgrims, as appears by an inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon it. Not far from the river on our right hand
we paſſed under a little town, ſtanding on the top
of a hill,<note place="margin">Maglia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</note> called <hi>Magliano,</hi> and rode on about 6
miles near the bank of the river, (having in proſpect
at a good diſtance on our left hand a town called
<hi>Horta)</hi> till we came to <hi>Vtricoli,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Horta.</note> which town at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſtands upon a hill,<note place="margin">Vtricoli.</note> but by the ruines that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
the ancient <hi>Ocricoli</hi> ſeems to have lain near
the river, at leaſt part of it.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Vtricoli</hi> we had ſtony way over the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
for five miles. For about a mile before we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>Narni</hi> we rode upon the brink of a horrid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice
by the river <hi>Nera's</hi> ſide.<note place="margin">Narni.</note> 
                     <hi>Narni</hi> anciently called
<hi>Nequinum,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Narnia</hi> from the river <hi>Nar</hi>
which runs beneath that ſteep rocky mountain upon
the ridge whereof this City ſtands, was formerly a
<hi>Roman</hi> colony and a place of ſome account, but is
now very mean, poor, and inconſiderable. <hi>Leander
Albertus</hi> ſaith it was ruined and left almoſt quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate
by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Souldiers who were quartered
there in the time that the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII in the Caſtle S. <hi>Angelo. Gatta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melata</hi>
the famous Captain for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to
whom they have erected a braſs ſtatue on horſeback
near S. <hi>Antonies</hi> Church in the City of <hi>Padua,</hi> was
native of this town. Near <hi>Narni</hi> are ſeen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of vaſt arches of ſtone, which ſome ſay
were of a bridge, others more probably of an Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
over the river from one mountain to another.</p>
                  <p>We rode from <hi>Narni</hi> over a pleaſant and fruitful
valley,<note place="margin">26.</note> encompaſſed with mountains, and cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after the manner of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> to <hi>Terni,</hi> anciently
<hi>Interamna</hi> from its ſituation, a handſome little City,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:98511:198"/>
having a pretty piazza, on which ſtands a Church
that ſeems to have been an ancient temple. About 4
miles from this town is that famous Caſcate or fall
of water from the lake <hi>di Pie di Luco.</hi> At the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of this valley beyond <hi>Terni</hi> and upon the
hills were the greateſt olive-yards or rather foreſts of
huge olive-trees that I have any where ſeen in <hi>Italy,</hi>
and at this time of the year we found the people ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
buſie in bruſhing down and gathering of olives.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Terni</hi> we had mountainous way to a little
place called <hi>Tritura,</hi> another Poſt-ſtage, and from
thence we deſcended to <hi>Spoleto,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Spoleto.</note> the chief town of
<hi>Vmbria</hi> thence called <hi>Ducato Spoletano.</hi> The walls
of this City are of a large extent, and the houſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
fair, and there are to be ſeen many ruines
of ancient buildings in it.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Spoleto</hi> we rode through a very pleaſant and
fruitfull valley of a great extent, ſurrounded with
mountains, much reſembling the <hi>Arena</hi> of an Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theater,
planted with rows of trees and vines after the
manner of <hi>Lombardy.</hi> The hills round about yield
a pleaſant proſpect, being ſprinkled every where
with little towns and houſes ſet thick upon them.
About 4 miles ſhort of <hi>Foligno</hi> we rode under an
indifferent great town, ſtanding on a round hill,
called <hi>Trevi.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Trevi.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foligno [Fulginium]</hi> is a pleaſant and handſome
little town,<note place="margin">Foligno.</note> noted for confections and ſweet-meats.
At the end of the valley of <hi>Spoleto</hi> beyond <hi>Fuligno</hi>
we obſerved the like woods of olive-trees as in the
valley of <hi>Terni.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Leaving <hi>Foligno</hi> we aſcended again in a way cut
out of the ſide of a mountain,<note place="margin">Jan. 27.</note> having on our left
hand a huge precipice, and below a valley between
very high and ſteep hills, into which at the upper
end falls down a little river called <hi>Dale,</hi> which drives
ſome paper-mills; a pleaſant place to behold. About
4 or 5 miles from <hi>Foligno</hi> we got up to the top of the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:98511:199"/>
                     <hi>Apponnine,</hi> where the mountains all about us were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with ſnow. On the top of theſe mountains is
a little plain, and upon it a ſmall lake or pool
of water, and a village called <hi>Col fiorito,</hi> a very
pleaſant place in Summer-time, as its name
imports. When we had paſſed over this plain we
began again to deſcend, and the next conſiderable
village we came to was <hi>Serravalle, ex re nomen habens,</hi>
it being ſituate in the jaws of a narrow valley, 14
miles diſtant from <hi>Foligno.</hi> From <hi>Serravalle</hi> we rode
among the mountains by the ſide of a little river,
paſſing ſeveral ſmall villages, <hi>viz. La Muccia</hi> or <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
and <hi>Pulverina,</hi> &amp;c. and lodged at <hi>Valcimarra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We rode through <hi>Tolentino</hi> a pretty little town,
having a handſome piazza,<note place="margin">28. Tolenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> diſtant 9 miles from <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimarra.</hi>
This was the Birth-place of <hi>Franciſcus Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelphus</hi>
a learned man, and a great Critic in the
<hi>Greek</hi> tongue. He it was that invented the word
<hi>ſtapes</hi> for a ſtirrop, which before had no name in
<hi>Latine.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</note> From <hi>Tolentino</hi> we had 10 miles to <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata,</hi>
a large, well-built and populous town, having
a handſome piazza. It is the Capital city of <hi>Marca
Anconitana,</hi> where the Cardinal-Legate or gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Province uſually reſides. From <hi>Maccrata</hi>
we rode to <hi>Loreto</hi> paſſing through <hi>Recanati,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Recana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</note> in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<hi>Ricinetum,</hi> a very pretty town, ſituate on the
ridge of a hill, and but 3 miles ſhort of <hi>Loreto.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Loreto</note> It
aroſe from the ruines of <hi>Helvia Ricina,</hi> deſtroyed by
the <hi>Goths.</hi> Heer we took notice of a table with a
braſs ſtatue of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>baſſo relievo</hi> upon it,
and an inſcription, giving thanks to her that ſhe was
pleaſed to fix her houſe in the territory of this City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Loreto</hi> ſtands likewiſe upon a hill, a pretty ſmall
place, conſiſting only of one little ſtreet within the
walls, and a Burgo or Suburb without likewiſe of
one ſtreet, as big as the City within. The Church
and College of the Canons ſtands at one end of the
ſtreet. Before the Church is a little piazza having a
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:98511:199"/>
cloyſter or Portico on one ſide where the Canons
lodgings are. In the midſt of this piazza is a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
fountain, and before the Church door a braſs
ſtatue of <hi>Sixtus</hi> V in a ſitting poſture, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
ſignifying that he had advanced <hi>Loreto</hi> to
the dignity of a city, giving it a Biſhop. The doors
of the Church are of braſs caſt and graven with
ſeveral hiſtories. The Church is built like our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals
in form of a Croſs, having a <hi>Cupola</hi> in the
middle, directly under which ſtands the <hi>Santa Caſa</hi>
or holy houſe (as they call it) encloſed in a caſe of
white <hi>Parian</hi> marble, curiouſly engraven with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
figures in b. r. repreſenting ſeveral hiſtories, by
the beſt ſculptors then living. The houſe it ſelf is
ſufficiently deſcribed in the hiſtory of it written by
<hi>Turſellinus.</hi> The walls (which are now only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the roof being removed) are made of a kind of
red ſtone (as they would have us believe) not only of
the colour but alſo of the figure of bricks, indeed
ſo like bricks that I can hardly perſwade my ſelf they
were any other. This kind of ſtone, they ſay, at
this preſent is found about <hi>Nazareth</hi> and no where
elſe, which if true is one of the beſt arguments they
have to prove that this houſe came from thence. That
the Reader may ſee what weak proofs and little
evidence they have of the miraculous tranſporation
of this houſe from <hi>Judea</hi> hither, I ſhall heer inſert
the whole Relation of it made by themſelves, which
is tranſlated into 13 ſeveral languages and hung up
in tables heer in the Church: and in <hi>Engliſh</hi> runs
thus,

                              <p>The Church of <hi>Loreto</hi> was a Chamber of the
B. Virgin nigh <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in which ſhe was born and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:98511:200"/>
bred, and ſaluted by the Angel, and therein concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and brought up her Son <hi>Jeſus</hi> to the age of 12
years. This chamber after the Aſcenſion of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
was by the Apoſtles conſecrated into a Church
in honour of the B. Lady: and S. <hi>Luke</hi> made a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
to her, likewiſe extant therein to be ſeen at
this very day. It was frequented with great devotion
by the people of the Countrey where it ſtood whilſt
they were Catholics. But when leaving the Faith of
Chriſt they followed the Sect of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
took it and carried it into <hi>Sclavonia</hi> and placed
it by a town called <hi>Flumen,</hi> where not being had in
due reverence, they again tranſported it over the
Sea to a wood in the territory of <hi>Recanati,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Noble woman called <hi>Loretta,</hi> from whence
it took the name of our Lady of <hi>Loreto;</hi> and thence
again they carried it, by reaſon of the many robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
committed, to a mountain of two brothers in
the ſaid territory: and from thence finally, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their diſagreement about the gifts and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
to the common high-way not far diſtant,
where it now remains without foundations, famous
for many ſigns, graces and miracles; whereat the
inhabitants of <hi>Recanati,</hi> who often came to ſee it,
much wondering, environed it with a ſtrong and
and thick wall, yet could no man tell whence it
came originally, till in the year 1296. the B. V. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in ſleep to a holy devout man, to whom ſhe
revealed it, and he divulged it to others of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in this Province, who determining forthwith to
try the truth of the viſion, reſolved to chuſe xvi
men of credit, who to that effect ſhould go all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to the City of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> as they did, carrying
with them the meaſures of this Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
therewith the foundatious remnant, they
found them wholly agreeable; and in a wall there
by engraven, that it ſtood there, and had left the
place. Which done they preſently returning back,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:98511:200"/>
publiſhed the premiſſes to be true: and from that
time forward it hath been certainly known, that this
Church was the Chamber of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> to
which Chriſtians began then, and have ever ſince had
great: devotion, for that in it daily ſhe hath done and
doth many and many miracles. One <hi>Frere Paul de
Sylva</hi> an Eremite of great ſanctity, who lived in a
cotage nigh unto this Church, whither daily he
went to Mattins, ſaid that for ten years ſpace on
the 8th. of <hi>September,</hi> two hours before day he ſaw
a light deſcend from heaven upon it, which he ſaid
was the B. V. who there ſhewed her ſelf on the Feaſt
of her Nativity. In confirmation of all which two
virtuous men of the city of <hi>Recanati</hi> divers times
declared unto the Prefect of <hi>Terreman</hi> and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the forementioned Church is followeth,
The one called <hi>Paul Renalduci</hi> avouched, that his
Grandfather ſaw when the Angels brought it over
the Sea, placed it in the forementioned wood, and
had often viſited it there: the other called <hi>Francis
Prior</hi> in like ſort affirmed, that his Grandfathers
Grandfather, being 120 years old, had alſo much
frequented it in the ſame place, and for further proof
that it had been there, he reported that his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
Grandfather had a houſe nigh unto it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

the Auguſtine Freres Church: And the braſs ſtatue
of Fortune which was adored, taken out thence,
now ſtanding in the palace. In this City is a Senate
of 70 Gentlemen changed every third or fourth year,
who out of their own number elect every two
months 2 Priors and a Gonfalonier, but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or Monſignor placed heer by the Pope is the
<hi>Dominus fac totum. Malateſta</hi> tyrant of <hi>Rimini</hi> (as
they call him) ſeized alſo upon this place, but was
driven out by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> II, aſſiſted by the Duke of
<hi>Vrbin, Carignano</hi> of <hi>Ancona</hi> and one <hi>Caſſaro.</hi> Theſe
two Gentlemen had each of them a ladder for his
arms, the one red, and the other white. The city
out of gratitude took theſe two ladders for their
Arms, leaving their former, which was a gate or
Arch with this motto under it, <hi>In hac porta ſtat hîc

We ſaw this town only <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> but it merited a
little demurr. From hence we croſſed the Countrey
to a village called <hi>Catolica</hi> 10 miles. We left <hi>Gradara</hi>
on our left hand but came not in ſight of it. From
<hi>Catolica</hi> we rode along the Sea-ſhore for the moſt

                     <hi>Rimini</hi> is a pretty

Puppet or man of ſtraw, <hi>Bamboccio</hi> they call it.</p>
                  <p>We made a digreſſion to S. <hi>Marino,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. S. Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</note> a little
town ſtanding on the top of a very high hill, ſome
10 miles or more diſtant from <hi>Rimini.</hi> This place
hath maintained it ſelf in the condition of a free
State or Commonwealth, as the Inhabitants boaſt,
for above 1000 years, but its well if half ſo long.
The territory of this Republic is but one mountain
about 3 miles in length, and ſome 9 or ten miles
round. In this ſmall territory they have 4 <hi>Caſtelli</hi> or
villages, <hi>viz. Serravalle, Fietano, Monte Giardino,</hi> and
<hi>Fiorentino:</hi> 8 corn mills upon the little river <hi>Canova,</hi>
which bounds this territory towards the North, and
a powder-mills: the number of ſouls is about 4000
or 5000, of Souldiers or fighting men 1500. The
Arms of this Republic are 3 towers upon a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and under it this Motto, <hi>Libertas perpetua.</hi>

The <hi>Borgho</hi> of S. <hi>Marin</hi> ſtands at the foot of the hill
upon which the town is built, and is like ſome of
our <hi>North-Wales</hi> towns. In this <hi>Borgh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> weekly on
Wedneſdays is held a market, where are bought and
ſold a great number of Swine, eſpecially in Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
time, 3, 4, or 5 thouſand on a market-day. The
reaſon of this great concourſe to buy and ſell heer is
becauſe they pay ſo little toll, <hi>viz.</hi> about ſix pence for
a drove be they more or leſs. From the <hi>Borgho</hi> up to
the town are two aſcents, the one more eaſie and
winding about to the furthermoſt gate, by which
coaches may make a ſhift to get up, the other ſteep
to the nearer gate. On one ſide the town is walled
about, on the other ſide it needs it not, for it ſtands
on the brow of a precipitious rock of a very great
height, whereon they have placed 3 towers in a row.
On the ſide where the wall goes the hill is very ſteep
and almoſt impoſſible to climb but by the made ways.
There is no hill near it that can any way offend it,
and thoſe that are next far lower than that whereon
the town is built. The ſtreets of the town are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and the houſes but mean. Heer live about 60
Jews. Two cloyſters they have within the walls,
one of diſcalceate <hi>Franciſcans</hi> or <hi>Succolanti,</hi> the
other of Nuns of the Order of <hi>Santa Clara;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the walls in the <hi>Borgho</hi> is a Monaſtery of <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi>
and about a mile from the town a fair Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of the <hi>Servitae.</hi> They have 25 ſmall pieces or
Drakes and 2 Culverines. This place is a Biſhops
Sea and the Biſhop of it is Biſhop alſo of <hi>S. Leo,
Monte Feltre,</hi> and <hi>La Penna.</hi> This Republic is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
by the territory of the Pope; they ſtamp
no money; they have neither friendſhip nor enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with any of the States or Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> and
in the ſeveral wars of <hi>Italy</hi> they have enjoyed peace.
On occaſion they ſend Embaſſadours to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Princes and States. At <hi>Rome</hi> they have their
Protector, who at preſent is Cardinal <hi>Carlo Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi>
                     <pb n="381" facs="tcp:98511:203"/>
to whom they ſometimes ſend preſents, <hi>viz.</hi>
100 little Cheeſes or a Butt of <hi>Muſcatella.</hi> They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
no Superior under God, but have abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
power in civil and criminal cauſes. If a perſon
baniſhed from other places retires hither, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timet
give him protection, but it is done by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
vote of the Council. If one man kill another,
though in his own defence, he is ſentenced by the
Commiſſary or Judge to pay 100 <hi>Scudi,</hi> but he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning
the Council, they uſually bring it down to
25. If one murthers another and flies, he is baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for ever and all his goods confiſcate. This Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
maintains a Phyſician and a Surgeon at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
charge. The Muſcatella's of this place are much
eſteemed, and the Gentry heerabout in Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
come ordinarily hither to drink them, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the <hi>freſco.</hi> Cows they have none, but ſheep and

the Duke of <hi>Vrbin.</hi> They have 4 great Fairs every
year, the chiefeſt of all is on S. <hi>Bartholomew's</hi> day,
at which time there is a general muſter of all their
Forces. At theſe Fairs there is great abundance of
young cattel ſold. Many veals driven as far as <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>

                  <p>The Government of S. <hi>Marino</hi> is by a Council of

Gentlemen in this State) 15 Artiſans or tradeſmen
and 15 farmers or count reymen. They continue for
their lives, and when one dies another is choſen by
two third parts of the votes, when a Gentleman a

When the old Captains go out of office they nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
12; the names of theſe are written in 6 ſcrolls
of Paper, <hi>viz.</hi> two names in a ſcroll. Theſe ſcrolls
are put into a hat or box, and a boy puts in his
hand and draws out 3. Theſe 3 the elder Captain
takes and carries to the Church of the Sacrament,
and <hi>Te Deum</hi> being ſung, a Prieſt puts the 3 ſcrolls
into a hat, and a young child puts in his hand and
draws out one, and they whoſe names are therein
written are <hi>Capitanei</hi> for the next 6 months. Theſe
<hi>Capitanei</hi> cannot be eleced again for two years fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
Beſides, the Great Council elect out of
themſelves by major vote a leſſer Council of 12, <hi>viz.</hi>
4 out of each order. And to this Council civil and
criminal cauſes and quarrels of right and wrong are
referred. This Commonwealth hath a Commiſſary
or Judge, who muſt be a Doctor of Law, and always
a foreigner. He is elected by the Council and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
18 months. His ſtipend is ten crowns the
month. His ſentence is confirmed, or may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
or mitigated by the Council. The Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
is elected in like manner. He is a notary and his
allowance is 60 ſcudi or crowns <hi>per annum.</hi> They
have alſo a Captain of the <hi>Militia,</hi> who continues
in office as long as the Council pleaſes. But enough
and more then needs will moſt Readers think of this
petty Commonwealth; concerning which I ſhould
not have been ſo large, but that no body that I know
of before me hath made any particular deſcription
of its State and Government, as accounting it not
worth their while to enquire into it, or their pains
to ſet it down.</p>
                  <p>We travelled from <hi>Rimini</hi> to <hi>Ravenna.</hi> 3. We paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                  <p>We obſerved in this journey from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi>
a great difference between the temperature of the
air on this ſide and on the other ſide the <hi>Appennine</hi>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:98511:206"/>
mountains, on the other ſide it being very tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and warm, but on this ſide as cold and raw as
it is at any time in winter with us, or indeed can
well be in open weather; and that this cold did not
proceed from a general change of weather ſince our
coming on this ſide we are well aſſured; for we heard
of no ſuch change, and we found ſnow lying heer in
the low grounds in many places, which on the other
ſide was all melted and gone even upon the hills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our coming over. The reaſon of this is obvious,
becauſe this ridge of hills being higher than the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
region of the air, or place where the Sun-beams
are reflected, hinders the commixture of the warm
Southerly and Weſtern air with the cold Northerly
and Eaſtern, but eſpecially ſtopping on one hand
the South and Weſt winds which elſe would drive
the temperate air and tepid vapours into theſe parts;
and on the other hand the cold Northern and Eaſtern
blaſts, which elſe would temper and much abate the
warmth of thoſe beyond the mountains. Hence I do
not think incredible nor much wonder at what is
related by ſome Travellers of a mountain in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
on the one ſide whereof it is Summer when
on the other it is Winter.</p>
                  <p>We left <hi>Ravenna</hi> and rode along the bank of the

very ill breeding to interrupt any man in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
as hating to be interrupted themſelves. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the manner of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> who
make no ſcruple of interrupting one another, and
ſometimes talk all together. As careful are they, not
to whiſper privately one to another when in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or to talk in an unknown language which all the
company underſtands not. They do alſo ſhew their
civility to ſtrangers in not ſo much as asking them
what Religion they are of, avoiding all unneceſſary
diſputes about that ſubject, which are apt to engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
quarrels: which thing we could not but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, becauſe in <hi>France</hi> you ſhall ſearce exchange
three words with any man, before he ask you that
queſtion.</p>
                     <p>It is not eaſie for a ſtranger to get acquaintance and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:98511:210"/>
familiarity with the <hi>Italians,</hi> they not much delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to converſe with ſtrangers, as not knowing their
humours and cuſtoms. Yet is their converſation when
gotten pleaſant and agreeable, their diſcourſe profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and carriage obliging.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of them, even of the ordinary ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
will diſcourſe intelligently about Politic affairs
and the government and intereſt of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
being much addicted to and delighted in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic
ſtudies and diſcourſes.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of them are very covetous of liberty, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuch Cities as have been formerly Common-wealths,
diſcourſes or treatiſes of that ſubject ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
deep impreſſions on their minds: So that in
ſome places not only books but alſo diſcourſes about
former revolutions are prohibited. <hi>Barclay</hi> alſo ſaith,
that they are <hi>glorioſae libertatis cupidi, cujus adhuc
imaginem vident.</hi> Hence the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> build
ſtore of Caſtles and cittadels in their territories, not
ſo much to defend themſelves againſt their enemies
as to bridle their Subjects, and ſecure themſelves
againſt tumults and inſurrections. A ſtrange thing
it is, that of all the people of <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi>
who never taſted the ſweetneſs of liberty, nor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their condition by their commotions, but always
(as we ſay) <hi>leapt out of the frying-pan into the fire,</hi> ſhould be the moſt tumultuous and given to rebel
againſt their Princes. <hi>Leti</hi> tells us of one of thoſe
petty ſubordinate Princes in this Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>
called <hi>Thomaſo Ferrari,</hi> who governed his ſubjects
not like vaſſals, but with that ſweetneſs and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs,
as if they had been his own children; yet
ſome of theſe fellows taking arms come into their
Princes preſence, and ſay to him, <hi>Sir Prince, we are
come to drive you out of your Palace and burn all your
moveables. Why</hi> (anſwers the Prince) <hi>can you find
fault with my government? Are you aggrieved in any
thing and it ſhall be redreſſed: No</hi> (replied they)
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:98511:210"/>
                        <hi>but becauſe we underſtand that many of our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have revolted from their Lords, we alſo to ſhew that
we love revolutions, are reſolved to rebel againſt you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> are greatly delighted in Pictures,
ſtatues and muſic from the higheſt to the loweſt of
them, and ſo intemperately fond of theſe things
that they will give any rate for a choice picture or
ſtatue. Though all of them cannot paint or play on
the muſic, yet do they all affect skill and judgment
in both: And this knowledge is enough to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
a man a <hi>virtuoſo.</hi> Many of them are alſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in collecting ancient coyns and medals.</p>
                     <p>They are great admirers of their own language,
and ſo wholly given to cultivate, poliſh and enrich
that, that they do in a great meaſure neglect the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
few of them now adays ſpeaking or writing
well therein; but mingling ſo many <hi>Italian</hi> idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms
with it, that you have much ado to underſtand
what they ſpeak or write. As for the <hi>Greek,</hi> few or
none have any tolerable skill in it, the ſtudy thereof
being generally neglected and laid aſide.</p>
                     <p>They are very temperate in their diet, eating a
great deal of ſallet and but little fleſh. Their wine they
drink well diluted with water, and ſeldom to any
exceſs. We ſaw only one <hi>Italian</hi> drunk by the ſpace
of a year and half that we ſojourned in <hi>Italy.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be that in hot Countreys men have not ſo
good ſtomachs as in cold; or whether meat as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
better concocted nouriſhes more there; or that
the <hi>Italians</hi> are out of principle, temper or cuſtom
more ſober and temperate than other nations. Their
herbs ſeemed to me more ſavory and better concocted
than ours. Their water alſo was not ſo crude. But for
fleſh ours in my judgment much excels theirs, being
much more ſucculent and ſapid. Yet in <hi>Rome</hi> have I
eaten beef not inferiour to ours: but I ſuppoſe it might
be of <hi>German</hi> oxen; of which (as we were informed)
there are many driven thither: and for ſucking veal
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:98511:211"/>
the <hi>Romans</hi> (as we have already noted) think theirs
preferrable to any in the world.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italians,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of inferiour quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are in all things very ſparing and frugal: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be becauſe they are ſo educated and accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or becauſe the gabels and taxes which they pay
to their governours are ſo great that they cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
to ſpend much on themſelves; or becauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
loving their caſe they had rather live nearly
then take much pains.</p>
                     <p>The Nobility and great perſons chuſe rather to
ſpend their revenues in building fair palaces and
adorning them with Pictures and ſtatues, in making
ſtately and ſpacious orachards, gardens and walks, in
keeping coaches and horſes and a great retinue of
ſervants and ſtaffiers, than in keeping great houſes
and plentiful tables; giving board-wages to their
ſervants and attendants, which in my opinion is the
better way of ſpending eſtates, theſe things finding
poor people employment, ſo that the money comes
to be diſtributed among them according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry;
whereas the other way maintains in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſuch perſons for the moſt part as leaſt deſerve
relief: thoſe that are modeſt and deſerving chuſing
rather (if poſſibly they can) to maintain themſelves
and their families by the labour of their hands, than
hang about great houſes for a meals meat. Beſides
that great houſe-keeping is very often, not to ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
the occaſion of great diſorder and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Were I therefore Gods ſteward for a great
eſtate (for ſuch all rich men are or ought to be) I
ſhould think it more charity to employ poor people
and give them mony for their work, than to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
my eſtate among them freely and ſuffer them to
live in idleneſs, I mean ſuch as are able to labour.</p>
                     <p>The inferiour Gentry affect to appear in public
with as much ſplendour as they can, and will deny
themſelves many ſatisfactions at home that they may
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:98511:211"/>
be able to keep a coach, and therein make the <hi>tour
à la mode</hi> about the ſtreets of their City every even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> when they call, ſpeak to, or of one
another, uſe only the Chriſtian name, as <hi>Signor
Giacomo, Signor Giovanni,</hi> &amp;c. unleſs it be for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
ſake, ſo that you may converſe among them
perchance ſome months before you hear any mans
ſurname mentioned.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> Gentry live for the moſt part in the
Cities, whence it is that the Cities are ſo ſplendid
and well built, ſo populous and rich; and the
Countrey ſo poor and thinly inhabited. Yet are the
Noblemens Palaces rather great and ſtately, than
commodious for habitation. In many Cities the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
windows (which are for the moſt part tatter'd
and broken) diſgrace the buildings, being unſuitable
to their magnificence.</p>
                     <p>The houſes are generally built of ſtone, thick
walled and high rooft, which makes them warm in
Winter and cool in Summer: but they contrive
them rather for coolneſs than warmth, and therefore
make the windows large to give them air enough.</p>
                     <p>Of the Gentry in <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Venice,</hi> if
there be many brothers of one houſe only one uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
marries, and that the eldeſt if he pleaſes; if he
be not diſpoſed then any other, as they can agree
among themſelves. The reſt do what they can to
greaten him that is married, to uphold the Family.
The brothers that marry not keep concubines or
whores; which though it be ſin, yet their Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
can eaſily abſolve them of it.</p>
                     <p>In moſt of the Cities and Towns of <hi>Italy</hi> there
are <hi>Academies</hi> or Societies of <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> who have at
ſet times their meetings and exerciſes, which are
for the moſt part proluſions of wit and <hi>Rhetoric,</hi> or
diſcourſes about moral ſubjects, curious queſtions
and Problems, or Paradoxes, ſometimes extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:98511:212"/>
ſometimes premeditated. Theſe have their
head whom they call Prince, and a certain number
of Academiſts, who are choſen by balloting, but
they ſeldom refuſe any that offer themſelves to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Many of theſe Academies aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
conceited or fanciful names, and take a ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>impreſe</hi> or coat of arms; as for example the
<hi>Academiſts</hi> of <hi>Bergamo</hi> call themſelves <hi>Eccitati,</hi> and
their impreſe is the picture of the morning. In <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi>
the Academiſts called <hi>Acceſi</hi> have taken for their
Emblem a Looking-glaſs reflecting the Sun-beams;
thoſe called <hi>Timidi</hi> a hare. As for the other Cities
of <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> there are 3 <hi>Academies,</hi> the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriſti,</hi>
the <hi>Lyncei</hi> and the <hi>Fantaſtici:</hi> in <hi>Padua 3,</hi>
the <hi>Ricoverati, Infiammati</hi> and <hi>Incogniti:</hi> in <hi>Bologna 3,
Ardenti, Indomiti,</hi> and one innominate: in <hi>Venice 2,
Diſcordanti</hi> and <hi>Guſſoni:</hi> in <hi>Naples 2, Ardenti</hi> and

                     </p>
                     <p>Moſt of the <hi>Italians</hi> of any faſhion wear black or
dark coloured cloths, and for the faſhion of them
follow the <hi>French</hi> (but not too haſtily) excepting
thoſe Countries which are ſubject to the King of
<hi>Spain;</hi> which uſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> habit.</p>
                     <p>As for their vices, they are chiefly taxed for three.</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Revenge;</hi> they thinking it an ignoble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
thing to put up or paſs by any injury or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front.
Many times alſo they diſſemble or conceal
their diſpleaſure and hatred under a pretence of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:98511:212"/>
friendſhip, that they may more eaſily revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of whom they hate by poiſoning, aſſaſſinating
or any other way; for nothing will ſatisfie them
but the death of thoſe who have injured them: and
there be <hi>Bravo's</hi> and cut-throats ready to murther
any man for a ſmall piece of mony. Beſides, which
is worſt of all, they are implacable, and by no means
to be truſted when they ſay they pardon. Hence they
have a Proverb among them, <hi>Amicitie reconciliate &amp;
meneſtre riſcaldate non furono mai grate.</hi> The women
alſo provoke their children to revenge the death of
their fathers by ſhewing them the weapons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they were murthered, or cloths dipt in their
blood or the like, by which means feuds between
families are maintained and entail'd from generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to generation. Theſe are the qualities for which
we uſually ſay, An <hi>Engliſh</hi> man <hi>Italianate</hi> is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
incarnate.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Luſt,</hi> to which the inhabitants of hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
are by the temper of their bodies inclined.
Hence it is that all Cities and great Towns do ſo
ſwarm with Courtezans and Harlots; and to avoid
worſe evils the State is neceſſitated to give them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
toleration and protection. As for maſculine
venery and other works of darkneſs, I shall not charge
the <hi>Italians</hi> with them, as not having ſufficient
ground ſo to do; and becauſe (as <hi>Barclay</hi> ſaith) <hi>Haec
ſcelera tenebris damnata &amp; negari faciliùs à conſciis
poſſunt, &amp; ab aemulis fingi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> which ſtrangely poſſeſſes this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
ſo that for every little ſuſpicion they will ſhut
up their wives in a chamber, and carry the key with
them, not ſuffering them to ſtir abroad unleſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
accompany them. To ſalute an <hi>Italians</hi> wife
with a kiſs is a ſtabbing matter; and to call a man
<hi>cornuto</hi> or Cuckold in good earneſt is the greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
or diſgrace you can put upon him. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
women in <hi>Italy</hi> by this means have but bad
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:98511:213"/>
lives, being for the moſt part confined to their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
except when they go to Church, and then they
have an old woman attending them: the doors of
their houſes ſhut up at dinner and ſupper; all viſits
and familiar diſcourſes with men denied them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can they ſpeak or ſmile without ſuſpicion: one
reaſon of this among others may be, becauſe the
husbands knowing themſelves to be ſo diſhoneſt and
falſe to their wives, they preſume that had they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
they would not be more true to them.
And yet for all this guarding and circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are not the <hi>Italian</hi> Dames more uncorrupt than
the matrons of other Nations, but find means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their husbands, and be diſhoneſt in ſpight of
jealouſie.</p>
                     <p>To theſe I might add <hi>Swearing,</hi> which is ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
among all ſorts, the Prieſts and Monks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſcarce abſtaining from oaths, that I believe
they account it no ſin.</p>
                     <p>It is a general cuſtom all over <hi>Italy</hi> to ſleep an
hour or two after dinner in Summer time; ſo that
from two of the clock till four in the afternoon you
ſhall ſcarce ſee any body ſtirring about the ſtreets of
the Cities. Indeed if one ſits ſtill it is very hard to
keep his eyes open at that time. Either this cuſtom
did not prevail when the School of <hi>Salerno</hi> wrote
their Phyſic precepts, or that direction, <hi>Sit brevis
ant nullus tibi ſomnus meridianus,</hi> was calculated for
<hi>England,</hi> to whoſe King that Book was dedicated.
And yet the <hi>Italian</hi> Phyſicians ſtill adviſe people ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not to ſleep at all after dinner, or if they muſt
ſleep, to ſtrip off their cloths and go to bed, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to take a nod in a chair ſitting.</p>
                     <p>In many Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> are Hoſpitals where Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
and poor travellers are entertained, and have
their diet and lodging for three days (if they have
reaſon to ſtay ſo long) <hi>gratis,</hi> beſides a piece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
when they go away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="401" facs="tcp:98511:213"/>
There are alſo Hoſpitals to receive expoſed chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
if I may ſo term them; that is, any without
exception that ſhall be brought and put in at a grate
on purpoſe, whither upon ringing of a bell an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
comes preſently and receives the child, and
asking the party that brought it, whether it hath
been baptized? carries it to a nurſe to give it ſuck;
and there it is maintained till it be grown up. The
place where it is put in is ſo ſtrait as to admit only
children new born or very young. This I look upon
as a good inſtitution in great Cities, taking away
from women the temptation of murthering their
new-born children, or deſtroying their conceptions
in the womb, to hide their ſhame. I know what
may be objected againſt it, <hi>viz.</hi> that it emboldens
them to play the wantons, having ſo fair a way of
concealing it: <hi>Sed ex malis minimum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Rome, Venice</hi> and ſome other Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> they
have a way of exerciſing charity little uſed among
us. Several Confraternities of well-diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
raiſe ſums of mony by a free contribution
among themſelves, which they beſtow yearly in
portions for the marrying of poor maids, which elſe
might want husbands, and be tempted to diſhoneſt
practiſes to maintain themſelves. This I look upon
as well-plac'd alms and worthy the imitation; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very convenient and in a manner neceſſary, that
new-married people ſhould have ſomewhat to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
their houſes and begin the world with; and no
leſs fitting, that young perſons ſhould be encouraged
to marry, as well for multiplying of people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ſtrength of the Commonwealth chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
as for the preventing thoſe evils to which
young and ſingle perſons are ſtrongly tempted and
inclined.</p>
                     <p>It is troubleſome thing to travel with fire-arms
in <hi>Italy,</hi> you being forc'd in moſt Cities to leave
them at the gate with the Guard, who give you a
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:98511:214"/>
tally or token; and when you Leave the City you
bring your tally and receive your arms. This is done
to prevent aſſaults and murthers, which are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in many Cities of <hi>Italy.</hi> For this the G. <hi>Duke</hi>
of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> is much to be commended, there being
no ſuch muthers and outrages committed in any
of the Cities under his dominion as in other places:
ſo diliegent is he in ſearching out, and ſevere in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
<hi>Bravo's,</hi> Cut-throats, Aſſaſſins and ſuch kind
of malefactors. As much might be ſaid for the <hi>Pope</hi>
in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> but in other Cities in his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
there is killing enough.</p>
                     <p>When you depart from any City you muſt be ſure
to take a <hi>bill</hi> of <hi>health</hi> out of the Office that is kept
every where for that purpoſe: without which you
can hardly get to be admitted into another City, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if it be in the Territory of another Prince
or State. If any one comes from an infected or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
place he is forced to keep his <hi>Quarantain</hi> (as
they call it) that is, be ſhut up in the <hi>Lazaretto</hi> or
Peſt-houſe 40 days before he be permitted to come
into the City. So ſcrupulouſly careful are they to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Contagion.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> we have often
obſerved many labourers that wanted work ſtanding
in the market places to be hired; whither people
that want help uſually go and bargain with them.
Which cuſtom illuſtrates that Parable of our <hi>Saviour</hi>
recorded in the beginning of the 20th. Chapter of
S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel, wherein the houſholder is ſaid
<hi>to go out about the third hour, and ſee others ſtanding
in the market-place,</hi> ver. 3. and in <hi>ver.</hi> 6. he is ſaid <hi>to
find others about the eleventh hour,</hi> and to ſay to them,
<hi>why ſtand ye heer all the day idle;</hi> and <hi>ver. 7.</hi> they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<hi>becauſe no man hath hired us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> and other hot Countreys ſo ſoon as they
have cut down their corn they threſh and winnow
it uſually, or at leaſt a great part of it, on a floor
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:98511:214"/>
made in the open air, before they bring it into the
houſe. Hence in the Scripture we read of threſhing
floors as open places without roof or cover. Such I
ſuppoſe was that where <hi>Boaz</hi> winnowed barley,
<hi>Ruth 3. 3.</hi> Neither is it any wonder that he ſhould
lie there all night: for at <hi>Aleppo</hi> and even in <hi>Malta</hi>
in Summer time they ſet their beds upon the roofs of
their houſes, and ſleep <hi>ſub Dio,</hi> in the open air.</p>
                     <p>One cuſtom we have in <hi>England,</hi> which (as far as
I could obſerve) is no where uſed beyond the Seas,
and that is for children to beg their Parents and
Godfathers bleſſing upon the knee.</p>
                     <p>One cuſtom which prevails generally in foreign
Countreys is but little uſed in <hi>England,</hi> that is to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
thoſe that ſneez by vailing the bonnet, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God to bleſs, aſſiſt or defend them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a kind of ſport or game much uſed this
day by the <hi>Italians,</hi> called <hi>Gioco di mora,</hi> which
ſeems to have been uſed by the ancients and called
<hi>micare digitis.</hi> It is for the moſt part between two,
who put out juſt at the ſame time each of them as
many fingers as they pleaſe and alſo name each of
them what number he thinks fit, and if either of

                     <p>1. IN <hi>Lombardy</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy, Tartufale</hi>
(as they call them) i. e. <hi>Tubera Terrae,</hi> a kind of
ſubterraneous Muſhrome, which our Herbariſts
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:98511:215"/>
                        <hi>Engliſh Trubs,</hi> or after the <hi>French</hi> name <hi>Trufles,</hi> are
accounted a choice diſh, held by naturaliſts to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive
of luſt. The beſt of all are gotten in <hi>Sicily,</hi>
and thence ſent over into <hi>Malta,</hi> where they are ſold
dear. The way to get them is to turn ſwine into a
field where they grow, who find them by the ſmell,
and root them up out of the ground, and ſet one to
follow the ſwine, and gather them up.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Snails</hi> boil'd and ſerved up with oyl and pepper
put into their ſhells are alſo accounted a good diſh: I
am ſure they are ſold dear at <hi>Venice</hi> and elſewhere, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the great whitiſh or aſh-coloured. ſhell-ſnails,
which we had not then ſeen in <hi>England,</hi> but have
ſince found plentifully upon the Downs near <hi>Darking</hi>
in <hi>Surrey,</hi> whither (as we were informed by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<hi>Charles Howard</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr>) they were brought
from beyond Seas by.
Mr. <hi>Martin Liſter</hi> hath found them on the banks of
that hollow lane, leading from <hi>Puckeridge</hi> to <hi>Ware.</hi>
Theſe ſnails before winter ſtop up the mouth or
aperture of their ſhells with a thick hard white paſte
like a good lute or plaiſter, and are kept all Winter
in barrels or other veſſels, and ſold by the Poulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
The firſt place where we met them to be ſold in
the market was <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> where they imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the <hi>Italians</hi> as well in their diet as in the manner
of their buildings.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Frogs</hi> are another <hi>Italian</hi> viand which we in
<hi>England</hi> eat not. Theſe they uſually fry and ſerve up
with oil. At <hi>Venice</hi> they eat only the loins and hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legs,
as alſo at <hi>Florence,</hi> and that upon fiſh-days. In
ſome places of <hi>Lombardy</hi> they eat their whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and beſides their frogs are of a larger ſize than
ordinary. Their fleſh ſhews white and lovely as they
lie in the markets skin'd and ready prepared to be
fried. Howbeit even there in <hi>Italy, Kircher</hi> in his
book <hi>de Peſte</hi> condemns them as an ambiguous and
dangerous meat, and I think deſervedly; wherefore
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:98511:215"/>
we do well having plenty of better food, wholly to
abſtain from them.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Land Tortoiſes</hi> are accounted with them a better
meat than Sea-tortoiſes, and are commonly to be
ſold in the markets. They are eaten by thoſe Orders
of Freres whoſe rule obliges them to abſtain from
fleſh, as <hi>Carthuſians, Carmelites,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>5. They eat alſo many ſorts of <hi>Shell-fiſh,</hi> which
we either have not or meddle not with, as Purples,
Periwinkles of ſeveral ſorts, <hi>Patellae</hi> or Limpets,
Sea-urchins, which laſt are to be found every day in
the markets at <hi>Naples.</hi> They alſo eat the Sea-tortoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
of which the blood put into the ſtomach and
boil'd is the beſt part.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Paſte</hi> made into ſtrings like pack-thread or
thongs of whit-leather (which if greater they call
<hi>Macaroni,</hi> if leſſer <hi>Vermicelli</hi>) they cut in pieces and
put in their pots as we do oat-meal to make their
<hi>meneſtra</hi> or broth of, much eſteemed by the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people.
Theſe boil'd and oil'd with a little cheeſe
ſcraped upon them they eat as we do buttered wheat
or rice. The making of theſe is a trade and myſtery;
and in every great town you ſhall ſee ſeveral ſhops of
them.</p>
                     <p>7. They ſcrape or grate <hi>Cheeſe</hi> upon all their
diſhes even of fleſh; accounting that it gives the
meat a good relliſh; which to thoſe that are unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
makes it rather nauſeous or loathſome.</p>
                     <p>8. <hi>Cheſnuts</hi> roaſted and the kernels ſerved up
with juyce of Lemon and ſugar are much eſteemed,
and by ſome called the <hi>Piſtachios</hi> of <hi>Italy.</hi> At <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
they grind them and make little cakes of the
flower of them, which though eaten by the poor
are no deſirable dainty to a delicate palate. Roaſted
Cheſnuts are a great part of the diet of the poor Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
in <hi>Italy;</hi> as we have elſewhere noted.</p>
                     <p>9. They eat all manner of <hi>ſmall birds</hi> as well as
the <hi>Germans,</hi> viz. <hi>Wrens, Stares, Titmiſe, Butcher-birds,</hi>
                        <pb n="406" facs="tcp:98511:216"/>
&amp;c. and ſeveral great ones which we touch
not in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Mag-pies, Jayes, Wood-peckers,
Jack-daws,</hi> &amp;c. nay we have frequently ſeen <hi>Kites</hi>
and <hi>Hawks</hi> lying on the Peulterers ſtalls; as we have
already noted in our deſcription of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>10. They uſe ſeveral herbs for <hi>Sallets,</hi> which are
not yet, or have been but lately uſed in <hi>England:
v. g. Selleri,</hi> which is nothing elſe but ſweet ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
the young ſhoots whereof with a little of the
head of the root cut off, they eat raw with oyl and
pepper: In like manner they eat Fennel: Artichoke
alſo they eat raw with the ſame ſauce; [the ſame
part of it that is eaten boild.] In <hi>Sicily</hi> at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
village upon that ſide Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> that we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
they gave us to eat for a Sallet the ſtalks of
a tall prickly thiſtle, bearing a yellow flower, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it was the <hi>Carduus Chryſanthemus</hi> Dod. which
the rankneſs of the ſoil had cauſed to mount up to
that ſtature. Beſides in moſt of their ſallets they
mingle Rocket, (<hi>Rachetta</hi> they call it) which to me
gives them an odious taſte. <hi>Curl'd Endive</hi> blancht is
much uſed beyond Seas; and for a raw ſallet ſeemed
to excel Lettuce it ſelf: Beſides it hath this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that it may be kept all Winter.</p>
                     <p>11. Many <hi>fruits</hi> they eat which we either have not
or eat not in <hi>England,</hi> v. g. <hi>Jujubes,</hi> ſold by the
Huckſters while they are yet green: <hi>L'azarole,</hi> the
fruit of the <hi>Meſpilus Aronia,</hi> of a pleaſant acid taſte:
both fruit and tree exactly like the common Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn,
but bigger. <hi>Services</hi> or <hi>Sorbes</hi> the true, as
big as little Pears; thoſe that grow with us are the
fruit of the <hi>Sorbus torminalis: Green figs</hi> both white
and blew in great plenty; a moſt delicate fruit when
fully ripe, comparable for the taſte to the beſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malade,
and which may be eaten freely without
danger of ſurfeiting: The husks or cods of <hi>Carobs,</hi>
called in <hi>Latine Siliqua dulcis,</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the
word uſed <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 16. and therefore by ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:98511:216"/>
to be the husks the Prodigal is ſaid to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to fill his belly with. Indeed we thought
them fitter meat from ſwine than men; for though
they had a ſweet taſte, yet afterwards they troubled
our ſtomachs and purged us: but they have not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all men the like effect; for the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
eat them ordinarily without any ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
<hi>Love-apples: Mad-apples</hi> both raw and pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
<hi>Water-melons;</hi> which they uſe to eat to cool
and refreſh them, and ſome Phyſicians allow ſick
perſons to eat them in Feavers. They are almoſt as
as big as Pompions, have a green rind and a reddiſh
pulp with blackiſh ſeed when ripe. The <hi>Italians</hi> call
theſe <hi>Cucumeri,</hi> whereas Cucumers they call <hi>Citrulli.</hi>
Several ſorts of Gourds, as <hi>Cucurbita lagenaria,</hi> and
<hi>Cucurbita flexuoſaſive anguina;</hi> which eats very well
boild in pottage: <hi>Cucumis anguinus,</hi> which is more
eſteemed and indeed better taſted then the Cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
The common people both in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi>
eat green Chich-peaſe raw, as our people do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
peaſe.</p>
                     <p>12. In their Deſſerts and ſecond courſes they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſerve up pine-kernels, and in time of year
green Almonds: alſo a kind of ſweet-meat or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
made up of muſtard and ſugar, which they
call <hi>Italian</hi> muſtard.</p>
                     <p>13. To cool and refreſh their wines they uſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſnow, where it may eaſily be had, elſe ice,
which they keep in conſervatories all Summer. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſnow they that are uſed to it do not willingly
drink, no not in winter.</p>
                     <p>14. In the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> they
make a ſort of cheeſe which they call <hi>Caſeo di cavallo,</hi>
i. e. Horſe-cheeſe, for what reaſon I could not learn.
Theſe cheeſes they make up in ſeveral forms; ſome
in the faſhion of a blown bladder, ſome in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
of a cylinder and ſome in other figures. They
are neither fat nor ſtrong, yet well-taſted and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:98511:217"/>
to ſuch as have eaten of them a while. The pulp
or body of them lies in flakes and hath as it were a
grain one way like wood. They told us that they
were made of Buffles milk, but we believed them
not, becauſe we obſerved not many Buffles in thoſe
Countries, where there is more of this cheeſe made
than of other ſorts.</p>
                     <p>15. In <hi>Italy</hi> and other hot Countries their meat
is not only naturally more lean and dry then ours,
but they roaſt it alſo till it be ready to fall from the
bones, and there be little juyce left in it. Beſides
when they roaſt their meat they draw coals under the
ſpit, and let the fat drop on them, the <hi>nidor</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
perfumes the meat, but not our guſt who are
not uſed to it, and what they loſe in dripping they
ſave in fewel. Their roaſting differs not much from
our broiling or carbonadoing. I ſpeak this of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Inns and mean peoples houſes, in great houſes
and Inns it is otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> count not their hours as we do, from
twelve to twelve, beginning at midday and mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night;
but from one to four and twenty, beginning
their count at Sun-ſet, which is a much more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
way; the ſetting of the Sun being a moveable
point or term, and they being therefore neceſſitated
to alter and new-ſet their clocks every day: whereas
midday and midnight being fixt points, the clocks
need no ſetting anew. As for <hi>Italy</hi> in general,
though the <hi>Italians</hi> imagine it to be the beſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
in the world, and have a Proverb among them
that <hi>Italy is the garden of the world:</hi> yet ſetting
aſide <hi>Lombardy, Campania</hi> and ſome few other
places, the reſt is mountainous and barren enough:
the earth ſo parcht by the Sun-beams that it bears no
graſs, and (as <hi>Barclay</hi> faith) ſeldom yieldeth grain
enough for three year ſucceſſively to ſupply the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
and uſes of its inhabitants, whatever they
may boaſt of the <hi>Itala gleba.</hi> The reaſon why the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:98511:217"/>
                        <hi>Italians</hi> are ſo conceited of their own Countrey is,
becauſe they ſeldom travel abroad, and ſo ſee not
the beauty and fertility of others.</p>
                     <p>I might have taken notice of the vaſt and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
number of Religious houſes there are in <hi>Italy.</hi> I
have ſometimes thought they might in all of both
ſexes amount to eight or ten thouſand. Of theſe the
Gentlemen make advantage. For ſuch of their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as either they cannot get husbands for, or are
not able to give portions to, ſuitable to their birth
and quality, they can in one of theſe houſes for a ſmal
matter honourably diſpoſe of and ſettle for their
lives. The inſtitution of ſuch houſes as theſe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
young women of quality, who for want of
ſufficient fortunes or perſonal endowments cannot
eaſily provide themſelves ſuteable matches, might
retire and find honourable proviſion, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
be tolerable, yea commendable, were they
purged from all ſuperſtition the women not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
too young, and under no vow of perpetual cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,
only to leave the houſe in caſe they married.
But becauſe of the danger of introducing Monkery,
I think it more ſafe for a Chriſtian State not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any ſuch foundations.</p>
                     <p>Buſſles are a common beaſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> and they make
uſe of them to draw their wains as we do of oxen:
only becauſe they are ſomewhat fierce and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly,
they are forced to lead them by an iron-ring
put in their noſes, as our Bear-wards do their Bears.</p>
                     <p>For inſects the moſt remarkable ſorts which we
want in <hi>England,</hi> are,</p>
                     <p>1. The <hi>Cicadae</hi> before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>2. The <hi>flying Glow-worms,</hi> which are there
every where to be ſeen in Summer time. Theſe fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or winged Glow-worms are nothing elſe but the
males of the common creeping or unwinged Glow-worm
<hi>Fabius Columna</hi> relates, that <hi>Carolus Vinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miglia</hi>
of <hi>Palermo</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> having out of curioſity
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:98511:218"/>
kept many unwinged Glow-worms in a glaſs did
put in among them a flying one, which preſently in
his ſight did couple with them one by one after the
manner of ſilk-worms; and that the next day the
unwinged ones or females began to lay their eggs.
That the males are alſo flying inſects in <hi>England,</hi>
though they do but rarely or not at all ſhine with us,
we are aſſured by an eye-witneſs, who ſaw them in
conjunction with the common ſhining unwinged
Glow-worms. Heer by the way it may not be amiſs
to impart to the Reader a diſcovery made by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Gentleman and communicated to me by <hi>Francis
Jeſſop</hi> 
                        <abbr>Esq</abbr> which is, that thoſe reputed Meteors
called in Latine <hi>Ignes fatui,</hi> and known in <hi>England</hi>
by the conceited names of <hi>Jack with a Lanthorn,</hi> and
<hi>Will with a Wiſp,</hi> are nothing elſe but ſwarms of
theſe flying Glow-worms. Which if true, we may
give an eaſie account of thoſe ſtrange <hi>phaenomena</hi> of
theſe ſuppoſed fires, <hi>viz.</hi> their ſuddain motion from
place to place and leading travellers that follow them
into bogs and precipices.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Scorpions,</hi> which in <hi>Italy</hi> ſting not, or at leaſt
their ſtings are not venenoſe, as the learned <hi>Franciſcus
Redi</hi> affirms; though by experience he found
the ſtinging of the <hi>African</hi> Scorpions to be mortal,
or at leaſt very noxious.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Tarantula's</hi> ſo called becauſe found about <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum,</hi>
(though we have ſeen of them at <hi>Rome</hi>)
which are nothing elſe but a large ſort of Spiders;
the biting whereof is eſteemed venemous, and
thought to put people into Phrenetic fits, enforcing
them to dance to certain tunes of the Muſic, by
which means they are cured, long and violent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
cauſing a great evacution by ſweat. Theſe fits
they ſay do alſo yearly return at the ſame ſeaſon the
Patient was bitten. But Dr. <hi>Thomas Cornelius</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenza</hi>
before mentioned, a learned Phyſician and
Virtuoſo in <hi>Naples,</hi> diligently enquiring into this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:98511:218"/>
received and heertofore unqueſtioned ſtory,
that he might ſatisfie himſelf and others whether it
were really true in experience.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Cimiei</hi> as the <hi>Italians</hi> call them, as the <hi>French
Punaiſe.</hi> We <hi>Engliſh</hi> them Chinches or Wall-lice,
which are very noiſome and troubleſome by their
bitings in the night time, raiſing a great heat and
redneſs in the skin. They harbour in the ſtraw of
the bolſters and mattreſſes and in the wood of the
bedſteds, and therefore in ſome <hi>Noſocomia</hi>
or Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
for ſick perſons, as for example at <hi>Genua,</hi> the
bedſteds are all of iron. This inſect if it be cruſhed
or bruiſed emits a moſt horrid and loathſome ſcent,
ſo that thoſe that are bitten by them are often in a
doubt whether it be better to endure the trouble of
their bitings, or kill them and ſuffer their moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and abminable ſtink. We have of theſe inſects
in ſome places of <hi>England,</hi> but not many, neither
are they troubleſome to us.</p>
                     <p>We departed from <hi>Trent</hi> intending for <hi>Coira</hi> or
<hi>Chur</hi> in the <hi>Griſons</hi> Countrey called in Latine <hi>curia
Rhaetorum.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">March 18.</note> We rode up the valley wherein the river
<hi>Atheſis</hi> runs, called <hi>Val Venoſta,</hi> every 5 miles paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
through a large village, and one handſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
town called <hi>Burgo,</hi> and lodged at a ſmall place
called <hi>Brunſole.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We rode through <hi>Bolzan</hi> conſiderable Town and
for bigneſs comparable to <hi>Trent,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">19. Bolzan. Maran.</note> and 10 miles fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Maran</hi> a large Town, and lodged at a village

                     </p>
                     <p>We paſſed through <hi>Latourn,</hi>

                        <hi>Slach, Schlanders,
Maltz,</hi> all villages and Towns of note, and laſt of all
<hi>Cleurn</hi> a pretty great walled Town, and then ſtruck
up on the left hand among the mountains to a village
called <hi>Tavers</hi> where we lodged.</p>
                     <p>We rode on through the ſnow to <hi>Monaſtero,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">21.</note> where
the <hi>Griſons</hi> Countrey begins, and S. <hi>Maria</hi> a ſmall
<hi>terra,</hi> and ſtopt at <hi>Gherf</hi> a village at the foot of the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:98511:219"/>
high mountains. In this Countrey the people uſe a
peculiar language of their own, which they call
<hi>Romanſch,</hi> that is <hi>Lingua Romana.</hi> It ſeems to be
nearer <hi>Spaniſh</hi> than <hi>Italian,</hi> though diſtinct from
both. Beſides their own language they generally
ſpeak both <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Dutch:</hi> ſo that after we had
loſt <hi>Italian</hi> in the valleys we wondered to find it
heer again among the hills. Their wines they bring
all out of the <hi>Valtelline,</hi> from <hi>Tirano,</hi> about 2 days
journey diſtant. The Countrey at this time was all
over covered with ſnow, ſo that they are fain to
keep their cattel within doors for ſix months! yet
the people ſaid that heerabouts the ſnow did not lie
all Summer, no not on the tops of the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
Heer we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that to draw their ſleds over
the ſnow, inſtead of Oxen they make uſe of Bulls,
one Bull drawing a little ſled. About <hi>Tavers</hi> we obſerved
them ſowing of duſt upon the ſnow, which
they told us was to make the ſnow melt ſooner: I
ſuppoſe it was rather for manure. They uſe ſtoves in
all places, and good reaſon they have the Countrey
being ſo cold, A great number of <hi>Chamois</hi> or <hi>Gemps
[Rupicaprae</hi>] are taken all over theſe Countries upon
the high hills, as, though the people had not told us,
we muſt needs have gathered from the multitude of
horns we ſaw ſtuck up in the houſes where we lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Bears there are and Wolves among the high
mountains but not many. The men generally wear
ruffs and long buſhy beards. All the people (as far as
we had experience or could judge of them in the
ſhort ſtay we made among them) we found to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
hearty and civil, and the common ſort very
mannerly. Their houſes are built of ſtone, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with ſhingles of wood, the walls thick and the
windows very ſmall to fence againſt the cold. They
have no ſtrong holds or fortified places among them;
nor will they permit any to be erected; having ſo
much confidence in their own valour, that they
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:98511:219"/>
think they need no other defence: indeed their
Countrey is ſuch as one would think none of their
neighbouring Princes ſhould covet unleſs for the
ſecurity of his own Territories.</p>

                  <p>THe <hi>Griſons</hi> are divided into 3 Leagues, and each
League ſubdivided into <hi>Communes:</hi> each <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune</hi>
contains ſeveral Villages; not all an equal
number, but ſome more ſome fewer. The <hi>Lega
Griſa</hi> (according to <hi>Simler</hi>) hath <hi>19 Communes.</hi> The
<hi>Lega della caſa Dio</hi> hath 21 <hi>Communes,</hi> which are
ſometimes contracted into 11. <hi>Cleurn, Tavers</hi> and
<hi>Maltz</hi> have ſately revolted from this League, and
put themſelves under the Archduke of <hi>Inſpruck.</hi> The
<hi>Dieci Dritture</hi> have ten, as the name imports. Each
<hi>Commune</hi> hath its annual chief Magiſtrate, whom
in ſome places they call <hi>Maeſtrale,</hi> and a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Aſſeſſors or Judges, which in their language
are called <hi>Truoeder.</hi> Each <hi>terra</hi> or Village chuſes its
Judges by majority of votes. [Sometimes the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
chuſe only a certain number of Delegates, which
Delegates are to make choice of the Judges.] All
the People, as well rich as poor, as well Servants as
Maſters, have their Suffrages ſo ſoon as they come
to the age of 16 years. The time of their Election
is <hi>St. Matthias</hi> day. The <hi>Commune</hi> of <hi>Engadina alta</hi>
hath 10 great Villages (<hi>terre</hi> they call them) 16
Judges called <hi>Truoeder,</hi> one <hi>Maeſtrale,</hi> one Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
or Notary. The <hi>Maeſtrale,</hi> the Chancellour, and
4 <hi>Truoeder</hi> are always of <hi>Zuotz.</hi> The other <hi>terre</hi> have
ſome one, ſome two, according to their bigneſs.
[In other Communities the ſeveral <hi>terre</hi> have the
<hi>Maeſtrale</hi> and other Officers by turns.] Theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
are changed every two years, but confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every year, and may be put out by the People if
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:98511:220"/>
they pleaſe. The <hi>Maeſtrale</hi> (called in ſome places
<hi>Landamman</hi>) is the chief, and aſſembles the <hi>Truoeder</hi>
together, makes Proceſſes, and in ſum hath the
executive power. When they have occaſion to meet
to decide any buſineſs, or judge in any criminal
cauſe, he that is caſt or condemned, if he hath goods
bears the charges, if he hath none then the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune</hi>
bears the charges; So that every <hi>Commune</hi> is a
Common-wealth by its ſelf, and its government
purely Democratical. Every two years they have
two Diets or general Councils: The firſt Diet
(when the Officers which they ſend to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Praefecturae</hi> are elected) is at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
(when they take an account of their Officers)
is on <hi>St. John Baptiſts</hi> day. To theſe Diets each
<hi>Commune</hi> ſends its Delegates, <hi>Meſſi</hi> they call them,
or Commiſſioners, ſome one and ſome two. Theſe
Delegates muſt act according to the inſtructions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them by their ſeveral Communities. Each
League hate its Head or Chief. The Burgomaſter of
<hi>Coira</hi> is always Head of the League <hi>della caſa di Dio.</hi>
In the <hi>Lega Griſa</hi> there are four Communities that
by ancient cuſtom have the Head (who is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Landtreichter</hi>) by turns. In the <hi>Dieci Dritture</hi>
ſix Communities have the choice of the Chief, who
is called <hi>Landamman.</hi> Thoſe ſix <hi>Communes</hi> ſend
each its Delegate to <hi>Tavas,</hi> and the Delegates by the
major vote chuſe the new <hi>Landamman.</hi> Theſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with ſome aſſiſtants meet as a leſſer Council,
but have no abſolute or deciſive ſentence. There
lies an Appeal from the general Diet to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
and what the major part of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
or agrees upon is valid. The <hi>Griſons</hi> pay no
ſort of Datii, Gabels or Taxes. In <hi>Italy</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Chiavenna</hi> and the <hi>Valtelline</hi> are ſubject to the
<hi>Griſons.</hi> To the County of <hi>Chiavena</hi> they ſent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
two Podeſta's or Bailifls, one to <hi>Plurs,</hi> which
Town was miſerably deſtroyed by the falling of a
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:98511:221"/>
Mountain upon it, and one to <hi>Chiavena,</hi> who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Commiſſario.</hi> Near <hi>Plurs</hi> are made Pots and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſtone turned after the manner of wood, which
will endure the fire. The <hi>Valtelline</hi> according to
<hi>Simler</hi> is divided into ſix <hi>Praefecturae,</hi> whether the
<hi>Griſons</hi> ſend <hi>Podeſta's</hi> or Governors. Thoſe are <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio,</hi>
which ſome make a County by it ſelf, <hi>Tirano,
Tellio, Sondrio, Morbegno</hi> and <hi>Travona.</hi> They named
to us two more, <hi>viz. Ponte</hi> and <hi>Chiur.</hi> Theſe <hi>Pode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta's</hi>
are changed every two years, the principal or
head of them is the Prefect of <hi>Sondrio,</hi> who is not
called <hi>Podeſta,</hi> but <hi>Governatore</hi> as we were told, as
<hi>Simler</hi> ſaith <hi>Capitaneo.</hi> In the chuſing of Praefects
the order both of the Leagues and of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
is obſerved. So that for example, if the <hi>Lega
Griſa</hi> chuſes the Governor of <hi>Sondrio</hi> for this two
years, the <hi>Lega della caſa di Dio</hi> ſhall have the choice
of him the next two, and the <hi>Dieci Dritture</hi> the
following. The like order is obſerved in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Communities of each League. The People of
<hi>Valtelline,</hi> the Country of <hi>Bormio,</hi> and the County of
<hi>Chiavenna</hi> pay no Taxes or Gabels more than for
the maintenance of their Governors or <hi>Podeſta's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We left <hi>Ponte,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 24.</note> and paſſed over another high
Mountain called in a very bad ſeaſon,
for that it ſnowed exceeding faſt all the while we
were abroad, which in many places ſo filled up the
track that we could ſee no way at all, only we could
preſently find when were out, for then our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were almoſt up to the belly in ſnow: beſides a
brisk gale of moſt bitter cutting wind blew juſt in
our faces, which did ſo affect my eyes that I could
not open tem without great pain for three days,
nor eaſily endure to look upon ſnow for a great
while after. The reaſon why my eyes were more
affected than others I conceive was, becauſe I was
not careful to wipe the ſnow off my face, but ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to freez to the hair of my eyebrows and eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids:
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:98511:221"/>
the cold whereof being contiguous to them,
ſtupified, and would in time have quite mortified
my eyes. And here by the way we may take notice,
that the People living in this mountainous cold
Country look more ſwarthy and dusky, at leaſt their
their faces and parts expoſed to the air, and have
not ſo good complexions as thoſe that live below
in a milder and more temperatre Region. It is an
obſervation of <hi>Bodin</hi> in his <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> That
the Inhabitants of the temperate Zone, as you go
further and further from the Tropic are ſtill whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and whiter, till you come to a certain degree of
latitude, and then they grow dusky and dark-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
again; 3 witneſs the <hi>Greenlanders, Laplanders;
&amp;c.</hi> extremity of cold parching and tanning the
skin as well as exceſs of heat. And we found this
true by our own experience; for our faces were ſo
hackt and burnt (if I may take ſo to uſe that
word) by the cold in our paſſage over theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
that for ſome time after we lookt like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Gypſics. This night we lodged in a <hi>terra</hi> called
<hi>Bergun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We went on to <hi>Coira</hi> the capital City of the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">25. Coira or Chur.</note>
a pretty little Town ſtanding on a ſmall River

environed almoſt with Mountains, ſave only on that

excepting the Biſhop (who coyns money that
is current here) and 24 Canons. The Biſhop hath
nothing at all to do in the Government of the
Town. The form of Government is much like that
of <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Baſel, viz.</hi> the Citizens are divided
into ſive Tribes or Companies, each of which chuſes
14 Senators, which make up the great Council of 70.
Theſe are called <hi>Ratſheren,</hi> and are choſen by
the people anew every year on <hi>S. Martins</hi> day; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:98511:222"/>

                  <p>The Governments of the ſeveral Cantos of <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi>

whoſe chief Officer is called <hi>Landamman;</hi> and in
theſe the ſupreme power is in all the People, by
whoſe counſel all buſineſſes of moment are decided.
Of this ſort are <hi>Vri, Suits, Vnderwalden, Zug, Glaris</hi>
and <hi>Appenzel.</hi> The ſecond, of thoſe which have
Cities that were either built by, or ſometime ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Princes, whoſe chief Officer is called <hi>Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus</hi>
or Scout: This form is moſt Ariſtocratical of

Cities divided into ſeveral Tribes or Companies,

                     <head>GLARIS</head>
                     <p>Is divided (according to <hi>Similer</hi>) into 15 parts,
but as we were told there into 12 Pariſhes, of which
ſome have five Counſellors, ſome ſix; ſome more
ſome leſs, according to their bigneſs. Theſe make
up the Senate or Council, which conſiſts of 60,
whereof two parts are of the reformed Religion and
one of the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> beſides the <hi>Landamman</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cheif Officers, who have the privilege of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in Council when their term is expired. The
chief and ſupreme power is in the whole people.
Upon the laſt Sunday in <hi>April</hi> yearly there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Convention of all the males above 16 years of
age, together with the Magiſtrates at a place called
<hi>Schuandan.</hi> This general Meeting or Convention
is called <hi>Landtſkmein:</hi> and by theſe by majority of
Suſſrages the Magiſtrates and Officers are choſen;
and firſt the <hi>Landamman,</hi> who continues in Office
ſometimes two, ſometimes three years. Into this
Office they may chooſe out of all the people whom
they pleaſe without any regard of place. 2. The
<hi>Statthalter</hi> who is the <hi>Landammans</hi> Lieutenant.
Theſe Offices in the Canton are thus divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Proteſtants and Papiſts. Three years the
<hi>Landamman</hi> is a Proteſtant, and the <hi>Statthalter</hi> a Papiſt; then the two following the <hi>Landamman</hi> is
a Papiſt and the <hi>Statthalter</hi> a Proteſtant. 3. The
<hi>Seckelmeiſter</hi> or Treaſurer. 4. <hi>Pannerheer</hi> or Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard-bearer.
5. <hi>Landſhauptman</hi> or chief Captain, and
under him in time of war Lieutenant. 6. <hi>Landtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendricht</hi>
or Enſign. Theſe three laſt continue for
life. 7. Three <hi>Landtſchrieben, i. e.</hi> Secretaries or
Chancellours, who are preſent in Council, but have
no ſuffrages. 8. <hi>Landtweible</hi> or Apparitour; he
gathers the votes in the general Convention, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
the Council by Proclamation in the Church,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:98511:223"/>
&amp;c. The <hi>Landſcmein</hi> chuſes alſo the <hi>Landtvogts</hi> or
Prefects, and either confirms or abrogates public
Edicts and Conſtitutions. The 60 Senatours uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
continue in office during life <hi>modo bene ſe geſſerint,</hi>
yet are they yearly choſen anew or confirmed
at the general Convention, not by the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
but each one by that part of Pariſh to which
he belongs, and by which he was choſen; who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
when any one dies chuſe another into his place.
The <hi>Landamman</hi> when his office is expired is called
old <hi>Landamman,</hi> and may ſtill ſit in council, which
is a favour allowed him in regard of his former
dignity. The aforementioned Officers do alſo ſit in
council. The <hi>Landamman</hi> puts men in priſon by his
Authority, propounds buſineſs to the Council, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points
the days of the Councils meeting, and to that
end appoints the Officer to give them notice in the
Church. In this Canton, to avoid the ambition and
inordinate expences of Candidates for Offices, who
were wont to court and feaſt the people, they have
lately introduced Lottery in the choice of Officers
and Governours. All the Candidates are firſt put to
the vote, and thoſe eight (if there be ſo many for
any one place) who have moſt ſurages are ſet in the
middle. Then the <hi>Landtſchrieb</hi> or Secretary takes
eight balls, one of which is gilt, and wraps them
up in ſingle papers, and puts them into a hat which
he holds under his arm, whilſt a little child puts in
his hand and takes out the balls one by one, and
gives them to the eight. He who happens to have
the gilt ball is the Officer. Beſides theſe Councils
there are alſo two Conſiſtories of Judges; one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of nine, choſen by the <hi>Landtskmein</hi> out of the
Council or <hi>Ratſheeren,</hi> to whom the <hi>Landamman</hi>
is added as Preſident, who determine all cauſes of
injuries, and all buſineſs of inheritances, and where
money is gained with hazard of life: the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of five who determine actions of debt. Theſe
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:98511:224"/>
Conſiſtories (ſaith <hi>Simler</hi>) ſit only in <hi>May</hi> and

                     <p>At <hi>Glaris</hi> they told us, that in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
thoſe of the Canton of <hi>Suitz</hi> were good Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
but living moſt upon milk and white meats,
they could not laſt and endure abroad. That thoſe
of <hi>Vri, Appenzel,</hi> and the lower part of <hi>Glaris</hi> made
the beſt Soldiers of all.</p>
                     <p>We travelled from <hi>Glaris</hi> through <hi>Nafels</hi> a little
Village,<note place="margin">April 1.</note> and ſeveral other Villages near the Lake of
<hi>Rapperſville</hi> or the <hi>Zurich-ſea,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Lachen,</hi>
where they uſually take boat for <hi>Zurich,</hi> and after
an hours riding by the Lakes ſide, and in ſight of
<hi>Rapperſvill,</hi> and the long Bridge croſs the Lake, we
climb'd up a very high Mountain on our left
hand, to the top of which when we were aſcended
we rode throogh a Country all covered with ſnow,
which in the Summer time ſeems to be a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
place. Heer we found <hi>Eynſidle,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eynſidle.</note> where is a famous
Monaſtery of <hi>Benedictine</hi> Freres, in whoſe Church is
an Image of our Lady, which works great miracles,
<hi>ſi credere fus ſit.</hi> This is a place of great devotion,
viſited by Strangers and Pilgrims after the manner
of <hi>Loreto.</hi> And as there is the <hi>Holy houſe,</hi> ſo here is
a <hi>Chappel divinely conſecrated,</hi> ſet in the body of the
Church, and encloſed in a caſe of Marble, given by
an Archbiſhop of <hi>Saltzburg.</hi> Near the door of this
Church is an Alley of Shops of Beads and Medals,
as at <hi>Loreto;</hi> and here as there an incredible number
of Beggers continually waiting. The Canton of
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:98511:225"/>
                        <hi>Switz</hi> is Protector of his Abbey. If any one deſire
to know more of this place he may conſult the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory

                     </p>
                     <p>We rode again over the ſnow for about three
hours,<note place="margin">3. Schwytz.</note> and then deſcending by degrees we paſſed
through three Villages, and at laſt arrived at <hi>Swyts,</hi>
a fair Village (for its counted no other, though it be
comparable to the beſt of our Market Towns) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a large <hi>Piazza</hi> handſomely paved.</p>
                     <p>The government of this Canton is much what
the ſame with that of <hi>Glaris.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Canton of Suitz.</note> The whole Canton
is divided into 6 parts or quarters. Each diviſion
hath 10 Counſellors; ſo that the Council or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
conſiſts of 60, which they call <hi>Ratſheeren.</hi> When
a Senatour dies, that quarter to which he belonged
chuſes another by the major vote of all the people.
Every quarter hath its head, who is called <hi>Siebener:</hi>
becauſe they are ſeven in all, the <hi>Landamman</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
one of the number; which make a leſſer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to manage and take care of the public revenue.
The Senatours are obliged in important cauſes to
take each his man to be his aſſiſtant, and in the moſt
weighty of all (as concerning peace and war) each
two men; ſo that then the Council is tripled. The
laſt Sunday of <hi>April</hi> (as at <hi>Glaris</hi>) is the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole Canton called the <hi>Landtskmein,</hi>
when all the males above 16 years of age meet and
elect by major vote the <hi>Landamman</hi> and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

that can conveniently are obliged to come; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one to ſwear fidelity to their Countrey, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Liberties, &amp;c. The Officers are the ſame
as at <hi>Glaris.</hi> This Canton and every one of the reſt
ſend two <hi>Meſſi</hi> to the general Diet at <hi>Baden,</hi> of
which the <hi>Landamman</hi> is uſually one. This Canton
hath alſo the like two little Councils or Conſiſtories
as <hi>Glaris.</hi>

                        <pb n="425" facs="tcp:98511:225"/>
We rode about 3 miles to a place called <hi>Brunen,</hi>
beſide the lake of <hi>Lucern,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">3. Altorff.</note> and there embarkt for <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf,</hi>
ſpending in our paſſage upon the water about
3 hours, and then we had but a mile to the town.
From <hi>Swytz</hi> to <hi>Altorf</hi> there is no travelling by land
(as they told us) unleſs we would go ſome ſcores of
miles about. <hi>Altorf</hi> hath no piazza, yet is it a larger
town than <hi>Schwytz,</hi> and hath a pretty Church and
a Monaſtery of <hi>Capucines.</hi> Heer we heard at large
related to us the ſtory of <hi>William Tell</hi> and the <hi>Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogt,</hi>
which he that is deſirous to know may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<hi>Simler.</hi> On the top of a pillar over one of their
fountains in the ſtreet is ſet the ſtatue of this <hi>Tell,</hi>
with his croſs-bow on his ſhoulder, and leading his
ſon by the hand. At ſome diſtance ſtands a tower
on which are painted the ſeveral paſſages of the
Story.</p>
                     <p>The Government is almoſt the ſame with that of
<hi>Schwytz.</hi> The number of Senators, manner of
their election the ſame. The Officer and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
the ſame, only they mentioned a <hi>Suk-heer,</hi>
who hath the charge of the Ammunition, whom
they told us not of in other Cantons, and 6 Fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprachts,
i. e. Proctors or Councellors, but not of
the Council. The Senatours being to judge in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
cauſes take to them another man, ſo that then
the Council is doubled. They have alſo a leſſer
Council of 15 called the <hi>Landtram,</hi> which decides
civil cauſes. Theſe are taken out of the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and go round in a <hi>rota.</hi> They meet the firſt
Munday every moneth. A third Council alſo they
have called the <hi>Poderade,</hi> which ſits weekly about
actions of debt where the ſum exceeds not 60 li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
The Senators (as they told us) have no Salary
or allowance at all. When one of the Council is
choſen <hi>Landtvogt</hi> he is put out of the Council. <hi>Vri</hi>
is the firſt Canton that ſet it ſelf at liberty.</p>

                        <pb n="426" facs="tcp:98511:226"/>
We returned to the lake of <hi>Lucern,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">April 4. Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walden.</note> and taking
boat we went by water within one hour of <hi>Stantz,</hi>
the principal village of <hi>Vnderwald,</hi> where we lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
As we ſailed upon this lake we happened to ſee
a great fall of ſnow from the tops of ſome moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
hanging over the lake, which made a ratling
and report not unlike thunder, as Monſieur <hi>de Cartes</hi>
in his Meteors notes. At <hi>Stantz</hi> they have a very
fair Church, and two Convents, one of <hi>Capucine</hi>
Freres, and one of Muns. Heer and at <hi>Altorf, Switz,
Lucern,</hi> &amp;c. we obſerved in the Church-yards croſſes
ſet upon the graves, ſome of wood, ſome of iron,
and on ſome of them hanging a little copper kettle
with holy water in it. Some women we ſaw com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a bunch of herbs in their hands, which
they dipped in the kettle, and ſprinkled the water
therewith upon the graves. Theſe I ſuppoſe were
Widows or Mothers who ſprinkled the water upon
the graves of their dead Husbands or Children.</p>
                     <p>This Canton is divided into two parts, <hi>Oberwald</hi>
or the upper, whoſe capital village is <hi>Stanner,</hi> and
the lower or <hi>Vnderwald,</hi> the head whereof is <hi>Stantz.</hi>
In the lower are 60 Senatours choſen by 11 <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
ſome whereof have more, and ſome fewer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their bigneſs. The Officers are the ſame,
and choſen in like manner as in <hi>Schwytz</hi> and <hi>Vri,</hi>
only the <hi>Landamman</hi> and <hi>Statthalter</hi> continue in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
but one year.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lantweible</hi> or Apparitor and 7 Judges, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
one out of a <hi>Commune,</hi> judge in civil cauſes.
From theſe there is an appeal to another Tribunal
of 11, conſiſting of the <hi>Landamman,</hi> and one ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
out of each <hi>Commune</hi> ſave tat the <hi>Landam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
is of. Theſe 11 are choſen out of the Council,
the ſeven indifferently. In capital cauſes the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of 60 Judges, and beſides any one of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
may be preſent and give his ſuffrage if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
though ordinarily none do but the Senators,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:98511:226"/>
who are all there to by oath obliged. The Senators
and Officers of this Canton have all ſalaries. Heer
and in <hi>Vri</hi> all the males of all conditions that are
14 years old and upward have their ſuffrages at the
<hi>Landtskmeind. Oberwald</hi> hath likewiſe a Council,
<hi>Landamman</hi> and other Officers by themſelves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
nothing common with <hi>Vnderwald.</hi> They no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<hi>Landvogts</hi> and Embaſſadors by turns. They
might be eſteemed two Cantons were it not for that
they have but two Delegates at the Diet at <hi>Baden,</hi>
as the other Cantons have.</p>
                     <p>Theſe three Cantons, <hi>Vti, Switz,</hi> and <hi>Vnderwald,</hi>
conſiſt chiefly, not to ſay wholly, of paſture ground:
No cornfields or vineyards heer. Their wine is
imported from <hi>Italy,</hi> their corn from ſeveral parts.
They boaſt that by this means their ground is not
ſo ſubject to the caſualties of weather, or injuries of
bad ſeaſons as either plowed fields or vineyards,
and yields to the owners a more certain profit.
It's well if one reaſon why they maintain all their
ground paſture, be not becauſe they are unwilling to
take pains in husbandry. Wine is dear heer. At
<hi>Altorf</hi> and <hi>Stantz</hi> they have it from <hi>Logarno.</hi> At
<hi>Switz</hi> they have both <hi>Valtelline</hi> and <hi>Logarno</hi>-wine.
The people are very honeſt and good natured, keep
their houſes neat and cleanly, and withal very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
and in good repair. The men are given much to
drinking. The meat ſtands before them three or
four hours, and they now and then cat a bit, but
the main buſineſs is drinking.</p>
                     <p>We travelled to <hi>Lucern,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">April. 5. Lucern.</note> croſſing over a part of the
lake. This is a very neat city and pleaſantly ſituate
upon the lake: divided into parts by a river which
runs out of the lake; over which there are three
bridges, one for carts and horſes, the other two
handſome foot bridges covered over with a roof or
penthouſe, one near a quarter of a mile long. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
there is a fourth bridge which leads towards
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:98511:227"/>
the Church covered like this laſt, and longer than it.
The great Church ſtands without the city wall,
a very handſome tall, and lightſome ſtructure. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Weſtern door is the greateſt Organ that ever
I ſaw: A man might very well creep into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of the greater pipes of it. The account of the
Government that was given us heer was much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from <hi>Simlers.</hi> They told us that the Great
Council conſiſted of 136, whereas he writes that it
conſiſts of no more that 100: but theſe may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled;
for that, I ſuppoſe, he excludes the leſſer
Council, which they included. They continue in
office during life; and when one dies, the reſt of
the Council chuſe another into his place, out of the
Citizens whom they think fit. <hi>Simler</hi> ſaith that the
leſſer Council of the laſt half year chuſe the new
Senators. This Council hath two Preſidents whom
they call <hi>Sculteti,</hi> who preſide <hi>alternis annis,</hi> and
continue in office during life. <hi>Simler</hi> ſaith they are
choſen yearly by the Suffrages of both the Councils.
The manner of chuſing Officers and Senators is this.
Behind a curtain according to the number of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors
are placed two, three, or more boxes. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Senator hath given him a little medal or piece
of money for that purpoſe; and ſo the Senators
go one by one behind the curtain, and put the
medal into what box they pleaſe, and he that
hath moſt of theſe pieces is underſtood to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.
Out of the great Council is choſen a leſſer of
the moſt ancient and wiſe, who alſo continue du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
life, and judge in civil cauſes, and take care
of the ordinary concerns of the City; and for that
purpoſe they ſit daily. They are divided into two
equal parts, 18 for the Summer, and 18 for the
Winter. If one of the Winter dies, thoſe of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
elect one into his place out of the 100, and
<hi>vice verſa.</hi> The great Council of 136 judge in cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
cauſes. Thoſe of the leſſer Council have five
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:98511:227"/>
                        <hi>Batz</hi> [about 10 <hi>d.</hi> or 1 <hi>s. Engliſh</hi>] and thoſe of the
great Council two Batz <hi>per diem</hi> for every day they
ſit in Council. All the people of the territory of this
city are Subjects, and divided into 19 or 20 <hi>Proefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturoe:</hi>
the number of fighting men about 18000.
The Subjects in time of peace pay no more tribute
than 5 Batz or a hen the man <hi>per annum</hi> to the
<hi>Lanivogt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From <hi>Lucern</hi> we travelled to <hi>Zugh</hi> called in <hi>Latine
Tugium,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">April. 6. Zugh.</note> about 15 miles.<note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Canton of <hi>Zug.</hi>
                        </note> This City is by one half
leſs than <hi>Lucern;</hi> it ſtands by the ſide of a little lake.
The Government of this Canton is popular like
thoſe of <hi>Vri, Switz</hi> and <hi>Vnderwalden.</hi> Beſides the
City there are 3 <hi>Communes</hi> which have an intereſt in
the government, <hi>viz. Eyry, Menſinguen</hi> and <hi>Baar.</hi>
They have a Council of 40 (as they told us there)
but according to <hi>Simler</hi> of 45; 9 out of each Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
and 18 out of the City. The 3 <hi>Communes</hi> have
the <hi>Landamman</hi> 6 years and the City 3. So that when
the <hi>Landamman</hi> is of a <hi>Commune</hi> he continues in
Office but two years, when of the City three years.
When one of the Council dies another is choſen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his place by major vote of all the males above 18
years of age of the City or that Community to which
he that died belonged. The Magiſtrates are the ſame
and elected in like manner as in <hi>Vri</hi> and <hi>Switz,</hi> &amp;c.
All the <hi>Praefecturae,</hi> (which are in number eight) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the City only. The City together with its
ſubjects can arm 4000 Souldiers: the 3 Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
not 2000. Yet are they obliged by ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
to bear two third parts of the charge in caſe
there be nay war. In criminal cauſes they have 12
Judges taken out of the Council, 3 of the City and
3 of each Community. In civil the Senators judge
in their ſeveral Communities. To the general <hi>Diet</hi>
at <hi>Baden</hi> the City ſends one and the three Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
another. The nomination of the common
<hi>Lantvogts</hi> the City hath once and the Communities
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:98511:228"/>
twice. When the <hi>Landamman</hi> is of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he is obliged during his Office to reſide in the
City.</p>
                     <p>The lake of <hi>Zugh</hi> hath great variety of fiſh, more
then any other lake of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> if the people
there may be believed. They named to us <hi>Eels,
Carps, Perches, Trouts, Salmons,</hi> which is very ſtrange,
there being no way for them to get thither but up the
<hi>Rhene,</hi> and ſo they muſt have a courſe of above 500

portico's or Cloyſters on each ſide. It lies ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
out in length upon a hill which I may call a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninſula,</hi>
it is ſo almoſt begirt about with the river.
On that ſide where it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed

This Church is one of the handſomeſt ſtone-fabrics

into 60 <hi>Praefecturae</hi> or Bailyages, beſides 4 which are
common to them with <hi>Friburg.</hi> For this reaſon there
muſt needs be many rich men in the City, though
they have but little trade. The <hi>Landtvogts</hi> or Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs
continue in office 6 years, during which time
they enrich themſelves well; yet do not their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
complain, but acknowledge themſelves well

Bears in a pit. Theſe Bears I obſerved to climb the
firr-trees growing in the pit, and delighting to ſit
on the tops of them like birds on a perch. The Arms
of the Town is alſo a Bear, which they took I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

                        <note place="margin">18. Lauſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. Morges.</note> a great Town and an Univerſity, and
from <hi>Lauſanna April 19.</hi> through <hi>Morges</hi> a large
Town, <hi>Rolle</hi> and <hi>Nion</hi> conſiderable Towns by the
lake of <hi>Geneva's</hi> ſide and <hi>Verfoy</hi> a little Town on the
lake near <hi>Geneva,</hi> belonging to the <hi>French,</hi> and came
to our lodging at <hi>Geneva,</hi> where we reſted and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
near 3 months.</p>
                     <p>The Governments of <hi>Soloturn. Bern</hi> and <hi>Friburg</hi>
are much like that of <hi>Lucern.</hi> In <hi>Soloturn</hi> the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the leſſer Council is 35, and of the greater
115. When one of the 35 dies, the 34 remaining
chuſe one into his place out of the 115. When one
of the 115 dies or is advanced the reſt chuſe one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his place out of the number of the Citizens. In
<hi>Bern</hi> the greater Council conſiſts of 200, and the
leſſer (as we were told there) of 42, though <hi>Simler</hi>
makes them but 26. Theſe Councils are choſen by
20 Electors and the <hi>Scultheſs, viz.</hi> the four <hi>Signiferi</hi>
of the City and 16 whom they pick out of the whole
body of the Citizens and joyn with themſelves. In
<hi>Friburg</hi> the leſſer Council is of 24 and the greater of
200. When one of the leſſer Council dies they chuſe
one into his place out of the greater: and when one
of the greater dies or is removed the leſſer (as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
them) chuſe one into his place out of the
number of the Citizens. All theſe Cities have 2
<hi>Sculteti</hi> or Conſuls who rule <hi>alternis annis.</hi> He that
deſires a more full and particular account of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of theſe Cities may conſult <hi>Simler de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub.
Helvetiorum.</hi> Each of the Cantons have ſome
Saint or other to be their Patron and protector,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:98511:229"/>
whoſe image the popiſh Cantons ſet on the reverſe of
their monies, <hi>v. g. S. Oſwald</hi> a King of <hi>England</hi>
Protector of <hi>Zug.</hi> In their Church they have his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
and have ſet up his image on horſeback. The
Proteſtant Cantons are <hi>Zurich, Bern Baſel, Sehaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſſe,</hi>
part of <hi>Glaris</hi> and part of <hi>Appenzel.</hi> That
which moſt frequently breeds differences a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
among the Suitzers is the buſineſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>vogties</hi> or Bailywicks. For moſt of theſe [I
mean the <hi>Dutch</hi> ones] being of the reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
are oppreſſed and injured by the Popiſh <hi>Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vogts,</hi>
the Proteſtant Cantons not knowing how ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to help and relieve them or retaliate. For the
Popiſh Cantons being more in number than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
they ſend <hi>Lantvogts</hi> to theſe places twice to
the Proteſtants once. This one of the Miniſters of
<hi>Zurich</hi> told me wad <hi>fundi ſui calamitas,</hi> and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the two late breaches among them. The <hi>Switzers</hi>
on each ſide are very ſtiff in their Religion; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
not permitting or tolerating one Proteſtant, nor
the Proteſtants one Papiſt in their proper territories.
Though the Cantons adhering to the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> are more in number, yet the reformed are
much the greater, beſides that their land is better,
very like to ours in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the better Souldiers, and good reaſon they
have, being more exerciſed in War, ſerving the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Kings, as being of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Beſides, the <hi>Zurichers</hi> who anciently had
the reputation for valour, are now much given to
merchandiſe and to accumulate riches, and ſo taken
off from martial ſtudies and exerciſes. The <hi>Berneſe</hi>
though they have far the greateſt and beſt territory
of all (ſo that it's ſaid they can arm as many men
as the Dutchy of <hi>Milan;</hi> ſend into the field 100000
Souldiers and yet leave enough at home to till the
land) yet have they no reputation for Souldiers; they
loſt their credit quite in the late skirmiſh with the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:98511:230"/>
                        <hi>Lucerneſe,</hi> who account them rather <hi>Savoyards</hi> than
<hi>Switzers.</hi> All the Cantons of <hi>Switzerland</hi> coyn
money except <hi>Appenzel, Vnderwald</hi> and <hi>Glaris,</hi> of
which <hi>Glaris</hi> formerly hath coined though now it
doth not. All the Swizzers in general are very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
people, king and civil to ſtrangers. One may
travel their Countrey ſecurely with a bag of gold in
his hand. When we came to out Inns they would be
troubled if we diſtruſted them ſo far às to take our
Portmanteau's into our lodging-chambers and not
leave them in the common dining rooms. They keep
their houſes very clean and polite like our good
houſewives in <hi>England.</hi> For plants, going from
<hi>Zurich</hi> to <hi>Mellingen</hi> we obſerved common <hi>Gooſeberry</hi>
in the hedges and by the way-ſides very plentifully,
and in ſome places <hi>Barberries. Sigillum Solomonis</hi> and
<hi>Herba Paris</hi> are the moſt common plants that grow
in this Countrey in the woods and hedges every
where: <hi>Anonymus flore Coluteae</hi> on the mountains
near <hi>Zurich.</hi> From <hi>Arauw</hi> to <hi>Soloturn Helleboraſter

                     <p>
                        <hi>Geneva</hi> is pleaſantly ſeated at the lower end of the
<hi>Lacus Lemanus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Geneva.</note> now called <hi>Genffer-zee</hi> or the lake
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> upon a hill ſide reſpecting the lake; ſo
that from the lake you have a fair proſpect of the
whole Town. It is divided by the river <hi>Rhodanus</hi> or
<hi>Rhoſne</hi> into two parts, which are joyned together by
two wooden bridges, one of which hath on each
ſide a row of houſes after the manner of <hi>London<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
only they are low. The two principal and
indeed only conſiderable ſtreets in the Town are the
low ſtreet [<hi>Rüe bas</hi>] which runs along by the river
and lakes ſide: and the high ſtreet or great ſtreet
[<hi>Rüe grand</hi>] which runs up the hill. The City is
indifferently ſtrong, and they have lately been at
great expences to fortific it <hi>alla moderna</hi> with ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:98511:230"/>
and baſtions of earth. Though it be but ſmall
yet is it very populous, being ſuppoſed to contain
30000 ſouls, St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Church, formerly the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral,
is handſome and well-built, and in it
is a ſtately monument for the Duke of <hi>Rohan.</hi> The
Citizens are very buſie and induſtrious, ſubſiſting
chiefly by trading: the whole territory of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public
being not ſo great as ſome one Noblemans
eſtate in <hi>England</hi> for extent of land. All proviſions
of victuals are very plentiful and cheap at <hi>Geneva,</hi>
eſpecially milk-meats, the neighbouring mountains
feeding abundance of cattel.</p>
                     <p>The tops of <hi>Jura, Saleve</hi> and other high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Savoy, Daulphiny</hi> and the <hi>Alps,</hi> where they
are bare of wood, put forth very good graſs ſo ſoon
as the ſnow is melted off them, which uſually is
about or before mid-May. And then the Countrey
people drive up their cattel to paſture, and feed
them there for three months time. Upon theſe hill
tops they have heer and there low ſheds or dairy
houſes, which ſerve the men to live in and to make
their butter and cheeſe in, ſo long as they keep their
beaſts above. The men I ſay, for they only aſcend
up thither and do all the dairy work, leaving their
wives to keep houſe below; it being too toilſome
for them to clamber up ſuch high and ſteep hills. By
reaſon of theſe cotes it is very convenient ſimpling
upon the mountains, for if a man be hungry or
thirſty he may ſoon find relief at one of them. We
always found the people very kind and willing to
give us ſuch as they had, <hi>viz.</hi> brown bread, milk,
whey, butter, curds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which we could ſca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>For the temper of the air in reſpect of heat and
cold <hi>Geneva</hi> I think is very like <hi>England,</hi> there being
no great exceſs of either extreme. The City is well
governed, vice diſcountenanced, and the people ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
really better or at leaſt more reſtrained then in
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:98511:231"/>
other places: Though they do take liberty to ſhoot
and uſe other ſports and exerciſes upon the Lords
day, yet moſt of their Miniſters diſallow it and
preach againſt it.</p>

bigger than <hi>Geneva</hi> but not ſo populous. The
number of Inhabitants at preſent being about
25000, of which two third parts are Papiſts and
one Proteſtants. The Proteſtants have 2 Churches
(Temples they call them) in Town. The ſtreets of
this City are very narrow, ſhort and crooked, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any uniformity or beauty at all, ſo intricate that
its half a years work to underſtand them all, and
learn the way from place to place. The houſes are
many of them well built of free ſtone, which were

handſome ſtreets. No large Piazza or market-place
in Town. The number of Apothecaries in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
City is ſcarce credible, there being 130 ſhops,
and yet all find ſomething to do: Their <hi>Cypres pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
ſweet bags, Caſſolets, Treacle, Confectio. Alkermes
&amp; Hyacinthi</hi> having a name all <hi>France</hi> over. The
Queen of <hi>Hungaries</hi> water (as they call it) made
heer is likewiſe much bought up. It is nothing but
common Spirit of Wine in which Roſemary flowers
have been macerated, diſtilled from the ſaid flowers.
The wines heerabout are very ſtrong and bear wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

depth, ſomewhat above the wine they ſet ſticks
croſs the pot, and having reatly many little plates of
Copper, they lay upon the droſs ſticks firſt a layer of
the prepared Grape-ſtalks, then a layer of copper
plates, and ſo alternately S S S till the pot be
full. In the middle of the pot they uſually leave a
hole all along for the vapour of the wine to aſcend;
neither are the copper plates laid near together for
the ſame reaſon. When they have filled up the pot
they cover it, and ſet it in a cellar, and after ſome 5

filled with olive pouce they lay on a heap in the preſs
and letting down the preſs-beam, ſqueeze them at
firſt without any mixture. Then winding up the
beam they take out the baskets, and into each one
put a good quantity of ſcalding water, (which they
have always ready) and ſhaking the basket mingle it
with the pouce and then piling them one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
as before, preſs them down a ſecond time.
This ſecond operation they repeat again, and then
taking out the pouce put in new and proceed as
before. The oil together with the water runs out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
veſſels ſet to receive it. The water with the <hi>Amur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
ſinks to the bottom, and the oil ſwims above it,
which they take off with a copper diſh like a fleeting

milk. The water mixed with the red juyce of the
olives becomes red and thick, not at all mingling
with the oil, ſo that it cannot eaſily the leaſt drop
of it be taken up without perceiving it. Its ſaid that
in <hi>Provence</hi> they ſpread their olives on a floor after
they are gathered, and there let them reſt 30 days to
dry, and for that reaſon their oil is better than that
of <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Others lay them on a heap a while to
let them ſweat, as they call it. It is worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that though the olives be very bitter and of a
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:98511:242"/>
firy ungrateful taſte, yet the on which is drawn from
them is ſweet; the like is obſerved in bitter Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
and it is very likely might be in all other
bitter fruits; which is a ſufficient proof that the taſte
of ſuch fruits doth not inhere in the oil, at leaſt
which is made by expreſſion; and it deſerves exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
whether the chymical oil may not alſo be
deveſted of the taſte of the vegetable from which it
is extracted.</p>
                  <p>Olives when they come to maturity change colour
and become black as ſome other plums do, but it is
very late in the year firſt. They are then notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of a horrid and ungrateful taſte, firing the
throat and palate of one that eats them. They afford
moſt oil when fully ripe, but beſt (as they told us)
when gathered and preſſed green. Sometimes they
pickle ripe olives, but they will not laſt; therefore
thoſe which they pickle to ſend abroad are gathered
green. The pickle they uſe is nothing elſe but a brine
of ſalt and water.</p>

                        <hi>September</hi> 1. We intended to have ſeen the Coral-fiſhing
heer, but the windy weather hindred us. The
Sea muſt be very calm and ſmooth, elſe it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for them to fiſh for it. It grows downward (as
the urinators told us) under the hollow rocks, and
not upwards as trees. I believe rather that it grows
indifferently either upwards or downwards accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ſituation of the rocks.</p>

The engine they uſe to get it is a great croſs of
wood ABCD, that at the middle E hath a huge
weight of lead made faſt to it and at each end
<figure/>
A, B, C, D, a round net. To the lead at E is faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a long rope. They go out in little boats and let
down this croſs; and when they have found a rock
at the bottom of the Sea, he that manages the rope
thruſts it into the hollows, getting in one or two of
the legs, and if there be any coral it entangles in
the nets at the end of the croſs, by which it is torn
off and brought up. The natural colour of the coral
while it is alive and growing to the rocks is a pale
carneous; but when the ſcurf (which anſwers to
the bark in trees) is rubbed off, it is red. The Coral
that dies or is broken off from the rocks loſes that
carneous ſcurf or bark in the Sea and becomes red,
though ſometimes it gets a greeniſh white ruſt. They
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:98511:247"/>
ſay it is 50 years before it comes to its full growth:
but that I conceive is an ungrounded conjecture.
They ſometimes but very rarely find branches of
three or four pounds weight. It rots, dies, grows
light, worm-eaten and full of holes like wood. They
all affirmed it to be hard and not ſoft as it grows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
water, contrary to the current tradition of the
Ancients, <hi>Moliis fuit herba ſub undis.</hi> I believe the
outward ſcurf or bark may be ſoft, it eaſily crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
off afterwards, which might give occaſion to
the fable. They told us that a piece of Coral (having
the carneous ſcurf upon it) wetted is juſt the ſame as
when it is firſt taken out of the Sea. The beſt Coral
rude as it is found is worth a Piſtol the pound, or
two or three pieces of eight: Poliſhed and wrought
into beads, bracelets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> it is ſold
for 30, 40 and ſometimes 60 ſols (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſo many pence)
the ounce. They find heer white coral alſo but very
rarely.</p>
                     <p>Near <hi>C. de Creux</hi> upon the mountains they find a

3. We paſſed by <hi>Aulot,</hi> where we ſaw a <hi>Bufalore,</hi>
of which there are divers in that Town. It is a hole
or cave out of which continually iſſues a cool air.
They keep bottles of wine, fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a little houſe
built over the cave. The wine heer kept drinks as
cool as if it were kept in ice or ſnow. They ſay that
it is the water running and falling down under the
ground that makes theſe <hi>Spiracula,</hi> which is not
unlikely. They are all on the left ſide of the river
as you go to <hi>Vict,</hi> and none on the right. This day
alſo we paſſed <hi>Rhoda</hi> and lay at <hi>Vict,</hi> 7 leagues.</p>
                     <p>4. We went to the hill where the Amethyſts or
Violet ſtones are found diſtant two leagues from <hi>Vict,</hi>
called <hi>S. Sigminont.</hi> On the top of the hill is an her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage
and place of devotion, where S. <hi>Sigminont</hi> a
<hi>Burgundian</hi> King did penance. The Amethyſts are
found lower in the ſide of the hill, Viſcount <hi>Jacque</hi>
is lord of the Soil, and whoever opens a mine pays
him a piſtol and an half <hi>per menſem.</hi> They find the
ſtones by following a vein of reddiſh or black earth,
or a vein in the rock ſo coloured. They are all hexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
and pointed like cryſtal. There are of three
ſorts, the beſt are the blackeſt or deepeſt violet.
2. Others are almoſt quite white. 3. Some, but very
rarely, are found tinctured with yellow, They ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſtick a great many together to the rock like the
<hi>Briſtow</hi>-diamonds; but thoſe are never good: the
beſt are found looſe in the chinks of the rock in a fat
yellowiſh or reddiſh earth. They ſcrape out this
earth with long narrow knives that enter into the
chinks, and then crumble it in pieces with their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to feel for the ſtones. They are afterwards ground
and poliſhed upon leaden moulds after the ſame
manner as cryſtal is. Firſt they uſe the duſt of <hi>Smiril</hi>
or Emery, and at laſt of <hi>Tripoli.</hi> All along the way
to this hill we ſaw abundance of <hi>Arbutus</hi> and <hi>Rbus
coriariorum</hi> called <hi>Rhondo.</hi> In this Countrey they uſe
not bark of Oak to tan their leather, as we do, but
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:98511:248"/>
the leaves and branches of this ſhrub, which they firſt
bruiſe with a perpendicular ſtone, and then mingle
with water, and heating the water luke-warm, ſteep
the skins in it 3 or 4 days. In theſe mountains are
alſo found Emeralds, Gold and other ſorts of mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
and ſtones, but it doth not turn to account to
ſearch for them. Topazes are found in a lake called
the lake of <hi>Silles,</hi> not far from <hi>S. Colonna</hi> near <hi>Girona.</hi>
They find them upon the ſhore of the lake.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Vict</hi> there is a great Market-place,<note place="margin">Sept. 5.</note> and a
Church at a <hi>Covent,</hi> ſaid to have been built by <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne</hi>
when he had diſcomfited the Saracens &amp;
driven them out of <hi>Catalonia.</hi> This night we lodged
at <hi>Moia</hi> having travelled only 3 leagues.</p>
                     <p>We rode within ſight of <hi>Montſerret,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">6.</note> broken at the
top into rocks ſtanding like the teeth of a Saw, from
whence it took its name. There is a Chappel of our
Lady, a place of great devotion. This night we
lodged at <hi>Caſa della pobla,</hi> a ſingle Inn, 5 leagues.</p>
                     <p>We came to <hi>Cardona</hi> 2 leagues.<note place="margin">7.</note> All the way as we
rode the rocks and ſtones were full of round holes,
juſt like thoſe in the ſtones at <hi>Ancona</hi> in which the
<hi>Pholades</hi> harbour; and there is no queſtion but theſe
holes have been made by ſome animal before the
ſtones were hardned.</p>
                     <p>We viewed the mountain of ſalt,<note place="margin">8.</note> where were
three Officers, one to weigh the ſalt, another to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
money, and the third to keep accounts.
The Revenue of this Salt amounts yearly to about
30000 pieces of eight. For every Quintal, that is
104 pounds, they pay ten <hi>reals</hi> of two <hi>ſous</hi> to a <hi>real.</hi>
The ſalt is hard and tranſparent like cryſtal, and
when powdred fine as white as ſnow. They hew
it out with axes and mattocks; and make chaplets,
boxes, &amp;c. of it. They ſay there is no end of it, but
that it reaches to the center of the earth. Near the
place where they work there are two caves within the
rock of ſalt, to the end of one of which they never
durſt venture to go.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="471" facs="tcp:98511:248"/>
Not far from this there is another mountain of
ſalt, where the ſalt ſticks to the rocks, and is moſt of
it tinctured with red. Of this red ſalt they make
broad plates like tiles, which they call <hi>Ruggiolas;</hi>
theſe they heat before the fire, but never put them
into it, and uſe them to take away aches, ſtrengthen
the ſtomach, keep the feet warm, &amp;c. Well heated
on both ſides they will keep warm for 24 hours.
Amongſt this red ſalt there is a kind of <hi>Selenitis,</hi>
(which ſome call Iſing-glaſs, and the <hi>Italians Geſſo,</hi>
from the Latin wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>Cardona</hi> is a Dukedom containing 3 or 4 villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
beſides the town. The Duke thereof is one of
the richeſt Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> having 3 Dukedoms,
4 Marquiſates, 2 Earldoms &amp;c. The name of his
family is <hi>Folke.</hi> He lives for the moſt part at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
but ſends every three years a Governour. The
King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath nothing at all to do with this
city: and the Duke never impoſes any taxes, but
hath only all the tithes of the corn, wine, &amp;c. There
is a Council of 36 changed every year, and he that
hath been of the Council muſt wait three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he can be choſen again. The laſt thing the
Council does is to chuſe a new Council for the year
following. This new Council is divided into four
Ranks, not equally, but as the old Council ſhall
think fit; and their names are put into 4 boxes, out
of every box a child takes out one to be Conſul. He
that is drawn out of the firſt box is the firſt Conſul,
and ſo in order. Near the town is a caſtle, and in
the caſtle a tower ſaid to be built by <hi>Charlemagne.</hi>
Every Duke hath an oath given him by the Conſuls,

where are a great many Lead-mines. The oar
is very rich, and they melt it juſt as it is taken out
of the mine, without beating it to powder. They
fell the oar for 40 <hi>Reals</hi> of <hi>Ardit</hi> the Quintal, a
Quintal being 122 pounds: Five Quintals of oar
uſually yield four Quintals of lead. This town and
the mines about it belong to the Duke of <hi>Cardona.</hi>
They told us that the vein of metal lay always Eaſt

fruit grew up in bunches out of the ground like the
berries of <hi>Arum,</hi> and was not much bigger. Thoſe
that were ripe were of a reddiſh colour, of an oblong

very thin, and did but juſt ſerve to cover the ſtone.
It hath the ſmell and taſte of Dates. The ſtones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

they ſawed theſe ſtones to make tables, &amp;c. with
only water and ſand. That when there was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
red in the ſtone they made little holes and
ſet in red ſtones. That the cement they uſed for all
ſtones in Moſaic works was made of one half ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich,
and one half <hi>Greek</hi> pitch. That in building
they joyned the ſtones together with ordinary lime,
but on the outſide they filled up the chinks with a

with ſulphur and <hi>Mangra;</hi> to make it more white
they put in more ſulphur, to make it more red

Conſuls. They are taken by lot out of 6 Urns or
Burſes, two out of each: In the firſt Urn are the
names of all the better ſort of Nobility that have
the title of <hi>Dons:</hi> in the ſecond Urn the names of
all the lower rank of Nobility, that have not the
title of <hi>Don:</hi> in the third the names of all rich
Citizens that are not Gentlemen; they muſt have
al leaſt 400 crowns yearly rent beſides what their
wives bring. Beſides theſe there is a Rationel and
two Syndics changed every third year; ſix Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
for their lives, and 40 Plebeians changed
yearly. The City being divided into 15 Trades or
Companies; each Company chuſes two, which make
30; the other ten are choſen, two by the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
and eight by the ſix Jurats and two Syndics,
each chuſing one. Of all theſe Officers and the 40
Plebeians conſiſts the Senate. But nothing can be
done unleſs there be 29 of the Plebeians preſent at
leaſt. There is alſo 1. a Judge for criminal cauſes,
taken by turns out of the 3 Urns, and changed
yearly. He hath an Advocate to aſſiſt him, who is
changed yearly, but ſo that all the Advocates in
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:98511:251"/>
the City have the place by turns: and a <hi>Lieutenant
criminel,</hi> taken by lot out of the 40 Plebeians. 2. A
<hi>Muſtafa</hi> who has the care of all kind of victuals,
corn, weights, meaſures, &amp;c. He is taken by lot out
of the 3 burſes as the criminal Judge is, and hath
alſo a Lieutenant out of the 40. Moreover there is
a Judge for civil cauſes taken out of the 3 Burſes,
who has an Advocate like the criminal Judge;
but he cannot decide cauſes of above fifteen
crowns.</p>
                     <p>The Univerſity is governed by the Town, who
every third year chuſe a <hi>Rector</hi> that muſt be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.
The other Officers are a Bedel, a Sergeant
and a Puntadore, who is to take notice when any
Profeſſour fails to read. There are eight <hi>Praepoſiti</hi> in
this Univerſity, four for Divinity, two for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law, and two for the Civil Law; who have
each 500 crowns yearly. There are alſo four Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for Philoſophy, ſeven for Phyſic, one for the
Greek tongue, one for the Hebrew, and two for the
Mathematics. Theſe have but ſmall ſtipends, but
all their ſcholars that come to hear their lectures pay
ſomewhat yearly. If a Profeſſor promote 3 rich
ſcholars, that are able to pay the fees, to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
he may promote a fourth that is poor for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
The degrees are the ſame with thoſe in our
Univerſities, viz. 1. Batchelour after they have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a courſe in Philoſophy; which degree coſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
12 crowns. 2. Maſter of Arts, which coſts 80.
3. Batchelour in Divinity, Law or Phyſic, which
coſts 16. 4. Doctor, which coſts 150. They may be
Maſters of Arts preſently after they are Batchelours
if they will, and in like manner Doctors. In the
Market at <hi>Valence</hi> and all <hi>Spain</hi> over they divide
hens and chickens into pieces and ſell them by quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
They make great veſſels of Goats skins to put
wine and oil in, and leſſer bottles which they call
<hi>boto's.</hi> The women paint, laying it on ſo thick as

                     <p>We ſet out from <hi>Valence,</hi> and paſſing by <hi>Maſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sept. 24.</note>
                        <hi>Catareggi</hi> &amp; <hi>Seille</hi> lodged at <hi>Muſſafes,</hi> 3 leagues.
Coming out of <hi>Valence</hi> we were fain to give money
at 3 places to avoid ſearching.</p>
                     <p>We paſſed <hi>Cullera,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">25.</note> where we ferried over a great
river called <hi>Xucar,</hi> and lay at <hi>Gandia.</hi> There is a
College and an Univerſity, as appears by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
upon the wall of the Col. <hi>Sanctus Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcus
à Borgia, Dux Gandiae</hi> 4, <hi>Praepoſitus generalis So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietatis
Jeſu</hi> 3 <hi>hoc Collegium &amp; hanc Vniverſitatem à
fundamentis erexit</hi> A. D. 1546. At <hi>Cullera</hi> the wine
firſt began to be ſweet, and 3 leagues off at <hi>Gandia</hi>
the Plantations of Sugar-canes began. <hi>Q.</hi> Whether
the nature of the ſoil that was fit to nouriſh the
Sugar-canes did not alſo contribute to the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Grapes? At <hi>Gandia</hi> we firſt found raiſins
of the ſun (as they are called in <hi>England</hi>) in <hi>Spain</hi>
they call this kind <hi>Panſas,</hi> and they ſeem to be the
<hi>Duracinae</hi> of the Ancients. They are all white, round,
and have a tougher skin than other Grapes. They
gather them when fully ripe, and dip them in a
boiling <hi>Lixivium</hi> of water and aſhes, juſt dipping
them in, and taking them out again; and then dry
them upon boards in the ſun, taking them in by
night or in foul weather. The name Raiſin comes
from <hi>Racemus.</hi> Figs are dried juſt as they are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
not being dipt into any <hi>lixivium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I went to <hi>Olives,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">26.</note> where and at <hi>Gandia</hi> are the
Engines for Sugar-works, the beſt are at <hi>Olives.</hi> By
the way we ſaw the Sugar-canes growing in ſeveral
places. They are planted in low wet grounds,
well mucked and dreſſed, divided into beds or hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks
are furrows. They cut the canes cloſe to the
roots in <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> and cutting of the
ſlender tops, which afford no good juice, keep them
under ground till <hi>March,</hi> and then prick them into
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:98511:252"/>
theſe hillocks or beds; out of every <hi>talea</hi> or cut ſhoot
4, 5, or 6 canes, which will be ripe the next Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
The knots or joynts of the cane at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
are very cloſe together, ſcarce an inch aſunder,
but upwards the diſtance is more as the cane grows
ſlenderer. Within is a white pulp or pith, full of
ſap, ſweet as honey. They ſell them at <hi>Gandia</hi> to
eat, and cutting them into pieces juſt in the middle
between two knots, ſuck the pieces at both ends.
To make ſugar, after the canes are cleanſed from the
tops and leaves, and cut into pieces, they are firſt
bruiſed either with a perpendicular ſtone running
round, as apples to make cider, or olives to make
oil; or between two axes ſtrongly capped with iron
horizontally placed and turned contrary ways; and
then preſſed as grapes or olives are. The juice thus
preſſed out is boiled in three ſeveral Cauldrons, one
after another. In the third Cauldron it becomes
thick and black, and is then put into conical pots
which at the bottom have a little hole ſtopped only
with courſe and foul ſugar; Mr. <hi>Ligon</hi> ſaith with
Plantain leaves. Theſe pots are covered when full
with a cake of paſt, made of a kind of earth called
in Spaniſh <hi>Gritto,</hi> and found near <hi>Olives,</hi> which is
good to take ſpots out of clothes, which cap or
cover ſinks as the ſugar ſinks. [Mr. <hi>Swift</hi> told me
that the clay they uſe with us is tobacco-pipe clay,
or very like it, and that the water in the clay ſerved
to waſh down and carry away the <hi>Moloſſos,</hi> at leaſt
the clay helps the ſeparation and precipitation of it]
Theſe conical pots are put into other pots, into
which by the hole at the <hi>vertex</hi> the juice dreins
down through the courſe ſugar at the bottom. It
dreins ſo for 5 or 6 moneths, in which time the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
in the conical pots grows hard and white, all
the juice being either drunk up by the lute, or run
out by the hole at the <hi>vertex.</hi> This juice is boiled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
ſo long as it is good for any thing, but at laſt
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:98511:252"/>
it makes only a foul red ſugar that will never be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The conical loaves of ſugar after they are taken
out are ſet to drein over the ſame pots for 14 or 15
days. To make the ſugar more white they muſt boil
it again, but about one ſixth is loſt every time. A
pound, of ſugar of 12 ounces is ſold at <hi>Olives</hi> for
three <hi>ſous</hi> and a half; refined for 5 or 6 <hi>ſous.</hi> The
ſugar-juice is ſtrained through ſtrainers of linnen, as
it is put out of one Cauldron into another. They take
it out of the firſt and ſecond Cauldrons ſo ſoon as it
begins to boil: but in the third Cauldron they let it
boil till the ſcum riſes, and then take off only the
ſcum with a ſcummer, and put it into a long trough
to cool, and when it is cool put it into the conical
pots. One ſcum riſes after another in the third
Cauldron. The ſcum when it is taken off is white,
but turns to a black liquor in the trough. They
never refine the ſugar more than 3 or four times.
They uſe for the refining of it whites of eggs putting
in 2 or 3 dozen into a Cauldron. They uſe but one
Cauldron for refining. When it is refined it grows
white and hard in 9 or 10 days. The juice boiled up
is eaten with bread toſted as honey: The juice of the
refined ſugar is much better than the firſt juice. The
Duke of <hi>Gandia</hi> ſends preſents of this refined juice
to the Queen of <hi>Spain.</hi> When they refine it they
put in a little water into the cauldrons to diſſolve it
the better. But for a more exact deſcription of the
whole proceſs of the Sugar-works, I refer to <hi>Piſo</hi>
in his natural hiſtory of <hi>Braſil,</hi> and <hi>Ligon</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the <hi>Barbados.</hi> The Sugar of <hi>Olives</hi> is
better than the Sugar of <hi>Gandia.</hi> At <hi>Meuttria</hi> in <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi>
they alſo make a great deal of Sugar.</p>
                     <p>About <hi>Valence, Gandia,</hi> &amp;c. the earth is alwayes
wrought, and never lies fallow or idle. They rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
5 <hi>Raccolta</hi>'s or crops in one year. 1. Of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry
leaves for ſilk. 2. Wheat and other European
grain. 3. <hi>Darſi, i. e. Maiz</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat. 4. Grapes.
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:98511:253"/>
5. Olives; and 6. at <hi>Gandia</hi> Sugar-canes. After the
wheat is cut they preſently ſow the <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat.
They complained that lately for a great many years
together they had very vad <hi>Raccolta's</hi> for want of
rain, which had almoſt ruin'd <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We paſſed <hi>Benegana</hi> and lay at <hi>Chativer</hi> ſix leagues

                        <hi>Chativer</hi> is an antient Town of the <hi>Moors,</hi>
and was once head of one of their little Kingdoms.
About a league from the Town began a very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
Aquaeduct made by the <hi>Moors.</hi> It was juſt over
a river along the ſide of a hill, in moſt places not
above a yard or two under ground, and had a great
many funnels juſt like the tops of chimneys to give
vent, and let out the water when there ſhould be
too much. The tops of theſe funnels were made of
a red clay and pebble ſtones. The water came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

one.</p>
                     <p>We paſſed in ſight of <hi>Monteſa</hi> a caſtle belonging

which they burn and put into wine to clarifie
it. About a league from <hi>Orivola</hi> began the Kingdom

an octagonal Chamber vaulted at the top, with 8
doors, one in every ſide. If one ſtand in one angle

in an angle that is not diametrically oppoſite you
hear nothing. The reaſon of the conveying the voice
is the vault above, and the corners being ſtreightned
into a very ſharp angle or channel. In <hi>Granada</hi> are
two great Market-places, one called <hi>Plaſſa nova,</hi> the

                     <p>We paſſed <hi>Les fontes</hi> and lay at <hi>Euia,</hi>

We travelled this day 9 leagues.</p>
                     <p>We paſſed over the river <hi>Xenil</hi> that runs into

                     <p>The moſt conſiderable places in <hi>Cordova</hi> are 1.
The Biſhops Palace. 2. The <hi>Cavalleriſca,</hi> where the
King keeps a great many horſes. 3. The ruines of
<hi>Almanſor</hi>'s Palace, the laſt King of the Moors. 4.
Plaſſa di Corridera: 5. The Church of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine
Freres. 6. The great Church, which was
anciently a Moſque. It is large but very low, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by a great many rows of pillars in a quadrate
order, 16 rows one way and 30 another. Upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the pillars are Moors heads carved in the ſtone,
and one or two with turbants on. In the middle of
this Church is the great Chappel where are ſeveral
Biſhops interred. In one of the Chappels that is now
dedicated to S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Moors time was kept a
thigh of <hi>Mahomet:</hi> Round about the corniſh of this
Chappel and that part of the Church next it is an
<hi>Arabic</hi> inſcription. The People complain grievouſly
that <hi>Cordova</hi> is quite ruined and undone by Gabels
and taxes.</p>
                     <p>We left <hi>Cordova</hi> and after a league or two riding
entred the <hi>Sierra Morena,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">27.</note> a miſerable deſolate moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous
Countrey, and lodged at a little village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Adamus;</hi> 6 leagues.</p>
                     <p>We travelled all day through the <hi>Sierra Morena,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">28.</note>
and lay at a village called <hi>La conquiſta;</hi> 9 leagues.</p>
                     <p>In this days journey we ſaw abundance of galls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Ilices,</hi> which were of like bigneſs, figure, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
conſiſtency and other accidents with thoſe that
grow upon Oaks. This day we firſt met with red
wine again which they call <hi>Vino tinto.</hi> We got ſafe
out of <hi>Sierra Morena,</hi> and came to <hi>Almedovar del
campo,</hi> a great Lougar, 9 leagues. About the middle
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:98511:257"/>
of <hi>Sierra Morena</hi> are the bounds of <hi>Caſtilia nova</hi> and
<hi>Andaluzia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We paſſed by <hi>Caraquol,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Octob. 30</note> 
                        <hi>Cividad real</hi> and lay at
<hi>Malagon,</hi> 10 leagues. Between <hi>Malagon</hi> and <hi>Cividad
real</hi> we paſſed over the river <hi>Anas</hi> now called <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana,</hi>
which was there but a little brook. In this
days journey we met with a great many great flocks
of ſheep and goats going towards the <hi>Sierra Morena</hi>
out of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> it being the cuſtom all Summer to
feed their ſheep upon the mountains of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and
in Winter in the <hi>Sierra Morena.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We paſſed by the ruines of an Aqueduct about 4
leagues from <hi>Malagon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">31.</note> then <hi>Yvenas</hi> a good big lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and lay at <hi>Orgas;</hi> 10 leagues.</p>
                     <p>We paſſed through <hi>Toledo</hi> and lay at <hi>Eſquinas</hi>
11 leagues.<note place="margin">Nov. 1.</note> As ſoon as ever we were paſſed the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>erra
Morena</hi> we felt a great change of weather, the
warm air that comes from <hi>Afric</hi> and the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
Sea being ſtopped by the interpoſition of the
mountains This day there was heer a hard froſt
and pretty thick ice. The moſt conſiderable things
in <hi>Toledo</hi> are 1. The bridge over <hi>Tagus</hi> conſiſting of
but two arches, one great one and one little one.
2. The ſhambles, where notwithſtanding the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the day I ſaw abundance of flies, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
the ſtory that there is but one great fly there all
the year. 3. The great Church, where there are
many monuments of Biſhops, but without inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions;
in the <hi>Capella maggior</hi> lie interred two Kings,
and in the <hi>Capella de los Res</hi> four Kings. 4. The
Kings palace. 5. The ruines of a famous Engine to
raiſe up water to the Kings Palace. There is ſo little
of it remaining that it is impoſſible thence to find out
all the contrivance and intrigue of it.</p>
                     <p>Between <hi>Toledo</hi> and <hi>Madrid</hi> the Countrey is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
populous and the ſoil very good. All along the
road from <hi>Sevil</hi> to <hi>Madrid</hi> the common fare is Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets,
red-leg'd Partridges and Eggs: which are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
dear.</p>

We arrived at <hi>Madrid;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2.</note> 6 leagues near the Town
we paſſed over the river <hi>Xarante. Madrid</hi> is very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
well built with good brick houſes, many
having glaſs windows, which is worth the noting,
becauſe you ſhall ſcarce ſee any in all <hi>Spain</hi> beſides.
The ſtreets are very foul and naſty. There is one ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fair <hi>piazza</hi> or market place, encompaſſed round
with tall an uniform houſes, having 5 rows of
Balconies one above another, and underneath <hi>por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticos</hi>

                        <note place="margin">6.</note> all the way
a barren, miſerable, mountainous Country; 11 leagues.</p>
                     <p>We paſſed <hi>Frecedille</hi> and lay at <hi>Aranda</hi> having

of Dominican Freres and a palace of the Duke

leagues. The moſt conſiderable things in <hi>Burgos</hi> are
1. The bridge over the river <hi>Relarzon.</hi> 2. The gate
at the end of the bridge, where are the ſtatues of

good water, <hi>Miranda</hi> a great Town, where there

and lay at <hi>Erminian;</hi> 11 leagues At <hi>Miranda</hi> there
is a great market for wheat.</p>
                     <p>We travelled to <hi>Vittoria.</hi>

<hi>Haec eſt victoria quae vincit;</hi> 4 leagues. <hi>Vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria</hi>
is the chief City of a little Countrey called
<hi>Alaba.</hi> We paſſed this day by <hi>Salines</hi> the firſt Town
of <hi>Guipuſcoa</hi> and lay at <hi>Aeſcurias;</hi> 9 leagues. In <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcoa</hi>
they pay no taxes or other duties to the King
without the conſent of the Countrey. The whole
Province is more commonly called <hi>Provincia</hi> than
<hi>Guipuſcoa;</hi> it is cantoned out into a great many Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations
and Villages, every one of which ſend 1,
2 or 3 Repreſentatives to the general meeting when
there is any public buſineſs. All offices are annual,
and choſen diverſly according to the differing cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of the Towns. The chief Officer in each
town to determine all civil and criminal cauſes is the
<hi>Alcalda;</hi> but from him they may appeal to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Province, ſent by the King every
third year; and from the Governour to the Kings
Council at <hi>Valladolid.</hi> Next to the <hi>Alcalda</hi> are 2
<hi>Regidores</hi> to look after the prices of all commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
a <hi>Bolſer</hi> for the treaſury; a <hi>Medino</hi> for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>Argozils</hi> or Serjeants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They boaſt that they
are the walls of <hi>Spain,</hi> and therefore have many
priviledges. <hi>Guipuſcoa</hi> is under the Biſhop of <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelona.</hi>
In <hi>Guipuſcoa</hi> and <hi>Biſcay</hi> they have a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
language of their own, and therefore ſend
their children to School to learn <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> (which
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:98511:258"/>
they call <hi>Romance</hi>) as we do ours to learn <hi>Latin.</hi>
The Searchers having hindred us we were forced to
travel great way in the night. We were lighted by
<hi>Tias</hi> or <hi>Teas,</hi> which burnt as well and gave as good
a light as torches. When they went out they toſſed
them up and down in their hands, which kindled
them again. Theſe <hi>Teas</hi> (ſo called doubtleſs from
the <hi>Latin</hi> word <hi>taeda</hi>) are very commonly uſed in
this Countrey, and are nothing elſe but baſtons of
wood hacked and cleft, (but ſo as the pieces hang
together) and afterwards ſoundly dried in an Oven
or Chimney. Along the middle they uſe to cleave
them almoſt quite aſunder. They are made of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſorts of wood, of <hi>Robla,</hi> i. e. Oak, <hi>Aiga,</hi> i. e.
but the beſt of <hi>Avellana,</hi> i. e.
Hazel. <hi>I wonder much at this, unleſs they have ſome
way of preparing the wood, by ſteeping it in oil or other
inflammable matter. The taedae of the Ancients were
made only of the trunks of old and ſappy pines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We paſſed by <hi>Mondragone,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">12.</note> where there is a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brica</hi>
of Arms for the King, <hi>Oniate, Legaſpa, Villa
real,</hi> and lay at <hi>Villa franca;</hi> 7 leagues. We left S.
<hi>Adrian,</hi> which is the ordinary road, a little on our
left hand. This Countrey is very populous and well
wooded, all the hills being covered with oaks.
They uſe no ploughs but turn over the ground with
tridents of iron; 4 or 5 of them working together,
and thruſting in their tridents all together, turn up
a yard or two of earth at a time, which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
dreſs and level like beds in a garden. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are ſomething better conditioned than the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;</hi>
richer and far more populous. 1. Becauſe
there is a better government and greater liberty.
2. There is abundance of wood and iron. 3. More
rain than in the other parts of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We paſſed <hi>Toloſa,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">13.</note> and arrived this night at <hi>S. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi>
having travelled 8 leagues. The moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
things in S. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> are 1. The walls and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:98511:259"/>
guns. 2. A great Convent of Dominican Freres in
which there is a famous pair of ſtone-ſtairs, each
ſtep being of one entire ſtone and ſupported only on
one ſide. 3. The haven The Government of S. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian</hi>

is not above 150 or 200, though the town be very
populous conteining about 24000 ſouls. Once in a
year all the names of this 150 or 200 are put into an
urn, and a child takes out 8 to be Electors. Every
one of this 8 chuſes his man. the old Magiſtrates
that are juſt then going out divide theſe 8 that the

deſired, there being a great many Eccleſiaſtical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments

                     <p>Every Winter there are ſeveral whales caught up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this coaſt, they coming hither in Winter and
frequenting heer, as they do upon the coaſt of

                     <p>From S. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> I travelled through <hi>Orogna,
Irun,</hi> on the left hand of which is <hi>Fontarabia</hi> a ſtrong
Fort juſt on the Frontiers of <hi>Spain.</hi> About 1½ league
from <hi>Irun</hi> is the river that parts <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
In the middle of this river is an Iſland where the
Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> met, when <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV
the preſent King married <hi>Philip</hi> the IV his daughter.
The iſland was divided juſt in the middle, and a
houſe built ſo that at the table where they ſate to eat,
the King of <hi>France</hi> ſate in <hi>France,</hi> and the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spain</hi> is in many places, not to ſay moſt, very thin
of people, and almoſt deſolate. The cauſes are
1. A bad Religion. 2. The tyrannical Inquiſition.
3. The multitude of Whores. 4. The barrenneſs
of the Soil. 5. The wretched lazineſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
very like the <hi>Welſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> walking ſlowly
and always cumbred with a great Cloke and long
Sword. 6. The expulſion of the Jews and Moors,
the firſt of which were planted there by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Adrian,</hi> and the latter by the Caliphs after the
Conqueſt of <hi>Spain.</hi> 7. Wars and Plantations. In
all the Towns eſpecially in the South and Weſt parts
of <hi>Spain</hi> a great many ruines of houſes to be ſeen.
Within a quarter of a league of a Town you begin
to ſee ground ploughed, elſe all a wild Countrey,
and nothing but Roſemary, Ciſtus, Juniper, Laven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Broom, Lentiſcus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> growing in the fields,
and on the hills. Little or no hay any where in <hi>Spain,</hi>
they feeding their mules and horſes with ſtraw. At
leaſt one half of <hi>Spain</hi> is mountainous.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not ſo abſtinent as moſt people
take them to be, eating the beſt they can get, and
freely enough if it be at another mans coſt: and in
Inns never refuſing Partridges, Quails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:98511:260"/>
dearneſs if they have but money. Lazineſs and ſloth
makes them poor, and poverty makes them pinch
their bellies and fare hardly. They ſeldom mingle
water with their wine, it being a common ſaying
among them <hi>Vino poco &amp; puro,</hi> though all over
<hi>Spain</hi> the wine is very hot and ſtrong. They delight
much in <hi>Pimentone,</hi> i. e. <hi>Guiny</hi> pepper and mingle it
with all their ſauces. In roaſting of meat they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
uſe dripping pans but draw the coals juſt under
the meat, which though it be not ſo cleanly yet is
the quicker and more thrifty way for ſaving of few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.
They tear Rabbets in ſunder with their hands
when they are almoſt roaſted, and ſtew them in a
pot with water and <hi>Pimentone.</hi> To toaſt bread they
throw it upon the coals. They long and ask for
every thing they ſee, to avoid which a Merchant
that travelled with me was wont to put in ſome
thing into his victuals which they did not love.
They take Tobacco much in ſnuff, and if one take
out a box of ſnuff he muſt give ſome to all the
company. The beſt perſon in the company at
table cuts and tears the meat in pieces, and gives
to every one his ſhare.</p>
                     <p>They are moſt impertinently inquiſitive, whence
you come? whither you go? what buſineſs you
have, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> moſt horribly rude, inſolent and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
uncivil to ſtrangers, asking them, What do
you come into our Countrey for? we do not go into
yours. [This is to be underſtood of the middle and
inferiour ſort of people, many of the Gentry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very civil and well-bred.] Their children are
the moſt unmannerly and ill-bred of any in the
world. The ſons of <hi>French</hi> fathers and <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
women when they are grown up often turn their
fathers out of doors, having many privileges above
them for being born in <hi>Spain.</hi> They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
given to lying. <hi>Almuzzos</hi> and ſuch kind
of fellows not to be believed or truſted in any thing
they promiſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="495" facs="tcp:98511:260"/>
They ride altogether upon mules, and carry their
Portmanteau's before them, for fear they ſhould be
loſt or ſtollen from behind them; they lie between
a high pummel of the ſaddle and an iron hook.
Inſtead of ſtirrops perſons of quality uſe great clogs
of wood of the ſhape of ſhooes without heels.
They cut away the mules hair cloſe to the skin under
the Saddles, and Portmanteau's to avoid galling.
Of this baſtard breed of Animals the males are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

be that they are always bred of a mare and

the reaſon be the ſharpneſs of their urine or the
ſmallneſs of their bladder? 3. They piſs almoſt
always when they go through water. 4. They ſhooe
them with ſhooes a great deal broader than their

they uſually hang a net with provender in it.
Theſe beaſts are better at climbing of mountains
than horſes, have a greater courage to endure long
and hard travel, and beſides are maintained with

                     <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeldom ride alone, but ſtay for a
<hi>troppas</hi> as they do for a Caravan in <hi>Arabia.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
phraſes or forms of ſalutation when they meet
or paſs by one another, are, <hi>Garda Dios voſtes,</hi> i. e.
<hi>vous autres</hi> [God defend you] <hi>A Dios</hi> [adieu]
<hi>Vaga con Dios</hi> [God go along with you.] When
they are angry <hi>Cornuto,</hi> i. e. Cuckold, is the firſt
word, and ſometimes <hi>Cornutiſſimo.</hi> When they
ſpeak to their mules or boys they ſend of errands,
they ſay, <hi>Anda Cornuto,</hi> [Go Cuckold.] When they
refuſe a courteſie, or complement to drink firſt, go
firſt or the like, they ſay, <hi>Non per vita mea,</hi> [no by
my life.] At any thing ſtrange or ridiculous they
cry out, <hi>Cuerpo di Dios</hi> or <hi>di Criſto</hi> [Body of God
or body of Chriſt.] When they call to one to make

<hi>Italian,</hi> they cry <hi>O-yes</hi> juſt as our Criers do in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
When they put off a beggar not giving him
an Alms, they ſay, <hi>Voſtes perdonnè.</hi> [Good friend
pardon or excuſe me.]</p>
                     <p>As for their Religion the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are the moſt

They are to be hired at a very cheap rate. It
were a ſhame to mention their impudence, lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and immodeſt be behaviours and practices. In <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia,
Guipuſcoa</hi> and ſome other places they are
not ſo bad.</p>
                     <p>They are ſo lazy that in their ſhops they will ſay
they have not a commodity rather than take pains to
look for it: not to be hired to carry a Portmantean,
go of an errand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but at an exceſſive rate. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
never tie up any thing they ſell, and if they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
paper, they only rudely mumble up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
in it. Of their fantaſtical and ridiculous
pride, and that too in the extremeſt poverty all
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:98511:261"/>
the world rings. If there be any employment
that you would ſet them about which they think
themſelves too good for, they preſently ſay ſend for
a <hi>French-man.</hi> Indeed the <hi>French</hi> do almoſt all the
work in <hi>Spain.</hi> All theſe beſt ſhops are kept by
French-men, the beſt workmen in every kind are
<hi>French,</hi> and I believe near ¼ or ⅕ part of the people
in <hi>Spain</hi> are of that Nation. I have heard ſome tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
ſay, that ſhould the King of <hi>France</hi> recal all
his Subjects out of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
to be all ſtarved to death.</p>
                     <p>Bread is very ſcarce and very dear in many places
or <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe of the barrenneſs of the ſoil
and want of rain, but chiefly becauſe of the ſloth
of the people in letting a great deal of ground lie
untilled, and in not taking the pains to fetch corn
and bread from thoſe places where there is plenty.
So that in a days journey the price of bread will be
trebled, and in another days journey fall as much
again. This Summer there was a tumult at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid:</hi>
the poor people gathering about the Kings pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
cried out, Let the King live, but let the ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
die; let exactors die, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> juſt as they did
at <hi>Nuples</hi> in the rebellion under <hi>Maſaniello.</hi> Upon
which the King ſent to all the Towns about for
bread-corn, and in two or three days bread was
very plentiful and cheap. All over <hi>Catalonia</hi> bread
was very cheap. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> bread is commended
for the beſt of the world, and well it may be, if as
we have heard, they pick their wheat grain by
grain.</p>
                     <p>At my being at <hi>Madrid</hi> there was an Engineer
there ſent by the Emperour, that had invented a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>low, called by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> a <hi>Sembrador,</hi> to
ſow corn at equal diſtances, and one grain in a hole;
the deſcription whereof hath been ſince publiſhed in
the <hi>Philoſophical Tranſactions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all kind of good learning the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:98511:262"/>
behind the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> underſtanding nothing at
all but a little of the old wrangling Philoſophy and
School-divinity.</p>
                     <p>The people are much diſcontented all over <hi>Spain,</hi>
complaining of Taxes, evil Counſellours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
they have a good opinion of and age generally well-affected
to their King, whoſe intentions they ſay
are very good.</p>
                     <p>As for their habit and dreſs in that they are to be
commended that they are conſtant to the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions,
though they be not the moſt convenient
that might be deviſed. To change for the better I
think it rather commendable than blame-worthy;
but to change out of meer levity or an apiſh imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of others is fooliſh and unreaſonable. They
wear great hats with broad crowns and the top
breader than the bottom. Their hair moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
but eſpecially when they travel, they tie up
in a knot behind, aud ſometimes braid like womens.
Their bands lie upon black collars juſt of the ſame
bigneſs or a little bigger. They are joyned to the
collar and they put on collar and band together.
They wear very much Cambrick half-ſhirts, and
have their ſleeves open before and behind both Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Summer; they have great skirts upon their
doublets. Their breeches are very ſtreight and cloſe
to their thighs, and buttoned down on each ſide,
and reach a little lower than the knee. They wear
very ſlight-wrought black ſilk-ſtockins, that the
white linnen-ſtockings which they wear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
may be ſeen through them. Their ſhooes
juſt fit for their feet, very light and thin, with low
heels. Over their doublets they wear a cloſe coat or
jerkin with open ſleeves like the doublet, and for
the moſt part with hanging ſleeves like childrens,
yet never reaching lower than their skirts: a very
long ſword, and a ſhort dagger hanging juſt behind
them, and at laſt over all a cloak with a great cape.
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:98511:262"/>
The women wear great Vardingales, ſtanding ſo far
out an each ſide, that to enter in at an ordinary
door they are fain to go ſide-ways: when they go
abroad are covered with a vail of black having only
a hole left for one eye. The poor people wear
ſhooes made of packthread.</p>
                     <p>The moſt noble ſport in <hi>Spain</hi> is the <hi>Jeu de Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau,</hi>
or Bull-fighting, practiſed at <hi>Valentia, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
&amp;c. At <hi>Madrid</hi> 3 times in the year, where in
the Market-place a brave Don on horſeback, and
a great many pages on foot fight with a wild Bull:
When one Bull is killed or much wounded they turn
in another. Seldom but ſome of the pages are kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
And with theſe cruel and bloody ſpectacles
the people are much delighted, as were the <hi>Romans</hi>
of old in the time of Heatheniſm.</p>
