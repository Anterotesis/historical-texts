            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

theſe Doctors imagining to hide

wax, a two-handed ſword. But for to
ſupply the Scriptures want, there is
a Tradition and unwritten Word,
which they cauſe to be received with
like credit and certainty as the very
Word of God. And with this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and cunning, the Pope hath ſet
up himſelfe in the Temple of God,
and hath changed the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
into Idolatry, ſuperſtition and
falſe Doctrine; cauſing the people to
receive whatſoever he ſaith and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
as the very Word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God, though they be things
directly contrary to the ſame: which
things, by the grace of God, I ſhall
make plainly appeare by many places
of the Word of God, and neceſſary
conſequences drawne out of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as touching the darkneſſe of
the Scripture which they ſuppoſe, for
to hinder the ſimple people from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65094:15"/>
the ſame: I ſay that in this very
thing, they truely ſhew themſelves to
be thoſe blinde and incredulous ones
of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes when he
ſaith, <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to
them that are loſt: In whom the God of
this World hath blinded the mindes of
them that beleeve not, Leſt the light of the
glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image
of God, ſhould ſhine unto them,</hi> 2. Cor. 4.
ver. 3. 4.</p>
               <p>If the Word of God be dark, it is
not in regard of it ſelfe, but of men
that are blinde by nature in things
that are of God.<hi> The natural man,</hi>ſaith S.<hi> Paul, receiveth not the things of

becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,
1. </hi>Cor. 2. 14. And, our Lord teacheth
us, that they<hi> which are not of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
heare the Word of God, </hi>Joh. 8. 47.</p>
               <p>The Word of God is not dark to

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65094:15"/>
God, that they may know the things

Secondly, The Pope and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
teaching that the Word of
God containeth not all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to Salvation, ſhew themſelves
wholly and abſolutely adverſe to
Saint<hi> Paul: </hi>theſe words are plain to<hi>Timothy: The holy Scriptures, </hi>ſaith he,<hi>are able to make thee wiſe unto Salvation,
through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.
All Scripture is given by inſpiration of
God, and is profitable for doctrine, for
reproofe, for correction, and for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in righteouſneſſe, That the Man of
God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed
unto all good works, 2. </hi>Tim. 3. 15. 16. 17.</p>
               <p>The written Word of God, hath
the vertue and power to ſave ſoules;
S.<hi> James </hi>teacheth the ſame when he
ſaith,<hi> Receive with meekneſſe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
Word, which is able to ſave your
ſoules, </hi>Jam.<hi> 1. 21. If you continue in my
Word, </hi>ſaith Chriſt,<hi> You ſhall know
the truth, and the truth ſhall make you
free, </hi>Joh. 8. 31. 32. <hi>Theſe things are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65094:16"/>
written, </hi>ſaith S.<hi> John, that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Sonne
of God, and in beleeving you may have
life through his name, </hi>Joh. 20. 31. The
written Word of God therefore
containeth all things neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and it is a needleſſe thing to
have recourſe to mens Traditions.</p>
               <p>Againe, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him in vain, teaching for doctrines
the commandements of men,</hi> Mark. 7. 7.
He would not therefore have men to
take upon them to make laws &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
in his Church: But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that al ſhould ſubmit themſelves
to his doctrine and Commandements
contained in his Word, <hi>without either
adding unto it, or diminiſhing from it,</hi>
Deut. 4. 2. Apoc. 22. 18. 19. <hi>The fear
of this people,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is towards me
through the commandements of men,</hi>
Eſay 29. 13.</p>
               <p>In a word, Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
in many places doe ſend us to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65094:17"/>
written Word of God, but never to
an unwritten word, or humane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:
But rather on the contrary,
S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the faithfull to take
heed leaſt they be ſurpriſed by the
Traditions and vain deceits of men.
<hi>If any man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yea, even an Angel
from Heaven, preach unto you any other
Goſpel than that which you have received,
let him be accurſed,</hi> Galat. 1. 8. The
written Word of God therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
all that which is neceſſary to
ſalvation: and conſequently, we need
not ſeek after any other unwritten
Word for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Moreover, We doe not reject all
kind of Traditions, but onely ſuch as
are contrary unto the Word of God,
or invented by men for to impoſe a
yoake upon the conſciences of men,
which God hath not impoſed.</p>
               <p>The true Church, groundeth no
Articles of faith upon the Traditions
of men, but upon the Word of God.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65094:17"/>
But our Adverſaries build their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of faith upon the Tradition and
the unwritten Word onely, which
they preferre before the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and ſet it up far above the ſame.
<hi>Gabriel de S. Maria,</hi> in his treatiſe of
the <hi>Authority of Scripture,</hi> chap. 7. pag.
162. ſaith, that If we doe compare
the Tradition with the written
Word of God, we ſhall finde that
the Tradition excels it infinitely, for
that it hath more neceſſity, more
light, more firmeneſſe, and more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
than the written Word of
God.</p>
               <p>The Church of God uſeth ſome
Traditions, but ſuch as are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto the Word of God, and
which doe not impoſe a yoake upon
the conſciences of men: But the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which
(as our Adverſaries ſay) excel the
Word of God infinitely, are directly
contrary unto the ſame and impoſe a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65094:18"/>

which God hath not impoſed; which

A doctrine which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
unto the word of God, as
I ſhall prove it hereafter out of

out of the VVord of God,
and neceſſary conſequences drawn
out of the ſame.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, they teach
that our Works doe diſpoſe and
prepare us to obtain the grace of
God. But now, I aske of them,
whether we doe good Works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we be in grace, or whether we
doe them after? yea or no. If they
ſay that we doe them before; they
know that men naturally are dead
in ſinne; I prove it by this expreſſe
text out of Saint <hi>Paul: And you</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>being dead in your ſinnes,
and through the uncircumciſion of
your fleſh, hath he quickned together
with him; having forgiven you all
treſpaſſes,</hi> Coloſ. 2. 13. Now even
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65094:27"/>
as a dead man cannot doe ſo much
as to ſtir his fingers end, unleſſe
he be raiſed againe: So a man
dead in ſinne, cannot doe any good
work, unleſſe God raiſe him firſt,
and regenerate him inwardly by
his ſpirit. The ſame Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
it plainly in another place,
ſaying, That <hi>it is God which worketh
in us both to will and to doe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13.</p>
               <p>The holyeſt men, though endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſpirit of God, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
accompanied with his
grace, have alwaies acknowledged
themſelves to be ſinners, and very
unable to doe good works. Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh thus of himſelfe,
and alſo of all others in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>For I was alive without the Law
once: but when the Commandement
came, ſinne revived, and I died. I
am carnall, ſould under ſinne, I know
that in me (that is, in my fleſh)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65094:28"/>
dwelleth no good thing: For to will is
preſent with me, but how to performe
that which is good, I finde not. For
the good that I would doe, I doe not:
but the evill which I would not, that
I doe,</hi> Rom. 7. 9. 14. 15. 18. 19.</p>
               <p>Is it not then a meere ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
foolery, to teach, that a man
deſtitute of the Grace of God,
may doe any good work to obtain
Grace, ſeeing that theſe which
have this Grace already, doe not
doe the good they would, but doe
the evill which they would not,
having alwaies ſome corruptions
of the fleſh oppoſing the deſires
of the ſpirit? And therefore they
muſt confeſſe, that we doe good
workes after we have received
Grace: whence it followeth that
their Doctrine is falſe, as I prove
it by this argument.</p>
               <p>If we doe good works after we
are received into Grace: Then it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65094:28"/>
followeth, that our works doe not
diſpoſe us to obtaine that Grace
which we have already, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which we cannot apply our

fully and perfectly ſatisfied the

               <p>THat which our Adverſaries
teach concerning ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
is, That God relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
unto the ſinner all the guilt,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65094:29"/>
and forgiveth him the eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment

will have it turn'd into a Temporal

our Juſtification, nothing were
found but the forgiveneſſe of ſins,
it would be perfect mercy; but that
there is ſome other thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the juſtice of God appeareth.
To be ſhort, The Doctrin of theſe
Doctors, is, that God (for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of his juſtice) wil have
the juſtified ſinner to ſatisfie Gods
juſtice for the Temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his ſinnes: otherwiſe, his
juſtice is not ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is an old wile of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
which he hath alwaies practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by his falſe Prophets, to ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and bury as much as in him
lyeth, the meanes whereby God is
pacified with us, and his juſtice ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſatisfied. Therefore I aske of
them, whether Chriſt hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65094:29"/>
to the juſtice of God, or no?
If he hath not ſatisfied <hi>it, he</hi> is not
our Saviour, and we are ſtill in
our ſinnes, lyable to the curſe of
the Law, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 13. But if Chriſt
hath ſatisfied the juſtice of God
for ſinne; it followeth, that it is
ſatisfied; and declared in this alone
ſatisfaction of his; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
that it is a vain and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
thing, to deſire to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the ſame again.</p>
               <p>Now that Chriſt hath ſatisfied

               <p>
                  <hi>He hath born our griefes, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
our ſorrowes. He was wounded
for our tranſgreſsions, and bruiſed

that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for

but not for that Temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<hi>That there is no condemnation to

Therefore there is no puniſhment

Therefore there is no puniſhment

Epheſ. 2. 8. 9. And in the Epiſtle
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>All have
ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of
God, being juſtified freely by his Grace,
through the redemption that is in
Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3. 23. 24. It is
not therefore by paying on our

freely to acquit and diſcharge

for it to the uttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Again, if God doe forgive
the ſinnes of his children in ſuch
ſort as he will remember them no

not be ſatisfied with temporall
puniſhments. But the firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
is true. <hi>I will forgive their
iniquity,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and I will
remember their ſinne no more,</hi> Jerem.
31. 34. Eſay 43. 25. Heb. 10. 27.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the laſt alſo, and therefore
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65094:32"/>
there remains no puniſhment for
the juſtified ſinner.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Moreover, Jeſus Chriſt our
Lord hath ſatisfied the juſtice of
God for us, either fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
or imperfectly and in part
onely, yea or no. If fully and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
then it followeth that he
hath ſatisfied it aſwel for the guilt,
as for the puniſhment of ſinne: and
by conſequent, that we ought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſatisfie it for the one, nor
for the other. If inperfectly and
in part onely: it followeth, that
he is our Saviour but in part; for
he is not our Saviour, unleſſe he
hath fully ſatisfied the Juſtice of
God for us.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Again, Whatſoever is done
by ones ſelfe, is not done by an
other: But Jeſus Chriſt our Lord
hath purged our ſinnes by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith Saint Paul, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by himſelfe purged our ſinnes,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65094:33"/>
ſate downe on the right hand of the
Majeſty on high,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. It is not
done therfore but by Chriſt. And
if the purgation of ſinnes be not
but by Chriſt; it followeth, that
it is not done by Temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
and Humane ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But the Antecedent is true,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> the Conſequent alſo. And
therefore to deſire to ſatisfie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the Juſtice of God, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
too much the worth and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the blood of Chriſt, and
to eſteeme his ſatisfaction as a
thing of nought. For it is he only
that was able to ſatisfie the ſame,
for them that have obtained free
mercy. And to alledge as they
doe, that the Phyſicke is prepared,
but that we muſt drink it: That it
is true, that we receive all good
things from the blood of Chriſt,
but we muſt apply it, is to no
purpoſe. For our penall works
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65094:33"/>
are not the means wherby we may
apply unto our ſelves the vertue
and efficacy of the blood of Chriſt.
It is by faith that he is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and applyed unto us. For as
the body is fed and nouriſhed by
means of the corporall mouth,
that receiveth and apprehendeth
the food. So the ſoule is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and ſuſtained by Faith that
receiveth and apprehendeth our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his merits,
by which onely means Chriſt is
applied unto it for it's ſpirituall
food.</p>
               <p>In a word, I maintain that it is
altogether impoſſible for a man to
ſatisfie the Juſtice of God. Yea,
even for all men put together, to
ſatisfie it for the leaſt ſinne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the guilt, or for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
For God is infinite, he
therefore that offends him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
an infinite and an Eternall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65094:34"/>
puniſhment. Puniſhments ought
to be according to the offences:
And the offences, according to the
quality of the perſons offended.
And to alledge, that Eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
are turned into Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
is as vain and ridiculous.
For Gods Juſtice being infinite,
cannot be ſatisfied but by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
puniſhment. And if God
through his mercy remits any
thing unto the ſinner, he will not
doe it by halfes.</p>
               <p>Therefore they conſider the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of God, and the deſert of
ſinne very ill, when as they think
to be able to ſatisfie the ſame, and
that by ſuch means, as ſhould open
the gates of Heaven to the rich,
rather than to the poore. For the
principall means they appoint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
man to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice
withall, for the puniſhment of ſins,
is to buy pardons and indulgences
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65094:34"/>
of the Pope, and give to the
Churh; the which indeed the rich
may do, but not the poore. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it will follow, that we muſt
ſay quite contrary to that which
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the poore,
for to ſuch is the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
Math. 5. 3.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries doe bring in
ſome places of Scripture to prove
their pretended ſatisfactions; but
againſt their true ſence: as that of
the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Whom
the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth, and
ſcourgeth every ſonne whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi>
Heb. 12. 6.</p>
               <p>Again, they ſay that <hi>David</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
confeſſed his ſin to <hi>Nathan,</hi>
did nevertheleſſe, bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his ſin, it being ſaid unto
him, <hi>The childe that is borne unto
thee, ſhall ſurely die,</hi> 2. Sam. 12. 14.
and divers other places, where it
is ſaid that God chaſtiſeth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65094:35"/>
I anſwer, That in all theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
there is not a word ſpoken of
ſatisfying Gods Juſtice, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
tryeth his children, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
chaſtiſeth them, not to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his Juſtice, but to correct
them and make them wiſer for the
time to come, ſhewing them and
making them feele how much ſin
is diſpleaſing unto him.</p>
               <p>There is two ſorts of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God; the one of revenge,
the other of correction: by the
one, God puniſheth his enemies,
confounding them in his wrath.
<hi>David</hi> prayeth he might not be
puniſhed in this kind. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>rebuke me not in thine anger, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chaſtiſe me in thy hot diſpleaſure,</hi>
Pſal. 6. 2. By the other of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
God doth not chaſten to
caſt away and to deſtroy, but to
admoniſh his children, and make
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to profit unto repentance. He
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65094:35"/>
chaſtened <hi>David</hi> fatherly, when he
took away his childe, and <hi>Saul</hi> in
Juſtice, in taking away his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from him.</p>
               <p>The Faithfull are alſo called to
ſuffer in this life, for to follow the
ſteps of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.
<hi>For even hereunto were yee called</hi>
ſaith S. Peter, <hi>becauſe Chriſt alſo
ſuffered for you, leaving us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that yee ſhould follow his ſteps,</hi>
1. Epiſt. 2. 21. <hi>All,</hi> ſaith S. Paul,
<hi>that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus,
ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2. Tim. 3. 12.
<hi>In the World yee ſhall have tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
ſaith our Lord to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>John</hi> 16. 33. And in another
place, <hi>Whoſoever taketh not his croſſe,
and followes after me, he is not worthy
of me,</hi> Math. 10. 38. Therefore
the pains and afflictions that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
the Faithfull, are not to ſatisfie
the Juſtice of God, neither for
the guilt, nor for the puniſhment
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65094:36"/>
of ſinnes, but to follow the ſteps
of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

Firſt if a man ought and may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie

               <p>Moreover, I demand of theſe

have fully and wholy ſatisfied for

can a man ſatisfie for another, if

much leſſe for another. But
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65094:37"/>
the firſt is true, therefore the laſt

us that concupiſence remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſtill in a man: but yet they ſay
(for an evaſion) that it is not
ſinne as touching the guilt, but an
inclination and an alluring unto
ſinne, being onely an originall
puniſhment of the ſinne of <hi>Adam;</hi>
wherein they deceive themſelves
groſly: for whatſoever is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion

Exod. 20. 17. Rom. 7. 7. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>In a word, I aske of theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,

onely for to weaken the merits of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and to

               <p>BUt it was not yet enough
for our Adverſaries to
teach men to ſatisfie the
Juſtice of God; and that they may
doe it ſuperabundantly, one for
another: But they maintain more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
That the treaſure of their
holy mother Church, is framed
and repleniſhed with theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant
ſatisfactions: of which
treaſure His Holineſſe is the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,

And it is here that they
make Chriſt a little Saint, that no

they argue, to cloak this Doctrin.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> (ſay
they) about the latter end of their
life, had done ſo many painefull
works, that they had fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
their ſatisfaction: After
that, they ſuffered martyrdome;
this martyrdome was a good work
done in Grace. Therefore it was
ſatisfactory and meritorious. But
ſo is it, that it was not ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for them: for they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
wholly and fully ſatisfied. It
was therefore a worke of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erogation.
And ſo may one ſay
of ſo many other Saints, beſides
the infinite ſatisfaction of the

al the Saints, wherewith is framed
the treaſury of the holy mother

               <p>All this being builded upon
this naughty foundation of their

               <p>Saint<hi> Peter </hi>teaches us that<hi> there

By ſo many expreſſe places of the
word of God, and neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
drawne out of the ſame,
the pretended ſatisfaction of our
adverſaries is caſt to the ground
and cut even to the very deepeſt
roote: as likewiſe their Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
which they have built upon
the ſame foundation. For, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
was invented but for theſe
two ends. The firſt, to ſatisfie the
juſtice of God for the puniſhment
of ſinnes. Now if we muſt not
ſatisfie Gods juſtice for the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment
of ſinnes, as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it clearely: It followeth there
needeth no Purgatory.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is for to intrap and
to catch money from the ſimple
people. For, how commeth it to
paſſe, that the Prelates of the
<hi>Romane</hi> Church, have ſo many
thouſand pounds of yearely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venews?
That one part of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65094:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is incommodated and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
hand; and that the greateſt
part of the people ſtarve with
hunger; but becauſe theſe men
have by divers meanes cunny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catcht
a great part of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
and eſpecially by great
Donations that many have given
at their death, to redeeme their
ſoules from the paine which they
thought to ſuffer in a fire of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie?
For, is there any thing
in the world, which a man will
not give at the very point of death
to free himſelf from going into
a fire for the ſpace of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares? Will a man in that
perplexity care to leave his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
after him miſerable and
wretched, in giving away all his
eſtate, So hee may be exempted
from the torments of that fire,
which, as they ſay, is ſeven times
hotter than our fire is in this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65094:42"/>
world? Thoſe therefore that laid
the firſt foundation thereof, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves moſt ungodly and
full of covetouſneſſe, which is the
roote of all evils, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaith, <hi>Timoth.</hi> 6. 10. as likewiſe
enemies of the glory, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the death and paſſion of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               <head type="sub">That our good works have no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
at all: and that all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

               <p>AS for the merits of works,
we need no long diſcourſe
for to ſhew that they have
none at all; ſeeing that the very
beſt of our works are full of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
being alwaies mingled with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65094:43"/>
ſome corruptions of the fleſh; and
man is ſo ſubject to ſin as that he
doth not the good he would, but the
evill which he would not; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, That
<hi>we are al as an unclean thing, and that
al our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags,</hi>
Eſay 64. 6. Whence it followeth,
that they have no merit at all. For
what can ſuch polluted works that
are ſo farre from that perfection
they ought to have, deſerve at the
hands of God? And though they
were done as they ought, yet could
they deſerve nothing. For a man
deſerveth nothing in doing that
which he is bound to doe. <hi>When ye
ſhall have done all thoſe things which
are commanded you</hi> (ſaith our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>ſay, we are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſervants, we have done that which
was our duty to doe,</hi> Luk. 17. 10.</p>
               <p>Moreover, whatſoever is given
us by Grace and Mercy of God, is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65094:43"/>
not given us by the merits of our
works. <hi>If it be of Grace,</hi> ſaith Saint
Paul, <hi>it is no more of works: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
Grace is no more Grace,</hi> Rom.
11. 6. But the ſalvation of the
Faithfull, and the glory that they
ſhall have in the kingdom of God,
is given them through the Grace
and mercy of God. Therefore it is
not given them by the merits of
their works.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition of this
Argument is alſo proved by many
expreſſe texts out of the Word
of God.<hi> All have ſinned, </hi>ſaith
S. Paul,<hi> being juſtified freely by his
Grace, </hi>Rom.<hi> 3. 23. 24. By Grace are
yee ſaved, and that not of your ſelves;
it is the gift of God: not of works,
leaſt any man ſhould boaſt, </hi>Epheſ. 2.
8. 9. and in another place,<hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the kindneſſe and love of God
our Saviour towards man appeared,
not by works of righteouſneſſe which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65094:44"/>
we have done, but according to his
mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of
regeneration, and renewing of the
holy-Ghoſt, </hi>Tit. 3. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>In a word, whatſoever abſolves
and juſtifies us before God,
from the ſame I ſay, comes all
our merit: But it is the onely
obedience, merit and ſatisfaction
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
and juſtifies us before God.
Therefore, from him alone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
all our merit: and if all
our merit proceeds from Chriſt
alone, then it followeth, that it
doth not proceed from our
works. But the firſt is true: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the laſt alſo.</p>
               <p>Let our Adverſaries now deny
as much as they will, That all our
merit is in one Chriſt alone, and
let them eſtabliſh other merits in
their works: as for our ſelves, we
will remain conſtant to that, being
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65094:44"/>
aſſured that by Chriſt his onely
merits, obedience and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we are abſolved and juſtified
before God: which thing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Eſay</hi> teacheth us when hee
ſaith, That <hi>he was wounded for our
tranſgreſsions,</hi> and that <hi>the Lord
hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi>
Eſay 53. and ſo doth the Apoſtle
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, That <hi>the Mediator
is one between God and man, the man
Chriſt Jeſus: who gave himſelf a
ranſome for all,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 5. 6. and
Saint <hi>John</hi> teacheth it alſo plainly,
when he ſaith, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the
Righteous is the propitiation for our
ſinnes,</hi> 1. Epiſt. 2. 2.</p>
               <p>Now our Adverſaries alledge
certain places of Scripture, which
ſay, that God rewardeth good
works: Wherupon they build this
ſyllogiſme:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Whereſoever there is a reward, there
is merit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:65094:45"/>
But there is a reward to good
works, <hi>Mat. 5. 12. Apoc. 22. 12.</hi>
Therefore there is merit.</p>
               </q>
               <p>I deny the <hi>Major.</hi> For there are
ſome undeſerved rewards. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may promiſe his Son a fine
ſuit of cloathes, if he write a good
coppie: Now that ſonne deſerves
not that ſuite of clothes for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well that coppie. For what
profit cometh to the father there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by?
nevertheleſſe, the father will
give the promiſed ſuit onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of his promiſe. Even ſo
doth God to his children, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Kingdome unto them
without any deſert, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath promiſed it.</p>
               <p>Moreover, a father may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to give the promiſed ſuire
to his ſonne, becauſe of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in doing his coppie well, give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his father content by that
meanes. But none of the faithfull,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65094:45"/>
can doe their duty towards God.
<hi>All have ſinned,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
Rom. 3. 23. and <hi>Whoſoever,</hi> ſaith
Saint <hi>James, offendeth in one point
of the Law, he is guilty of all.</hi> Jam.
2. 10. All therefore are guiltie
of the breach of the whole Law.
For who is he that hath not fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in ſome one point or other
of the Law? And therefore our
Adverſaries are very farre wide
of that pretended merit they doe
attribute to their good workes.</p>

               <p>THeſe Doctors keepe a

Like unto Foxes which
runne into thickets and buſhie

theſe words, <hi>This is my body:</hi> which
they thinke are very cleare to
prove, that the bread is tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated

But I will ſhew in its due place, in

               </p>
               <p>Now I will ſhew what ſlender
cauſe they have to maintaine the
Invocation of Saints departed,
and to teach that Chriſt is not
our onely Mediator with God:
but that all the Saints in heaven
are alſo our Mediators: and that
we muſt draw neere unto God by
them, as wee come neere unto

intreating them to pray for us.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65094:47"/>
A Doctrine which is abſolutely
falſe, as I ſhall prove hereafter
out of diverſe expreſſe places, and
neceſſary conſequences drawne
out of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all then, wee aske of
them one expreſſe text out of the
Word of God, or one neceſſary
conſequence drawne out of the
ſame for the proofe of this doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.
There they ſtand as mute as
fiſhes: Behold then a doctrine
that hath neither prop nor foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in the Word of God, but
is meerely invented by men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Word of God, as I
will ſhew hereafter. And albeit
it were not contrary unto the
ſame; I yet maintaine that it
ought to bee rejected of every
Chriſtian, becauſe it is a vaine
worſhipping of God, to worſhip
him after the Doctrine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of men. As our
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65094:47"/>
Lord Jeſus Chriſt tearmeth it.
<hi>Marke</hi> 7. 7.</p>
               <p>Moreover, I prove that this
doctrine cannot be without great
ſinne. For whatſoever is done
without the Word of God, is
done without faith. <hi>Faith,</hi> ſaith
Saint <hi>Paul, commeth by hearing, and
hearing by the Word of God.</hi> Rom.
10. 17. But the Invocation of
Saints departed is done without
the Word of God: Therefore it
is done without Faith. <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is done without Faith, is ſin,</hi> ſaith
the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. But
the Invocation of Saints departed
is done without Faith: Therefore
the Invocation of Saints departed
is ſinne.</p>
               <p>In briefe, That Doctrine which
teacheth men to pray unto Saints
departed, is contrary unto the
Word of God, that teacheth, <hi>That
we ought to call upon none, but on him
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65094:48"/>
in whom we have beleeved,</hi> Rom. 10.
14. But we doe not beleeve in the
Saints departed; but in one onely
God, Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt.
Therefore we ought not to call
upon Saints departed, but upon
God alone, in whom we beleeve.</p>
               <p>That Doctrine which teacheth
men to goe unto God by his
Saints, as a man goes to the King
by his familiar ſervants, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto the Word of God, which
teacheth us to goe directly to
Chriſt, and that he is the onely
<hi>Way,</hi> to goe to the Father. <hi>Come

not have us then goe unto him by
the Saints departed. <hi>I am,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life; no
man commeth unto the Father but by
me,</hi> John 14. 6.</p>
               <p>That Doctrine which teacheth
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65094:48"/>
that there is divers Mediators
with God, is contrary unto the
Word of God, which teaches us,
That <hi>God is one, and the Mediator
one, between God and Man, the Man
Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>Item, That<hi> God alone knoweth the
hearts of all the ſonnes of men, 1. </hi>Kin.
8. 38.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it followeth, That
the Saints departed doe not know
our prayers, which are made in
the heart; and that by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
it is a vain and an idle thing
to pray unto them.</p>
               <p>The Argument which we draw
out of this place of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
againſt the Invocation of Saints
departed, is thus.</p>
               <p>If there be one onely Mediator
between God and man, to wit,
Chriſt Jeſus: It followeth, That
the Saints departed are not our
Mediators with God, and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65094:49"/>
that it is unprofitable to
pray unto them to pray for us.
But the Antecedent is true; Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conſequent alſo.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries, to put off this
blow, make a diſtinction, ſaying,
That Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this place,
ſpeaketh not of a Mediator of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
but of a Mediator of
Redemption: and therefore that
this place is not brought to the
purpoſe for the Interceſſion of
Saints: a thing which is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
between them and us.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, Firſt, That
they are not able to prove that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of a Mediator of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and a Mediator of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion,
either by any expreſſe
texts out of the Word of God,
or any neceſſary conſequence
drawn out of the ſame: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that it is falſe. Secondly,
That on the contrary, the Word
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65094:49"/>

Jeſuits,</hi> pag. 18. anſwereth, That to
ſay there is one Mediator, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is but one Mediator,
is no good Conſequence; and he
bringeth in for example one that
ſhould ſay, I have a Crown: It were
no good Conſequence to ſay,
Therfore he hath but one Crown.</p>
               <p>But this anſwer comes from a
groſſe ignorance. For that is not
to be able to judge of what is
Conſequent to a thing, and what
is not. Let him learn therefore by
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65094:50"/>
the ſame example he produceth,
that if we aske one, How much
mony have you in your purſe? and
he anſwereth Categorically, I
have one Crown; the Conſequent

one Crown in your purſe.</p>
               <p>Even ſo, I aske how many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
we have with God? and
reading the whole Word of God,
I finde that it ſhews me but one
Advocate with God, which is
Chriſt Jeſus. The Conſequence
is good then, Therefore we have
but one Advocate with God, which
is Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>
               <p>It is then our Jeſuits part to
ſtudy Maſter <hi>du Moulins</hi> Logick,
whereunto he ſends me, ſeeing he
ſheweth himſelf ſo ignorant ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
that he may learn better how
to judge of Conſequences.</p>
               <p>Moreover, God will not give
his glory unto another; <hi>I am,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65094:50"/>
he, <hi>the Lord, ſuch is my name. I will
not give my Glory unto another, nor
my prayſe unto the Idol,</hi> Eſay 42. 8.
He would not have us then to give
unto the creatures that Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which belongeth unto him.
Whereby it doth appeare, That
this Invocation of Saints depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is wholly and abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto the Word of God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no other end but to give un-
the creature the honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that belongeth onely unto the

               <head type="sub">That the Images of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church, are made againſt the
Commandement of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
the adoration which they give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, is meere Idolatry.</head>
               <p>AS for the Images of the<hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>Church, It is certaine
that they are made directly
againſt the Commandement of
God, (as I have ſhewed before)
which in the ſecond Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Law, ſaith,<hi> Thou ſhalt
not make unto thee any graven Image
of any thing that is in Heaven above,
&amp;c. </hi>Exod. 20. 4. And in another
place,<hi> Ye ſhall make you no Idols nor
graven Image, neither reare you up
a ſtanding Image, neither ſhall you
ſet up any Image of ſtone in your
Land, to how down unto it: for I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65094:51"/>
am the Lord your God, </hi>Levit. 26. 1.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries doe anſwer,
That God hath forbidden Images,
for to worſhip them, but not as
touching the repreſentation. But
I will even in that, ſhew that they
tranſgreſſe the Commandement
of God, and commit Idolatry. For
if they cauſe Images to be erected
for to worſhip them: It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that they ſwerve from the
Commandement of God, and that
they are Idolaters. But the firſt
is true; I prove it by the ſecond
Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> That comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ſtraightly to have Images, and
to worſhip them. Beſides, let
any man ſee the books of their
Schoolemen upon this point of
Images, and they ſhall finde them
all reach, That the Image ought
to be worſhipped with the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
making but one adoration
of the Image, and of the thing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65094:52"/>
repreſented by the Image.</p>
               <p>When they ſee themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by their owne Decrees,
Books, and Canons, they ſay, That
the Error is not in the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
by means of the Images, but
by them to worſhip falſe gods, as
the Pagans did; but as for them,
they, by means of the Images, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the true God.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; By this reaſon, the
<hi>Iſraelits</hi> did well to make the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
calfe, and <hi>Moſes</hi> very ill in
breaking of it. For theſe Calves
thought to worſhip the true God
by means of that calfe, <hi>Exod. 32.
5. 6. Ezekias</hi> had likewiſe done ill
in taking away the Braſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
for this people thought to
worſhip the true God, by burning
Incenſe to it, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 18. 4. and
yet God had commanded it ſhould
be ſet up. But it would puzzle our
Adverſaries vilely to ſhew us one
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65094:52"/>
expreſſe place in the Word of
God, wherein it is commanded
to make Images of God for to
worſhip him by them. Theſe men
are like unto thoſe Idolaters
which the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſent to
inhabit the Cities of <hi>Samaria</hi> in
ſtead of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
whom he had brought into <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
Who feared the Lord, and ſerved
their graven Images,</hi> 2. King. 17.
32. 33. 41.</p>
               <p>Again, theſe Doctors alledge,
That they worſhip their Images
diſtinctly; that is, the Images of
God with the adoration of <hi>Latria,</hi>
and the Images of Saints with
<hi>Dulia.</hi> Item, That they make
their adoration paſſe unto the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
object, and therefore they are
no Idolaters.</p>
               <p>But that will not ſerve their
turn: For whoſoever giveth unto
the creature that worſhip which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65094:53"/>
belongeth unto the Creator, is an
Idolater. But the Doctors of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church confeſſe they give
unto the Image (which blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
they ſay to be of God) the
Adoration that belongeth to
God: Therefore they are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Neither can they eſcape, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that their Adoration paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to the finall object: For to
worſhip the creature with the
Creator, is manifeſt Idolatry. And
indeed, were it not Idolatry to
worſhip Images of Gold, of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
of Wood and Stone, with
God, with the ſame Adoration
that belongeth to God? And to
ſay that the Adoration paſſeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the finall object, is as vain. For,
the Image being then firſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped,
at leaſt partaketh with
the Adoration; which is meere
Idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:65094:53"/>
Now, theſe Doctors telling us
(for a ſhift) That the Adoration
paſſeth to the finall object, in that
confeſſe under-hand tacitely, that
they are Idolaters, worſhipping
Wood and Stone, which is the
firſt object of their adoration:
which is an abomination unto the
Lord, who calleth himſelfe a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
God, and that cannot endure
we ſhould any manner of way give
unto the creature the honour
which is due unto Him.</p>
               <p>Many in the<hi> Roman </hi>Church,
(that are not well inſtructed in the
Doctrine of their Doctors) think
aſſuredly, that the adoration of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
is<hi> Dulia, </hi>and the adoration
of the things imagined or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
to be<hi> Latria. </hi>But that is not
their Doctrine. For they make
but one adoration both of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and of the thing repreſented
by the Image.<hi> If we worſhip God,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:65094:54"/>
(ſaith<hi> Panigarole </hi>in his leſſons, pag.
439.)<hi> by means of the Image, God and
the Image are both worſhipped with one
adoration of </hi>Latria.<hi> And if by means
of the Image we worſhip the Saint, both
the Saint and the Image are worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with one Adoration of </hi>Dulia.<hi> But
it will never be proved, That the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Image, is </hi>Dulia,<hi> and that
of the Imagined or repreſented by the
Image is </hi>Latria;<hi> becauſe both are
but one Adoration: </hi>Theſe are the
very words of this Doctor.</p>
               <p>In fine, We aske of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
one expreſſe text out of the
Word of God, or any one neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Conſequence drawne out of
the ſame, where it is commanded
to make Images of God to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him by them. That puts them
into a grievous rage, and makes
them preſently to fall to rayling
inſtead of anſwering.</p>
               <p>We aske them again, who hath
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65094:54"/>
told them, that God may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by Images of Gold, Silver,
Wood and Stone.<hi> God is a Spirit,</hi>ſaith Chriſt,<hi> and thoſe that worſhip
him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and
Truth, </hi>John 4. 24. God is infinite
and incomprehenſible, therfore he
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be repreſented by ſuch mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
and corporall things, it being
an horrible blaſphemy to go about
to repreſent the God-head with
ſuch things. Wherefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet<hi>Eſay </hi>cryeth aloud againſt
ſuch Idolaters;<hi> To whom then will
yee liken God? or what likeneſſe will
yee compare him unto? or to whom
ſhall I be equall, ſaith the holy One?
Lift up your eyes on high, and behold
who hath Created theſe things, </hi>Eſay
40. 18. 25. 26. And the Apoſtle
Saint<hi> Paul </hi>ſaith,<hi> That profeſsing
themſelves to be wiſe, they became
fooles, and changed the Glory of the
uncorruptible God, into an Image
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65094:55"/>
made like to corruptible Man, and to
Birds and foure-footed Beaſts, </hi>Rom.
1. 22. 23.</p>
               <p>This adoration of <hi>Dulia,</hi> which
they give unto Saints, cannot chuſe
but be a great ſinne, and Idolatry:
For this adoration is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any warrant out of the Word
of God, and by Conſequent, done
without Faith, which cannot be
but ſinne and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>In ſumme, Our Adverſaries are
greater Idolaters in worſhipping
of their Images, than the <hi>Pagans</hi>
and ancient Idolaters were. For
thoſe had not the knowledge of
the true God, and were not taught
and inſtructed by his Word. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
They worſhipped the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of things which they beleeved
to be gods; as of <hi>Jupiter, Hercules,
Apollo, Juno, Venus, Diana,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
But theſe Idolaters here,
ſee by the Word of God, how
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65094:55"/>
much Idolatry is in abomination
unto the Lord: and nevertheleſſe,
they worſhip the Images of things,
which as themſelves confeſſe are
no gods, as of the true <hi>Croſſe,</hi> of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> of
Saint <hi>Dominick,</hi> and others: and
are come ſo farre even as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
Tabernacles, Boxes, and ſuch
other like things. But if any man
thinke that I accuſe them wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and lay to their charge that
which they doe not teach: Let
him take the paines to reade their
Canons and Books, and namely,
the Leſſons of <hi>Francis Panigarolle,</hi>
a renowned Doctor amongſt them,
and he ſhall finde, that the <hi>Pagans,</hi>
never came to ſuch a height of
Idolatry.</p>

               <head type="sub">That foure rules ſhew unto us, that
there is a Figure in theſe Words,
<hi>This is my body.</hi> And that the
Tranſubſtantiation of the bread
into the body of Chriſt, is contrary

the humane nature of Chriſt.
<hi>Item,</hi> That in all Sacraments, the

<hi>repreſenteth.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BY that which hath been ſaid
already, It appeareth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That the Doctrine of
our Adverſaries is altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto the Word of God, and
therefore it is no wonder, that they
have forſaken the light, for to hide
themſelves under the darkneſſe of
a Tradition and unwritten Word.
It is true, they boaſt much of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65094:56"/>
theſe Words, <hi>This is my body:</hi> and
make a ſhew to ſticke cloſe to
thoſe Foure ſmall Words of the
Goſpel, upon which words they
will not admit of any Figure or
interpretation, but will take them
at the bark of the Letter, to draw
out of the ſame a Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto the Analogy of Faith,
and that wholy deſtroyeth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt. The which I will prove
by theſe foure rules following,
which will put us out of all doubt;
For they certainly ſhew unto us
when there is a Figure in any place
of the holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, when the matter,
and the circumſtances of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
and ſubſequent words, ſhew
that there is a Figure.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, whether the time
in which it is ſpoken, is to make a
Figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:65094:57"/>
The third, whether underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the place literally and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Figure, there ſhould from
thence ariſe an impoſſible thing.</p>
               <p>The fourth, if taking it literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and without a Figure, there
ſhould follow any abſurdity.</p>
               <p>According to theſe foure rules,
we muſt examine this place, <hi>This
is my body,</hi> and ſee whether there
be a Figure in it or no.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, the matter and
the circumſtances doe ſhew, That
there is a Figure in theſe words,
<hi>This is my body:</hi> For Chriſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting
of a Sacrament. Now,
whatſoever is ſaid in matters of
Sacraments, ought to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
ſacramentally, and not lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.
Again, The circumſtances
of the preceding and ſubſequent
words doe ſhew alſo, that there is
a Figure. For in the foregoing
words, the Scripture ſaith, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65094:57"/>
Chriſt <hi>took bread, brake it, and gave
it.</hi> But it is not given till after the
conſecration: therefore he gave
bread. And to the ſubſequent
words hee addeth theſe words,
<hi>This is my body, which is broken for
you.</hi> But the body of Chriſt was
not broken in the Lords Supper;
no not on the very Croſſe it ſelfe;
therefore they muſt be underſtood
figuratively.</p>
               <p>Moreover, he ſaid, giving the
Cup to his Apoſtles, <hi>This Cup is
the New Teſtament in my blood,</hi> Luk.
21. 20. the which cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
without a Figure: For a
Cup, or that which is in it, is not
a Teſtament ſubſtantially.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item, </hi>he ſaith,<hi> He will drink no
more of the fruit of this Vine, </hi>Mat.
26. 29. He commandeth,<hi> to doe
that in remembrance of him, 1. </hi>Cor.
11. 24. Therefore there is a figure
in theſe words,<hi> This is my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:65094:58"/>
By the ſecond rule it appeareth
alſo, That there is a figure in theſe
words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> For the
time in which Chriſt inſtituted
the holy Sacrament of his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
was the ſame time in which he
would leave the World, and goe to
his Father, as he teſtifieth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
ſaying, <hi>I leave the World, and
goe to the Father,</hi> John 16. 28. <hi>I am
no more in the World,</hi> John 17. 11.
<hi>Yee have the poore with you alwaies,
but me yee have not alwaies,</hi> Mar. 14.
7. But hee willing to have his
Church to make a commenmora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his death, he Inſtituteth a
Sacrament, wherein he ordaineth
bread to be broken, and the Cup
to be diſtributed in remembrance
of him; <hi>Doe this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of me. For as often as yee
eate this bread, and drink this cup,
yee doe ſhew the Lords death till he
come,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. 26. And that, to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65094:58"/>
repreſent unto us, That even as
the bread and wine nouriſheth our
bodies in this Temporall life: So
his fleſh and his blood are the
food of our ſoules in the Eternall
life. Therefore there is a figure
in theſe words, <hi>This is my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the third rule, it appeareth
alſo clearely, that theſe words,
<hi>This is my body,</hi> are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
figuratively. For as it is
impoſſible that twice two be not
foure, but there muſt bee the
firſt odde number umpire: So it
is likewiſe impoſſible, That a true
body be in divers places at once.
But the body of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt is a true body, <hi>Like unto
his brethren in all things, ſinne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 2.
17.</hi> Therefore it cannot be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
places at once.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries would faine
cover themſelves with the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65094:59"/>
of God; but it is in vain:
for the queſtion is of his will, and
not of his power. But it was his
will that his Sonne ſhould take a
true humane body, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
that he ſhould be in one, and
not in divers places.</p>
               <p>It is moſt true, That God is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent;
but he doth not all that
he is able to do. For he could tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the Pope into a monſter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſeven heads, and ten hornes,
and al his Diſciples into Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers:
but he doth not doe it.</p>
               <p>In a word, He will not have the
body of his Sonne to be in divers
places at once, becauſe there would
be in him <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay. Yea</hi> in that
he will have every phyſicall and
compoſed body to be in one onely
place: <hi>Nay,</hi> If he would have the
body of his Son which is ſuch, to
be in ſeverall places at once.</p>
               <p>Moreover, every true humane
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65094:59"/>
body is a materiall ſubſtance, that
hath his naturall and inſeparable
properties, one of which is to be
limited, circumſcribed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in one certaine place.<hi> Take
away from bodies the diſtance of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>ſaith Saint Auſtin,<hi> and they ſhall
be nowhere, and becauſe they ſhall be
nowhere, they ſhall not be at all.</hi>And ſpeaking of the body of
Chriſt, he ſaith, That<hi> if ſome ſpace
be not given unto it that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it after the ſame manner as other
bodies are, its humane nature is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi>Epiſt.<hi> 37. ad Dardanum.</hi>Therefore there is a figure in
theſe words,<hi> This is my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth rule alſo ſhewes us
very plainly, That there is a figure
in theſe words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> For
if we take them literally, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a figure, there followeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
abſurdities.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, That a body like unto
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65094:60"/>
ours in all things, ſinne excepted,
ſhould be in an infinite number of
places at one and the ſame time.
For they teach it is in as many
places as there are Maſſes ſaid:
and that it is whole in every
crumme of the Hoſte, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
drop in the Chalice, and yet
budges not from Heaven: neither
is it in the ſpace which is between
both, and by Conſequent, that one
and the ſelfe ſame body, may be
higher and lower than it ſelfe, and
that there is ſome diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Chriſts body and the body
of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, That a true body
hath all its parts under one point,
having the head where the feet are,
the eyes, mouth, and eares altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and by Conſequent, it hath
a length without extent, that is, a
length and no length.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, That Chriſt did eat
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65094:60"/>
himſelfe, and drank his own body
and blood, ſeeing (after their own
Doctrine) his body is alſo in the
Chalice. And that by Conſequent,
he had his head in his mouth, and
his whole body in his ſtomack, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the inſide out, and the outſide
in, which is a thing more abſurd
than if the ſcabberd were in the
ſword; For being in the ſword, it
were in another thing than it ſelfe.
But theſe Doctors put the body
of Chriſt into the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, That there is a
Chriſt ſuffering, and a Chriſt not
ſuffering: A Chriſt crucified, and
a Chriſt not crucified. For as
ſoone as Chriſt had ſupped, he
went to the Garden of Olives,
where he ſwate greate drops of
blood, was apprehended, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
Crucified. But the ſame that
was in his and the Apoſtles ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks,
did not ſweat great drops
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65094:61"/>
of blood, was not apprehended,
nor crucified: And by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
he was not our Saviour,
ſeeing he hath not ſuffered for us.</p>
               <p>It appeareth therefore plainly
by that which hath bin above ſaid,
That theſe words, <hi>This is my body,</hi>
muſt not be taken literally, but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, our Adverſaries
are ſo wilfull and obſtinate in this,
as to affirme ſtill, That theſe words
muſt be taken literally and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a figure: and that the bread of
the Maſſe, is tranſubſtantiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the body of Chriſt: alledging,
that God is able to doe it: but as
I have ſaid already, the Queſtion
is of his will, and not of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
They ſhould have proved
firſt, That it is his Truth and his
Will, before they goe about to
tell us of his power. There is no
opinion ſo extravagant or fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65094:61"/>
but may be maintained in
ſaying that God is powerfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make it to bee ſo. To
prove a doctrine, onely becauſe
God is omnipotent; is an open
confeſſion of their weakeneſſe.
There be ſome things that God
cannot doe, becauſe he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent.
He cannot lye: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contradict himſelfe. Gods
omnipotencie ought not to be
a cloake unto Error, nor ſerve
as a refuge to falſhood and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
Therefore wee muſt ſee
firſt whether it bee his truth or
no.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> telleth us, that
<hi>Chriſt is like unto his brethren in all
things, ſinne excepted,</hi> Heb. 2. 16.
17. Therefore it is a thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
unto the truth of God, to
teach that he may be in a million
of places at one and the ſame time.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65094:62"/>
For to have a true body, and to be
like unto his brethren in al things,
he muſt be in one, and not in many
places.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Himſelfe tels us that <hi>hee
leaveth the World, and goes to the
Father,</hi> John 16. 28. That <hi>hee is
no more in the World.</hi> John 17. 11.
That <hi>we ſhall have the poore alwayes,
but we ſhall not have him alwayes.</hi>
Marke 14. 7. It is therefore a
thing contrary unto the truth of
God, to teach that he is here on
earth in a million of places at
once. They anſwer to this, that
we have Chriſt no more viſibly:
but that wee have him inviſibly
under the <hi>Species</hi> of the bread and
wine.</p>
               <p>But that will not ſerve their
turne. For, to have Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly,
is ſtill to have Chriſt. That
man were a lyer that ſhould ſay
he had no clothes, becauſe they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65094:62"/>
are hid in a trunke. Even ſo hee
were a lyer that ſhould ſay he had
not Chriſt, becauſe he is hidden
under the <hi>Species</hi> of bread and
wine. But he ſaith expreſly, <hi>Wee
ſhall not have him alwayes;</hi> That <hi>he
leaves the World, and goes to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
Sentences which ſhould be
falſe if he were yet in the world
betweene the hands of a Prieſt
ſaying Maſſe, or lockt up in a pix
or box. And as touching that
which hee ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20.
That <hi>hee ſhall be with us unto the
end of the World:</hi> That is very true:
not according to his Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but according to his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
power and efficacie of the
holy Ghoſt, whereby he guideth,
governeth, and ruleth his Church.
<hi>We have Chriſt alwayes, according to
the preſence of his Majeſty,</hi> ſaith
Saint Auſtin; <hi>but according to the
preſence of his fleſh, it was truly ſaid
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65094:63"/>
unto the Apoſtles, Ye ſhall not have
me alwayes,</hi> Auguſt. 50 Treatiſe
upon Saint John.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
muſt containe him untill the
times of reſtitution of al things, which
God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all
his holy Prophets ſince the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi>
Act 3. 21. It is therefore a
thing contrary unto the Truth
of God, to teach that he is here
on earth below in the hands of a
Prieſt, in as many places as there
are Maſſes ſaid.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the Apoſtles Creed we
beleeve and confeſſe, That <hi>he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into heaven, and ſits at the
right hand of God the Father.</hi> Item,
That <hi>from thence hee ſhall come to
judge the quick and the dead,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a thing contrary unto
the truth of God, to teach that
he is here below on earth in the
hands of a Prieſt, in as many
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65094:63"/>
places as there are Maſſes ſaid.</p>
               <p>But for aſmuch as they alledge,
without any reſpect to Gods truth,
that it is his wil, manifeſted in theſe
words <hi>This is my body:</hi> I wil ſhew
that it is no more his will, which
cannot be contrary to his truth.
For the will of our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt was to inſtitute a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But in all Sacraments there
ſhould be two diſtinct things; to
wit, the ſigne, and the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
the one thing terreſtriall, and
the other celeſtiall. It was his wil
therefore that theſe two things
ſhould be in the Sacrament of the
ſupper, which he inſtituted: that
is, the bread and the wine, which
are the ſigne and the terreſtriall
thing: And his body and blood,
which are the celeſtiall and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
thing. The ſignes received by
the corporal mouth, and the thing
ſignified by faith, according to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65094:64"/>
that which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt
dwelleth in your hearts by faith.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.
3. 17. Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that it was not his will,
that the bread and wine ſhould be
tranſubſtantiated into his body,
which they ſhould ſignifie. And
indeed, he did not ſay, <hi>this is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated
into my body:</hi> but only,
<hi>This is my body.</hi> And that confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mably
unto the ſtyle of the holy
Scripture, which giveth alwayes
to the ſigne the name of the thing
ſignified, uſing in all Sacraments
the word <hi>is</hi> for <hi>ſignifieth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
lyeth upon this word <hi>is,</hi>
to know whether it ought to be
taken properly, or by <hi>ſignifieth</hi>
in this euunciation, <hi>this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi>
I prove that it ought not to
be taken properly, but by <hi>ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.</hi>
Here is my argument. If
in all Sacraments, the ſignes doe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65094:64"/>
beare the name of the things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified:
<hi>Item,</hi> if the word <hi>is,</hi> is put
for <hi>ſignifieth</hi> or <hi>repreſenteth:</hi> It
followeth that the bread and the
wine, which are ſignes in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Lords Supper,
ought to beare the name of the
body and blood of Chriſt. <hi>Item,</hi>
that the word <hi>is,</hi> is put for <hi>ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
or <hi>repreſenteth.</hi> But the firſt
propoſition is true. Here are my
proofes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Circumciſion was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
among the Jewes, that
ſignified the Covenant of God,
as it is ſaid in the 17 of <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
verſ. 10. 2. 4. 7. <hi>Every man-childe
among you ſhall be circumciſed, and
ye ſhall circumciſe the fleſh of your
foreskin, and it ſhall be a token of
the covenant betwixt mee and you.</hi>
But in the ſame chapter this Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
is called the Covenant
it ſelfe, <hi>I will make my Covenant
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65094:65"/>
betweene me and thee. As for mee,
behold my Covenant is with thee. I
will eſtabliſh my Covenant betweene
me and thee.</hi> All that is ſaid of the
Circumciſion; it was then called
the Covenant, of the name of the
thing whereof it was a ſigne. So
Chriſt following the ſtyle of the
holy Scripture, did call the bread
his body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Paſchall Lambe was
alſo a Sacrament among the Jews,
which repreſented the paſſeover
of the Angel that paſſed by in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.
Nevertheleſſe it is called e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the paſſeover it ſelfe. <hi>And thus
ſhall ye eate it: with your loynes
girded, your ſhooes on your feet, and
your ſtaffe in your hand: and ye ſhall
eate it in haſte: for it is the Lords
paſſeover.</hi> Exod. 12. 11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Arke of the Covenant
was alſo a Sacrament among the
Jewes, which repreſented the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65094:65"/>
Lord: but it is called the Lord
himſelfe in the Word of God, as
we ſee in theſe words,<hi> And David
aroſe and went with all the people that
were with him, from Baal of Juda to
bring up from thence the Arke of
God whoſe name is called by the name
of the Lord of hoſtes that dwelleth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it betweene the Cherubins,</hi> 2 Sam.
6. 2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Rock from which came
out waters in the Wilderneſſe,
was alſo a ſigne and a ſacrament
among the Jewes, that ſignified
the refection and ſpirituall food
which the faithfull have in our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt: but it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Chriſt, even by Saint <hi>Paul.
Our Fathers did all eate the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
meate: and did all drinke
the ſame ſpirituall drink: for they all
drank of that ſpirituall rock that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them: and that Rock was Chriſt,</hi>
1. Cor. 10. 3. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:65094:66"/>
                  <hi>P<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anigarolle</hi> in his Leſſons, page
477. deceiveth himſelfe groſſy,
being of opinion that in this place
Chriſt is called a rock, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that this word <hi>Was,</hi> is to be
taken for <hi>being,</hi> and not for <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying.</hi>
1. For if it were the ſence
and meaning of the Apoſtle, he
would not have ſaid that the rock
was Chriſt, but that Chriſt was
the rocke. 2. Alſo he would not
have ſaid in the paſſive tenſe <hi>was,</hi>
but in the preſent tenſe <hi>is:</hi> For
he is alwayes both the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
and chiefe corner ſtone of the
Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To diſcerne the truth, wee
muſt but conſider the words of
the Apoſtle: for hee ſaith That
our Fathers <hi>did all eate of the ſame
ſpirituall meate, and did all drinke
of the ſame ſpirituall drinke,</hi> 1. Cor.
10. 2. But this ſpirituall meate
was the <hi>Manna. Exod.</hi> 16. 15.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65094:66"/>
which he calleth ſpirituall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was a figure of Chriſt:
Likewiſe, this ſpirituall drinke,
was the water iſſuing forth of the
rock. <hi>Exod. 17. 6. Numb. 20. 10.
11.</hi> which alſo he calleth ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
drinke, becauſe its ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was ſpirituall. But as by this
ſpirituall meat, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did
not meane Chriſt himſelfe: So by
this ſpirituall drinke he did not
underſtand Chriſt himſelfe, but
the water that flowed out of the
Rock. It is therefore cleare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
that this Rock whereof
he ſpeaketh, is the ſame whence
the waters flowed in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which he calleth Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was a figure of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The which is plainely ſhewed
in the foregoing words of <hi>Sea,</hi> and
<hi>Cloude.</hi> For the <hi>Sea,</hi> the <hi>Cloude,</hi>
and the <hi>Rock</hi> are uſed in one and
the ſelfe ſame kind, and to one
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65094:67"/>
and the ſelfe ſame end. Even ſo
then as it was a true Sea, and a
true cloude: ſo this Rock was a
true Rock. And it is ſaid it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the people: becauſe the
ſtreames of waters that iſſued
forth of this Rock, followed this
people a long time in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, Chriſt ſaith, That <hi>he is
the true Vine,</hi> John 15. 1. That <hi>he is
the doore of the Sheep,</hi> John 10. 7.
And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the
bread which we break, is the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the body of Chriſt,</hi> 1. Cor. 10.
16. Howbeit the bread is not the
Communion it ſelfe, but a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof.</p>
               <p>As for Baptiſme, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
That <hi>by it we are buried with Chriſt,</hi>
Rom. 6. 4. Col. 2. 12. becauſe it
repreſenteth the death of the old
man, and of our naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:65094:67"/>
But without going from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
whereof we now treat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there is ſufficient matter to ſhew
plainly, That in theſe words, <hi>This
is my body,</hi> the word <hi>is,</hi> is put for
<hi>ſignifieth,</hi> or <hi>repreſenteth:</hi> For
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is my body which
is broken for you.</hi> But if we ſhould
here take this word <hi>is,</hi> properly
and without a figure, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
That the body of Chriſt was
broken at the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper: which is a thing
contrary unto the Word of God,
that ſaith, <hi>He was not broken, that
the Scripture ſhould be fulfilled which
ſaith, that a bone of him ſhall not be
broken,</hi> John 19. 33. 36.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt note, That this
word <hi>is,</hi> is found here twiſe in the
ſame place, and within three words
one of another, viz. <hi>This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which is broken for you, &amp;c.</hi>
Theſe ſubtill Doctors, enemies of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65094:68"/>
figures, will take the firſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and without a figure, in theſe
words, <hi>This is my body:</hi> but in the
words following, <hi>which is broken
for you, &amp;c.</hi> they take it figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſaying, that <hi>breaking</hi> is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the body of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>ſpecies</hi> which cover it,
are broken by the Prieſt, that is to
ſay, the colour, the quantity, the
meaſures. A brave ſubtilty; for
according to this Doctrine, an
arme ſhall be broken, becauſe the
ſleeve that containeth it, is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>But here is yet more. S. <hi>Luke,</hi>
and S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, That <hi>the Cup is the
New Teſtament, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 22. 20.
1. Cor. 11. 25. Out of which we
draw this infallible concluſion. If
the Cup, or that which is in the
Cup, cannot be the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſubſtantially, but onely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally:
It followeth, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65094:68"/>
this word <hi>is,</hi> ought to be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this place for <hi>ſignifieth</hi> or
<hi>repreſenteth.</hi> But the firſt is true;
Therefore the laſt alſo.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries deny the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent:
affirming, That the Cup
or that which is in the Cup, is the
New Teſtament properly, and
without a figure: and perceiving
very well, that the bread is the
Lords body in the ſame kind as
the Cup is the New Teſtament:
and that if the word, <hi>is,</hi> muſt be
expounded for <hi>ſignifieth</hi> or <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth,</hi>
in this enunciation, <hi>This
Cup is the New Teſtament, &amp;c.</hi> that
it muſt be expounded ſo in this
enunciation, <hi>This is my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this hole is too little to
creep out at. For behold, Saint
<hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith, That <hi>this blood is the
blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> Mat. 26.
28. Therefore it is not the New
Teſtament. For even as the foure
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65094:69"/>
corner Cap of a Jeſuite is not a
Jeſuite: ſo the blood of the New
Teſtament, is not the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Adde moreover, that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
tell us, That the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
is founded upon the blood
which they ſay is in the Chalice.
Therefore by their own Doctrine,
it is not the New Teſtament: for
one thing founded upon another,
is not the ſame thing with it.</p>
               <p>In ſumme, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This Cup
is the New Teſtament in my blood.</hi>
Therefore it is not his blood; For
a thing which is in another, is not
the ſame thing in which it is.</p>
               <p>By ſo many expreſſe texts, and
invincible reaſons, is this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
evidently proved: That in
all Sacraments, the ſignes do beare
the name of the thing ſignified;
and that this word <hi>is,</hi> is put for
<hi>ſignifieth</hi> or <hi>repreſenteth;</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65094:69"/>
that the bread and wine,
remaining ſtill bread and wine, at
the Sacrament of the Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
doe beare the name of the
body and blood of Chriſt whom
they ſignifie. And therefore the
meaning of theſe words, <hi>this is my
body,</hi> is, <hi>This ſignifieth</hi> or <hi>repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
my body:</hi> as divers Fathers
have expounded it, and namely,
Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> in theſe words: <hi>The
Lord made no difficulty to ſay, This
is my body, when he gave the ſigne
of his body. Auſtin</hi> againſt <hi>Adimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
chap. 12. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> alſo
in theſe words: <hi>Chriſt having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
bread and diſtributed it to his
Diſciples, made it to be his body, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this is my body,</hi> that is, <hi>the figure
of my body, Tertullian</hi> contra <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi>
chap. 40. Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that this popiſh doctrin is no

than unto his truth manifeſted in

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65094:71"/>
of the ſaid Councels, That Chriſt
did inſtitute the Sacrament of the

in the beginning of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and yet nevertheleſſe, they
are ſo bold and impudent as to
put an <hi>Anathema</hi> upon him that
ſhall ſay that all every one
of the Faithfull ought to receive
under both kindes the Sacrament
of the Euchariſt, by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God. Declaring that
this cuſtome of receiving under
one kinde, ought to be held as a
Law: forbidding every Chriſtian
to beleeve or teach otherwiſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
how theſe Doctors have ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themſelves openly againſt
Chriſt, whom they have Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſed
with the Apoſtle Saint
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65094:72"/>
                  <hi>Paul.</hi> Our Lord, for ſaying unto
his Diſciples when he gave them
the Cup, <hi>Drinke yee all of it:</hi>
Math. 26. 27. And the Apoſtle,
for commanding to every one of
the Corinthians, <hi>to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and ſo eate of this bread and
drinke of this cup.</hi> 1. Corinth. 11.

               <p>Now, becauſe this is ſufficient
to make it appeare that the Pope
is contrary unto Chriſt, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to put off this blow, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Chriſt ſpake to none but
to his Apoſtles, which were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours;
and ſo, that this priviledge
of receiving under both kindes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to Prieſts onely, and not to
Lay men; but they cannot ſhun
it ſo; for if Chriſt command all
his Diſciples to doe that which he
had done in the ſupper: It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that all his Diſciples indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
ought to communicate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>Behold ſome expreſſe texts and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequences drawn out of the pure
Word of God, for the proofe of
our Doctrine, and condemnation
of that of our Adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Our Adverſaries on their part,
produce ſome places, by which
they pretend to prove, that Chriſt
and the Apoſtles have given the
Communion under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of
Bread onely.</p>
               <p>Firſt they produce a place out
of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> who ſaith, That in
<hi>Emaus, as Chriſt ſate at meat with
the two Diſciples, He took Bread, and
bleſſed it, and brake, and gave to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65094:73"/>
them;</hi> and that there is no mention
made that he gave them the Cup.
<hi>Luke</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Moreover they bring in two
other places in the Acts of the
Apoſtles, whereof the firſt ſaith,
That <hi>The Diſciples did continue in
the Apoſtles doctrine, and in the
communion and breaking of bread;</hi>
and the other, That <hi>the Diſciples
were gathered together to break bread.</hi>
Acts 2. 42. and chap. 20. 7. From
which places they doe inferre,
That it is in the power of the
Church to take away the Cup
from the Lay people: ſince in
theſe places there is no mention
made of the Cup, but of the bread
onely.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, 1. That I
have already brought expreſſe
texts out of the Word of God,
whereby it is expreſly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to all Chriſtians to drinke of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65094:74"/>
the cup in the Sacrament of the
Lords Supper: and therefore that
it is not in the Churches power
to take away the cup from the Lay
people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a manifeſt impiety to
make uſe of the Word of God
for to oppoſe and contradict the
ſame word, pulling for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſome texts as it were by the
haire and againſt their true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to eſtabliſh a doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto expreſſe textes: which
is an ordinary thing with theſe
Romiſh Doctors, as appeareth
here in this place, where they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the texts here above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to theſe two expreſſe and
plaine texts. <hi>Drinke yee all of it.</hi>
Math. 26. <hi>Let Every man examine
himſelfe, and ſo let him drink of this
cup.</hi> 1. Cor. 11. 3.</p>
               <p>That even from theſe places
produced by them, no man can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65094:74"/>
that it is in the power of the
Church to take away the Cup
from the people. 1. For in that
of Saint <hi>Lukes,</hi> it is not ſpoken of
the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but of a common repaſt, at
which it was Chriſts accuſtomed
manner to breake the bread with
giving of thanks, as you may ſee
in Saint <hi>Math.</hi> 14. 19. and in S.
<hi>Luke</hi> 9. 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That though the Sacrament of
the Euchariſt were meant in theſe
places, it were no good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to ſay: <hi>In theſe places there is
no mention made, but of breaking of
bread: Therefore there was no wine:</hi>
For under the word <hi>Bread,</hi> the
Scripture ſignifieth all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for life, as you may ſee
in theſe places of the Word of
God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 35. and chap. 43.
31. 32. 34. And though I ſay I
did eate with ſuch a one, It doth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65094:75"/>
not follow that I dranke not with
him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That if in theſe places the
Sacrament of the Lords ſupper be
meant, and there was no wine at
it: It followeth that neither Chriſt
nor the Apoſtles dranke at it,
and conſequently that Prieſts are
no more bound than the Lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to communicate under both
kindes. But <hi>de Raconis</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it in a Treatiſe he made upon
the converſion of <hi>Monſieur de
Colincourt,</hi> page 87. ſaying, That
<hi>the Apoſtles were bound to celebrate
under both kindes of bread and wine
ſeverally, to repreſent the ſeparation
that was made on the Croſſe of the
blood of Chriſt from his body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for to prove their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
theſe Doctors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
ſome places out of the ſixt
of Saint <hi>John,</hi> where there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a word ſpoken of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65094:75"/>
but of Chriſts fleſh given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Croſſe for the life of the
World; not perceiving that by
this meanes they even overthrow
themſelves. For here are Chriſts
words, <hi>Except you eate the fleſh of
the Sonne of man, and drinke his
blood, yee have no life in you. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
eateth my fleſh and drinketh
my blood, hath eternall life.</hi> John 6.
53. 54. If theſe words be meant
of the Euchariſt: It followeth
they deprive the people of life,
taking from them the Cup.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is not enough to
eate the fleſh of Chriſt by faith
under the ſigne of bread, but we
muſt alſo drinke his blood ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
by faith under the ſigne of
the wine, ſeeing Chriſt hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
this holy Sacrament un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
both ſignes of bread and wine;
the one to be broken, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be ſhed or powred forth
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65094:76"/>
in remembrance of him: the which
he chiefly recommended of the
Cup, ſaying, <hi>Drinke yee all of it.</hi>
Math. 26: and even as if he would
have remedied the error that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
crept into the Church;
<hi>viz.</hi> in taking away againſt his
precept, the halfe of that holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
And therefore it is to no
purpoſe to alledge the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie.
For, to eate a morſell of
bread in forme of a Wafer, is not
to drinke Chriſts blood as hee
biddeth it expreſly, ſaying, That
<hi>Except we drinke his blood, we have
no life in us.</hi> John 6.</p>

               <p>BRiefly, whoſoever ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Popes Doctrine, and

plainly, That it tendeth onely to
debaſe the merit and vertue of the
death and paſſion of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt: as you may obſerve by
the Doctrine of their pretended
ſacrifice of the Maſſe. For theſe
Doctors teach, that it is a ſecond
ſacrifice of Chriſt, propitiatory
both for the quicke and for the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65094:77"/>
dead; which is plainly to deny that
the Sacrifice of the Croſſe hath
the power and efficacy to take
away ſinnes, unleſſe it be reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
teacheth us plainly, that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Croſſe, hath at once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſin wholly away, when he ſaith,
That <hi>by the wil of God we are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
through the offering of the body of
Jeſus Chriſt once for all. By one offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
he hath perfected for ever them
that are ſanctified.</hi> And he addeth
yet another ſentence, that cutteth
up this Error by the very roots.
Now, <hi>Where remiſsion of theſe is,
there is no more offering for ſin,</hi> Heb.
10. 10. 14. 18. He meaneth by
theſe things, the tranſgreſſion of
the Law of God. But in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the Croſſe there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe
of theſe things: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is no more oblation for
ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:65094:77"/>
Againſt ſuch cleare places, theſe
Doctors arme themſelves with a
falſe diſtinction of Sacrifice, which
they could never yet prove, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of any expreſſe text taken
out of the Word of God, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Conſequence drawn out of
the ſame. They ſay, that there is
no more bloody ſacrifice for ſin;
but that there is an unbloody ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
according to the order of
<hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> for the continuall
application of the merit of the
ſacrifice of the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>But this diſtinction is not able to
take them off the hooks. For, the
Apoſtle ſaying expreſſely, That
there is no more oblation for ſin,
ſheweth us plainly, That there is
no other propitiatory ſacrifice
for ſinne, of what kind ſoever, but
that of the Croſſe. It is therefore
their part, that goe about to
give the Apoſtle the lye, to prove
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65094:78"/>
that diſtinction, ſhewing by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
texts, or at leaſt by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
conſequences drawne out of
the pure Word of God, that we
ought to ſacrifice againe the body
of Chriſt unbloodily, to apply
the merit of his bloody ſacrifice:
which thing they are never able
to doe.</p>
               <p>For to attaine to this proofe,
ſome of them argue thus: Chriſt
is a ſacrificator after the order of
<hi>Melchiſedeck;</hi> but <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi>
offered an unbloody ſacrifice: for
he offered bread and wine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt after the ſame order,
hath offered an unbloody ſacrifice,
when he hath offered himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Species</hi> of bread and wine.
And therefore the diſtinction of
bloody and unbloody ſacrifice is
true.</p>
               <p>We grant the <hi>Major,</hi> but wee
deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65094:78"/>
upon a falſhood. Wee doe
not finde in any place of holy
Scripture, that <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to God bread and wine. Wee
reade in the 14 of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> verſ. 18.
that he brought unto <hi>Abraham</hi>
bread and wine for to feede and
refreſh him and his men that were
wearied and travayl'd as they came
from the defeat of the Kings: But
there is not a word there that
<hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> offered bread and
wine unto God. And therefore
the concluſion of this argument
is falſe, and by conſequent alſo
this pretended diſtinction of
bloody and unbloody ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Now I will ſhew hereafter wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
conſiſts this order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck,</hi>
according to which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Chriſt is an everlaſting Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficator.
At this preſent, I will
preſſe our Adverſaries upon this
pretended application, which is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65094:79"/>
the laſt refuge of falſhood brought
to the baye upon her back.</p>
               <p>We ſay then that in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
application, our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
grant under hand tacitely, that
the Maſſe is not the ſacrifice of
Jeſus Chriſt. For, if it be but the
application of Chriſts ſacrifice:
It followeth it is not Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
For even as the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a plaſter is not a plaſter; ſo
the application of Chriſts ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
is not Chriſts ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>And here theſe Doctors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
freely againe that the Maſſe
is not Chriſts ſacrifice. For they
ſay that every true ſacrifice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
that the thing offered be
deſtroyed and conſumed: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we build this argument.</p>
               <p>Every true ſacrifice requireth
that the thing offered be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and conſumed. But the Maſſe,
ſay they, is a true ſacrifice: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65094:79"/>
the thing offered in the Maſſe,
is deſtroyed and conſumed.</p>
               <p>They yeeld us that too, but to
their confuſion; for ſay we,</p>
               <p>If the thing offered in the Maſſe,
be deſtroyed and conſumed, and
this thing offered is the body of
Chriſt: It followeth that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Chriſt is deſtroyed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
in the Maſſe. It is not true,
ſay they, but it is the <hi>Species</hi> of
bread and wine that are deſtroyed
and conſumed: that is, the color,
the taſte, the roundneſſe and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the bread and wine. They
confeſſe therefore freely that the
Maſſe is not Chriſts ſacrifice, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he is not deſtroyed, but
onely a ſacrifice of roundneſſes,
of meaſures, of lines, of caſtles
in the ayre, well befitting ſuch a
Religion, wherein all is nothing
but Maske and hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the application of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65094:80"/>
a thing, is not the thing applyed.
As for example, The water of the
Bath is applyed by meanes of the
channel or conduit-pipe: Yet it
is not the pipe. Phyſicke is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
with a cup or veſſel, but it
is not the veſſel: and ſo of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things. But contrariwiſe,
theſe ſuttle Doctors will have the
application and the thing apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be one and the ſelfe ſame
thing. For they ſay that Chriſts
ſacrifice is applyed by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the ſame Chriſt. But they
have not cunning enough yet to
perſwade us that although the
Maſſe were good, it could be both
the Phyſicke and the veſſel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But, ſay our Adverſaries, doe
we an injury to the phyſick by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
it with the veſſell? doe we
wrong to the water of the Bath,
when we receive it by the channel?
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65094:80"/>
doe we wrong to the bloody ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
in applying it by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody
ſacrifice?</p>
               <p>Yea Doctors, ye doe wrong to
the Phyſick, when ye attribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the veſſel the vertue of healing,
which is onely proper to the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke.
Ye doe wrong to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Bath, when ye attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
unto the conduit-pipe the
cure which the water onely work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Likewiſe ye doe wrong to the
ſacrifice of the Croſſe, when yee
attribute to your pretended ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Maſſe the vertue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
ſinnes, as if the other alone
were inſufficient.</p>
               <p>Wee hold therefore, that
Chriſt cannot bee offered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in ſacrifice for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſinnes, without making
voyde the vertue and efficacy of
the ſacrifice of the Croſſe. For
of two plaſters, either the one
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65094:81"/>
is ſufficient to heale the wound, or
both are requiſite and neceſſary.
If the one be ſufficient, the other
is ſuperflous. If both are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
and neceſſary: it followeth
that one is not ſufficient. Let
us ſay then, if there be two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory
ſacrifices for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſinnes, the one bloody,
and the other unbloody: The one
of the two is ſufficient, or both
are requiſite and neceſſary. If the
one be ſufficient, the other is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perflous.
If both are requiſite
and neceſſary: It followes that one
alone is inſufficient. So that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
two propitiatory ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the one bloody, the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody,
is to deny that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Croſſe hath the vertue
alone to expiate ſins.</p>
               <p>The Word of God doth not
teach us that there is two different
ſacrifices of Chriſt, the one bloody
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65094:81"/>
the other unbloody. The Apoſtle
to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> imployeth many
leafes to declare this point, and
treating fully of the Prieſthood
in the Chriſtian Church, he there
makes no mention at all of the
Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>Finally, our Adverſaries affirme
that the Maſſe is an unbloody pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory
ſacrifice inſtituted by
Chriſt, both for the quick and for
the dead. Enquired where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
it: they bring theſe words,
<hi>Doe this.</hi> Admirable proofe! <hi>Doe
this,</hi> that is to ſay, ſacrifice me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
under the kindes of bread and
wine in propitiatory ſacrifice both
for the quicke and for the dead.
That is a good gloſſe. But by
theſe words <hi>Doe this,</hi> Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
to doe that which he did
at the Supper. Therefore they
ſhould have prooved firſt that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65094:82"/>
Chriſt did at the Lords Supper
ſacrifice himſelfe to God his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which he did not doe. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
ſome of them doe go
about to prove it, alleadging the
words which our Lord ſaith in
Saint <hi>Luke, This is my body which
is given for you.</hi> Luke 22. 19.
Where given, ſay they? not on the
Croſſe: for he was not yet there;
but under the <hi>Species</hi> of bread and
wine at the ſame inſtant, and even
while he pronounced theſe words:
Whereupon they conclude that
Chriſt offered himſelf to God his
Father at the ſupper.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that theſe words <hi>which
is given for you, &amp;c.</hi> prove no
manner of way that Chriſt offered
himſelfe to God his Father in the
ſacrament. For he offered onely
to his Diſciples, ſaying unto them
<hi>Take.</hi> But he offereth nothing to
God, he maketh no Elevation of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65094:82"/>
an Hoſte. Moreover, Adoration is
a neceſſary action in all Sacrifices:
but the Apoſtles worſhipped not
the bread which Chriſt gave unto
them, but remained at table with
him: which ſheweth, they did not
think that bread to be tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
into the body of Chriſt.
For otherwiſe, it had been an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
irreverence in them not
to worſhip that which Chriſt did
preſent unto them.</p>
               <p>And for that he ſaith in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
tenſe, <hi>which is given for you,
&amp;c.</hi> we ſee he ſpeaketh often of
his approaching death, as if it
were preſent; <hi>I lay down,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>my life for my ſheep,</hi> John 10. 15.
17. 18. <hi>I leave my life that I may
take it again. Father, I have finiſhed
the work which thou gaveſt me to doe,</hi>
John 17. 4. Nevertheleſſe, there
remained the principall thing, to
wit, his death upon the Croſſe.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65094:83"/>
                  <hi>The Lambe was ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World,</hi> Apoc. 13. 8.
<hi>I ſend you</hi> (ſaith God by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Malachy) the Prophet</hi> Eliah,
Mal. 4. 3. that is, I will ſend you
<hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> which was not
done of long time after. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a thing ſo farre off, was
ſaid as if it were preſent: how
much more ſhall that be thought
preſent, which is to be done at
hand? There is nothing ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in the word of God as the
changing of tenſes: So as very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
the Paſt, or the Preſent, is
taken for the future. Thus Chriſt
ſpeaketh of the Sacrifice of the
Croſſe, on which he gave himſelf
for the life of the World.</p>
               <p>Some others argue thus; All
effuſion of blood for the Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſinnes, is a propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:
But Chriſt ſaith that his
blood is ſhed in the Euchariſt for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65094:83"/>
the Remiſſion of ſinnes: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Euchariſt is a propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That the two firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of this Argument are
falſe, as alſo the concluſion, in the
ſence that our Adverſaries take it
in. Firſt, it is falſe that an effuſion
of blood is a propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for the Remiſſion of ſinnes:
Unleſſe that blood be offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God with the death of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
But Chriſt offered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unto God in the Euchariſt,
nor yet ſuffered death thereat.</p>
               <p>Again, It is falſe that Chriſt
did ſhed his blood in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.
For it was not ſhed, but on
the Croſſe: and it is of that ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>This Cup
is the New Teſtament in my blood
which is ſhed for you.</hi> And to reply
that there is in the preſent tenſe
<hi>is ſhed,</hi> and not in the future <hi>ſhal be
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65094:84"/>
ſhed:</hi> is to no purpoſe. For I have
above ſtopt this paſſage, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of divers places of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures, that this word, <hi>is,</hi>
is oftentimes taken in the Future.
And indeed, the Latine Bible of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the Canon
of the Maſſe, turnes it in the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>qui pro vobis effundetur, which
ſhall be ſhed for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is worthy of Note, to ſee
how our Adverſaries grant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty, that which they ſo
painfully deny. For when we aske
of them, whether Chriſts blood
came out of the veins in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Euchariſt, or no? They
anſwer, It did not come out of the
veins. Then it was not ſhed there,
ſay we. For a thing is not ſhed
while it remaineth incloſed in the
veſſell that containeth it. And
beſides, they call the Maſſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody
Sacrifice. Nevertheleſſe,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65094:84"/>
contradicting themſelves groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they will not give over writing
and affirming that Chriſt ſhed his
blood there. We aske them then,
how, and after what manner it is
ſhed in the Maſſe. They anſwer,
It is ſhed under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the
wine. Then, ſay we, It is ſhed. It
is not, ſay they; It is but the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of the wine onely that are
ſhed. Now I leave it to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all men, whether this be
not with one breath to deny, and
affirme both together. Why then
do they tell us that it is ſhed, for
to tell us preſently after that it is
not ſhed, but that the onely acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of wine are ſhed? They have
bin brought to lay the like abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon theſe words, <hi>which is broken
for you,</hi> being forced to maintain
that the body of Chriſt is broken,
becauſe the <hi>ſpecies</hi> that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain him,
are broken. The concluſion which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65094:85"/>
they draw from this argument, is
alſo falſe. For they conclude, that
the Euchariſt is a propitiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for ſin, both for the quick
and for the dead: which is not ſo,
but onely a Sacrifice of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
for there is but one propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory
Sacrifice for ſinne, which
is that of the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>Now, even as there is but one
onely expiatory Sacrifice, ſo
there is but one onely Prieſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
expiatorily, to wit, Chriſt
Jeſus our Lord. There were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
under the Law, becauſe they
were hindered by death from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining:
but our Lord Jeſus Chriſt
remaining a Prieſt for ever, and
which cannot be hindered by death,
needeth no other Prieſt to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in his roome.</p>
               <p>And it is here that theſe new ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers
labour in vain to prove
their pretended calling: For it is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65094:85"/>
an imaginary charge, which was
never eſtabliſhed by Chriſt, nor
practiſed by the Apoſtles. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
how they argue.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>As
my Father hath ſent me, ſo I ſend you.</hi>
But Chriſt was ſent of the Father
to ſacrifice under the kindes of
bread and wine, after the order of
<hi>Melchiſedeck.</hi> Therefore he ſent
his Apoſtles to ſacrifice under the
<hi>ſpecies</hi> of bread and wine according
to this order; and Conſequently,
hath made them Prieſts.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That if it be falſe that
<hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> did ſacrifice bread
and wine: It followeth, it is as
falſe that Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles
to ſacrifice him under the kinds of
bread and wine: but the firſt is true.
I have proved it already plainely
here above: therefore the laſt alſo.</p>
               <p>But to make the Error of this
allegation appear the more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65094:86"/>
we muſt but adde this to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
propoſition of their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
As Chriſt was ſent of his
Father, ſo he ſent his Apoſtles.
But Chriſt was ſent of his Father
to be a King, a Prophet, and for to
ſacrifice himſelf for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many. Therefore he ſent
his Apoſtles to be Kings, prophets,
and to ſacrifice themſelves for the
Redemption of many. Who ſees
not the error and falſhood of ſuch
a propoſition? This word, <hi>As,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
muſt not be underſtood of
the Kingly, or Propheticall Office,
and Prieſthood of Chriſt. It is a
preſumption and temerity for
men to aſſume unto themſelves
ſuch titles: but onely for the
preaching of the Goſpel, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
of Sacraments, and things
which onely regard the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.
Chriſt gave them not any
other Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:65094:86"/>
And as touching the Order of
<hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> after which Chriſt is
a Prieſt for ever: It is not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the ſacrifices, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the perſons ſacrificing.
The Apoſtle teacheth it plainly,
handling the compariſon between
Chriſt and <hi>Melchiſedeck.</hi> In the
firſt place, he ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 2. That
Melchiſedeck <hi>is by Interpretation,
King of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> and alſo,
<hi>King of Peace:</hi> which are titles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Chriſt, and which the
Prophets alſo give him. For he is
King of Righteouſneſſe, becauſe
he abſolves and Juſtifies us by his
obedience before God his Father.
He is alſo King of Peace, becauſe
that making our peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
he directeth us into the
way of everlaſting peace. The
Apoſtle goes on, and ſaith, That
<hi>this</hi> Melchiſedeck <hi>was without Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
without Mother, and without
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65094:87"/>
deſcent, having neither beginning of
daies, nor end of life: but being made
like unto the Sonne of God, abideth a
Prieſt for ever.</hi> Behold then wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
conſiſteth the agreement and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
between our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt and <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> which is
not in the matter of the thing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed,
but in the Order and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the perſons ſacrificing:
which is proved again plainely in
this, that Chriſt is a Prieſt for ever
after that Order of <hi>Melchiſedeck.</hi>
For if this Order were and did
conſiſt in the pretended ſacrfice
of the Maſſe: Then it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that Chriſt ſhould not be a
Prieſt for ever, ſeeing the Maſſe
ſhall not endure for ever.</p>
               <p>Therefore, Even as the ſame
<hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was not head of any
Order of Prieſthood, but onely a
Prieſt after his own Order under
the Law: So Chriſt the onely
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65094:87"/>
Prieſt under the Evangelical Law,
needeth not to have a company of
Prieſts ſacrificing expiatorily; and
therefore that infinite number of
Sacrificers eſtabliſhed in the
Church of Rome for to ſacrifice
againe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt to
God his Father, ſtandes convinced
of having no calling. Seeing they
have intruded themſelves into that
Office without any commandment
from God, taking unto themſelves
in ſo doing, the honour which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to none but to our Lord
and Saviour: it not belonging at all
unto the crature to ſacrifice the
Creator; or for men ſinners, to
ſacrifice the Lambe without ſin.</p>

               <head type="sub">That S. <hi>Peter</hi> was not eſtabliſhed
by Chriſt head of the Univerſal Church,
and Prince of the Apoſtles, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that the Pope (who challengeth
this Title but as S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor)
hath intruded himſelfe into that office,
without any lawfull calling: and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himſelfe to be Antichriſt, in doing
quite contrary to that which Chriſt
and S. <hi>Peter</hi> did.</head>
               <p>TO be ſhort, It ſeemeth that
our Adverſaries wil be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
no longer: having not
only forſaken the Doctrin, but the
very name alſo, for to take the name
of Catholicks. God in his Juſtice
would not ſuffer that they ſhould
retain the name which belongeth
onely to true Chriſtians, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his word, and truſt in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.
For to be a true Chriſtian,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65094:88"/>
it is not enough to beleeve onely
that there is a Chriſt: but we muſt
rely on his promiſes, and receive
him ſuch as he was given unto us of
the Father, that is, for our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
righteouſneſſe and ſatisfaction
for our ſinnes. But our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
doe not receive him ſo, ſeeing
they have eſtabliſhed their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
in their own works, by
which they thinke to deſerve the
kingdome of God. They will ſay
indeed, that his blood ſhed upon
the Croſſe is our Purgatory: but
they doe eſtabliſh another in an
Imaginary fire. They ſay that the
ſacrifice he made upon the Croſſe
hath taken away our ſinnes: but
they have eſtabliſhed another ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to blot them away againe;
and all againſt the Word of God.
Therefore they cannot boaſt that
they are Chriſtians, but rather An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians,
that have rejected the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65094:89"/>
true Doctrine, for to embrace and
follow the Doctrine of the Pope
of Rome, who oppoſeth and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
himſelf above all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
God, or that is worſhipped: So
that he as God, ſitteth in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God ſhewing himſelfe that
he is God, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p>But for as much as the Popes
Diſciples do cloak this myſtery of
iniquity with ſome places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
wherby they pretend to prove
that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was eſtabliſhed Head
of the Univerſall Church, and
Prince of the Apoſtles; becauſe
they would maintaine the Pope,
who by cunning hath intruded
himſelf into that office: I wil ſhew
in few words that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was
not Prince of the Apoſtles, nor
head of the Univerſall Church, as
they ſay.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, the Word of
God tels us, That our Lord Jeſus
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65094:89"/>
Chriſt is the Head of his Church.
<hi>God hath put all things</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul)
under his feet: and gave him to be
the head over all things to the Church,
which is his body.</hi> Again, <hi>He is the
head of the body, the Church: who is
the beginning, the firſt born from the
dead: that in all things he might have
the preeminence,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 22. 23.
Coloſ. 1. 18. By theſe places it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was not Head
of the Church; For Shee which is
but one body, cannot have two
heads. And it is to no purpoſe to
ſay that Chriſt is the eſſential head,
but that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was the Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
head: For it is ſtill to make a
monſter of the Church, in giving
her two heads.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if S. <hi>Peter</hi> was mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall
head of the Church, and
Prince of the Apoſtles, It muſt be
by the inſtitution of Chriſt: and
if it be by Chriſts inſtitution, this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65094:90"/>
inſtitution is to be found in the
word of God. Moreover, S. <hi>Peter</hi>
muſt needs have exerciſed that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
or elſe it would have brought
a confuſion in the Church. But on
the contrary, the word of God,
ſheweth us, That Chriſt did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<hi>Peter</hi> to bee head of the
Church, nor Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
<hi>Item,</hi> That S. <hi>Peter</hi> did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
exerciſe that office, as I ſhall
prove by theſe texts and reaſons
following.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt point, S. <hi>Paul</hi>
teacheth us, That <hi>our Lord for the
gathering of the Saints, for the work
of the Miniſtery, and for the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his body, hath given ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and ſome Prophets, and ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
and Teachers,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11. And
in another place: <hi>God hath ſet ſome
in the Church: Firſt Apoſtles, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prophets, thirdly Teachers,</hi> 1. Cor.
12. 28. He maketh no mention at
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65094:90"/>
all of any head of the Church, nor
or Prince of the Apoſtles: and yet
theſe are the places where this
principality ſhould have appeared,
being very likely that if Chriſt had
eſtabliſhed <hi>Peter</hi> for head of the
Univerſall Church, and Prince of
the Apoſtles; he would not have
omitted to ſet down this principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the firſt ranke. But having
left it out, it appeareth, That
Chriſt did not ordaine any one for
head of the Church, and Prince of
the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>But let us learn of S.<hi> Peter </hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
whether there ſhould be in
the Church a Prince among the
Apoſtles or no.<hi> I exhort </hi>(ſaith he,

the overſight thereof, not by conſtraint,

the Flocke,</hi> 1. Pet. 5. 1. 2. 3. S.<hi> Peter</hi>therefore did not beleeve that any
Biſhop ſhould be Prince among
the Apoſtles, and have ſpeciall
lordſhip in the Church, as the
Pope and his diſciples do ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſtrife which aroſe
twice among the Apoſtles about
primacy, Chriſt decided their
controverſie, ſaying unto them,<hi> Ye
know that the Princes of the Gentiles
exerciſe dominion over them, and they
that are great, exerciſe authority upon
them; Bus it ſhall not be ſo among you,</hi>Mat. 20. 25. 26.</p>
               <p>The word of God alſo in divers
places recommendeth humility
unto us: to become as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to be poore. Chriſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65094:92"/>
himſelfe for an example there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
unto his Apoſtles: and will have
his Apoſtles to be for an example
unto all the World. That <hi>the ſon
of man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not come to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
unto, but to miniſter,</hi> Mat. 18.
1. 2. 3. and chap. 20. 28.</p>
               <p>When the Apoſtles were ſent
to preach, they were ſent as fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
the which excludeth ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority,
<hi>Math.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Chriſt promiſeth
unto them, <hi>That they ſhall ſit upon
twelve Thrones, Judging the twelve
Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 22. 30. But he
giveth not unto <hi>Peter</hi> a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
place for to preſide, than to
the reſt.</p>
               <p>When the holy Ghoſt deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon them, It was when they
were all in one place, and without
any prerogative, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1. 4.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That <hi>there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between him and them who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65094:93"/>
to be moſt eminent,</hi> Galat. 2. 6.
He did not then acknowledge any
of the Apoſtles to be above him,
as head of the Univerſall Church
and Prince of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Again, he ſaith, That <hi>the Goſpel of
the Uncircumciſion was committed
unto him, as the Goſpel of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
was unto</hi> Peter, Galat. 2. 7.
Behold then, they are equall in the
labor and miniſtery of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles that were at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
hearing that <hi>Samaria</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the word of God: they ſent
them <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John, Acts</hi> 8. 14.
Now, to be ſent, ſhewes no ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
but, at moſt, equality of them
that ſendeth and of him that is
ſent. For the inferiour never ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the ſuperiour. I doe verily
beleeve that the Pope would not
approve of them that ſhould ſend
him to preach in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> was rebuked by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:65094:93"/>
who withſtood him to the face.
The which hee doth after ſuch a
manner, as he ſhewes well enough
that he did not eſteem him as head
of the Church, nor Prince of the
Apoſtles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11. 14.</p>
               <p>It appears therefore by theſe
places that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was not head
of the Univerſall Church, nor
Prince of the Apoſtles. It remains
now to ſee whether he did exerciſe
that place: and whether the reſt of
the Apoſtles have yeelded him the
preheminence.</p>
               <p>At the Councell of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
S. <hi>Peter</hi> propounded his opinion;
but <hi>James,</hi> Biſhop of the ſame place
made the concluſion as Preſident
thereof, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 7. 13. 19. and the
Letters were not diſpatched in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
name, but in the name of the
whole Aſſembly: Nevertheleſſe,
this was the place where S. <hi>Peter</hi>
ſhould have exerciſed this office
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65094:94"/>
of Head and Prince among the
Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> He is accuſed by the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for converſing with the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
He maketh his defence and
excuſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. He was then accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his brethren for what he
did.</p>
               <p>In ſumme, He calleth himſelfe a
fellow Elder with the Elders of
the Church, and exhorteth them
lovingly as his equals, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1.
Therefore he did not think himſelf
Head and Prince amongſt them.</p>
               <p>But let us heare a pleaſant obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which the Popes diſciples do
make for to prove that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was
Head and Prince of the Apoſtles.
S. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſay they, is the firſt named
in the Scripture. He was the firſt
whoſe feet Chriſt did waſh; The
firſt that ſpake at the Councell of
<hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> The firſt after Chriſt
to whom the Angels did ſpeak: all
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65094:94"/>
which prerogatives doe ſhew, that
he was Head and Prince of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
               <p>This Argument deſerves not an
anſwer. For if the firſt-named in
the holy Scriptures, is for that
cauſe the ſuperiour: the laſt named
ſhall be the leaſt and the abjecteſt.
Now, if that be true: <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſhall ſit in the loweſt ranke in
the Church. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe
is poſtpoſed to S. <hi>Peter</hi> by S. <hi>Paul.
Now, this I ſay, that every one of you
ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,
<hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I of</hi> Chriſt,
1. Cor. 1. 12. S. <hi>John</hi> alſo names <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
the laſt; <hi>Philip,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was of</hi>
Bethſaida <hi>the City of</hi> Andrew <hi>and</hi>
Peter, <hi>John</hi> 1. 44. S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
S. <hi>James</hi> before; <hi>James, Cephas,</hi>
and <hi>John who ſeemed to be pillars,</hi>
Galat. 2. 9. Therefore this is but a
meere foppery, brought in a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
cauſe for lacke of better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65094:95"/>
S. <hi>Peter</hi> might be among the
Apoſtles, the firſt in age or in zeale,
or in eloquence, or in vertue and
miracles; but not at all in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality
and ſuperiority of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Moreover, they alledge againe,
That <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to <hi>Peter, Thou art</hi>
Peter, <hi>and upon this rocke will I build
my Church.</hi> Therefore, ſay they
<hi>Peter</hi> was eſtabliſhed the head and
foundation of the Church.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not
build upon the perſon of <hi>Peter,</hi> but
upon himſelfe, and upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Faith which <hi>Peter</hi> had
made: and therefore this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
That S. <hi>Peter</hi> is head and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the Church is falſe. <hi>For
other foundation can no man lay, than
that is laid,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 3.
11. But this foundation which is
laid is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Therefore no
man can lay any other foundation
than <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:65094:95"/>
Againe, Chriſt hath plainely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
<hi>Peter</hi> from the <hi>Rock,</hi>
that is, <hi>Simon Peter</hi> from the <hi>living
Rocke</hi> upon which is builded the
Church. For he ſaith not <hi>ſuper te
Petrum,</hi> but <hi>Super hanc petram,</hi> that
is to ſay, <hi>upon this Rocke,</hi> and not
<hi>upon thee Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, let every one judge
whether it is more convenient the
Church ſhould be grounded upon
<hi>Peter</hi> than upon Chriſt: upon the
Son of the living God whom <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had confeſſed: or upon <hi>Peter,</hi>
who preſently after denied the Son
of the living God: upon him who
hath vanquiſhed Satan, or upon
him whom Chriſt calleth Satan.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 23. Upon him who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

him who was a ſcandal, that is
to ſay, a ſtumbling ſtone.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Popes Diſciples al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

                  </gap> difference betwixt feeding
Chriſts ſheep, and to be Univerſal
Head of the Church, and Prince of
the Apoſtles. Chriſt ſaith not to
him, feed my ſheep univerſally or
ſoveraignly: the ſame commiſſion
of feeding the ſheep is given to all
the Apoſtles. <hi>The holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſaith
Saint <hi>Paul, hath eſtabliſhed you Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
to feed the Church of God, whom
he hath purchaſed with his owne blood.</hi>
Act. 20. 28. <hi>Feed the flock of Chriſt
which is committed unto you,</hi> ſaith S.
<hi>Peter.</hi> 1. Pet. 5. 21.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſpeaketh unto <hi>Peter</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and biddeth him three times
feed his ſheep, becauſe he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
him thrice. Chriſt draweth
three confeſſions from him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
his threefold denying: at the
end of which he is reeſtabliſhed in
the office of a Paſtor.</p>
               <p>Therefore this being prooved,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65094:96"/>
that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was not head of the
Church, nor Prince of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:
It followeth that the Pope
(who challengeth it but as his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor)
hath intruded himſelf into
that office, without any lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
and maintaineth himſelfe
therein by tyranny, doing and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing
that which neither Chriſt
nor <hi>Peter</hi> ever did or practiſed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For neither Chriſt nor <hi>Peter</hi>
ever ſhewed themſelves in <hi>Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calibus,</hi>
crown'd with three crowns:
nor cauſed the Kings of the earth
to kiſſe their feet, as the Pope doth
at this day, having changed the
Chriſtian Religion into Idolatry,
ſuperſtition and falſe doctrines,
contrary unto the Word of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> never exalted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
above men and Angels, as the
Pope doth in that he willeth and

               <p n="3">3. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> never bragged
that he had all power both in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

<hi>Item,</hi> he never gave away the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
of the World, nor (for

for their oath of allegiance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> never cauſed

5. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> never ſtiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

6.</hi> Who in ſo doing, taketh
upon him thoſe titles which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
onely unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Councell of <hi>Florence</hi>
ſaith, That the Pope may add to
the Symbole of the Apoſtles;
which is as much in effect as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
and acknowledge him to be
God. For none but God alone
can add to the Symbole, And
make Articles of Faith in his
Church to bind the conſciences
of men.</p>
               <p>Upon this objection,<hi> De Raco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>maketh a pleaſant anſwer to<hi>Peter </hi>du<hi> Moulin; That which you
produce </hi>(ſaith hee in his triumph
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65094:98"/>
of truth, page 127.)<hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Florence, that the Pope may
add to the Apoſtles Creed: avayleth
nothing. The meaning of it, is only
that he may (whether in a Councell or
out of a Councell) eſtabliſh Articles of
Faith: But not that hee will place
them as thirteenth, fourteenth, or
fifteenth Articles of the Apoſtles
Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctor being ſmitten on
his viſible head, was ſo amazed
with the blow, that he knew not
what he wrote. Maſter du <hi>Moulin</hi>
tels him that the Councell of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
ſaith, that the Pope may add
to the Apoſtles Creed. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hee anſwereth that the onely
meaning is, that the Pope may
make Articles of Faith. Is not
that well anſwered? Doubtleſſe,
if the Pope may add to the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole,
hee may make Articles of
Faith. Therefore he ſhould have
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65094:98"/>
proved firſt that the Pope may
add to the Creed, and then it had
been time for him to tell that he
may make Articles of Faith. But
who hath told him that the onely
meaning is, that the Pope may
make Articles of Faith? What
audaciouſneſſe is it in this Doctor
ſo to reſtraine and wreſt the words
of this Councell, which ſaith in
expreſſe tearmes that the Pope
may add to the Creed?</p>
               <p>Mark therefore that <hi>De Raco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
doth not ſay that the Pope
may not add to the Creed: but, that
the Articles of faith which he may
make, he will not place them as
thirteenth, fourteenth, or fifteenth
Articles of the Creed. I anſwer, it
matters not: ſince the Pope will
have whatſoever he ſaith and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth
in matters of Religion, to
be received with like credit, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and certainty, as the Articles of
the Creed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:65094:99"/>
Moreover, I deny that the Pope
may add to the Creed, and make
Articles of Faith. And it is <hi>De
Raconis</hi> part and the reſt of the
Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to
prove it by expreſſe texts of the
Word of God, or by neceſſary
conſequences drawne out of the
ſame. For lack of which, I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that this alone is ſufficient to
prove that the Pope is Antichriſt,
ſince he takes upon him that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
which belongeth onely to God,
which is to be able to add to the
Creed, and make Articles of Faith
to bind the conſciences of men.</p>
               <p>In a word, if the Pope be wholly
contrary to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
both in doctrine and in manners:
It followes hee is that Antichriſt
ſpoken of in the Word of God;
ſince to be Antichriſt, is nothing
elſe but to be contrary to Chriſt,
But the antecedent is true; I have
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65094:99"/>
proved it already here above as
touching the doctrine. It is as eaſie
alſo to prove it touching man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt
ſhewed himſelfe ſo humble, that
although he was King both of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth, yet would he not
ſhew himſelfe to be ſuch in this
World. He fled unto a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
when the Jewes would have
made him King. <hi>John</hi> 6. 15. He
ſaith That <hi>his kingdome is not of this
World.</hi> John 18. 30. But the Pope
exalteth himſelfe above the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
and above al Kings &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the earth: Therefore he is
contrary unto Chriſt in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſts mind did not runne
upon heaping up treaſures on
earth; but his onely care was to
do the Wil of God his Father. He
teſtifieth That <hi>the Foxes have holes,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65094:100"/>
and the birds of the ayre have neſts:
but he had not whereon to reſt his head.</hi>
Mat. 8. 20. S. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo ſaith, That
<hi>he had neither Gold nor Silver,</hi> Act.
3. 6. But all the Popes care is to
gather up treaſures and riches.
Therefore he is contrary unto
Chriſt in his Manners.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt, willing to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a patterne of humility, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
the feet of his Apoſtles, <hi>John
13.</hi> But the Pope will not be ſo
officious; but on the contrary, he
makes others to kiſſe his feet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly,
out of his pride. Therfore,
he is contrary unto Chriſt in his
Manners.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt was Crowned with a
Crowne of Thornes: but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
his Holineſſe to weare three
Crownes that are not of the like
matter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt went into Cities and
Townes, preaching, and ſhewing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65094:100"/>
the Doctrine of Salvation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.
But the Pope diſpenſeth with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
handſomely from that labour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt commands his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to give for nothing that
which they have received for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 8. But the Pope is
wiſer than ſo, to give any of his
wares <hi>gratis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Chriſt teacheth us, That <hi>if
any man will be his Diſciple and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, that he muſt take up his Croſſe,</hi>
Mat. 10. that is, all manner of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and poverty; denying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
and his affections. But the
Pope followes not this precept:
and by Conſequent, cannot be put
or placed into the number of
Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Chriſt forbids Fornication:
and the Pope ordaineth it, in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
publick Stewes in <hi>Rome</hi> and
other places, that bring him in
great profit.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:65094:101"/>
9. The Pope likewiſe ſhewes
himſelfe contrary unto Chriſt in
greatneſſe and Worldly pompe.
It is an admirable thing to ſee him
in his Pontificalibus, crowned with
three Crownes, or carried upon
mens ſhoulders through the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Rome,</hi> attended with <hi>Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi>
and other guards, both a
Horſe-back and a Foot; and to ſee
the people upon their knees wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
him in the ſtreets.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In a word, The Pope is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
contrary unto Chriſt, in
magnificence of apparell, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
moveables, Horſes, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers;
all which he hath in great
number. <hi>Item,</hi> in meats, drinks,
baths, unctions, corporal delights,
pleaſures, Muſick, Playes, ſports,
and all Earthly contentments.
Wherefore the Conſequence of
my Argument is moſt true, and
therefore none ought to doubt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65094:101"/>
but thar he is that Antichriſt ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of in the Word of God. <hi>Item,</hi>
That that Congregation which
acknowledgeth him for its Head,
is not the Church of Chriſt, but
the Synagogue of Antichriſt, from
which we ought to ſeparate our
ſelves, according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. 4. and cleave to
the Reformed Church, which is
the true Church, the onely Pillar
of Truth, out of which there is
no Salvation.</p>
               <p>Apoc. 14. 9. 10. <hi>If any man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Beaſt and his Image, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his marke in his Forehead, or in
his hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the
Wine of the wrath of God, which is
powred out without mixture into the
Cup of his indignation, and he ſhall be
tormented with fire and brimſtone in
the preſence of the holy Angels, and in
the preſence of the Lambe.</hi>
