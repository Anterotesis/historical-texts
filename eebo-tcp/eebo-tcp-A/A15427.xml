         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The firſt loue, being not counterfet but ſurely grounded, can neuer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued from the remembrance: but

truly the ſweetnes of thoſe ioies were rare and numberleſſe, were they not often troubled by crooked &amp; finiſter meanes, as oftentimes happens to vs women, ſuch as I was in my yong &amp; vainer dayes, as ſhewing our ſelues too diſdainful, &amp; reckoning the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of our owne priuate opinions, to be farre beyond all others.</p>
               <p>Fooles that wee bee, how manie wonderfull pleaſures loſe we, in nice ſhunning them? Afterward, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone and publique, how much do we bemone our owne ſtearne rudeneſſe? Thus firſt (through our owne fault) we finde the cauſe of our annoiance, til with floods of teares we weare out the flint of our ſtonie ſtubbornneſſe, learning thereby to become more milde and tractable.</p>
               <p>It is beſt then to learne, how to loue without fierceneſſe or diſdaine, but it falls out verie ſildome, that without ſome bitterneſſe one can
<pb facs="tcp:10770:11"/>
endure the ſweete which growes by Loues beginning, except wee firſt make choyce of ſuch an one, as ſhall appeare moſt meete and worthie to be beloued.</p>
               <p>Liſten then (faire Virgins) &amp; learn of me to paſſe pleaſantly the courſe of your life, as alſo to bring ſuch qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et to your Loue, as the iſſue thereof ſhalbe moſt peaceable and glorious.</p>

the caſe of Loue requires.</p>
               <p>Think with your ſelues what a hell it is, to loue where the like cannot be returned againe. Whereas the able gallant Youth, being in the firſt flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his manly age, hath a moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate aſpect or countenance, declares a more firme &amp; potent conſtitution, and is able to endure watchings or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weightie burdens, in better ſort than thoſe of weaker diſpoſition can.</p>
               <p>But learne with me (I beſeech ye) to know, how many diſcommodities attend vpon ſuch men, as being ouer yong, are likewiſe vnapt for loue.</p>
               <p>They are not expert, &amp; euery ſmal occaſion ſeemes in their mindes to make a verie great ſhadow, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haſty, &amp; ſubiect to no patience.</p>
               <p>They are ſudden, raſh &amp; indiſcreet, knowing little, &amp; therefore improui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſuſpitious in all things, &amp; eaſily caried away with any diſdainful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.

wil diſcourſe a whole hiſtorie of their amorous paſsions, taking delight in counterfeiting and defending appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of truth, and making open vaunts of approoued falſhoods.</p>
               <p>Here hence inſues it, that theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports paſsing from one to another, whatſoeuer is ſpoken of vs women, bee it neuer ſo falſe, as quickly will ſome be found to beleeue it.</p>

               <p>And ſometimes it happeneth, that when all ſiniſter language is ſilent of vs, then our owne fortune reſembles the yong Liones following the Hart, who ieſted &amp; dallied verie long with her yet in the end caſt her off: rather than which inconuenience ſhould happen to me, I would make electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an elder Louer, than one ſo

               <p>The Louer more ſeene in yeares, will be wiſe, diſcreet, readie to know and accompliſh whatſoeuer, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to time, place, and all offered oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: whereas the yong gadding head, not obſeruing thoſe neceſſarie rules, can neuer know how to fit him ſelfe with theſe needfull furnitures.</p>
               <p>Note well the diſcreet Louer, and yee ſhall ſee him ſilent, ſecret, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, modeſt &amp; aduiſed: but the yong Fantaſticke will go vp and downe all day before your doore; where, thogh he be alone, yet euerie paſſenger ſhal be a witneſſe of his inward affection.</p>
               <p>The elder Fauour it, except there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too induced by ſome mightie occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will neuer giue ouer his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, his Loue is his hearts Heauen: but if he ceaſe to loue, yet neuer will he become an enemie, hate, or ſeeme moleſtuous vnto ye, either by word or deed.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:10770:14"/>The yong wanderer, like one that newly comes into a publique market place, walkes along euerie ſide, and admireth all things, deſiring to inioy each thing hee beholdeth: but with the leaſt looke he is preſently chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and no greater miſerie can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to her that truly loueth, than to affect the man, whoſe heart and ſoule are not ſolemnly dedicated and linkt together, to deſire or couet more than one onely Loue.</p>

               <p>Heere too I muſt now adde, that in loue are infinite pleaſures, no leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſome, than to be admired; as in the marriage bed, where is all kinde conference, diſcouering of greefes, recounting afflictions paſſed, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſuſpitions, correcting with ſweet accuſations one another: thus out-wearing the ſlow-paced howers, one while with true-loues teares, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while with intyre reioycing.</p>
               <p>To the faithfull Louer, nothing is more pleaſing, than to feele on her cheekes, or in her boſome, the teares

of him ſhe loueth, ſweetly trickling downe: what honnie of <hi>Hybla,</hi> what cinamon of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or what <hi>Nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> prepared for the gods themſelues to drinke, can be imagined ſo ſweet, (faire Glories of Vertue) as one little teare of him whom you intirely loue?

               <p>She that can deuide her liking into diuers parts &amp; proportions, knowes not how to loue indeed, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes ſo ſacred a profeſsion, &amp; ſhee that labours not to maintaine loue in his true and onely glorie, deſerues not to haue the benefites of loue, but rather to be generaly hated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned.</p>

               <p>If yee lend good lookes to euerie one, ye bring your ſelfe into a hell &amp; intollerable ſeruitude: for then, if ye grace one more than another, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ariſeth hatred and contentions betweene them.

               <p>If they diſcerne in your lookes no apparant ſignes of loue, they will ceaſe al purſute, and for beare further moleſtation: abuſe not then your ſelues with the opinion of ſome vain headed wantons, who are perſwaded

that the onely meanes to make them affected, conſiſts in brauery of attire, and gay decking of the bodie to bee gazde on.</p>

               <p>Not much differing from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe, I begin now to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mine owne former loues, when ſitting weeping by my deare beloued mother, I would make complaint vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, that my Husband (the onely moitie of my ſoule, to whom I frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaue my ſelfe, deſpiſing the thoght of anie other) ſeemed vnkind to me, and in outward appearaunce did not
<pb facs="tcp:10770:25"/>
manifeſt ſuch affection toward mee, as my ſimple wiſedome craued and expected.</p>
               <p>Continuing in the heate of theſe amorous oppreſsions, I found but one comfort onely in this my martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; which was, to weepe my fill daily, and declare my greefes to my pittying Mother, ſtill accuſing (to my vttermoſt) my Husband with great crueltie.</p>
               <p>When ſuch large expence of teares and heart-renting ſighes auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not, I would often intreat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him, that hee ſhould not forſake my companie, and ſeeme ſo diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to her, that intyrely loued him: but his diſcreete aunſweres (as now I can confeſſe they were, though then my folly would not ſuffer mee to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne ſo much) declared him to bee a wiſer Husband than I was a Wife, and his councell was more auailable, than I had wit to conceiue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:10770:25"/>But I being then yong, and in the extremitie of Loues flames, as many other in the like caſe doo, tooke all in the worſt ſenſe, fretted, greeued, and wept alone by my ſelfe, imagining ſtill, that I loued but in vaine, &amp; fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied where I was not affected.</p>
               <p>Theſe troubles and moleſtations made me ſo forget my ſelfe, that I v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the aduice of forcerers and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, hearbes, vearſes, oyntments, or anie thing thoght likely to induce &amp; procure loue: them I made proofe of, as deeming I had him not ſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, who loued me better than I did my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>In teares at length I told all to my Mother, and ſhe being well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with youths peeuiſh follies, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily controlling my deepe indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vſed theſe or the verie like ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vnto me.</p>

               <p>Let her then that will declare her ſelfe a Louer, affect truly him whom ſhe deemes to be the like.</p>
               <p>One knowes not a Muſitian, but either by his voyce or touching hys inſtrument: euen ſo ye cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a perfect Louer, but by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the true ſignes belonging to Loue.</p>
               <p>Figures are fallacies, &amp; ſhewes no ſubſtances; loue more priuately, than may be noted apparantly, ſo ſhall ye expreſſe your loues value, and your wittes vertue: for by following this courſe, yee ſhall haue this aſſurance, to be as intyrely affected, as your ſelf

can fancy, and the leaſt friendly look ſhall finde as fauourable liking.</p>
               <p>Heertoo ſhe added diuers other reaſons, but none ſo pleaſing (mee thought) as this.</p>
               <p>Beware Daughter (quoth ſhe) that when reports come of others deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thee, thou be not as readie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, as the other to belye, and ſo prooue as ſudden in hatred, as they were ſwift to incenſe thee.</p>
               <p>We ſhould bee naturally inclined rather to loue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hate, becauſe loue is full of ſweetneſſe, and hatred hath no felicitie but in bitternes &amp; ſowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Therefore thus reſolue with thy ſelfe, that whoſoeuer ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thy hearts firme affection, will hold it as religion to returne thee the like: leaue then theſe had courſes, to baſe abuſers of their time, for they that ſo liue, ſhal worthily be loathed, and run into more contempt, than thou haſt reaſon to conſider.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10770:27"/>Loue, and thou ſhalt be belou'de; be kinde, curteous, gentle, and debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire, that thy outward demeanour may <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

What thogh he bee ſomwhat ſlow in diſcouering his affection? thou oughteſt not to miſdeeme thereof, but conceiue the beſt in ſuch a caſe, gouerning thy ſelf by this rule; That he who is long ere he loues, is much longer ere he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, for haſtie fancie hath as haſtie flight: whereas loue growing by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, hath aduiſe for his guide, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by his continuaunce, and true fame after death to make him eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p>He neuer ſlips or falls, that runneth with diſcretion; and the tree which is ſlacke in ſprouting, is as ſlow in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing.</p>
               <p>Wel worthie regarding were theſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10770:27"/>
good admonitions, for (to my coſt) ſince then, I haue found them moſt certaine.</p>
               <p>How manie diſdaines, how manie moleſtations, more hurtfull to my ſelfe, than offenſiue to him: yea, how manie wrongs bare my Husband at my hand, only through no other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, but becauſe indeed I knew not rightly how to loue?</p>
               <p>All which notwithſtanding, his affection to me neuer failed, &amp; ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would hee ſeeme to ſhew himſelfe anie way offended: he ſaw it was but my want of better iudgement, &amp;, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne weake by nature, I muſt needes declare the ſame in nurture; which though he had admirable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to endure, yet had I no reaſon at all to diſcerne.</p>
               <p>My Grandame beeing a Woman experienſt in manie things, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Arte inſtructing to loue, tolde mee that long ſince, which I
<pb facs="tcp:10770:28"/>
found moſt true in my Husband. A patient man (quoth ſhee) is the true honour of manhood; for being euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more wiſe and ſecret to himſelfe, bee his wrongs few or manie, his boſome is their buriall, and tungs abroad ſhal not tattle of his troubles at home. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo did I finde it in my Husband: for though I daily gaue him cauſe to be diſpleaſed, and (indeed) preſumed a little too much on his patience, yet (God knowes) much griefe would he ſmoother with a ſmile, pittying to to haue my errors ſhowen, or his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet reuealed to anie.</p>
               <p>Conſider then (faire Ladies) on the good precepts rehearſed, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in loue, &amp; doubt not of the like: the next way to purchaſe contempt, is by ſhewing your ſelues vnkinde, &amp; the ſureſt waye to win loue, is by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing true loue; hate then the one, and be ſure to enioy the honor of the other.</p>

               <p>Which I hope ye wil account as a moſt neceſſarie conſequent, and that no leſſe skill is to be vſed in keeping, than was in obtaining: for in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsing of a thing, wee are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

               <p>To Time and Fortune (faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) wee muſt needes bee obedient. And as he that intends to paſſe a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, ſtayes on the banke till the rough ſtormes bee ouer-blowen: ſo in the ſtearne tempeſts of time, wee ſhould awaite and not wilfully caſt our ſelues into daunger, conſidering that what may not bee done to day, happily to morrow in better ſort will bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:10770:29"/>Let the way be neuer ſo long, hold on, and at length thou ſhalt attayne the end.

               <p>As for the ſlaunder and detraction which oftentimes attendeth on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete loue, it may eaſely bee eſcaped, becauſe hidden Loue is fortefied on all ſides with infinite good excuſes, which ſerues as a rampart againſt all bad reports.</p>
               <p>But among all the aduerſe chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces incident to vs Louers, (as I haue tried by mine own proofe, and noted the like in others) there can no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap whatſoeuer betide vs, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues from our ſelues the ground &amp; originall; as by our ouer-much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie, pride, wilfulnes, diſdaine, and ſuch like, which proones more to our owne harme, than theirs wee
<pb facs="tcp:10770:30"/>
ſeeke to hurt.</p>
               <p>And let me aſſure yee, that there is nothing more preiudiciall to the ſweete proceeding of loue, than our owne peeuiſh humours, which being carried away with meere ſhaddowes in manie things, continually deludes vs with vaine and idle fantaſies in all things.</p>
               <p>Onely our own folly and obſtinate opinions, makes vs afterward ſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and ſigh out our repentaunce, nor enſues this fault ſo much by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouidence, as through pride and vaine conceit at the firſt in our ſelues: therefore he ſpake both well and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that affirmed: A proud Woman could not loue effectually, becauſe ſuſpition continually attendeth her.</p>
               <p>Suſpition enſueth through lacke of knowledge, and diſtruſt, waited on by diſdaine; which makes vs to ſhun, iniure and torment them, that too dearly loue vs: thus our crooked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiors
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10770:30"/>
ſerue as inſtructers to them, &amp; look what coyne they receiued of vs, they pay vs backe with the like.</p>
               <p>There are ſome of vs women, who deeme themſelues neuer ſatisfied with pride, furie, and ſcornfulneſſe, which makes but a bad agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs: for where diſdain is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, contempt of all kindneſſe is the more increaſed, and it is pittie a true Louer ſhuld haue ſuch a reward for his labour.</p>
               <p>But ſhe that is of a noble inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gracious, benigne, modeſt, kinde and gentle, will liſten to iuſt excuſes, and let reaſon be her ruler. If anger would preſume, ſhe will quickly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it; if diſdaine would attempt her, ſhee can foorthwith turne it off: remembring, that loue muſt bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with loue, &amp; wher the enemy is repulſed, the ſolace is with greater ſweetnes receiued. Be not then coy, proud or ſcornful in affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but (like

your faire ſemblances) full of all affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</p>
               <p>Which of yee would denie him whom ye dearly loue, whatſoeuer he demaundeth? Little can ye do then, if (at his requeſt) ye will not forſake a fond and friuolous opinion: learne, as my Lord taught me in my firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to reiect and deſpiſe all ſuch hurtfull follies.</p>
               <p>I tooke extreame delight, ſweete Siſters, in commending him whom I knew to be compleat in all arts and vertues, eſpecially this whereof wee now conferre: yet let it not ſeeme of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue to ye, that among my praiſes of him whom I loued, and euer ſhall, I mingle ſome of mine owne infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, wherein, either you haue like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fallen through lacke of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or maye heereafter by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much peeuiſhneſſe.</p>
               <p>Being a yong Damoſell, raſh and vnexperienced, I began to loue, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10770:31"/>
afterward to a little pride in my ſelfe, which drew me to diſdaine, and ſuch fantaſticke humours, as falling from one peruerſe opinion to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I grew afterward ſuſpitious of anie occaſion whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>My Husband was a goodly perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, of exceeding pleaſing ſpeech and vertuous qualities, which made him called to manie companies, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and eſteemed of euerie one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and herehence began in me a world of afflictions.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer woman lookt on him, I iudgd her immediatly a riuall in my loue, my thoughts were neuer free from iealous ſuſpition: if he were in my ſight, yet I deemed him not ſure enough, and what woman lookt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him but once, I wiſht ſhe might be blinde for euer afterward.</p>
               <p>I could neuer glut mine owne eyes with ſufficient gazing on him, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that perpetually they might be
<pb facs="tcp:10770:32"/>
fixed on him, when he came toward me, no woman in the world could be more contented; and let him but go backe againe, I imagined no torment might be ſo greeuous.</p>
               <p>My too much repoſing truſt in him, began to make me diſtruſtfull of my ſelfe: and, though needleſſe ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had got ſome hold of me, as yet it robd me not of my loues felicitie, nor anie way impaired the height of my pleaſures.</p>
               <p>So long theſe golden howres, daies, months and yeares endured, till for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (enuying my further happines) ſuffered me to ſee a certaine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who albeit her deſerts elſe where were worthie liking, yet mee thought her familiaritye fitted not with my Husband.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, as if I had been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a deadly ſtroke, my face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came pale and wan, deepe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued diſpleaſure ſate vppon my brow,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10770:32"/>
and my former pleaſing diſpoſition conuerted into ſuch melancholy, as my Husband (being preſent) &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered with compaſsion, gathering by his diſcretion, what danger here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by might redound to our loue, both in teares, &amp; other apparant teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſorow, he declared how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this miſhap did diſcontent him.</p>
               <p>All which was no appeaſing of my furious oppreſsion, but I muſt needs goe complaine my ſelfe to my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: who, to witnes her owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as alſo to withdraw mee from ſo vaine a perſwaſion, affirmed; That ſhee had both noted and heard their diſcourſing, meruailing I wold ſhew my ſelfe ſo immodeſt, as to iudge of honeſt demeanour ſo abſurdly and raſhly, and the Gentlewoman, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming but in kindnes to ſee mee, my Husband (for my ſake) gaue her ſuch entertainment, aſwell knowing what became him, farre better than I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10770:33"/>Her words wanted ſtrength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue mine opinion, I reputed it an iniurie, and therefore I would not be otherwiſe perſwaded, but gaue this frantick ſpleene ſuch ſouereigntie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me, that I grew into a wonderfull hatred againſt him, concluding, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after to loue him againe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greeuing for the affection I had beſtowed on him alreadie. And in this heate, I ſhut vp my ſelfe to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, purpoſing while I liued to loath mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany: loue now was changd to hate, faire looks to bitter frownes, &amp; all elſe were my vtter foes, but ſuch whoſe fortunes did equall mine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>Alas, what fooles are we women, tranſported vp and downe with theſe amorous paſsions? When I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my former determination of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſſe, to haue no likelihood of continuance, then became I deuout and religious, none but Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10770:33"/>
might now bee my companions, with them (ſiſter-like) I went from Church to Church, vſing all the meanes I could deuiſe, to forget the loue of him whom I thought my greateſt enemie.</p>
               <p>And, leaſt conference with ouer-manie, might alter mine intent, I would prattle with dumbe pictures, vowing this day and that day to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter religion, becauſe I would become a ſworne aduerſarie to loue. See here my ſilly wiſedome, as if I could thus haue left my Husband, at mine owne proper pleaſure, being bound to him in the bond of all humilitie &amp; dutie.</p>
               <p>The verie thoght of Loue, I found wold not agree with the auſteritie of Religion; the one, in bitternes, I dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſweet, and the other, in the very beſt eſtate, ſomewhat too ſowre.</p>
               <p>Thus, while with one nayle I thought to expell another, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to quench Loue, I kindled it
<pb facs="tcp:10770:34"/>
more violent, and where I was but ſindgd before by the flame, now, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie part of me, I felt the fire hotly burning.</p>
               <p>Thus one while, I would faine be free from Loues mightie thraldome, yet lothe at another, to looſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall amorous ſeruice, whoſe verie lookes were my life, and whoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was more bitter than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand deaths.</p>
               <p>But I was cunning enough to keep all this cloſe, and ſeemed outwardly to feele no greefe at all, when (God knowes) how extreamely my poore heart was tormented.</p>
               <p>Sullen will made me to delight in ſolitude, darke roomes and obſcure vaults would I daily walke in, where, like a witleſſe foole, I did nothing elſe but plague my ſelf, and pleaſe others, who in ſecrete ſmiled at my peeuiſh diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>In the end, being well diſciplinde
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10770:34"/>
with mine owne diſeaſe, and more wearie of this oppreſsion, than I would the world ſhuld haue known, I became a little more friendly to my Husband, deſiring that ſtill he would keepe me companie, and I might be his glaſſe continually to gaze on.</p>
               <p>To eaſe himſelfe of my daily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtations, and ſomwhat to ſooth me in this friuolous humour, he yeelded to let his owne affaires run lauiſhly at randome, and ſuggeſt my ſottiſhnes with all poſsible conuerſation &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance.</p>
               <p>When I had gotten this vaine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, it were wonderfull to tell you, how prowde I became thereof, for then I beganne to determine a ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie in my ſelfe, to make my will a law, and his ſubmiſsion the onelye piller to maintaine and vnder-prop it. I grew then into ſuch extremitie of bold and vndecent preſumption, that I would eſteeme of him as I
<pb facs="tcp:10770:35"/>
liſt, offend him when I pleaſed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other reaſon, but onely his patient ſufferance: if he laughed, I would lowre; if hee ſpake faire, I would be froward; if hee deſired to walke, I would tarrie at home; if he inuited friends to be merrie, I would deuiſe al the meanes I could to make them malcontent: thus home was a hell to him, abroad, little or nothing better, and I (like a verie diuell) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually tormenting him.</p>
               <p>But who ſuſtained the worſt al this while? His patience did priuiledge him for inward vexation, ſo that my ſelfe bare the burden of this diſquiet, and I did my ſelfe more harme, than I could doo him: for my blood began to drie vp, my mind afflicted with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable ſorrowes, all my veynes ſeemed as ſhrunke and wythered, &amp; daily was I ſubiect to (welneere) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werly ſwounings. Which my pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Husband with great griefe behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10770:35"/>
my former faire ſhape to bee ſo ſtrangely altred, and without any iuſt cauſe of offence proceeding from himſelfe, he ſtill deſired to know the reaſon of this maladie, &amp; whether it lay in him by any means to help it, or if at him I was thus offended. If not (quoth he) but that your diſpleaſure is kindled againſt ſome other, wrong not your ſelfe with theſe ſharpe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentings, but let mee reuenge it on whom ſo ere it be: for it is a debt due to Loue, and a right which hee doth by great reaſon challenge, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two vnited ſoules, nothing ſhould bee kept in ſecret, but the one bee alwayes priuie to the others op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions; becauſe a Louer (in ſuch a caſe) is to be commaunded, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers counſel is not to be ſcorned, but obeyed as the onely ſalue to cure any amorous ſicknes.</p>
               <p>But I (euen as it is the nature of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other women, neuer to be ſuffiſed
<pb facs="tcp:10770:36"/>
with iniury, much leſſe with reuenge) one while tooke pride to ſee him hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, another while practiſed how to preuaile more &amp; more againſt him, ſmiling to ſee him ſo obſequious, &amp; I ſit (as it were) controlling ouer him.</p>
               <p>I wiſhed that he might know the ground of my greefe; yet, if by my ſpeeches hee anie way perceiued it, with ſtout courage &amp; ſolemne oaths I would flatly denie it: affirming that he had no way offended me, but the cauſe of my diſtemper grew by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Then would I ſhew diſdainfull looks, ſcorne to keep him company, and expreſſe manifeſt hatred againſt him: and ſo long I continued in theſe peſtilent humors, onely to make him wearie with the weight of this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, that I could ſing when hee ſighed, ſmile when he wept: &amp; (thogh indeed I lou'd him) yet I took a great pride in theſe commaunding beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:10770:36"/>Thus, though outwardly I appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bee high minded and imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet iealozie within kept me hot &amp; fiery, loading me with more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie moleſtations, than thoſe fooliſh conceits of mine could burden him withall: yet ſtill his patience exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my preſumptions, and the more I grew ſtubborne, the leſſe he cared for it. How ſorie haue I been (manie times) within my ſelfe, that I could not by my diſdaines and outrages, prouoke him to anger? I could haue wiſht my ſelfe in hell, to haue gotten him but half way thither. See (poore ſoules) the folly of our ſelfe wills.</p>
               <p>When all the reſt preuailed not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to plague him as I would, I fell to this wicked purpoſe, to ſeeme in outward ſhew quite weaned from his Loue, and that my affection was inclined to ſome other; which to make hym the more ſoundly beleeue, in his ſight I would talk idly &amp; fondly with
<pb facs="tcp:10770:37"/>
yong Gallants, to kindle the ſame fire in him, that flamed ſo extreamely in mee.</p>
               <p>Thus after long ſeeking mine own miſerie, at length I found it; and I was not ſo greedie of compaſsing it before, but then I would as gladly haue been rid of it againe.</p>
               <p>Much raine weares out the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt marble, and with continuance of ſtrokes the hardeſt ſteele is pierced: euen ſo, the greateſt patience (by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities) may be peruerted, and the kindeſt hart made cruell by intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torturing.</p>
               <p>His loue, which before flamed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mee like <hi>Aetna,</hi> became now more cold than froſtie <hi>Caucaſus</hi>; his kinde lookes, faire preſence, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſufferance, were now ſowre frownes, moodie geſtures, &amp; ſtearne impatience: which (finding to my coſt, and feeling to be ſo cruell) then, each word I had ſpoken, each deede
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10770:37"/>
I had done, &amp; euery priuate thought which had diſpleaſed him, with true teares I bewailed, &amp; with ſighes from my ſoule intirely repented.</p>
               <p>But what a hell is it, when repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance auailes not? Let me complain, it was to no purpoſe, though I ſighed and ſorrowed, it had no ſucceſſe: his wrongs had been ſo mightie, and my wilfull tranſgreſsions ſo manie, as I could not but expect a iuſt deſerued puniſhment, hauing thus (through mine owne folly) procured both his hurt and mine owne.</p>
               <p>Infortunate wretch, my teares and torments I cannot expreſſe vnto yee: the nights ſeemed too long, weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with a thouſand reuoluings and repentances, the dayes likewiſe appeared gloomie and dark, becauſe I had no ſuccour but ſolitude onely.</p>
               <p>My breaſt was nothing elſe but a ſtore-houſe of cares, griefes and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; my thoughts, like diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:10770:38"/>
ſeas, diuerſly tranſported, one while with anger, then with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, now with diſdaine, then again with loue; now with pittying my ſelf, then him whom I had diſpleaſed: I would, and I would not, I wept, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded excuſes, told my ſelfe the whole ſtorie of my ſilly behauiour, wiſhing I could againe haue recouered ſo much time ſpent in vaine.</p>
               <p>At length it was my good fortune, (though all this while I had been ſo vnhappie) to know for certainty, that my former ſuſpition concerning the Gentlewoman, which had been the cauſe of my ſo long diſcontentment, was nothing els but the folly of mine owne peeuiſh fancie, and no offence at all committed by my Husband.</p>
               <p>Had I not then great reaſon to bee aſhamed of my ſelfe, as one almoſt vnmeet for anie vertuous company? Iudge you (faire Ladies) that are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of your honours, and would not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10770:38"/>
haue your good names to bee anie way ſcandalized: was it time to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my ſelfe ſpeedily or no? &amp; to beg fauour of him, to whom I had beene ſo farre vnfriendly?</p>
               <p>But to ſee how different the nature of men is from vs women, &amp; where true wiſedome is embraced, how no malice can haue long predominance: he, who neuer was acquainted with vnciuill diſdaine, but euermore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed all franticke follies, vppon my ſubmiſsion vvas immediately ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all offences paſt before, vvere preſently forgiuen, and as effectually forgotten, as if neuer at all commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Then could I not chuſe but confes my infirmities, finding that moſt true vvhich himſelfe had alvvaies taught me, that in loue the leaſt ſuſpition is foorthvvith to be diſcloſed, &amp; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit no ſooner taken, but preſently to be told.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10770:39"/>For, a Louers beſt ſtrength is ſubiect to much weaknes, and ſuſpition once entered the minde, will hardly with reaſon or perſwaſions be maſtred.

               <p>They that pay for experience, as I did, will rue it as I doo; and they that preuent the ſweetes of Loue by their own wilfulnes, may wiſh for them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, and yet walk without them. My lucke was little better, which I ſigh to remember, becauſe when our felicitie began again to be firme, and that now I would not looſe the leaſt portion of pleaſure, our Countreyes affaires robd mee of my Husbands companie; where, with the loſſe of him, I would my life had periſhed.</p>
