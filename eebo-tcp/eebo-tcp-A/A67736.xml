            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>ouching <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> he yeeldeth this to be the reason, <hi>that
they might learn not to blaspheme, 1 Timothy</hi> 1. 20. And in another place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>If any man obey not our saying, note him by a letter, and have no company
with him, that he may be ashamed, 2 Thes.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
               <p>It was the practise of the primitive Church, in her first love, that she might
shine in beauty and fairness above all other Synagogues, not to admit any
scandalous person, or open offender into the Communion of Saints; until
their foule spots were carefully washt off, and taken away by the tears of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
The <hi>bread</hi> of the <hi>children</hi> was not given unto <hi>dogs;</hi> neither, by
an equall bounty, to the godly and the wicked, was there an equal encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to godlinesse and iniquity, but a separation was made between the
sick and the whole; and this <hi>separation</hi> had no other intent, but <hi>edification;</hi>
even an edification of the spirir, by the destruction of the flesh: so that men
could find no fault with the dispensers of this power, having nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of, but that their lives thereby were sought to be <hi>amended,</hi> and their
<hi>soules</hi> to be <hi>saved.</hi> I confesse, that was a <hi>separation</hi> of a higher nature, the
power of the keyes being added, they were <hi>delivered up to Sathan,</hi> shut out
of Heaven; herein it is not so, but this serves to the same end, and is done
only in cases of like fact.</p>
               <p>The cause was weighty, for which the gates of Heaven, were to be locked;
great, in the thing done; or great, in the wilfulness of the doer; and this
not without reason: for the doom was heavy, and fit for the back of a strong
and mighty evil: it was a short damnation, a temporall hell, a shutting out
of Heaven upon earth, yea, Heaven in Heaven, even the joyes, and comforts
of the spirit of consolation. Neither could it be but an excellent remedy, for,
besides that it was Gods institution, the remedy was fitted to the disease: a
degree of presumption, was encountered with a degree of despaire; the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
was made a medicine, against the sting of the Scorpion; Sathan was set
on work, to take him down by terror unto salvation; whom before he ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
and puffed up to destruction; he, that said at first, sin boldly, for <hi>ye
shall not dye at all;</hi> now he changeth his voyce, and saith, <hi>thy sin is greater
then can be forgiven thee.</hi> But the wisdom of dispensation suffered this roring
Lion no longer to terrifie, but <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>til his terror did mollifie: he aimed indeed
at despaire and destruction; but the Church aimed at humiliation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
yea, at consolation and salvation. And indeed <hi>humiliation</hi> for sin,
is the only way to <hi>conversion</hi> from sin; <hi>conversion</hi> from sin, the only way to
the <hi>consolations</hi> of tht Spirit; and the comfortable spirit is both the guide and
the way to life eternal: therefore, when the man is humbled, Sathan is cashei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
the horseleech is taken away, when he hath sufficiently abated the vicious
and superfluous blood.</p>
               <p>Thus were men <hi>healed,</hi> by <hi>wounding; exalted</hi> by <hi>humbling:</hi> O admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
use and command of Sathan! he is an enemy to God, and yet doth him
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ice; he is an adversary to man, and yet helps him. A strange thing, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38251:3"/>
Sathan should help the incestuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> to the <hi>destruction</hi> of his flesh,
his concupiscense, and the <hi>edification</hi> of his soul. A strange thing that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
should teach <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> not to blaspheme: he is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of blasphemies, and yet he teacheth not to blaspheme.</p>
               <p>But is Sathan contrary to himself, and is his Kingdom divided in it self?
no surely: but one that is stronger then he both in wisdom and power, mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
both his craft and malice, to ends, which himself intendeth not. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
is one and the same still, even purely malicious; but God suffers him to
go on in his temptations, just so farre as temptation is profitable, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
therefore while Sathan is driving the offender to despaire, God stops his
course, when the sinner is come to due humiliation: and then, as it was with
<hi>Christ</hi> in the wilderness, so is it with the humbled sinner, Sathan is dismissed,
and the Angels come an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> minister unto him.</p>
               <p>This was the nature, manner, and end of publike excommunication: pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
hath relation to it; both touching canse and end. First, publike had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the cause; that it was to be used, only in case of scandalous, open, and
notorious impiety: so hath the private; we do not break off society with any
for weaknesses, and sins of infirmity. Secondly, that did only aime at their
amendment, conversion, and salvation: so doth this; we desire only to have

and certainly nothing will sooner make the adulteress or drunkard bethink
themselves, then when they see, all that are honest and sober, even their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and old associates, shun their company and despise them, as if they were
not worthy of humane society: and if they have the least desire to be reputed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and sober again, and admitted their familiar converse, (without which,
they are, as it were, banished into exile) they will do what possibly lyes in
them to redeem their credit, and merit their good opinion, by a more sober, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
and holy demeanour: the disparity lyeth only in the power and severity
of the agents; we cannot, we dot not, we desire not to deliver them up
to Sathan; but heartily pray that they may be delivered from him, and all

It is a true Proverb, <hi>Evil company corrupts good manners:</hi> and <hi>He that
will not evill do, must keep from all that longs thereto.</hi> To be safe from
evil works, is to avoid the occasions; especially, he that will keep himself from
iniquity, and <hi>have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,</hi>
must have no fellowship with wicked persons, the workers of darknesse: <hi>Ioseph</hi>
thought no weapon comparable, for the beating off his Mistresses assaults, to
running away.</p>
               <p>The first thing that God did, after he created Heaven and Earth, was, to <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi>

<hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>evill,</hi> if they meane not again to become evil. It is not
more hard to find vertue in evil company, then to misse vice. <hi>They were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
among the heathen</hi> (saith the Psalmist) and what followes? <hi>they learned
their works, Ps. 106. 35. Peter</hi> had never denyed and forsworn his Master

if he had not been in company with <hi>Christ's</hi> enemies: but then how soon

I will not therefore hazard the fraile potsheard (my fleth) upon the rock of
evil company for any thing. <hi>David</hi> had never dissembled, if he had not been

not a quarrel. Many a man had been <hi>good,</hi> that is not, if he had but kept
<hi>good company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a pliable disposition in all men naturally to evill; we follow it, as
Iron doth the Loadstone, by a natural and hidden propensity: our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is like fire, which, if there be any infection in the room, drawes it streight
to it self: or like Jet, which omits all precious objects, and attracts nothing
but straws and dust: or, if a man hath both good and bad in his nature, either
of them will fortifie, as they meet with their like; or decline as they find a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
as <hi>Sampson</hi> did in his strength, who, at first being hard enough for all
the Princes of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> at last, by keeping <hi>Dalilah</hi> company, they set a
boy to lead him.</p>
               <p>Yea, suppose a man stands indifferent; his <hi>company,</hi> whether good or evil,
will work him into a new nature; and by continuance, he shall grow up to
the same height with them, as the Hop groweth to the end of the pole, be it
never so high, and he himself shall do the like to others; as one peece of Iron,
being rub'd with the Loadstone, will draw another peece, even as if it were the
Loadstone it self.</p>
               <p>A good man in ill <hi>company</hi> is like a precious pearl, fallen into the mud;
which the longer it lies, the deeper still it sinks into it: for, if the force of <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi>

by the unperceived stealth of time, assimilate us to it self: one rotten Aple will
infect a whole floor: one putrid grape corrupts the whole sound cluster. The
<hi>choice</hi> therefore of a mans <hi>company,</hi> is one of the most weighty actions of our
lives; for our future well or ill being, depends on that election: if we choose ill,
every day inclines us to worse, we have a perpetual weight hanging on us, that
is ever sinking us down to vice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antisthenes</hi> wondred at those which were curious in buying but an earthen
dish, to see that it had no cracks, nor inconveniences, and yet would be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
in the <hi>choice</hi> of <hi>friends,</hi> and take them with the flawes of vice. What was
the reason (think we) that our Saviour would not suffer his weak Disciple, in
the Gospel, to go and bury his dead father? <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 60. It was not any averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to civil, much lesse filial respect and duty to Parents; yea, he <hi>preferred
mercy</hi> before <hi>sacrifice;</hi> but he well knew, that when he once met with his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
friends at the funeral, they would pervert him again, and quickly flout him
out of his new Masters service, and that the Gospel should soon loose a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of him. The reason why the Raven returned not into <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, as
the Dove did, is given by some, because it met with a dead carkase by the
way.</p>
               <p>A wise man will be wary, not only to <hi>shun</hi> sin in the <hi>action,</hi> but in the very
<hi>occasion.</hi> How many, that meant not to sin, are won only by the opportunity?
for <hi>occasion</hi> and our <hi>nature</hi> are like two inordinate lovers, they seldom meet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but they sin together, and every act of sin, tyes a new knot: if we keep them asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the harm is prevented: and it is easier to deny a guest at first, then to turn
him out, having stayed a while: it is easier to keep fire from flax, then to quench
it after it is on fire: a man may spit out a spark, but when once kindled, there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38251:5"/>
is hardly any quenching of it. Why do we pray, <hi>deliver us from evil,</hi> but
that we imply, besides all other mischiefes, that there is an <hi>infectious</hi> power in
it, to make us evil? Let us therefore <hi>do</hi> what we <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> that we may
<hi>do</hi> it: yea, O Lord, free us both from speech and sight of these bauds and pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of vice, so far as is possible; if not, at least from joyning in league, or
dwelling in house with, or having dependency on such.</p>
               <p>O how many are there, that, like the Pine-tree, with their very shadow,
hinder all other plants from growing under them: or, like the great mountain
<hi>Radish,</hi> which, if it bee planted neer the Vine, causeth it to starve and wither
away? Alass! it is nothing to be godly in <hi>Abraham's</hi> house: but for a man <hi>to
dwell in the tents of Kedar,</hi> or to live in the Court of <hi>Sardanapalus;</hi> and
yet to keep himself upright, is a matter of great difficulty, especially, for him
that is not well rooted by time and experience. A sore new skind will fret off
again, with the least rubbing; yea, the very sight of evill is dangerous, to such
an one; lusting, for the most part, followes looking; as wee see in <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi>
3. 6. and <hi>David 2 Sam.</hi> 11. 2, 3. which makes <hi>Salomon</hi> speaking of a strange
woman, advise us to keep far from her, and not once come neer the door of her

unto which the eyes and the eares are enured, not out of love, but custome, we
fall into some offences.</p>

               <p>It is true indeed, there is supposed good fellowship, to which religion is an

               <p>Generons minds will associate with their matches and equals, or none: as

sworn brothers, but brethren in evill; which is too evil a brotherhood, for an

tread them under their feet, and turning again all to rent you, Matth.</hi> 7. 6.</p>
               <p>Again, as in Gods and their own behalf we are bound to reprove them: so in
our neighbours also, to whom, in this case, we owe a duty: for, admit we are in
company when, and where our brothers good name is taken away by false report;
it is our duty to defend the truth, in his behalf: we must neither backbite others,
nor be willing to give eare unto backbiters of others. It was an honest speech of
one; <hi>as I will be my present friends self, so I'le be my absent friends depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to say for him what he would, and cannot speak for himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thou wilt ask me. What need men <hi>trouble themselves</hi> with that which so
<hi>little concerns</hi> them?</p>
               <p>My answer shall be such another question. What needed <hi>Moses</hi> to have affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
himself with the afflictions of others, that he might work their deliverance,
when himself was at ease and pleasure in the court of <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> what needed <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi>
have purchased his fathers displeasure, and brought his own life in jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy,
that he might justifie <hi>David</hi> in his uprightness, and save his life? What
needed <hi>Calvin,</hi> in the yeer 1556, when <hi>Perin</hi> had conspired against the estate of
<hi>Geneva,</hi> have run into the midst of their naked swords, to appease the tumult?
what needs the hand cast it self betwixt a blow and the head, though it be cut off
by this mean? What needs the eye serve more to the use of the other members, in
being watchfull rightly to direct th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m, then for it self? A good heart cannot
abide to be happy alone; which is a religious answer, to a reasonable question
unreasonably moved. Yea, admit it were not a duty for one member to seek the
good of another, or of the whole, and that God had not enjoyned us so to do:
I am sure it is a pardonable fault, to do lesse good to our selves, that we may do
more good to, and for others.</p>
               <p>But suppose we offend them not this way; yet we shall another, if we keep
them company. The naturall man conceits of himself, far beyond what another
esteems him: and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

perhaps do you more mischief, then can easily be repaired: as that was done in
one quarter of an hour by our first Parents, which tended to the ruin of them,
and all mankind. It is usual with drunkards to kisse when they meet, and kill
when they part. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>unken <hi>Alexander</hi> killed <hi>Clytus,</hi> for whom sober <hi>Alexander</hi>
would have killed himself. The <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norwayes</hi> once purposing for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
fell drunk on shipboard, and so slasht one another, that there was an end
of their voyage. Out of their gallant disposition, you shall have one kill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
upon the interpretation of a word; a manifest confession, that their life is
not much worth, sith they will sell it so good cheap: yea, there are not wanting
of them that resemble <hi>Fimbria</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who meeting a Citizen that he hated,
gave him a deadly thrust into the body with his sword, and the next day entred
an action against him, that he had received but part of his blad into his body
and not all, as he meant it.</p>
               <p>Yea, perhaps they may make you to do that which you never dreamt of: like
<hi>Herod,</hi> who cut off <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist's head, only to answer the expectation of the
standers by, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 9. As for flattery it never wants welcome, while self-love,
is at home: but the plain dealing man cannot live among these Vipers, and
not be stung by them: yea, he lives most in trouble, that most seeks to have
peace with them by a familiarity.</p>

If we endanger our selves, our lives, our estates, loose our credit, our

to stir up the gifts of God in us; they will either adde something to our zeale,

stomacks: yea, if we have no gifts to stir up, their communion cannot but
leave some tincture behind it, if not of Piety, yet, at least, of a good profession,
and some inclinableness. If <hi>Saul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
