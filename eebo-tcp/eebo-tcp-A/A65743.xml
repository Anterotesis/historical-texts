            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

compared with them, they are of farre more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence; there was in thoſe dayes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſword to decide the controverſies, no other place choſen for that purpoſe but the field, in a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and couragious manner. In theſe our diviſions we have adverſaries of no courage or magnanimitie that riſeth againſt us, onely ſubtill and treacherous ſpirits lying in their Cabynets, and keeping themſelves cloſe in their ſtately buildings, their deviſing on divelliſh and helliſh ſtratagems to be put ſecretly in execution for our deſtruction; as powder-plots, fiering private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Townes, nay, Cities, if their endeavours might have ſucceſſe according to their deſires, which ſtrikes us with amaſement and continuall feare of our ſafetie in our owne habitations and places of livelyhood; we cannot diſcerne, ſo corrupt are the hearts of moſt men, who ſcarce to converſe, inhabit or eate withall, ſo malicious is <hi>Satan,</hi> (working in his inſtruments) in whom hee dwells, and over whom hee altogether raignes and rules, to bring to paſſe his owne ends, that hee workes by no wayes, but by practiſing of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard or unconceived of plots amongſt Chriſtians, as by Sorcery, Witchcraft, poyſoning, and the like, theſe inventions can wee not be aware of: A man ſeeing his enemy, and knowing him to be ſo, may uſe meanes either to reſiſt or flie from him, thereby to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but being in place unſuſpected to meet an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, pretending himſelfe a friend, or at leaſt not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or conceiving him to be his enemy, how can he be ſecure, how can hee defend himſelfe, or preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from his malice or deſtruction?

            <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>s.

The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and chiefeſt Authors of our miſeries is the Biſhops and their adherents, favourers of the Romiſh and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian faction, that have with a high hand and ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out Arme in their ſeverall places of Power and Juriſdiction, both ſpirituall and temporall exerciſed crueltie and tyranny over the Children and Saints of God, binding the Conſciences of free Subjects onely to their opinions and commands in the exerciſe of their Religion, with extremitie and greateſt ſeveritie, inflicting puniſhment upon thoſe of tender Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſhall refuſe the ſame, enjoyning all of the Clergie under their authoritie, to teach onely ſuch things as may ſerve onely to the defence and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their demiſed doctrines and tenents of their ſuperiors, preaching the ſame out of feare, not conſcience; theſe corrupt Biſhops Lords over their brethren and fellow ſervants in the adminiſtration of the myſteries of ſalvation, have beene the prime Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of all the troubles wee are now incumbred withall, I ſpeake not, Maſter SPEAKER, altogether againſt their perſons, but even their offices and places of authority as now they are uſed, contrary to the true iatent of the Apoſtles in the firſt admitting of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96440:4"/>
of Biſhops, in theſe particulars, as I under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour conceave.</p>
            <p>Firſt their denomination and ſtile, Lord Biſhops, we finde not any where allowed, nay, not named in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they joine not with their authority teaching and conſtant preaching of the word of GOD warranted by the ſame, but ſeparated contrary thereto.</p>

            <p>Secondly, I come to ſhew you theſe their practiſes, how they have, and ſtill endeavour to bring to paſſe their wicked deſignes, they are knowne already I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
