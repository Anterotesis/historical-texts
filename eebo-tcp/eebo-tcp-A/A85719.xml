            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Mr. SPEAKER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have received a Petition from the Knights and Gentry of his Maieſties County of Eſſex, and a Petition from the whole Burrough of Colcheſter in the ſame County, tending both to one effect, the ſcope and ſubiect therof conſiſts of theſe heads:</p>
            <p>
               <label>I.</label>
Firſt, the exceeding great decay of their Trade of Cloathing eſpecially, and alſo the trading of manifacture in that County, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the preſent diſtractions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers in the State.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 16 -->
               <label>II.</label>
Secondly, the putting of that County and the whole Kingdome in a fitting poſture of warre for the deſence of the ſame, for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any plot or practice in agitation either of forraigne force, or domeſticke ſtratagem by the pub<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icke and private enemies thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <label>III.</label>
The removing of Popiſh Lords and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops from the Houſe of Peeres.</p>
            <p>
               <label>IV.</label>
The ſearching out and apprehenſion of Prieſts and Ieſuits, which lye ſecretly lurking and practiſing miſchiefe in divers places of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>
               <label>V.</label>
Laſtly, the bringing to triall of thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and others of their adherents, delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents in this Sate, and to their deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> under favour of this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſe, I deſire to ſpeake a word or two of theſe Petitions, the preſenting whereof to this Houſe is committed to my truſt &amp; care, and of theſe particulars of the ſame, which I have now recited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:157555:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 16 -->
               <label>I.</label>
Firſt, concerning the decay of Trade in that County, of Cloathing: It is too manifeſt, that by the ſame, many houſholds and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are brought to poverty and utter decay. The greateſt part of that County towards Colcheſter, and the part thereof adiacent to the Sea, having formerly had the chiefeſt meanes of their livelihood by that Trade, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Webſters which have in times paſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the many taxations and oppreſſions laid upon that Commodity of Cloath, Sayes and Bayes, by divers ill inſtruments of State, pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Art, and benefit that came there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to this Kingdome, raiſing the Cuſtomes thereof, to that exceſſe and height, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be gained by the ſame) imployed many poore people, whereby their charges and families were maintained, now deal little or nothing in the ſame, but betake themſelves to other wayes of livelihood, ſome turning In-keepers, Ale-houſe-keepers, ſome Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Graſiers, and the like, whereby rents of Farmes are increaſed by the multitude of Tenants, that hath almoſt beggered the moſt part of that County. And rhoſe poore men, Artificers, as Wea<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers, Combers, and the like, appertaining to the Trade of Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working, are brought (many of them) to beg their bread, and the reſt live upon the Pariſhes

charge, wherein they have had their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>
               <label>II.</label>
Secondly, concerning the removing of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Popiſh Lords from the Houſe of Peeres, wee have found it by wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more then neceſſary, they having beene, both publickly and privately, the onely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers and hinderers of our proceedings in the great affaires wee had in hand, concerning neerly the peace and welfare both of Church and State, I need not mention their practiſes to effect their endeavours, they are too too manifeſt and apparent to all men.</p>
            <p>
               <label>III.</label>
Thirdly, for ſearching and apprehending or Prieſts and Ieſuites, which have been the chiefe diſturbers of our peace, this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe hath already taken order for the ſame, to which I can ſay no more.</p>
            <p>
               <label>IV.</label>
Fourthly, the bringing to triall of thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops accuſed, and all other delinquents, are the chiefeſt endeavours of this Houſe, as farre as other the great affaires of State will give leave.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:157555:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 17 -->
               <label>V.</label>
Fiftly and laſtly, the ſetting of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into a good poſture of Warre, is of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſitie for the defence and ſecuritie thereof, eſpecially that Countie of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and other Maritane Counties of ths King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome perceiving the malignities of Forreigne States, are alwayes watching an opportunitie to iniure, and to worke miſchiefe, if it were poſſible, to the utter confuſion, not onely of this, but the other his Maieſties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; To which purpoſe wee have daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of their practiſes and plots with diſaffected perſons, and members of this ſtate, favouring, and taking part with any whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, either Foreigne or domeſtique, to bring their owne intentions and malicious indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perfection, although it be to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of their King and Countrey.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Sir,</hi> of that which I had to ſay concerning theſe Petitions, which I humbly leave to the conſideration of this Houſe, and to give ſuch anſwere thereunto, as to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the ſame ſhall ſeeme requiſite.</p>
