         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE
Sir THOMAS LANE, Knight,
LORD MAYOR of the City of LONDON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BEfore I congratulate Your Lordſhip's happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration
to the Pretorial Dignity, I muſt
firſt pay my duteous Veneration to the Merit
that advanced You thither. Your Lordſhip had that
Remarkable Triumph in Your Election, that when
You ſtood Candidate for the Chair, You brought ſo
fair a Maſs of Virtues to intitule You to that Pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that inſtead of Doubts and Scrutinyes, the tedious
Diſputes and Jars of Voices and Parties, too common
in too many Elections, 'twas enough for ſuch Merit
as Sir <hi>Thomas Lane</hi>'s only to enter the Lifts and carry
the Conqueſt. Divided Favours were utterly Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
there. Your Lordſhip was that univerſal Darling
that leſs than an hour began and concluded the
Choice; inſomuch that there wanted no more to fix
Your Lordſhip's Wreath of Honour, then only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Brow that wears it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:36024:3"/>
And as Magiſtracy, eſpecially in ſo high a Station,
as Your Lordſhip's, is no leſs then the immediate
Lievtenancy of Majeſty, the Deputy and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of Soveraign Power, Your Lordſhip makes
Your Entry to that Honorable Poſt of Truſt with
all thoſe eminent Advantages, as muſt fully anſwer
the Expectation of the World. For You bring with
You, that Vivacity and Sprightlyneſs of a fair and
Active Youth to undertake it, a Genius and a Soul,
and all the warmth of a Publick Spirit to execute it; and
to both theſe, that unſhaken Fidelity to Crown the
Hand that holds it. Nay not to want even the leaſt
Ornament or Decoration of Dignity, You bring a
Perſon too even to grace the Honour You wear.</p>
            <p>Thus as a Vigilant and Faithful Magiſtrate is a true
Crown Jewel, Your Prince and Your Country, thoſe
two great Aſcendants, being Your Lordſhips whole
Influencing Powers, You challenge all the Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the Higheſt and cleareſt Luſtre that that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Royal Jem can bear.</p>
            <p>Nay Your Acceſſion to Magiſtracy gives us this
particular Obſervation, that Your Lordſhip enters
the Seat, left You ſo warm with the Merit that fill'd
it before You, to whoſe worth and Virtues Your
Lordſhip brings not only a Succeſſion, but an Allyance
too. Thus as the Encouragement of Religion, and
the Suppreſſion of Vice have been ſo Exemplar a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Endeavour before You, Your Lordſhip
<pb facs="tcp:36024:3"/>
Approaches enricht with thoſe Principles and that
Zeale, for the effectual keeping up thoſe Sacred Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſces
of Authority ſo deſcended and lodged in Your
Hand; that all Good Men live in hopes that ſuch
Leading Originals may ſtand as laſting Patterns e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to lateſt Generations And thus in this great Work
ſo well begun and ſo continued, though Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Dignity is that Honour which You hold
but one ſhort Year, nevertheleſs, You will lay thoſe
Foundations of that Glory as will laſt to Ages; in
which true Propheticks, give me leave to Write my
ſelf,</p>

            <head>TO THE
Honourable Company
OF
CLOTHWORKERS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my Addreſs to the Company of <hi>Clothworkers,</hi> I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
within thoſe Walls that lead me to a very fair Survey
of no common Worth and Merit. For I may juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
You this Fair Renown, <hi>viz.</hi> That the whole Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of <hi>England</hi> is in a high meaſure owing to your worthy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
For as the Gold of our <hi>Fleece,</hi> and the Wealth of our
<hi>LOOM</hi> is in a manner our whole Engliſh <hi>Peru:</hi> And the back
of the <hi>Sheep,</hi> and not the Entrayls of the Earth is our chief
Mine of Riches. The Silkworm is no Spinſter of ours; and our
Wheele and our Webb, Gentlemen, are all your own.</p>
            <p>Thus as <hi>Trade</hi> is the life-blood of the Engliſh Nation, and
indeed the very Supporter of the Crown; ſo the greateſt
Branch of the Engliſh Trade lies in the <hi>Clothworkers</hi> Hands. Our
<hi>Floating Caſtles,</hi> I confeſs, Our Naval Commerce, bring us in
both the <hi>Or</hi> and the <hi>Argent,</hi> and indeed the whole wealth of the
World: They bring it in, 'tis true, but when throughly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
'tis Your <hi>CLOTH</hi> ſends out to fetch 'em. And thus
whilſt the Imperial <hi>Britannia</hi> is ſo formidable to her Foes, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36024:4"/>
ſo potent to her Friends, her Strength and her Power, when
duly conſider'd, to the <hi>Clothworkers</hi> Honour I may juſtly ſay,
'tis Your <hi>Shuttle</hi> nerves her Arm, and Your <hi>Woof</hi> that enrobes
her Glory.</p>
            <p>But not to inſiſt upon that ſingle Merit alone, the Extent of
Your Trade, and the Reputation You have acquired, theſe
being no more than the common work of Your Induſtry; no,
I have a Diviner Theme before me, the Hundreds of Your
poor Penſioners that yearly taſte Your Bread, and wear Your
Cloth, a Cloth ſo worne, poſſibly the faireſt Web in Your
whole Loom.</p>
            <p>Nor, Gentlemen, is Your Bounteous Goodneſs bounded here,
Your Charity confined within Your own Gates, Your own Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable
Roof only: but Your more ſpreading Acts of Mercy
and Humanity have a yet larger Extent. Thoſe two fair Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
the <hi>Vniverſities,</hi> both Rivals to Your kind Favours, lay
their equal claim to Your Gracious Smiles, witneſs your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and generous <hi>Exhibitions,</hi> Your cheriſhing Hand towards
the Nurſery of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus not only our great Channel of Trade runs through
the worthy <hi>Clothworkers,</hi> but the two Great Fountains of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too muſt acknowledge You their Patrons and Benefactors.
Nay, Your goodneſs deſeends to cheriſh Literature, even in
Inferiour Schools of Youth, ſupported and maintained by You;
and not only ſo but communicates its cheriſhing warmth to Age
and Grey Hairs; when beſides Your Penſioners at home, ſo
many Alms-houſes of both Sexes look up to the Honourable
Clothworkers for their feeding Hand.</p>
            <p>In recounting the Clothworkers Worth, not to walk further
into ſo ſpacious a Field, 'tis ſufficient that Your <hi>Charity</hi> alone
diſplays You truly <hi>Honourable.</hi> For Charity as it is the higheſt
Heavenly Vertue, ſo ir carries likewiſe the higheſt worldly <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
too. For whatever great Names and gay Scutcheons, thoſe
emptier Blazons of Worth and Dignity may pretend; there's no
Grandeur nor Magnificence equals this. For even Statues and
Pyramids are but faint Memorials, and ſpeak but dead Praiſe;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36024:5"/>
whilſt fed Mouths and cloathed Nakedneſs are the living Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Honour. The cheerful and Thankful Praiers of the
<hi>Poor</hi> are of all the loudeſt <hi>Trumps</hi> of <hi>Fame,</hi> for their ſound
reaches Heaven, and makes the ſweeteſt and moſt greatful Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
there.</p>
            <p>And Gentlemen, as thoſe ſoft Airs create ſo divine a Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
to encreaſe that tuneful Quire, may You never want that
generous and continued Succeſſion of Charity, thoſe daily Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
with full Hands and open Hearts, who in pious emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the fair Examples before 'em, ſhall ſtudy to copy from
ſuch Illuſtrious Patterns; ſo feed the hungry Bellies, ſo cover
the naked Backs, and ſo warm the chilling Roofs, till in reward of
the drooping Heads they raiſe here below, they come to crown
their own above; which with laſt hearty wiſh</p>
