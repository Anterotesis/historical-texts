            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to shew them selues prest and redy, redy to suffer &amp; to crucify them selues with Christ, as wel in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite as in fleshe, as wel in soule as in body. To crucifye them selues. I meane, to afflycte the spirite &amp; soule with an inwarde remorse, with an inward remembraunce of theyr owne wretched lyues: euery one to consydre theyr owne synful dedes. Theyr synnes to be soo great &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable, that it was necessary for Chryst the sonne of God to suffer and dye for it. To consydre that nothyng in this worlde coulde pourge nor clense vs from synne, but the onely bloode of Chryst, his onely Passyon and deathe. And in this remembraunce, to crucyfye our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytes, to mourne and lament, to wepe and sorowe oure sayde synnes, whiche were the cause why Chryste dyd suffer, whiche were the verye cause of this his mooste pityous paynefull Passyon and death. We ought also this day to crucyfye, to afflycte, and punyshe oure bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, with exterior and outwarde afflyctyons: with bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dylye paynes and penaunces. As I do not doubte, but many good chrysten people hath done bothe this laste nyght and this day also. This nyght past I say, bothe inwardly and outwardly. Inwarly, by inward deuout remembraunce, howe and what Passyons Chryst suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered this nyght and day for vs. Howe that this nyght after he had eate the Paschal lambe with his disciples, after that he had ministred his moost holy precious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and bloode to them and washed theyr feete: howe he went in to the mount and there prayed vnto god the father, a prolixe, a longe, a deuoute &amp; dolorous prayer: thre tymes desiryng his father to put away that bloody

chalyce, that deathly cuppe, that paynful Passyon, that panguyous deathe. At whiche prayer his mynde was appalled, his soule was panguyde, his body was dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fyted, his nature was decayed, his herte ful of sorow, his mynd soo wonderfully troubled, that all his nature of the manheed soo horrybly was dysmayd, that he fell in a sweate, and swette water and blood, blood &amp; water: by that to shew his greate panguys &amp; paynes, bothe of soule and bodye, bothe inwardlye and outwardly. And in this pityous deuout remembraunces, they haue had I doubte not, moche pitye &amp; compassyon on the same.</p>
            <p>They haue also deuoutly remembred I trust, howe that he thryse rose from his deuoute &amp; prolixe prayer, &amp; yoode to his three dyscyples, Peter, Iames and Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And how he found them a slepe, &amp; sayde to Peter, <q>

O Peter, how woldest thou suffer &amp; dye with me, &amp; kanst not holde vp thy heed nor waake with me one houre? What not one houre Peter? They haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred also I doubte not, howe Chryst went volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taryly towarde that Traytour Iudas, and wyllyngly dyd mete hym, and the Iues whiche came to take hym. And how he asked Iudas &amp; his companye, whom they sought, for in dede they knewe hym not. And shewed to them that he was he, that he was Christ, that he was Iesus of Nazareth whom they sought: &amp; how he amaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them, &amp; threw them by his secret power down to the ground: &amp; suffered them twyse to aryse &amp; then to knowe him, then to take him, to bynd hym, to hale &amp; lugge him from post to pyller, and all spytefull wayes to handle hym.

So that now it appeareth to all the worlde, that this daye is festiuall, holye, gracyous and gloryous. A day to be halowed and kepte holye. A day to gyue laudes thankes and praysynges to god for his greate beneficiall actes shewed vnto vs and for vs as on this day.</p>
