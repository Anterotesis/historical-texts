         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou are here presented with a <hi>PEICE,</hi> never
intended for the Press, which hath slept long
amongst the Papers of Sir <hi>DUDLEY
DIGGES,</hi> late <hi>Master of the Rolls;</hi>
a Personage of known Wisdom and Integrity,
and who understood well the value of this <hi>Manuscript,</hi>
which had nothing forged or supposititious in it.</p>
                  <p>There is no kind of Writing, that men do generally with
more greediness look into, then <hi>LETTERS;</hi> especially, if they
be <hi>Letters of State,</hi> from <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Wise Persons,</hi> and
in a <hi>Wise Time,</hi> as these are. And that appears in the
<hi>Two Volumes</hi> of <hi>Letters,</hi> lately printed under the Titles
of <hi>CABALA,</hi> and <hi>Secrets of Empire;</hi> which have
been <hi>very well</hi> resented: and, though indeed, they have no
Coherence of <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Matter,</hi> but are a <hi>Rapsodie</hi> of the
dispersed thoughts of the <hi>Dead,</hi> upon several occasions; yet
(like a <hi>Prospect</hi> of <hi>Various Objects)</hi> have delighted the
<hi>Curious Eye.</hi> This <hi>Collection,</hi> being a <hi>continued Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation</hi>
of Sir <hi>FRANCIS WALSINGHAM,</hi> during his
three years Residence (as Ambassador) in that Mysterious
Treaty of <hi>Queen ELIZABETHS Marriage,</hi> successively,
with the two <hi>Great Brothers</hi> of <hi>VALOIS,</hi> wil without doubt
meet with an equal, if not a better reception; and not onely
please the <hi>Judicious</hi> sight, with its <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Uniformity</hi>
(like a <hi>large Prospect</hi> at sea;) but may be of great use to those
<pb facs="tcp:54478:3"/>
                     <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that shall be bred up to <hi>serve Princes</hi> hereafter
in this kind of <hi>Honorable Imployment.</hi> And though the
<hi>English</hi> have been hitherto so reserved, as not to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the <hi>Treaties</hi> and <hi>Negotiations</hi> of their <hi>Ambassadors</hi>
abroad; so that we have hardly any notion of them, hut by
their <hi>Arms,</hi> which are hung up in Inns where they passed;
yet the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> (who think themselves as
<hi>wise,</hi> and as <hi>good Polititians)</hi> have frequently done it;
which we see and read with delight, as giving a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of <hi>Affairs, Times</hi> and <hi>Persons,</hi> then any <hi>History</hi> can
do; unless men of <hi>Action,</hi> and great <hi>Statesmen,</hi> could find
leisure (as <hi>CAESAR,</hi> and some others did) to set down (with
integrity) the several Passages of their Times.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Persons</hi> who acted this Scene, and who speak by their
<hi>Letters;</hi> are, the <hi>QUEEN</hi> her self, <hi>LEICESTER, BURLEIGH,
WALSINGHAM,</hi> and Sir <hi>THOMAS SMITH;</hi> such a <hi>Iuncto</hi>
(for abilities) as were sufficient to <hi>govern</hi> the <hi>whole world:</hi>
but the chief ministerial parts lay upon <hi>BURLEIGH</hi> and
<hi>WALSINGHAM,</hi> two such <hi>Ministers of State,</hi> as no age in
this Nation hath produced their Equals.</p>
                  <p>Of her <hi>Royal-self</hi> (whom all <hi>EUROPE</hi> did either honor
or fear) I shall onely say, That as she had the <hi>judgement</hi> to
make good choice of her <hi>Servants,</hi> though she rewarded but
sparingly (like her Grandfather <hi>HENRY</hi> the seventh) yet
she had the <hi>Fortune</hi> to find them more <hi>loyal</hi> and <hi>secret</hi> then
those Princes that succeeded her, notwithstanding their great
gifts, and effusion of the Treasure of the Crown, which now
(with their bodies) lies buried in the Dust.</p>
                  <p>And if at any time it concerned her to be well served, it
was in this great <hi>Treaty</hi> of a <hi>League</hi> and <hi>Marriage</hi> with
<hi>FRANCE;</hi> where she had to do with as <hi>cunning a Lady</hi> as
her self (the <hi>Queen Mother)</hi> and with the <hi>King</hi> her Son,
<hi>CHARLS</hi> the ninth, the <hi>deepest Dissembler</hi> that ever wore
Crown.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:54478:3"/>
For the Match it self, whether it were really intended
by the <hi>FRENCH,</hi> I make some doubt of the first; namely,
that with the D of <hi>ANjou,</hi> afterwards <hi>HENRY</hi> the third;
but do rather think it was set on foot with design to amuse our
<hi>Queen,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Princes</hi> of <hi>FRANCE,</hi> and
to breed a <hi>Confidence</hi> the better to draw them into the <hi>Net</hi>
at <hi>Paris,</hi> I mean the barbarous and bloody Massacre on
St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> Eve, 1572. being the second year of
this <hi>Negotiation;</hi> and by reason of the <hi>close carriage</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
could never be discovered by our <hi>quick-sighted</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
with all his <hi>Spyes</hi> and <hi>Intelligencers,</hi> till he was
almost overwhelmed in it himself.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>second Treatie,</hi> which was set on foot in the
year 1581. with Monsieur the Duke of <hi>ALANSON,</hi> I do
conceive that it was really intended by the <hi>FRENCH,</hi>
and by the chief of the <hi>ENGLISH</hi> Councel, except
<hi>LEICESTER</hi> (who had pretensions of his own;) but for her
<hi>own Mind,</hi> what that really was, I must leave, as a thing
<hi>doubly</hi> inscrutable, both as she was a <hi>Woman</hi> and a <hi>Queen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning that <hi>Immortal hatred</hi> that grew between
her and the Queen of <hi>SCOTS,</hi> occasioned by <hi>difference in
Religion, contrary State-Interest, Neighboring King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
Emulation of Greatness,</hi> and perhaps of <hi>Beauty</hi>
too; and wherein all the Princes of <hi>Christendom</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose,
some one way, and some another (as will appear by
these <hi>Letters)</hi> I can resemble it to nothing better, then the
<hi>Poets</hi> faigned quarrel between <hi>JUNO</hi> and <hi>VENUS,</hi> which
did so often trouble the <hi>whole Family</hi> of their <hi>Gods;</hi> and
the <hi>Scots Queens</hi> assuming the <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi>
in the time of her <hi>first Husband</hi> (though she afterwards
excused it as an act of constraint, she being under obedience)
was that <hi>Manet alta mente Repostum.</hi>
That <hi>injury</hi> which could never be <hi>forgiven,</hi> till it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated
with her <hi>blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:54478:4"/>
And though these <hi>Things</hi> were the main part of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,</hi>
yet there falls in other important Matters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> the
business of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countreys;</hi> the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Fugitives,</hi> controversies about <hi>Merchant Affairs,</hi>
&amp;c. All so well digested, and delivered in so <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear</hi>
a stile, without any <hi>pomp</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> or <hi>ostentation</hi> of
<hi>Wit,</hi> as renders the <hi>PEICE</hi> much more valuable to those
that know a <hi>good Hand,</hi> when they see it. And if a man
could be beholding to his <hi>Cyphers,</hi> as Sir <hi>ROBERT NAUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON</hi>
saith, speaking of these very <hi>LETTERS</hi> in his <hi>Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta
Regalia,</hi> they would have told <hi>pretty Tales</hi> of the
<hi>Times:</hi> but I must leave the <hi>decyphering</hi> part to those that
have more <hi>leisure</hi> and <hi>dexterity</hi> that way, and conclude all
with this reflection upon our <hi>Ambassador,</hi> which will fall
under the careful observers eye; how <hi>vigilant</hi> he was to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>true Intelligence;</hi> what <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> be used for
it; how punctual he was in keeping to his <hi>Instructions,</hi>
where he was <hi>limitted;</hi> and how <hi>wary</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi> where
he was left <hi>free;</hi> still advancing, upon alloccasions, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi>
and <hi>Interest</hi> of his <hi>Great Mistris,</hi> with a most
lively and indefatigable Devotion.</p>

                  <head>Instructions for Francis Walsingham Esquire; sent by the Queens Majesty to the

12 year of Her Majesties Reign.</head>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst, you shall conferr with our Ambassador
Sir <hi>Henry Norris</hi> knight, upon this Charge
now committed unto you, and as you two
shall think best, to proceed therein for our
Service, so we are well content to allow
your doings; and for the repair and delivery
of our Letters to the French King, and to
the Queen Mother, with such other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
thereto belonging; you shall also
follow the advice and discretion of our said
Ambassador.</p>
                  <p>The charge which we doe commit to
you, resteth only and principally upon this
speciall Matter following; whereunto we will that you direct your whole
actions.</p>
                  <p>We desire that the Accord betwixt the King our good Brother, and the Prince
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54478:9"/>
of Navarre, Prince of Condé, and the Admirall, with the rest of the Company,
being the Kings Subjects, might be made as favourable for the reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation
and surety of the said Princes and their party, as may be possible to the
maintenance and continuance of them in the liberty of their Consciences for the
cause of Religion.</p>
                  <p>And because we consider that there is no small labour made by some directly
to impeach this accord, and by some others though not openly to withstand is,
yet by doubtfull dealing in the granting to their Requests to ruine the said Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and their party in the end: We finde it the more necessary for us to use all
good means to countervail such contrary labours, and to procure not only a good
Accord, but therewith a continuance thereof, as a matter which in our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Honor we think good both for the King and his whole Estate. And
therefore after you shall understand the state of the Negotiation of this matter
by the Deputies of the two Princes with the King, and wherein it shall be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for them that our Ambassador and you shall deal with the King or Queen-Mother
in our Name; Our meaning is, you shall in this manner, or the like, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
our Intentions, as Grounds whereupon you may lay the rest of our Reasons
and perswasions that shall be thought good to be propounded to the King.</p>
                  <p>First, you shall say that we earnestly request the King to set apart all manner
of Jealousie that either hath been, or may be insinuated to him, of our meaning
in this cause betwixt him and his Subjects: for that we mean as well, and so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
have to him and his Estate, as if we were his naturall Sister, and never had
any intention to maintain or comfort any of his Subjects against him to move
any trouble to his estate, or to diminish any parcell of his Crown. And yet you
shall say, That we will in this sort be plain with him, thinking yet best to agree
with good Friendship and Honor, that we could never be well satisfied or content
in our minds, to have the said Princes and their party, for professing of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
whereof they have freedom granted to them, to be overthrown or distressed
by means of partiality of their private Enemies, as long as they never required
in substance any other thing of the King, then a permission to enjoy the benefit
of the former Edicts granted unto them for the exercise of their Religion. In
the which we doe also consider that they had been so long suffered as a great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of people of his Realm had been in their young years therein nourished and
established, and without opinion of damnation of their souls, they could not
change the same, so as we pray the King to take this our plain dealing in good
part, and to interpret of our advice that we are bold to give him, as one that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
first and principally best to him and his estate, and no otherwise to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
then shall in our Judgment further the quietness, repose, and augmentation
of him in Honour, Wealth and Surety.</p>
                  <p>You shall next to this say, that we have partly considered of such Petitions
and Demands as we be informed his Subjects have in most humble sort required
to be granted to them: And we note the substance of them to consist specially
upon these points. The first, that they may be restored to his favour and grace
as most humble and faithfull Subjects; a thing most meet for a King to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
both readily and bountifully, and consequently to serve him with their lives,
lands, and goods: a thing also for a King most profitable to imbrace &amp; accept. And
the next, that they may be permitted to serve almighty God by exercise of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, according to their Profession, and to quietness of their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
a thing also in the sight, of God most commendable, and needfull of all
Christian Subjects. And last, that they may have assurance hereof in some bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort, then by former experience they have had, a matter of most moment to
be regarded for a full perfection of all the rest, and without the which the rest are
of no account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54478:9"/>
In these Suits most humbly presented, of Subjects to a most Christian King,
of so great a multitude of People, consisting of such sundry kinds and estates, of
Princes of his blood, of noble Captains, of learned men meet for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Counsel, of valiant Souldiers, of great Burgesses, rich Merchants,
yea of Women, Children, and all inferior sorts almost innumerable, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see, but the more speedily, the more bountifully and assuredly the King
shall deal with them, as a Father with his Children, the more shall be his own
quietness, his comfort, his riches, his strength, as we doubt not but he seeth
without Declaration; and glad we are to hear it commonly reported, how well
disposed he himself is to receive them to his favour: And therefore you shall
say, it needeth not to discourse with him, though he be young in years, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
dis-commodities and lamentable mis-haps hath within a short time grown
to his Estate, by denying to his Subjects of their reasonable requests. And
though there be <hi>per</hi> case by some hard hearted persons, cavilations found to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
some part of their requests in particular, yet we require him to think
how meet it is for him, the Soveraign Prince, not to want profit and honor of
so general a Peace in his Kingdom, by re-uniting to himself of such a multitude
of serviceable Subjects, which indeed is of such a moment, as no cavilation
would be admitted against any particular point that may stand with his Estate, and
accelerate the Peace. But to consider the King being the Soveraign to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and they his Subjects to obey, and so by nature alwaies to live in fear,
are to be rather comforted with a large grant to their requests, and a full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of assurance, then by denying any Portions of their demands, to be
nourished in doubt and anguish of mind; whereby neither part should rest in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
neither the King, for he had denyed, nor the Subjects, for they could
not obtain; and so as it hapneth in sickness, the recidivations might be most peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And after you have dealt with the King for furtherance of any particular
impediments, you shall also say, that we do promise the King, and will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to make any assurance, that he shall require meet to be made betwixt
Princes; that if it shall please him to be a gracious Lord unto them, at this time,
in their requests, and not to abridge the same to their misliking, whereby they
may gather doubtfulness and fear of continuance of that which shall be granted
them; if any of them shall contrary to their promises and submissions, attempt any
thing directly or indirectly to the trouble of the Kings Estate, and contrary to
the duties of true Subjects, we shall not only condemn them in our own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
and so pronounce them to the world, but shall also, as the King shall find
it meet, prosecute them as common enemies to our selves.</p>
                  <p>And for any particular matter, that you shall be by the Deputies of the Princes
requested to further, you shall do well to be instructed how to maintain their
Demands, which shall be committed to you with such reasons as may be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to be mentioned by you, having respect that you shall deal therein for us,
being a Queen and a Monarch with a like Prince.</p>
                  <p>And if any on the Kings behalf shall object to you, that our dealing for those
Princes and their company, being subjects in this sort, to have liberty granted
to them for exercise of Religion in other sort then the King himself, and the
common Authority of the Realm doth profess, is not agreeable with our own
actions and proceedings against our Subjects that have lately sought in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
liberty to use the Roman Religion contrary to our Profession; you may
answer thereto very well, that if they mean this by a late rebellion stirred up
this last year, in a part of our North Countrey, by the Earls of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Westmerland.</hi> First it is very true, that they only coloured outwardly
their rebellious attempts, with a pretence of Religion. And you may say, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54478:10"/>
the matter is objected, that it is well known, and you are warranted to avow
it, that the principal cause of that Rebellion was wrought (you will not say by
the Queen of Scots) but sure you are, by her Ministers both here in <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by some of the principal parties of the Nobility in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
that do hate Roman Religion.</p>
                  <p>Besides that, it is evident, that the two Earls that were the heads thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did begin their Rebellion, did at no time shew themselves unwilling to
exercise the rights of the Religion established by Law in this Realm; but as
they gave their consents when the order thereof was first established in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
so did they ordinarily resort from the beginning of our Reign in all
open places to the Churches and to Divine Services in the Church, without
contradiction or shew of misliking.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if either they, or any other of our Subjects, would make request
to be at liberty to acknowledge the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the
Pope would challenge it in this Realm, and as by his Bulls and Decrees he doth
declare his meaning, how he would exercise it to the ruine of our Crown, it is
so manifest, and that even by late experience notoriously well proved, that
such a provision to be granted, induceth necessarily the party to be criminal of
treason and as in no wise any such permission can be by us granted
to any Subjects within our Realm; without we would therewith also, yield our
Right and Royal Title to the will of Traytors, wherein manifestly appeareth
a notable difference betwixt such a permission as the Kings Subjects do require
for exercise of their Religion, which also hath been by the Kings Authoritie
granted heretofore to them, and the permission that were to be granted to any
of our Subjects, that would exercise the Roman Religion in our Realm, and
obey the Commandments, Decrees and Bulls of the Pope; for we never could
perceive, that the exercise of the Religion professed by the Princes, and their
adherents in <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rance,</hi> did any way prejudice the Kings Title and Right to his
Crown, but that the Professors thereof did alwaies with all humbleness and
constancie, acknowledge and maintain the same, without adhering to any other
Power or Authoritie; but we see it manifest, and have lately proved it, and
duly punished it, in such as seek to erect up the Authoritie of the Pope in
our Realm, and do directly and manifestly not onely impugn our Estate Royal;
but labour to remove us from the Throne of our Kingdom, whereunto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God hath placed, maintained, and preserved us; a matter so manifestly
full of danger, as neither we may yield unto, no, nor none of our good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
will never assent thereto, but in that quarrel will adventure all their lives,
lands and estates, as of late against the Rebellion that was coloured with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Romish Religion, we did sufficiently prove generally in all parts of
our Realm, and in all Estates and persons by the readiness of their service. And
thus you have a general note how to direct you in the prosecution of the purpose
intended by this your journey; not doubting, but both in this, and all the rest
of your Charge, you will joyn your self with our Ambassador, who for his
Acquaintance and his Experience, can very sufficiently inform you how to
deal.</p>
                  <p>If any thing shall be moved to you for the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> cause, you may
say, that before your departure, and within two or threes daies after that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Poigney</hi> had been with us, we had certain intelligence from <hi>Scotland,</hi>
that the Lord <hi>Levinston,</hi> which was sent from the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> to solicite
the leavying of Arms, and to bring some of the Nobilitie to confer both with
us and her for ending of the troubles, had been with the Duke of <hi>Chastelhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranlte,</hi>
the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> and others joyned with them before the 20 of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54478:10"/>
the last moneth, for so his own Letters do testifie to our Cousin the Earl of
<hi>Sussex</hi> our Lieutenant, upon our borders towards <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that he found
them well content with the Articles accorded by us with the French Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> and that he was well forward in his Commission,
so as we do look now daily both for a general ceasing of Arms there, and for
the access of the Noblemen on both parties of that Realm here, to treat and
conclude upon the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> cause. And if any further matter be moved
unto you in this, you shall say, that you have no more to say therein.</p>
                  <p>When you have been with the King, and entred so far into this Charge as
our Ambassador and you may see likelihood of the end hereof, we would be
advertised with all speed possible. And if our Ambassador and you think that
the hastie yielding of the Deputies in their negociation, may bring peril to the
cause, we think it good that they might be induced to stand somewhat hard
therein, as policie may serve them, without making to them any further aids of
money. But as yet, we do rather give them some countenance to use more earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estness
for their own suretie.</p>

shall use all good language to express the joy thereof; and to offer all manner of

                  <head>A Copy of the Letter sent to Master Secretary, touching the negotiation had
with the King the 28 of August, 1570.</head>
                  <p>SIr, it may please your Honour to advertise her Majestie, that the King ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
in very good part her Congratulation, as from his good Sister and
Neighbour, who hath alwaies wished his well-doing and prosperity (for these
were his words) after Congratulation done to the King. The Queen Mother,
having inquired of me of the well-doing of her Majestie, asked me how the
Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> did. I answered her, that at my departure, for any thing that I
knew to the contrary, she did very well; then she proceeded to enquire of me
touching her present estate: I answered, according to the tenor of my Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
in what state she stood at my departure, wherewith she seemed to rest
very well satisfied: And then she fell to protestation, that for her own part she
was so well perswaded of the Queens Majesties merciful disposition, as she knew
right well, that if she did deal any thing hardly with the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> it
rather proceeded from some of her Ministers, then from her Majesties self. I
replied, that I was glad to understand, that she conceived so well of the Queen
my Mistress's good disposition; so was I sorry, that she should think that she
would be, by any of her Ministers or Councellours, drawn to any thing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
towards her, or any other, that might not stand with her honour; for
that her skill and years was now to direct, and not to be directed: I desired her
therefore, in her Majesties name, that she would evermore reserve an ear for
her (a thing that would not in equity be denied to the meanest person in <hi>France)</hi>
who in all her actions hitherto towards the Queen of Scots, had dealt with that
regard to her honour, as she was right able to justifie herself both towards the
King her good Brother, as also toward all other Princes. Then she made
great protestation of her indifferencie, and that she is no less affected in good will
towards her Majestie, whom it pleaseth saith she, to do me the honour as to
call me by the name of a Mother, then to the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> her Daughter
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54478:11"/>
in Law: And therefore, in wishing her liberty, I do it, saith she, as much for
the Q. your Mistress quientness sake, as for any other respect, which without her
libertie can hardly grow unto her. This Sir, in effect, was the whole course of
the speech that passed from her in that behalf, which she had then with me apart;
the King being then in talk with my Lord Ambassador. Then she caused the
King to deal with me in that behalf; to whom I shewed the state of her cause,
according to the contents of my Instructions, wherewith he seemed to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
He told me, that he wished that the Queen his good Sister, according to
her merciful inclination, would have some compassion of her cause, and grow
to some speedy conclusion in that behalf. I told him, that I doubted not but
that her Majestie would for his sake do that which should be to his contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so far forth as might stand with her hononr and safetie: Then he protested,
that otherwise he would not desire it. Thus having imparted to your honor the
effect of my Negotiation, to the end you may advertise her Majestie, I most
humblie take my leave.</p>

there cometh forthwith a Gentleman from the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the

Majestie thanks for the great favour shewed them in this their troubles. Thus
Sir, having advertised you of the Accomplishment of that which was appointed

same to her Majestie, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <head>The Copy of my Letter to the Earl of Leicester.</head>
                  <p>RIght Honourable, and my very good Lord; for that I know my Lord
Ambassador here, imparteth unto your Lordship, the present state of
things here, I shall need the less to trouble your Lordship in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
                  <p>Touching my Message of Congratulation, the King accepteth the same in
very good part; he professeth good will towards the Queen my Mistress, and
touching the Peace, he protesteth to keep and observe the same inviolably,
which his proceedings hitherto doth very well confirm the same. The mutinous
Messiems of <hi>Paris,</hi> he hath fundry times since his repair hither, very sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked,
and charged them with contempt; he adviseth them to take another
course, and saith, he will be known to be a King: And therefore for that his
meaning is that the Edict should be duly observed, he commandeth them straitly
to look to the due observations of the same.</p>
                  <p>The like advertisement hath he given to the Presidents of his Parliament here,
who seem as yet to stand in some terms with him: For whereas the King
would have them sworn to the observation of the Edict, they refuse the same —
alledging, that in the entrance into their Government, they ordinarily take an
oath to observe all such Edicts, as by the King shall be published; what will be
the issue of the refusal, I know not. The King telleth them, that the passions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54478:12"/>
of some of his Councellors hath been of more value then his Authoritie; and
therefore he assureth them (which he confirmeth with many an oath) that unless
they turn over another leaf, he will provide him of new Presidents, and extend
such punishment towards them, as their contempt deserveth, and may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishment
to others to avoid the like.</p>
                  <p>As, I can gather in the time of my short abode here by such a Conference a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
I have had with some of judgement, I find the grounds of the continuance
of the Peace to be in number five, his own disposition, necessitie, pleasure,
the Kings misliking, with certain of his Council, and his late favouring of
others.</p>
                  <p>His disposition of Peace, is not grown to-him of late, but hath been from the
beginning, as those that have well observed him do testifie; and therefore there
is the more hope of continuance of the same.</p>
                  <p>His necessity hath two parts: first, he lacketh treasure to maintain the charges
of further Wars. Secondly, those that have served him in these wars, are grown
so weary of them, as men judge, that hardly they could have been drawn to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
them any longer.</p>
                  <p>Pleasure and Warrs are direct contraries, and he being so much inclined
to the one, as he is an enemy unto the other, it is thought therefore, that
hardly any thing will bring him to do that that may hinder his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>His misliking towards the house of <hi>Giuse</hi> continueth, who have been the
nourishers of these wars: And though of late the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> hath had
access to the Kings presence, yet is he not repaired in credit, neither dealeth he
in Government.</p>
                  <p>His favour to <hi>Montmorencie,</hi> a chief worker of this Peace increaseth, who
now carrieth the whole sway of the Court, and is restored to the Government
of <hi>Paris;</hi> besides, he hath procured the displacing of <hi>Monluc, Monsieur d'Escars,</hi>
and <hi>la Vale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t,</hi> and procured to be placed in their rooms, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>These, my Lord, be the grounds that I can gather of the new accord, the
doubts of the not continuance are in number three:</p>
                  <p>First, it is thought that this Marriage with the Emperours daughter, may draw
him from this peaceable inclination.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the great conference that is between the Q. Mother and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
breedeth some doubt of some practise to impeach the same.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it is a common fear, that Monsieur can hardly digest to live in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of a Subject, having already the reputation of a King: he seemeth yet to
run one course with the King in liking and misliking; but so to continue it, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
thought unlikely.</p>
                  <p>I have been desirous underhand, to search out somewhat touching the thing
your Lordship gave me secret informations of, yet I can learn nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
though that would be dangerous, yet I pray God there be not a thing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
of more danger, which may with more ease be brought to pass.</p>
                  <p>I leave your Lordship to consider, by that which hath been shewed, both hope
and fear of the continuance of this peace: What will be the issue of this Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
I pray God that fall out that may be to his glory; and so committing your
Lordship to his tuition, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>TRusty and right well-beloved, we greet you well; whereas Monsieur
<hi>Moulenet</hi> being lately with us, did not only bring several Letters from the
French King our good Brother, and the Queen Mother; by which the said
King and she expresly required us to use towards the Queen of Scots, all honest
and favourable treatment due to a Queen of her quality, and to set her at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and aid her to be restored to her Realm with Authoritie due to her; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
according to the credit given by the said Letters, he the said, <hi>Moulenet</hi> did at
length with very earnest speech deal with us therein, alledging, that in this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we should much satisfie the King his Master, and procure to our self great
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54478:13"/>
honor; adding many other Allegations to induce thereunto to the maintenance
of the said <hi>Moulenets</hi> speeches and negotiations.</p>
                  <p>Thereunto we have made some brief Answers, as the time then served, and
as we thought meet to satisfie them. But yet finding them to continue in their
earnest solicitations, and in the end earnestly requesting our Answer to the French
King, we told them, that the time did not then conveniently serve us to send
such an answer to them (as the case required) to our good Brother, but we would
shortly impart our meaning herein more at large by you, being our Ambassador
there Resident, in such sort, as we trusted our said Brother and the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should find the same reasonable.</p>
                  <p>And so will we, that you shall with your best opportunitie resort to them both,
and declare unto them, that because of the length and varietie of the matters
which we have committed unto you to be declared; yet <hi>per</hi> case it be hard for
you to express the same so orderly and readily in speech as you gladly would do,
you may require of the King license to read unto them in such sort as you have
turned it into French, a thing usual to this their Ambassador, and not to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked,
especially in you that most herein use their language, and not your own
natural; as their Ambassador doth here, to his great commoditie. And this
being granted, when you read it, our meaning is not, you shall deliver the same
out of your hands to be kept or copied, unless it be very earnestly prest by them.
And thus it followeth that you shall declare:</p>
                  <p>We have considered of the Letters sent unto us by <hi>Moulenet</hi> from them both,
with also the further explanation of the Contents thereof by him, according to
the credit given unto him. The sum whereof, was to require our favour towards
the Queen of Scots, in using her with favourable treatment due to a Queen of her
qualitie, and aiding her with our power to be restored to her Realm, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of her Subjects: And though we did suddenly say somewhat to <hi>Moulenet</hi> on
our own part, to have satisfied him, as we have done the like at sundrie other
times to their Ambassador here Resident; yet not knowing how they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
or delivered our speeches to the King our good brother, nor how there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he is satisfied, which we are desirous to do in all reasonable requests, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the good Amitie that is and ought to be between us, we have thought good
at some more length, to impart to our good Brother and Queen Mother, both
our doing and meanings in all this case of the Queen of Scots, nothing doubting
but the same being by them considered with their indifferent judgements, it shall
appear that we have done nothing hitherto, in this case, contrary to honour and
reason, or otherwise then very necessary and urgent cause hath moved us, or might
have moved any other Prince having the like cause; neither yet in deeming the
request of our good Brother the King in such sort and condition as it it made,
have we given him any occasion of offence towards us. And this to do, we
are moved in good will, in respect of the mutual Amitie that is betwixt the
King and us, and not of any necessitie we have to be accountable to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for our actions; and so we trust the King will accept the same in friendly
manner.</p>
                  <p>And before he shall know what is to be said on our part, we do earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
them both, as a good Brother, and a good Sister, according to the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
offers of their good amitie and perfect love made to us, not only by their
Letters, but by Messages, that they both will give ear hereunto, as Princes
and Persons standing indifferent in this cause, without declination of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
or adverting their judgements to the instigations of any particular persons
that are more affectionate of nature to the person of the said Queen, then to the
truth of the matter; and this being granted, as in honour it cannot be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54478:13"/>
denied, specially betwixt friends, as we make account of them both in all our
honorable causes, we doubt not but we shall well see, that in stead of request or
expostulation made to us, we shall be found to have deserved praise and thanks
for our doings past, and shall not be disallowed in forbearing hereafter to grant
simply to the requests as they are made. And after the King and his Mother
shall grant to us this reasonable request, you shall proceed and say, First, we
require our good Brother to consider what part of his request hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
accomplished of our natural disposition; and next, what part we have
not as yet yielded unto; and then also, he shall see uponwhat just reasons we
forbear to assent to the rest of their requests, as it is made, where we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to use all honest and gracious treatment due to a Queen of her qualitie:
The truth is, since her flying into our Realm, where she escaped an evident
danger of her life, we caused her to be alwaies honorably attended by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Nobilitie, and such as were of the ancient Families of our Realm; we
have entertained her at our charges with a company of her own, of such
Lords and Ladies as she her self made choice of to remain with her, and
appointed her houses of such Commoditie of pleasures and pastimes as the
Countrey would afford: And herein being constrained to say somewhat more
for our self, then otherwise we would, but to answer calumniations, we are
assuredly informed, that for her own Person, her Diet and commoditie of
Past<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me meet for the conservation of her health, she for the most part when
she lived at her own will in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had no better Entertainment or Diet,
but rather many times worse and baser, as it is well known to all persons that
understand both: So as for the state, and honest and favourable treatment of
her own Person, we are sure no lack can be found—suppressed, or rather
untrulie reported of us, wherein we have been much wronged, contrary to our
deserts, the King our good Brother, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d his Mother, not a little abused with
such untruths.</p>
                  <p>If fault have been found that she hath not been used according as a Q. of her
quality, if therein be meant, that she hath not such honour done in the services
of her, as are due to a Queen, she herself is to answer to the same, for by her
own servants she hath been, and is continually served. And we think not but
that they have therein accomplished their duties according to her desire, at
the least, to speak the truth, we are crediblie informed, that in <hi>Scotland</hi> she had
commonly less reverence done to her in her services by the self same servants,
then hath been by them here. And as to such of ours as have attended upon
her, we think they have not forborn to do their duties at all times agreeable to
her estate, except <hi>per</hi> case she her self have of her courtesie at sometimes remitted
some part thereof to them. But for our part truly, notwithstanding such great
offences as she hath diversly made unto us, we have been alwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es careful of her
person to be honorably used, and of her health to be by all possible good means
preserved, esteeming it our honor so to have her treated and used, being brought
into calamity, and flying into our Realm as she did.</p>
                  <p>But now if the rest that be required, be not granted, that is, to have her aided
with our power to the restitution of her Realm; we trust to make it manifestly
appear, that to consent thereunto, as is required, were not only a great follie in
us, and dangerous to our Estate, but against all common reason, and such an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
that neither Prince nor private person, having any sense of understanding,
would commit, the circumstances being well considered. And though many things
be well known commonly to the world, for maintenance of this our judgment, yet
the beginning of these things could not be known to the King our good Brother,
in respect of his young years, and to the Q. Mother, though they have been well
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54478:14"/>
known, yet either her time since occupied with her own dangerous causes, or
the continuance of perpetual informations for the Scotish Queen, or else some
part thereof touching the time of her worthie husband King <hi>Henry,</hi> and her son
also King <hi>Francis,</hi> may <hi>per</hi> case have brought the most part of things to oblivion,
or at least, have altered her judgement, or else move her to give the less heed
to them, being now remembred: nevertheless, as briefly as we can, with passing
over of a great number of accidents and scruples of offences, and especially such
as concerned the time of King <hi>Henry,</hi> or King <hi>Francis</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>econd, which
were of no less importance then the assailing of our Crown and Title, as the
world knoweth, we will lay before their eyes these things following, to
shew how the acts and dealings of the Scotish Q. towards us have provoked us to
deal in another manner with her, then hitherto we have.</p>
                  <p>First, she is the person by whom, and for whom only it is manifestly known,
that our Kingdom and Crown was Challenged almost as soon as Almightie God
called us by right thereunto. And how many waies that Challenge was furthered
and maintained, prosecuted and published, needeth not to be recited, for all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Christendom understand it. And if we should enter to inform our good
Brother the King, of the particularities thereof, howsoever the same should touch
the time of his noble Father King <hi>Henry,</hi> and his Brother King <hi>Francis,</hi> it may
be thought he being Son and Brother of such Kings, yet he would in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inwardly with himself think us not well used. But for avoiding of things
displeasant, and considering since the same unkindness was shewed in his Fathers
and Brothers times, a reconciliation of Amitie hath followed, which we observe
firml<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; we will omit all other parts, and remember only the things done by the
Scotish Queen after the death of her husband King <hi>Francis,</hi> when she was at her
own libertie.</p>
                  <p>We sent our Ambassador to her, and being in <hi>France,</hi> we required, according to
a certain T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eatie of Peace concluded in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 156C. by sufficient Commission from
King <hi>Francis</hi> the second her husband, and the Q. her self, under the several hands
and seals, aswel of <hi>Scotland</hi> as of <hi>France,</hi> to confirm the said Treaty, as was
by their Commissioners having Authoritie, covenanted and concluded.</p>
                  <p>In which Treatie was concluded Articles of good Amitie betwixt us and her in
our Countreys, and those as beneficial for her as for us. And also a provision and
especial Covenant, that she should forbear from thenceforth to attempt or offer
us any like wrong by challenging of our Crown as she had done before time. To
this our request, delay was made, not with alledging any thing to the contrary
of our right or maintenance of her former Challenges. But yet she must now
(being a Widow, and sole Governor of her Kingdom of <hi>Scotland)</hi> in these
causes have the presence of some of her Nobilitie or Counsellours of the Scotish
Nation; at whose coming she would confirm the said Treatie. This was not
much misliked of us: Shortly some of her Nobilitie and Counsellours came
to her from <hi>Scotland;</hi> and then being e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tsoons required in most friendly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to be remembred of her promise by the Ambassador, having Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so to do, and offering to deliver unto her the reciprocal of our part under our
Great-Seal, it was again deferred, until she should her self return into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
which she said should shortly be, and then she would not fail to perform
it well, though these delays were not convenient to nourish friendship, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ingender suspicion, with some other practises then discovered, yet
in respect of our natural desire to have her come into her own Kingdom, and then
to live neighbourly with us, we forbore to shew any great offence for those great
delays. And when she returned into <hi>Scotland,</hi> we e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tsoons sent to her, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same again, with offer of all manner of good friendship, which being again
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54478:14"/>
deferred, upon pretence she was not fully settled in her Realm, we forbore also
for that time, though not without great cause of misliking; and then in the
mean season following, notwithstanding many good offices used on our part, by
sending sundry times both Messages and Ambassadors to visit her, to offer unto her
all good offices. It chanced that a young Nobleman, our near Kinsman, brought
up in our Court named the Lord <hi>Darlie,</hi> was secretly intised to pass into <hi>Scotland</hi>
upon other pretences, for private suits for Lands, and such like. And there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
our knowledge, according to the same former practises, whereof we were not
altogether ignorant, though we would not seem so jealous of the same; he was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
accepted by that Q. to be affied in contract of Marriage with her, as one
thought to be a meet person to work troubles in our Realm for her advantage, yea
contrary to the advice of the wiser sort of her Councel; and consequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our will and liking, was married to her in all haste. And after that it
was there devised to make him an instrument to work danger to us and our Estate
by sundry practises, not only with certain of our subjects, but also with some forein
persons, as far forth as the power of the same Q. and her said husband being our
borne Subject could extend; In which their doings, sundry their practises were
discovered to us, and made frustrate: And yet after that nevertheless, when
the said Queen had a Son of that marriage, we were of nature moved to set
aside all unkindnesses, and did send thither an Ambassador, a person of honour,
the Earl of <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>edford,</hi> to assist the Christening of her Son, to whom we also were
Godmother. At which time unkindness being known to be between her and her
husband, although he had grievously offended us, we having compassion of the
unnatural discord betwixt them, and fearing some event thereof, caused our said
Ambassador at that time to use all the good means he could with her to repair the
same which he was not able to do, such was become her misliking of her husband,
although in him on the other side (as we heard say) was found all manner of lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
meet for him to recover her favour. And then also we required her to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that which in Justice and Honor she was bound to do, and had so often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed;
which was, to confirm the Treatie afore concluded, sending unto her at the
same time under our hand and seal the reciprocal for our part. But then she began
to alledge a matter not before heard of; which was, that from some words in a
certain part of the Treaty, it was doubted, that she might be prejudiced in such
right as she pretended to be due to her next after us, and the children of our bodie;
whereof we being advertised, caused it to be answered, that if there were any such
words, we were content they should be rased out of the Treaty, and she should not
be moved to confirm any such Clause. But that answer being not accepted, which
was very strange and unreasonable; a new matter of delay was invented, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that she would send some of hers shortly into <hi>England,</hi> to treat with us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
and so finish that which we did demand; vvhereof indeed nothing ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved
vvell, although vve had these great causes of miscontentation, as indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
persons may well perceive, and did novv clearly see vvhereunto these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
did tend very ungrateful and not vvithout danger, if vve should not regard
our self vvell; yet vvhen a miserable calamitie ensued shortly after to her, that the
King her husband, vvith vvhom of late she vvas grievously offended, vvas cruelly
strangled, and horriblie murthered, and the principal murtherer named the Earl
<hi>Bothewell,</hi> having a vertuous lavvful vvife (of a great house) living—because sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
her husband being first immediately upon the murther committed, and
directly and openly imputed to him—advanced by her to high degrees of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and estates of lands, vvho nevertheless vildly misused her, to the great grief of
all her subjects and friends; vve vvere stricken vvith invvard compassion of this
her great extream miseries and infamie, vvhich vvas spread upon her, and sent to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54478:15"/>
her special Messengers, not then to request her (as vve had done before) to confirm
the Treaty, but to have regard unto her honour, and to relinquish such an odible
person, being the known murtherer of her husband, an unlawful person to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to her; and generally so evil a man in all vices, as he had the common name
to excel all others in iniquitie, wherein no advice of ours could prevail. But in the
end he being hated of all her Estates, and seeking by force to subdue them that
intended to prosecute the Murtherers, was forced to flie the Realm: And leaving
her lamentably in the field desolate, she was conducted from thence to a place of
restraint, where she refused to renounce the said Murtherer, whilest she was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
in present danger to have her life taken away from her by furie of her Nation,
as she well knoweth: We by speedy Messages, and other kind of earnest means
used towards them that were most irritated against her, saved her life: A bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
such, as she never received the like of any worldly creature; and full glad
we were, that God gave us such power and disposition of mind, to bestow so
great a benefit of her, who nevertheless had offered us the greatest worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
that could be devised. It followed, that when she had found means to escape
to her libertie, whereof we were very glad, she sell again, by Gods suffering, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a second calamitie as dangerous as the former; for having attempted, by force,
to overcome the party that adhered to her son, that was then crowned, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
King by the States of the Realm, and that also with her consent, as they
affirm, her party was overthrown in her own sight, and she thereby forced to
escape, by flying with a very small number. And being hardly pursued, she
was driven for safety of her life to enter into a simple vessel, and crossing over an
Arm of the sea, came into <hi>England,</hi> unknown in the Port where she landed;
yea, she herself dissembled her person for a time. But yet shortly after being
discovered who she was, and we hearing thereof, within three or four daies (for
sooner we could not, in respect of the distance of the place) set forth by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
to have her comforted, and honourably used: And afterwards warned
certain persons of honor and credit to attend and wait upon her, to bring her from
the borders of our Realm, where she was in manifest danger of her contrary part
of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be suprized: And granted her to remain further within our Realm,
in a Castle of an ancient Nobleman, with all her company that escaped with
her, and with some others that did also follow her; and there she had such enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
(altogether upon our charges) as was meet for a Queen, and for a
person brought into such calamity, or for one that had notoriously challenged
our Crown, and would not perform that she was bound to do for our satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
After she had been there some time, and that she had now through her whole
Realm been newly charged with the former crimes, as to have been directly the
procurer and deviser of the horrible murther of her husband, to have married
the principal murtherer, to have defended and succord all the rest of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
whereof some of the principal were her own servants, with a number
of infamous crimes: We caused her to be friendly dealt withal, to understand
what she would have us to do for her, that with our honour we might do—to
relieve her of the infamies wherein we were nearly touched, even in the inward
part of our heart, considering the fresh death of her husband was not yet punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he being next Kinsman both to her and us living, on the King our Fathers
side, and on hers also. After many things propounded, at length she agreed, that
her cause of Criminations should be tryed as one that was not guilty of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
crime, the murther, and that we should have her allegations for her defence;
whereunto we assented, assuring her, that if by any means it might appear, that she
was not to be duly charged to be a deviser and procurer thereof, as she was charg'd,
her accusers should be with all severity punished, as reason was. And she should
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54478:15"/>
have our aid to be speedily restored to her State; but what followed hereupon,
and what was the cause why she did not cause her Commissioners to answer to the
matters produced against her, we do omit for this time, having been heartily sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that where so many matters were produced, to charge her to be culpable, and
she by her Commissioners thereof made privy, did not suffer the same to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tried of what value they were to have such credit as they did pretend: And
in this great matter, being so hainous, it is well to be considered of our good
Brother and Sister, to what respect more of her honor, and care of her, then of
our self, we hitherto forbore to notifie abroad the mutitudes of the Arguments
produced against her; by which if we had been by any waies disposed to hinder
her, as <hi>per</hi> case some of her friends would have thought of us, we could have
made, and yet can make no small advantage to abase her estimation to the whole
vvorld, and yet publish nothing but the only rude and bare arguments and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
as they have been manifestly and orderly produced, leaving to the vvorld to
consider of the same as should seem most profitable.</p>
                  <p>But herein have we esteemed more her honor, then our ovvn profit, having
an intention to overcome evil, if it might be vvith good; and the rather, for that
Almightie God hath so fortified our estate othervvise vvith his blessings, and so
abased hers vvith the lack thereof, as, vve thank him, vve have no need of such
means to abase our Enemies, or evil vvillers.</p>
                  <p>And thus far did things pass until this last year, in vvhich time, vvhilest vve
vvere occupied and travelling at her request vvith the States of her Realm, vvho
had accepted and acknovvledged her son as their King, to come to some
Conformitie vvith her for her return into her Realm, and for a concord to be
made betvveen her and her States; she again had, vvithout our knovvledge, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a secret dealing of marriage vvith a principal Nobleman of our Realm;
and not contented therevvith, vvhen vve did mislike it, she by her Ministers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into such an intelligence vvith certain of our Noblemen in the North part
of our Realm, as they novv since <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> burst out into an open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
making their outvvard shevv of intent, to change the state of Religion,
contrary to the Laws of our Realm; but in very deed, as manifestly it is to us
more known, and truly discovered, their meaning was chiefly to set up her, not
onely in her own Countrey, but in this our Realm. And though it pleased
God to animate all our Subjects generally of all Estates so to accord to serve us
in the speedie suppression hereof; yet her manner of unkind dealing against us
in this da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gerous sort is not the less to be weighed in respect of that which was by
her intended to our utter subversion; a matter worthie consideration of all such
as have States and Governme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, and that mean to preserve them from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
by such Rebellions, wherein the verie Crown of the Prince is
sought.</p>
                  <p>And thus having as shortly as so many matters of so many years continuance
could suffer, passed over no small number of unkind and dangerous enteprises
against us; and contrariwise, of our manifold kind and aboundant benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her in all her necessities, we doubt not but now, if the requests that are
made to us to aid her to our power, to restore her forthwith to her Realm, shall
be applid to the former things preceding, no indifferent person of any judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will, or can think it in conscience reasonable to move us to commit such a
dangerous folly, as to be the authour our self to hazard our own Person, our
State, our quietness of our Realm and People at one instant, without further
consideration how we might preserve the same, as God hath given them unto
us, and not to be lost (as it were wilfully) and with contemning or neglecting of
the wisdom that God hath bestowed upon us, to possess and to maintain our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54478:16"/>
Crown and Dignitie with publike peace and quietness amongst our Subjects:
And therefore, although now lately in this time of Rebellion, whereunto we
well understand that she hath a party, we did cause her to be removed further
into our Realm, from the parties where the Rebellion was stirred, and there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
resort to be made unto her, as before was common for all persons, but of
her own Countrey and ours, we see not why this our dealing in so dangerous a
time should be blamed, being assured that no Christian Prince in like case, would
have done less. And therein we durst appeal to the judgement of any Prince or
Potentate in the world that will profess any indifferencie in judgement; yea, we
dare think, that even herself and her most affectionate friends cannot think us
here to have dealt unreasonably.</p>
                  <p>The like might be thought also, in that we have of late restrained one, whom
she used as her Ambassador, being a Bishop, whom we used almost as one
of our own, for her sake, upon due information that he hath been a principal
motioner and nourisher of this late Rebellion, by divers means: A matter
to be as much allowed for us to do, in the stay from subversion of our Realm,
as were to stay and restrain one that would bring more fire to a Citie, which
he hath already set on fire. In this sort we have so nearly represented to the
King our good Brother, and the Queen his Mother, some part of such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the Queen of Scots cause, as we doubt not but reason, honor
and good will shall move them to conceive of us, as we should be the like to
conceive of them, if they had the like cause with any other Prince, as we
have with the Queen of Scots, having thought meet to omit a multitude of
other circumstances, tending also to this end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because we would not extend
this our letter to overmuch length for wearying the King with Declaration
thereof.</p>
                  <p>But if the King could but imagine, or the Queen Mother for him, how some
other Prince might have attempted the like dangers to his Estate and Crown,
and continued the like offences towards him, where he had shewed kindness, we
are assured they might think it somewhat in us, if we should, after the truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
move the King for any particular respect of a third person to consent to
that, which should plainly after hazard his Estate, being our Friend; and by some
such imagination of a like cause, we think their judgements shall be best directed
thereof: Sorry would we be that any like indeed should happen unto him, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
him how to judge in our case.</p>
                  <p>When you have thus done, if the King or his Mother shall object any
thing hereupon, as it were in excuse of the Queen of Scots, or intreating
further for her, you may say in answer,—That whatsover it shall please
them to move unto you, you will make report thereof, and doubt not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Queen of Scots doings have deserved other dealing, yet our natural
inclination towards her, is by our doings so manifest, as in any reasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
we doubt not, but we should be found reasonable to have regard to the
King our good Brothers motions and requests, that may stand with our honor and
safetie to accord unto; and so we trust the K. meaneth, not to propound any thing
unto us, otherwise then in good terms of friendship, whereby alwaies they that are
to make demands or requests to their friends, do regard how they may stand
to the safetie of their friends; and so hath <hi>Moulenet</hi> and the French Ambassador
certified unto us, that the intention of our good Brother is to no other end. You
shall also inform the King, that after we had given order to cause thus much
to be written, his Ambassador came to us, and signified the good will of our
good Brother, in imparting to us the double of such answers as he had made
to the Demand of the Queen of Navarre, and the Prince of Navarre,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54478:16"/>
and <hi>Conde</hi> and others, for the which his dealing with us in such friendly
sort to make us participate of his doings we heartily thank him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
his Ambassador so you may say also to the Queen, That except we
might understand what the said Queen, and the rest, with others have to say
to this offer, we cannot give any resolute judgement thereof. But we think
the King shall do a godly act, and both honourable and profitable to himself
and his Country, if he shall give them assurance of their lives; So as they may
change that common opinion which is in the World, that they have their
lives more safe whilest they take up Armes, then they were in time when
the peace was granted to them, such hath bin the insolency of evil ministers
to break the Kings commandement and endanger the Credit of his word and
promise; And in our opinion nothing is so hard in all this matter, as assurance
to them to enjoy that which shall be granted, and if our Credit or opinion
with them may help them—to accept the Kings favour, so as we might see
in what sort they might—therefore be sure notwithstanding the interruptions
of evill ministers, we would be glad to be the furtherer of so good an act, as
thereby the King might have an universall quietness in his Countries.</p>
                  <p>The Ambassador also now moved us that we would take Care that no aid of
Armor or Weapon should be by us or our license Conveyed to <hi>Rotchel,</hi> to the
maintenance of the Kings Subjects there, whom he n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>meth Rebells, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our answer was that we did direct no person thither, or licensed any to carry
any thing thither that might offend the King. But generally we must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our subjects as Merchants to resort for their trade to all places indifferent
in <hi>France,</hi> wishing that they might find like trade in others parts for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
as they do by likelyhood in <hi>Rotchel,</hi> and that we would not doubt but
they would follow their Comodity in other places and not at <hi>Rotchel;</hi> for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
Merchants follow where gain is most with surety and friendly usage,
and so you may make report to the King.</p>
                  <p>Lastly the Ambassador moved us in the Kings name to understand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he might assure the King that we made no leavie of Souldiers in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,
as it was commonly reported, whereunto we answered that presently
we made none, but yet we have such friendship with sundrie Princes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,
as if we should have need to require any numbers for our service, if
any unkindness by force should be offered us by any our neighbours we can
speedily thereof be furnished, and for the state of our Realm we are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
indeed to prepare a force both by Sea and by land; whereof if the King
shall hear, we require him to conceive no jealousie of our evill meaning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him and his Countries, trusting that from him no occasion shall grow
to alter our Amitie.</p>

                  <p>FOrasmuch as we are already determined to license our trustie and wel-beloved
Sir <hi>Henry Norris</hi> Knight, who hath of a long time served us faithfully as
our Ambassador with the French King our good Brother, to repaire over unto
us, and to leave that place; and that we have made speciall choice of you upon a
singular liking of your vertuousand good conditions to serve us in the same
place, wherein we trust our expectations shall be well satisfied of your fidelitie
and diligence. And for the rest also we doubt not but by the experience which
you shall daiely have, you shall be able to accomplish that which shall be requisite:
and for the better instruction of you, we have thought meet to cause to be
delivered unto you in writing these few things hereafter following by way of
memoriall. After you have delivered you letters, and and bin presented to the
King by our foresaid Ambassador whom you shall suceed, for the doing whereof
our said Ambassador can sufficiently direct you, and will we doubt not, but make
good recommendations of you to the French King, to the Queen, Mother and
others such as shall be thought meet; we will that you shall use such speech unto
them, that it may appeare that your special Charge is to be a Minister for the
conservation of the good Amitie that is betwixt us and the King, and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to preserve Concord and mutuall entercourse betwixt the Subjects of
both our Countries, according to the good Treaties that remaine betwixt us for
that purpose: and therefore considering you are so determined for your dutie
sake to us, and for the good that may ensue thereof, you shall require them if at
any time any thing to the contrarie shall be conceived of you (as we trust shall
not, because you mean to give no occasion) yet it may please them before any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54478:17"/>
such judgement be conceived of you, it may be in some wise declared as they
may understand our answer, wherewith you doubt not but to satisfie them.</p>
                  <p>Your office consisting of sundry parts, the first and principall shall be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
there aswell to execute our commandement, and to deliver our letters and
messages upon matters occurrent, as to require and to receive answers; and to
the best that you can, to procure thereupon reasonable and speedy resolutions, as
the nature of the matter, shall import: for the well doing whereof, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
you hereafterwards to such particular directions as we shall send you by our
speciall Letters, whereby you shall be best directed in manner to proceed.</p>
                  <p>The second shall be, to have continual regard to all manner of their doings there,
aswell private as publick, that may be prejudiciall to us or our estate: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after good consideration and knowledge thereof had, to advertise us dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
and secretly; and to this end, you shall do well to require of our said Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
(your predecessor) some good information by what means you may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n
to the knowledge of things needfull and requisite, and whom you may best
trust and use to attaine to the more certenitie; and if any thing be discovered
unto you at any time, that shall seem of importance, that the information there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
may well abide the time of your advertisement to us, and to answer again,
we leave it to your consideration and discretion to omit no time convenient,
but to resort to the King, or some other, as you shall think meet, to declare
what you understand and mislike, and in what sort it is hurtfull to the Amitie
betwixt us; And therefore to require some information, or some plain answer,
meet to be imparted to us, for discharge of your duty. And that in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
you shall not use, by way of complaint upon any light intelligence, but you
do first by conference of things together, find the matter to be true and worthy
of complaint, least hereafter lesse regard be had to you, when you shall have just
cause to complain.</p>
                  <p>The third is, to have regard to such suites, as our Subjects (using the trade
of Merchandise within those Realms) shall have cause to make; that they
may have by your soliciting readie expedition, with justice, upon causes of
depredations or arrests, or any such injuries or molestations; and therein to
solicite such of the Kings Counsell, as you shall find to have charge thereof;
letting them to understand, that besides the bond of Justice, whereunto they
do direct the King such favourable expedition of our Subjects, shall provoke
us and our ministers to do the like, and shall also breed mutuall love betwixt
the Subjects on both parties, and give cause to a more frequentation of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of Merchants, being a thing beneficiall to both the Realms. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you shall be the more able to understand, and to treate in your confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
&amp; negotiation upon any thing generally touching the Amitie betwixt the
King and us; or more particularly, for the deciding and determining of any causes
that may come in controversie for the trade and intercourse of Merchandise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Subjects of both our Countries &amp; kingdoms, you shall do well to have
with you some Copies of the treaties now remaning in force betwixt us and the
King, by the which you shall be very well informed &amp; directed, as by certain rules
how to treate and deal in all causes that may there come in controversie, and
thereby be bound to require due observation as cause and matter shall require.</p>
                  <p>We doubt not but you do consider, how profitable a thing it is for quietness
of us and our Realm, to have that party in France which hath professed reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion, to be maintained and contained in the favor, which the King hath
granted them by his Edict; And therein vve vvould have you at all times (when
occasion shall be given you) let it appear to the King, that vve think nothing can
procure more assurance of inward quietness in his Realm, then the due observation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54478:18"/>
of those things which he hath granted to his subjects in his Edict; and you
may say that he hath more cause by experience to believe us therein, then any
other Prince that is his Allie besides us, that shall be of a contrary mind.
And so experience hath taught us already to think, and may well ascertain him,
considering he hath seen and felt the continuance of the troubles of his Realm,
whilst he followed the advise of other Princes and Potentates, and disswading
him from granting such favour as he hath done to his subjects. And in any other
thing wherein you shall be able at any time to further and advance the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the matters of the Edict in favour of them of the Religion, we would
you should endeavour your self in such sort as may stand with our honour. And
of this our intention we will that you give understanding to such of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals
of that part as have interest therein, which you shall best do by the advise of
your predecessor, who has best acquaintance with these persons. Lastly, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
matters lately treated of here by the French Ambassador as touching the
Queen of Scots cause, and the preparations of ships and men of war made in
Brittanie, you shall at your coming to our Ambassador, learn in what state he hath
left those things, and how he hath answered the King, and so you may persist in
the same course untill you shall be by us otherwise directed.</p>
                  <p>We have by our Letters to our foresaid Ambassador willed him to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverie
unto you of all such our Plate as he had delivered unto him at his entrie
into his charge, which you shall receive of him by Indenture, if you shall have
need thereof.</p>
                  <p>Where we meant that you should have accompained the Lord of Buckhurst
in his journey to the French King, &amp; so have bin presented with him to the said
King; now that we cannot understand the certainty of the said Kings entrie into
Paris, at which time our meaning was and is that the said Lord of Buckhurst
should be there, we would not that you should abide any longer but proceed
in your journey; and if on your way you do perceive that the Kings entry will
be now in the beginning of Januarie [our will is] that you shall without attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any longer for the coming of the said Lord of Buckhurst, proceed by our
Ambassadors means to be presented to the King, and to take the place of our
ordinarie Ambassador, so as our former Ambassador Sir <hi>Henry Norris</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
at his Commodity. We would have you inform your self, by the judge of the
Admiraltie of all causes depending betwixt our subjects and those of France, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pretence of depredations, that you may the better answer complaints which
either ours or the others shall make.</p>
                  <p>And farther we would have you to acquaint your self by his means, with a
complaint lately exhibited by the French Ambassador in the name of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of Roan, and what answers hath bin made to the same, by such as we
did ordain to devise the same, whereof the said Judge was one. You shall also
receive a complaint which certain of our Merchants of London trading to Roan
do presently make for the Innovation of certain taxations by the Magistrates of
Roan upon the goods of our said subjects, contrarie to the common use, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
you shall (being well informed) of the inconveniencie thereof, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice;
sollicite the remedie thereof, so as time shall conveniently require.</p>

a Gentleman of good accompt, and one of the Order, who accompanied with

<hi>Febr.</hi> but hereof for the observing of the time, here is no more assurance than
there was before of the first of <hi>Ianuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Leaving Bullen, I have not forgot to enform your honour of the great exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
used by the Inn-keepers at Gravesend, Canterbury, &amp; Dover, in the prices
of Victualls, whereof besides mine own experience, I learned by certain strangers
that passed over with me, they are so great as in no Countrie is used the like,
where all things bear so unreasonable prices in the market, and the people so
free from impositions of the Prince. Surely, Sir, it were well done that there
might by your good means and furtherance, some order be taken for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
hereof, aswell for her Majesties honour, as for the ease of the poore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers.

pleasure touching my Revocation, I cannot but aswell for this, as your most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
acceptance of my service during my residence here, in most humble
wise acknowledge those favours of you; And after having conference with
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> at good large, further of your Majesties meaning, we
both sent to the Court to demand Audience, but the King being then newly
removed from Chantilly, and the Queen Mother repairing hither to Paris, our
Audience was by her deferred untill the Kings coming to Madrid, where the
Court being setled the 21 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> we were requested in the Kings name to
come thither, the 25 of the same; and repairing thither at the pointed time, we
were entertained by Monsieur <hi>de Lause,</hi> who by the Kings appointment dined
with us. After dinner being once ended <hi>Chevalier de Sener</hi> was likewise sent
from the King to accompany us; so after we were advised by Sir <hi>Gihoronovi Gondi</hi>
to repaire to the Kings presence, and staying a while in the Chamber of presence,
being curteously intertained by the Duke of Nevers and the Nobilitie; The
King came forth. Then I Sir <hi>Henry Norris,</hi> drawing near to him, said; That
her Majestie perceiving nothing more necessarie to entertain the good Amitie
and intelligence between Princes, then their devotion of good Ministers, had
chosen this Gentleman, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> being discended of a good
house, approved vertue, and like sincerity, to succeed me, and to reside your
Majesties Ambassador near his person; not doubting, but according to your
Majesties charge given him in that behalf, he would use all means possible to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
the good and neighbourly Amitie between your Majestie, and likewise
the continuance of the entercourse and traffique between your Realms and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
which I praied God long to continue, to his glory, to the increase of
your Honours, and tranquilitie of your Realms, and all Christendom. Also
I declared that your Majestie had sent certain Letters unto him, his wife, and
mother; whereupon the King giving you most hearty thanks, of your choise of
a Gentleman so well qualified, and desirous to continue that thing which he so
much wished, he required me to cause the Gentleman to come to him. Then I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54478:19"/>
                     <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi> being thus presented by Sir <hi>Henry Norris,</hi> after ordinary
salutations done, I delivered your Majesties Letters, which after he had caused
to be read by his Secretarie <hi>Pinart,</hi> I shewed him the great charge you gave
me so to direct my course in this service, as might best tend to the maintenance
of the good Amitie between your Majesties; as also the free traffique and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
between the Subjects of both your Realms, which thing aswell for
duties sake towards your Majestie, as the reverence I beare him, and the great
benefit that would grow to both your Realms, I said I would not faile to observe
with what care and sincerity I might: And therefore desired him that I might
come to my answer, which I doubted not should be such, as he should rest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
satisfied, and I justified.</p>
                  <p>To this, after enquire made of your Majesties health, he answered, That he
he could not but conceive great hope of continuance of Amitie betwixt her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
and him, for that you had made choise of one to supplie this place, so well
inclined to entertain it, as he hath given him to understand by his Ambassador,
that I was; he said therefore that I was very welcome, and should at all times
receive at his hands, for your Majesties sake, gracious Audience; for the which I
rendred him most humble thanks; and told him, That I hoped that I should
do nothing unworthy the good opinion he had conceived of me, And touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the gracious Audience promised, I doubt not but that his Ministers
both heretofore had, and hereafter should receive the like at your Majesties
hands.</p>
                  <p>Those ordinarie Ceremonies ended, being requested by the Deputies of the
Princes of the Religion, to recommend their cause at this present; for it is
generally conceived that the Ambassador sent hither from the Princes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
who besides congratulating the Marriage, recommended the observation
of the Edict, which was a thing procured by your Majestie, as with whom
you have some secret league, do concurre in all things that tend to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Religion, me thought I could do no lesse but say somwhat in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
both for that I thought the opinion conceived of the League and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie
worthy the nourishment; as also for that by your Majesties instructions,
I am appointed to do any thing that may advance their cause, so farre forth as
may stand with your Honour; and to that end your Majestie may judge, whither I
kept my self within that compasse. I thought it my dutie to send you the effect
of that I said, whereby if I failed in any thing, being by your Majestie admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
thereof, I may hereafter avoid to offend in the like.</p>
                  <p>I declared unto him, that your Majestie willed me to signifie unto him, that
you (as his good and loving sister who wished unto him all prosperitie, and
thinketh none so great as quietness of Government,) do not a little rejoyce to
heare of the great care he taketh for the due observation of the Edict lately pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
as that thing which maketh him honourable, and of great reputation
with all Princes, that are not carried away with passion; and that you do not
a little wonder to see his Majestie in these young years, able (through his great
foresight and wisdome) to quench a fire of so great a Consequence and danger
as lately was kindled and dispersed through his whole Realm, and now through
Gods goodness, and his good order was at this presence utterly extinguished:
an example for the rareness thereof, worthy to be honoured in him, and
followed in all other Princes who preferre good Goverment, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of their Subjects, before tyrannie and destruction of the same. I told
him further, that your Majestie hoped that he now findeth a difference between
the advise of those Princes his neighbours, that advised him to continue the
Warres, to the hazarding of his State, and destruction of his Subjects and yours,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54478:20"/>
and other Princes, that exhorted him to the contrary, who judged alwaies Peace
and concord tending most to his safetie and their preservation. And therefore
for that experience, now (the best means) hath taught him to know the
inconveniences of the one, and the profit of the other, your Majestie doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, but as of his own inclination he hath alwaies bin given rather to
peace, to preserve his subjects, (a property of a good and loving Prince)
then by sword and violence to consume them (a thing most fit for a Tyrant.)
So he will continue the said course that tendeth most to the due execution
of his said Edict, the only meanes to preserve quietness that now reigneth in
his kingdome; This course unto God so acceptable, for himself so honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and for his subjects so profitable, if any should seek to impeach,
for that it is most commonly seen, that good purposes (aswell in Princes as
privat men) have many hinderers, be he either a subject unnaturall, or a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
evill affected, as envious at his repose:</p>
                  <p>Your Majestie offereth your self with all aid and power to assist him to
your uttermost, against all such as shall seek or hinder him in so good and
godly a purpose; And as your Majestie resteth herein affected towards
him, so you doubt not but God who hath wrought this godly inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will raise up other Princes to assist him, and to be likewise affected
towards him in this behalf: And that therefore your Majestie prayeth
God to blesse him in this course, and to remove from him all such as shall
hinder him in so noble an enterprise; to whom your Majestie wisheth
as prosperous successe, as ever Prince had that occupied his place and
Seat.</p>
                  <p>To this he answered, that he had right good cause to accept in good part
your Majesties advertisement, whom he must needs acknowledge to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
as his good Sister and as on carefull of his well doing, advised him to that
which was best, both for himself and his Country; he willed me therefore to
assure your Majestie, that the onely care he presently had, was to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the peace, whereof the Q. of Navar and the Princes of the Religion
could well be witnesses as also generally the whole Realm; To this I replied that
I could not fail to advertise your Majestie both of his well accepting of your
advertisment, as also of the good inclination towards the sincere observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Edict, which newes I did assure would be to your Majestie most
welcome.</p>
                  <p>After I had thus ended with the King, and finding the Queen his wife ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
(who by report the night past had a fit of a fever) I signified unto
him that I had further Commission from your Majestie to present unto her your
Letters, and shew unto her notwithstanding you Majestie had made choise
of a personage honourable to congratulate their Marriage, whose comming
onely staied upon the certainty of his entrie, yet your pleasure was that in
the mean time I should have also executed the said office, which I would have
gladly done, if it might have bin without her trouble, whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the night passed she had the fit of a fever, which he thought would
not long co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But hoped that within four or five daies she would be in that good state
of health, as I might have accesse unto her, unto whom he assured me that
both your Majesties Letters, as also the office of congratulation, whereunto
I was appointed, should be accepted in very good part, as from their good and
loving Sister.</p>
                  <p>This is the effect of my speech unto the King from your Majestie, the
which ended, making our reverences we were conducted by Monsieur <hi>de

by <hi>Sig. Gondi,</hi> some alteration of wonted custom; and that we
should for the Solemnitie, visit apart the Queen Mother and her two Sons;
we thereupon resolved to keep one course in our several speeches to them,
and coming to the Queen, I Sir <hi>Henry Norris</hi> declaring the qualitie of
the Gentleman your Majestie had sent to be presented your Ambassador Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
his good inclination towards the continuance of the Amitie between
your Majestie and the King her Son; she eftsoons answered, that she no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doubted of your Majesties good election; she required the Gentleman
to come to her.</p>
                  <p>Then I <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ncis Walsingham,</hi> after due salutation, presented your Majesties
Letters, and used to her speeches, as before to the King, concerning your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
charge given me for the entertaining of the good Amitie between the
King her Son and you. I also recommended unto her the observation of the
Edict, being so requested to do by the Deputies of the Princes of the Religion;
as also so to do the like to the Kings Brethren: My speech therefore from your
Majestie unto her in this behalf was, that you were glad to hear that she had not
only the reputation and honour to be a chief maker of Peace and Union late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accorded, but also to be a chief Conserver of the same; wherefore, as one
that wished unto her all honour and reputation, you could but wish unto her
preservation in this course, so much to her honour, to the Kings safety, and
to the general benefit of his Countrey. Whereunto she answered, that she
could not but accept in very good part, both recommending your choice so
well inclined to entertain the Amitie between your Majesties, as they were
fully assured thereof by their Ambassador Resident in <hi>England,</hi> doubting
not but such effects should follow, as should redound to both your Majesties
contentations.</p>
                  <p>Being thus licensed of the Queen, we were streight brought to Monsieur <hi>de
Anjous</hi> Chamber; where I Sir <hi>Henry Norris,</hi> declaring this Gentleman to
be sent by your Majestie to succeed me, was not only commanded by you to
entertain the good Amitie, but likewise to bear that respect unto him, and the
Duke his Brother, as towards your good Cousins and Parsonages of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
and value. The Duke thanking me for this my good relation, requested
the Gentleman to come unto him.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon I <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> approaching near unto him, making reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
I shewed him, that you willed me to do your commendations to him,
and further to tell him, that your were glad to understand that he did so honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
concur together with the King his Brother in sincere and due observation of
the Edict, whereby he did not only get generally with all men the honour to be
reputed a Prince of courage in time of war, but also of Councel in time of peace;
which courage you doubted not but he would continue, in respect of the good
will he bare to the King and his Countrey, and the regard that he had of his own
honour. And further, I shewed him that your Majestie gave me command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
during my charge here, to behave my self towards him and the King his
Brother with that good respect as was fit for me towards your Cousins and
Princes of that qualitie that they were of.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto he answered, with great courtesie, that he thanked your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
for your commendations, as from a Princess of that honour you are, and
whom he so much reverenced. Secondarily, for the good encouragement you
gave him to be a good instrument for the observation of the Edict, which
thing he was bound to do in respect of his dutie towards the King and
his Countrey; so shall your advertisement be of no small force with him in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54478:21"/>
who is one that hath alwaies shewed himself well inclined to our Nation in these
times of jealousie and unkindnesse, that hath raigned betwixt the two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                  <p>Touching my own particular, if my charges continue as they begin, whereof
there is small hope to the contrary, except there be some extraordinary conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
had of me by your good means in transportation, my allowance will not
suffice to beare half my charges; I would therefore most humblie desire you at
the time of the receipt of the bill to weigh it accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Before my departure, I was earnestly requested by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>H. Cobham</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend

                  <p>MAy it please your most excellent Majestie to be advertised, receiving your
Highness Letters of the 16 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and perceiving your gracious
pleasure touching my Revocation, I cannot but aswell for this, as your most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
acceptance of my service during my residence here, in most humble
wise acknowledge those favours of you; And after having conference with
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> at good large, further of your Majesties meaning, we
both sent to the Court to demand Audience, but the King being then newly
removed from Chantilly, and the Queen Mother repairing hither to Paris, our
Audience was by her deferred untill the Kings coming to Madrid, where the
Court being setled the 21 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> we were requested in the Kings name to
come thither, the 25 of the same; and repairing thither at the pointed time, we
were entertained by Monsieur <hi>de Lause,</hi> who by the Kings appointment dined
with us. After dinner being once ended <hi>Chevalier de Sener</hi> was likewise sent
from the King to accompany us; so after we were advised by Sir <hi>Gihoronovi Gondi</hi>
to repaire to the Kings presence, and staying a while in the Chamber of presence,
being curteously intertained by the Duke of Nevers and the Nobilitie; The
King came forth. Then I Sir <hi>Henry Norris,</hi> drawing near to him, said; That
her Majestie perceiving nothing more necessarie to entertain the good Amitie
and intelligence between Princes, then their devotion of good Ministers, had
chosen this Gentleman, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> being discended of a good
house, approved vertue, and like sincerity, to succeed me, and to reside your
Majesties Ambassador near his person; not doubting, but according to your
Majesties charge given him in that behalf, he would use all means possible to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
the good and neighbourly Amitie between your Majestie, and likewise
the continuance of the entercourse and traffique betwen your Realms and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
which I praied God long to continue, to his glory, to the increase of
your Honours, and tranquilitie of your Realms, and all Christendom. Also
I declared that your Majestie had sent certain Letters unto him, his wife, and
mother; whereupon the King giving you most hearty thanks, of your choise of
a Gentleman so well qualified, and desirous to continue that thing which he so
much wished, he required me to cause the Gentleman to come to him. Then I

                     </hi> being thus presented by Sir <hi>Henry Norris,</hi> after ordinary
salutations done, I delivered your Majesties Letters, which after he had caused
to be read by his Secretarie <hi>Pinart,</hi> I shewed him the great charge you gave
me so to direct my course in this service, as might best tend to the maintenance
of the good Amitie between your Majesties, as also the free traffique and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
between the Subjects of both your Realms, which thing aswell for
duties sake towards your Majestie, as the reverence I beare him, and the great
benefit that would grow to both your Realms, I said I would not faile to observe
with what care and sincerity I might: And therefore desired him that I might
come to my answer, which I doubted not should be such, as he should rest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
satisfied, and I justified.</p>
                  <p>To this, after enquire made of your Majesties health, he answered, That he
he could not but conceive great hope of continuance of Amitie betwixt her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
and him, for that you had made choise of one to supplie this place, so well
inclined to entertain it, is he hath given him to understand by his Ambassador,
that I was; he said therefore that I was very welcome, and should at all times
receive at his hands, for your Majesties sake, gracious Audience; for the which I
rendred him most humble thanks; and told him, That I hoped that I should
do nothing unworthy the good opinion he had conceived of me, And touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the gracious Audience promised, I doubt not but that his Ministers
both heretofore had, and hereafter should receive the like at your Majesties
hands.</p>
                  <p>Those ordinarie Ceremonies ended, being requested by the Deputies of the
Princes of the Religion, to recommend their cause at this present; for it is
generally conceived that the Ambassador sent hither from the Princes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
who besides congratulating the Marriage, recommended the observation
of the Edict, which was a thing procured by your Majestie, as with whom
you have some secret league, do concur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which courage you doubted not but he would continue, in respect of the good
will he bare to the King and his Countrey, and the regard that he had of his own
honour. And further, I shewed him that your Majestie gave me command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
during my charge here, to behave my self towards him and the King his
Brother with that good respect as was fit for me towards your Cousins and
Princes of that qualitie that they were of.</p>

for your commendations, as from a Princess of that honour you are, and
whom he so much reverenced. Secondarily, for the good encouragement you
gave him to be a good instrument for the observation of the Edict, which
thing he was bound to do in respect of his dutie towards the King and
his Countrey; so shall your advertisement be of no small force with him in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54478:23"/>
that behalf. For my self, he told me, that during the time of my service here,
I should receive, for your Majesties sake, any favour he could do for me. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we had taken our leave of the Duke, anon we were brought to the Duke
of <hi>Alansons</hi> Chamber, to whom, after we had used part of such speeches as
we thought aptest for his capacity; and he making such answer as may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of his young years, we departed from him, returning to the place of
our retreat, and so that night to <hi>Paris.</hi> This being as near as our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
can serve us of all that in this Presenting and Negotiation hath been either
delivered by us, or received from them, the which we humbly submittting
to your Majesties wisdom and consideration, beseech the Almighty long

Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIr, I have received at Sir <hi>Henry Norris</hi> hands, aswel all such Copies as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Scotish affairs, whereby I may be the better directed hereafter how
to proceed therein; as also all other instructions as may concern her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
affairs. Touching common matters, I refer your Honour to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
of common Occurrents. The matters of secrecie here, at the least such
and so many as I can learn are these:</p>
                  <p>The Pope, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the rest of the Confederates, upon the
doubt of a match between the Queen my Mistress and Monsieur, do seek by
what means they can, to disswade and draw him from the same: They offer
him to be the head and chief executionar of the League against the Turk, a
thing now newly renewed, though long ago meant; vvhich League is thought to
stretch to as many as they repute to be Turks (although better Christians then
themselves.) The cause of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorraigns</hi> repair hither from <hi>Reyms</hi>
(as it is thought) vvas to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>The King as lately he uttered to <hi>le Sieur</hi> 
                     <gap reason="symbol" extent="11 letters">
                        <desc>〈11 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap>, seeming very much
to mislike hereof, utterred these vvords unto him, If this matter go forvvard,
it beho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth me to make some counter-league. I find the Germans (saith he)
vvell-affected tovvards me; and as for the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> I knovv she
hath good cause to mislike of this League, as I my self have; and therefore
(I suppose vvould be glad to joyn vvith me. To vvhom the other replied, that
he vvas glad that he savv his danger, for that he hoped he vvould provide for
the remedy; and vvished his Majestie that he vvould not forstovv the matter.
And therefore advised him, for that the Princes Ambassador of Germany vvere
not departed, that the mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er might be broken to them; vvhich thing the
King thought not convenient, for that that he thought their Ansvver vvould be,
that they had no Commission to deal in any such matteer; but rather thought it
more meet to send one of his ovvn. Then the other told him, that if he did
did send any body, it behoved him to make choice of one that vvas no
Catholique, for othervvise he should not be to them either grateful or
trustful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54478:23"/>
Whereupon the King named Monsieur <hi>Biron,</hi> though he be not thought to be
a Hugonot, yet is he not taken to be your enemie. Whereupon the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that he had made choice of a very fit person.</p>
                  <p>After he had made me acquainted with this matter, he asked me how I thought
the King should find the Queen affected. I asked him whether he had any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
so far forth to deal with me. He told me, no; but he desired me to say
frankly my opinion how I judged the Queen my Mistress would be inclined. To
whom I answered, that for my own private opinion, I thought not but that her
Majestie would very well like of it, First, in respect of the common cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Secondly, in respect of the good will she beareth the King, whose friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
above all other Princes, she doth chiefly embrace. And lastly, in respect of
her own safety. And as for my self, for these respects, when the matter shall
grow to some further moving, it shall not lack any furtherance that I can
give him.</p>
                  <p>The said party, the day before this Message, came unto me, and told me,
that he was wished from <hi>I.</hi> to give me to understand, that <hi>Malicorne</hi> (who
was sent into <hi>Spain</hi> to congratulate the Marriage, and is lately returned) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
that <hi>Iulian Remero</hi> at his being here, was dispatched from the
Court to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he was to do some great enterprise. Further, he
reported unto me, that the King here is angry, for that his Congratulation
was not accepted of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> in so good part as he looked for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
seemed to take some exception of the Kings Letters, for that certain words of
controversie to be usually put in such Letters as passed between them, were now
omitted. And further to the increase of this unkindness, the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi>
to whom the Kings Sister was offered in Marriage, sent an answer by <hi>Malicorne,</hi>
that they were both young, and that therefore about eight years hence that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
might be better talked of; which disdainful answer, is accepted here in
very ill part, and is thought not to be done, without the counsel of <hi>Spain.</hi>
And amongst all others, none taketh the matter more grievously then Queen
Mother, who thinketh her self not a little injured for the late friendship she hath
professed to <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He forgot not to renew the speech that passed between us touching the
League, desiring me to use some means to feel how her Majestie is inclined;
which I promised to do. And therefore I shall desire you to move her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
in that behalf, that I may receive some direction how to proceed therein.
And so leaving further to trouble your honor at this present, I most humbly
take leave.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honorable, and my very good Lord, the Earl of
Leicester.</head>
                  <p>RIght Honourable, and my very good Lord, touching the present state of
<hi>France</hi> I refer you to the common Occurrents here inclosed, and leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you by them to judge what likelihood there is of continuance of the Peace
lately here amongst them accorded. The best ground of continuance that I can
learn, by those that can best judge, is the Kings own inclination, which is thought
sincerely to be bent that way.</p>
                  <p>Touching his affection towards the Queen my Mistress, if outward entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be a just argument of inward affection, then surely there is great likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of continuance of Amitie and Concord. For first, I was in all those places
where the King had Governors, very well received. Then at the time when Sir
<hi>Henry Norris</hi> and I were appointed to have access to the Court for my present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(which was at <hi>Madrill)</hi> we were invited to dinner presently upon our Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
there; <hi>Laufay</hi> by the Kings appointment received us, and brought us to the
place where our dinner was prepared, where we lacked no store of good meat;
immediately after dinner, <hi>Chevaleir Thaers,</hi> sent by the King, came and told us,
that he was readie to give us audience; to whom we repaired, and were most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
received at his hands, who made great demonstration, by outward speech
and countenance of great good will towards the Queen my Mistress. Besides my
ordinarie speeches, concerning her Majesties charge, to behave my self in such
sort as might tend to the best continuance of Amitie between their Majesties, I
recommended the Peace, being so requested by the Deputies of those of the
Religion, which he seemed to accept in very good part.</p>
                  <p>Having thus ended with his Majestie, finding the new Q. not there, for that
it was given out she was sick of a fever. I declared unto him, that I had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from the Queens Majestie, to have presented unto her her Majesties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
as also to have used some office of Congratulation of the late Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; notwithstanding that her Majestie had made choice of a Personage
of calling honourable, to do that office, whose coming stayeth only upon the
certaintie of the knowledge of his Majesties entry; for that by the Q. Majestie
my Mistress, he is appointed to honour the same. The King alledged sickness
for excuse, and told me, that there should be another time appointed me, for
the execution of her Majesties Commission in that behalf; which both of him
and her could not but be accepted in as good part as it was meant.</p>
                  <p>Having thus ended with the King; whereas before it was customably to be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54478:24"/>
found (as I learned by Sir <hi>Henry Norris)</hi> to have present at the Audience both
Queen Mother and the Kings Brethren in place with the King, we found now
each of them to keep their several Estate, and so were driven to repair unto them
all severally to their Chambers; and though from her Majestie I had no further
Commission to have done any Message, but to the King, and unto the two
Queens, yet for that at my last being there, exception was taken at me, for
omitting my dutie to Monsieur; and besides, being requested by the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Religion, to recommend the observation of the Edict unto them
severally; therefore after access had to Queen Mother, my Letters being delivered
and certain ordinary speeches used, with the recommendation of those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
I repaired to Monsieur, who very courteously, and with good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
received me. To whom my speech from her Majestie was, that she willed
me to present unto him her commendations; and further to say unto him, that
she was glad to understand that he did concur together with the King, in that
good and honourable meaning of the observation of the Edict, whereby he did
not only win generally the reputation and honour to be thought a Prince of
courage in time of War, but also of Councel in time of Peace; which courage
she doubted not but that he would continue, in respect of the good will he bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the King and his Countrey, and the regard he had to his own honour.
Whereunto he answered, with great courtesie, that he thanked her Majestie, First,
for her commendations, as from a Princess of honour that she was, and whom
he so much reverenced. Secondarily, for the good encouragement that she gave
him to be a good instrument for the observation of the Edict; which thing,
as he was bound to do, in respect of his Duty towards the King and his
Countrey, so should her Majesties advertisement be of no small force with
him in that behalf. For my self, he told me, that during my service
here, I should receive, for her Majesties sake, any favour that he could
shew me.</p>
                  <p>Having thus done, I repaired to his Brother, to whom I used, besides
Commendations, some short Speech in recommendations of the Edict, for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
sake.</p>
                  <p>I do rather, my very good Lord, dwell upon those particularities, in respect of
your Lordships request. In observing Monsieur, I had at this present, by reason
the place served very well for the purpose, good occasion to view him; in stature,
by judgement of others that viewed us talking together, he was esteemed three
fingers higher then my self, in complexion somewhat sallow, his bodie of very
good shape, his leg long and small, but reasonably well proportioned; what
helps he had to supply any defects of nature, I know not: touching the
health of his person, I find the opinion diverse, as I know not what to
credit; and for my own part, I forbear to be over curious in the search
threof, for divers respects; if all be so well, as outwardlie it sheweth,
then is he of bodie sound enough. And yet at this present, I did not
finde him so well coloured, as I esteemed him to be at my last being
here.</p>
                  <p>Since my Arrival here, there hath been great search made by divers means,
how I am inclined to Monsieurs attempt. My general answer is, that I left my
private passions behind me, and do here submit my self to the passions of my
Prince, to execute whatsoever she shall command me, as precisely as I may, not
presuming to do any thing further then I shall be commanded. And as for her
marriage, whensoever it shall please God to incline her to that Change, I should
forget my dutie towards her and my Countrey, if I should not like very well
thereof, though my present calling requiret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> me to do no more neither in that
<pb facs="tcp:54478:25"/>
nor in any other thing further forth then I am prescribed. This answer seemeth
very well to satisfie those that would further this matter, for that I vvas fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to be a very passionate Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Touching the pictures your Lordship desired, they can by no means be gotten,
for no man may make any counterfeit of the King or his Brother, vvithout license;
if he do, the punishment is great. Thus having imparted to your Honour that
which at this present I thought worthy the advertisement, I most humbly take
my leave.</p>

of the 16 of this Moneth, touching my allowance for transportation. Surely,
Sir, I find my charges daily increase, through the extream prises of things here.
The expences of my horses at this instant grow to 4 l. the day, and yet is my daily
diet (through the meaness thereof) not such as the place I supply requireth. True
it is, the entry causeth the dearth to be so great and some hope there is, that
hereafter things will be more reasonable; but in the mean time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I find the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
over heavie; and when things shall be best cheap, yet shall I find it heavie
enough. But herewith I leave further to trouble you at this instant. The 25
of this instant moneth, I was presented unto the King at <hi>Madrill,</hi> where he now
presently lieth, being received by him with great courtesie and favour, as also
by his Mother and Brethren. I leave, Sir, to you to gess the cause of this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and yet I should do Monsieur <hi>de la Motte</hi> Ambassador with her Majestie,
great wrong, if I should not acknowledge some part of this good entertainment,
to proceed from the good report he hath made of me, as one that will do what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

and though they seem to give some doubt of the Kings sincerity, yet
surely, Sir, they that know him throughly, are of opinion, that if the matters
grow to new troubles, he will incline to those of the Religion.</p>
                  <p>This Oration, Sir, whereof I send you a Copie, pronounced and delivered to
him, and to the Ambassador of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> hath put him in some
good courage; whereas before, by the faction of the <hi>Guises,</hi> he was put in great

he is not settled in Religion, how he is carried away with wordly respects, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
misery to those of his Calling. God make those of his calling more truly
Religious then we are: To whose tuition I most humbly take my leave, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

                  <p>SIr, it may please you to be advertised, that the last of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> I received a
Letter from my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> by one <hi>Hollinshed,</hi> wherein he gave me
his notice of proceedings onward on his journey hithervvard. Whereupon I sent
forth M. <hi>Beal</hi> to the Court, being still at <hi>Madrill,</hi> to advertise the King and Queen
Mother from me.</p>
                  <p>First, that the said Lord of <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> who was deputed from the Queen
my Mistress to Congratulate his Marriage, had sent over thirty of his
Train, and that he himself about the first of this moneth, was minded to
be at Dover, there to imbark himself and the residue of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, for that I heard the Queens Majestie was sick, whereby it was
doubtful when she should be in state able, without her trouble, or some peril, to
give the said Lord <hi>Buckhurst</hi> access unto her, to execute his charge from the
Queens Majestie, my Mistress; that therefore I desired to know of his Majestie,
and the Queen his Mother, whether there were any hope of her Majesties speedy
recovery, whereby the said Nobleman may proceed in his journey, to accomplish
his said charge; or otherwise, whether I might not with his advice and favour,
write unto the said Nobleman some Letters of stay or return, if he were passed
the sea, or onward his voyage, until such time as he should be hereafter further
advertised of her Majesties speedy recovery.</p>
                  <p>In answer whereof, I received this inclosed from Secretary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Pynart;</hi> and for
that Mr. <hi>Beal,</hi> whom he made privy to his Letter, did not see his answer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
touching that point, which concerned his access to the Queen, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to know what was the Kings mind in that behalf. To whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
for that it was doubtfull by reason of the Queens sickness, whether
the Lord of <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> should have any access unto her (the only stay of
her Entry and Coronation) therefore the King referreth it to my Lords own
judgement, whether he will come now, or stay until the other Entry. I have
made my Lord privy of my proceedings herein; as also, what answer I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from the King, referring him to do therein, as his Instructions should
best direct him. I have made him also acquainted with my private opi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion in
this behalf; which is, if her Majesties direction may bear it, rather to proceed
then otherwise: First, in respect his coming now will be here accepted in as
good part as at any time hereafter. Secondarily, in respect of her Majesties
charges and his own. Thirdly, in respect that the Governour of <hi>Picardie</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>Bullen</hi> to receive him, should lose their labour, if he should not proceed
forward.</p>
                  <p>And as touching the Queens sickness, whereby his access unto her, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
the Marriage growth doubtful (judged here the chief cause of her
repair hither) I do not think the contrary, but that her Majesties honourable
and good meaning will be accepted in as good part, as if by access unto her
he might have executed the same, for that the let and impediment groweth
only from God; and for confirmation thereof, there was lately sent an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
from <hi>Luca,</hi> to execute the like office, who by reason of her sickness
could have no access, and so was driven to deliver over his Message to the
King, which was accepted at his hands very graciously, and so was dismissed,
as I heard, rewarded with a very honourable Present. Thus having been

over long in this behalf, I leave further to trouble your Honour, and most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

                  <p>If <hi>la Roches</hi> attempt be done with his privity, as in reason hardly me

he maketh here unto us her Majestities ministers; Which to the outward

God she may never have tryall. And so leaving further to trouble your

                  <head>To the right Honourable, Sir William Cecil her Mejesties
principall Secretarie.</head>
                  <p>SIr, it may please you to advertise her Majestie, that before I had accesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King, I sought by vvhat means I could to be informed of the Irish
attempts by those of this country. And being given to understand that <hi>de la
Roch,</hi> vvho as I learned by <hi>Rogers,</hi> vvas the partie that should lead the Souldiers
that made the invasion there, vvas here in this Tovvn; I found the means to
cause Monsiuer <hi>Brickmals,</hi> for that he said <hi>De la Roch</hi> had served under him, to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54478:27"/>
deal with him, and to aske him, whether he had not bin in Ireland; who answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he had not bin there, but in such cold terms he denied it, as he gathered by
divers circumstances, and his manner of speech, that true it was he had bin there,
which thing he seemed to be loth to affirme, for that (he said) he was well assured
that whosoever they were that dealt in the enterprise, the King would disavow
them. Hereupon at the time of my accesse, which was the 6 of <hi>Febr.</hi> at the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
of <hi>Burbons</hi> Lodging in Paris, I thought good to temper my speech accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
in such mile sort using this speech following:</p>
                  <p>I told him after ordinary commendations done, that though the Q. Majesty my
Mistress, was advertised from her Viceroy of Ireland, That one <hi>de la Roch</hi> his
Subject, had landed certain men there, who confederated with certain Rebells in
that Island, did commit (by way of hostility) certain out-rages, not answerable
to the good Amitie that rested between their Majesties. Notwithstanding her
Majestie was so well perswaded of his great good will and sincere affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her Majestie; whereof she had received by his Ambassador from him so
earnest assurance and protestation, that she could not but do him wrong to think
that this disoder should proceed from him, but rather from some evill Minister of
his, such as do mislike and envie the good Amitie that presently resteth between
them: And therfore so doubted not, but that his Majestie as her good Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
unto this good advertisement given, would in such sort extend his Authority
for the redresse of this inconvenience, as she might have just cause to think, that
the new and earnest lately professed friendship was grounded on sincerity, which
could not but bring forth fruits answerable to the said profession. To this in
few words he answered, That of his faith he knew of no such matter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
willed me to give him the names of all such as I could learn any waies of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors
in that behalf; and that he would so punish them, as that her Majestie his
good Sister should well p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rceive what good accompt he made of her friendship.
After I had thus ended with him, I repaired to the Q. Mother, both for that she
ruleth all here, as also, for that the rest of the Ambassadors here observe the same
course, and declared unto her as unto the King, that it was her Majesties pleasure
that I should so do; requiring her Majesties name, to be a good mean to avoid all
such offences as may any way impeach the good Amitie that presently is between
the King her son, and the Q. Majestie my Mistris. I received at her hands for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
divers good words of assurance and continuance of Amitie, which she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to further so much as lay in her power, and that she found the King her Son
so well inclined thereto as the Q. my Mistris might full well assure her self, that
whosoever should go about to disturbe the same, should receive such punishment,
as should be to the Q. my Mistris satisfactions. I thanked her in her Majesties
name, and shewed her, that I would not fail to make report unto the Q. my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris
of this her good affection towards her. Wherefore though herefore
she had received good assurance, yet that friendship vvas of that Nature as it is
alvvaies desired to be entertained vvith the exercise of mutuall good offices.</p>
                  <p>This Sir, vvas the effect of the speech that passed betvveen the Kings Majesty,
Q. Mother, and me, at this present accesse. Novv to the end that there may be
some triall vvhether these words were as well meant as they were uttered,</p>
                  <p>I have made choise of one to send to Britain, to search out the names of the
offenders, to the end I may present them unto the King, to see whether he will
be as good as his word in punishing of them; further by him, that I said I meant
to take order there, to be advertised from time to time from thence of such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
as may any vvay reach to any of her Majesties Dominions, vvhich I
see a thing very needfull, because this Tovvn is full of brutes. As I vvas in
vvriting, I vvas certified by one, from vvhom my Predecessor Sir <hi>Henry N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:54478:28"/>
had his best intelligence, who repaired secretly unto me, and told me this news
following.</p>
                  <p>How that the enterprise of Ireland is of great consequency and danger, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
though he thought the King was not privie, yet he did assure me that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ise</hi> were great dealers in it.</p>
                  <p>Further he said, that the Popes Nuntio labored what he might to draw Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
into the practise, promising him for the maintenance thereof, to be paid in
Paris 100000 for his encouragement; he made no difficulty to bring the said
enterprise to passe, in respect of the great intelligence that they have both in
England and Ireland; and that the same being won, it would be an easie step
to a step of more consequence, meaning England.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he shewed me, that if he would not accept this enterprise, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it was resolved it should go forward, and that the bills of credit for the
said some of 100000 are already here; if this advertisement prove as true, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that heretofore have bin given by him to my Predecessor, then are they not
to be neglected.</p>
                  <p>By another means I was advertised, that <hi>Stewkley</hi> in Spain presented an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
unto the King there, not onely subscribed with the names of the most
part of the Irish Noblity, but also the names of divers in England of good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
ready to be at his devotion; I learned further, that of late, fithence the
Lord <hi>Setons</hi> comming hither, there hath bin some greater conference between
the Spanish Ambassador, and the Ambassador of Scotland. Further I learned,
that the greater part of those that are landed in Ireland, were Levied by the Earle
of Argile in the King of Spains name, within the said Earles Government, being
promised pay by the said King of Spains Ministers; they were imbarked at the
Mule, or streight of Kenutire. One <hi>Skeldon,</hi> an ordinary servant of the Q. of
Scots, arrived lately here with Letters of some importance, as it is thought, for
that oftentimes he hath had accesse to the Court.</p>
                  <p>Thus having made your Honour privy of all such things as I could learne, I

                  <p>SIr, I thought good to make you privie to this private Letter, directed privatly
to your self, of certain talke passed between the Queens Mother and me, which
I desired her by protestation that she should receive at my hands, as from a private
person, not having commission as a publike person to say any more then that
which concerned <hi>le Roches</hi> attempt; I protested unto her, that the onely mark
that I would shoot at, during my service here, should be to continue so
much as might lie in so mean a Minister, good Amitie between the two Crowns
as a thing profitable unto them both. And therefore I desired her Majesty, first to
consider how necessary it was for the safety of both Realms, to have a firm league
concluded between the two Princes; Then to weigh how fit this present was for
the same.</p>
                  <p>Touching the first point, I shewed her, that though France enjoyed now
through Gods great goodness a generall peace with all his neighbours, yet that
it should so continue it was not to be looked for; And that therefore in time of
peace, politique Princes were not unmindfull, that after peace wars commonly
follow, for that the earth is subject to alterations. In which consideration, they
commonly weigh the neighbours, who are by consequence of reason likest to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54478:28"/>
attempt any thing against them, vvhich they see evidently to be that Prince that
is nearest by situation, and in forces mightiest; against vvhom, besides ordinary
forces, vvhich they have alvvaies prepared, they seek to strengthen themselves,
and the Princes confederats. Novv if your Majesty by this measure of mightiness
and nearness measure your neighbours; you shall then find, that it is England,
whose conderatie is chiefly to be desired: he that thinketh himself mightiest will
be well advised before he deal with each of you.</p>
                  <p>Touching the other point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I told her, that I thought this time most fit; first,
for that there was in both Princes a like affection, being both of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
inclinations peaceably inclined, with conformity of disposition, as one of the
best knots of assured friendship. Then, because there reigneth some unkindness
between other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> neighbours, with whom her Predecessors heretofore had both
long and good unity.</p>
                  <p>These circumstances well weighed, I concluded with her, that the time was
now fit, and the thing it self most fit to be prosecuted; and that her Majesty was
most fit to bring the same to good effect, as she in whom the King (as he had
just cause so to do) reposed the direction of his whole Government.</p>
                  <p>To this she replied, That first at my hands, both the King and she did look
for nothing else but good offices, tending to the maintenance of good Amity.
Secondarily, that as at present they enjoyed peace, so they had good hope of the
maintenance of the same generally with all their neighbours. Lastly, that she
hoped that the Amity between the Q. my Mistris, was of all parties very sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
meant. Notwithstanding, if she should desire to enter into some streigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
league; she was of opinion nothing would be more gratefull to the King.</p>
                  <p>To this I answered, that I was glad to receive at her hands so good hope of
the Kings inclination in that behalf. This in effect was that, that passed between
her Majesty and me.</p>
                  <p>The reasons that moved me to use this speech were these: first, for that
Spain seemeth not to be at this present very well inclined towards the Q. my
Mistris. Secondarily, for that the King hath no great liking of Spain, as before
advertised. Lastly, for that I was advertised, how that the Admirall had advised
lately the King and Q. Mother by his Letters, to seek to strengthen himself by
confederacy with the Princes of Germany, and the Q. Majesty my Mistris.</p>
                  <p>Sir, having now made you acquainted with my speech, as also with the reasons
that moved me thereto, I shall most humblie desire you according to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to advertise me of my errors either in this or otherwise in this my present
service, which you shall perceive that I will accept in so good part, as you shall
think your advise well bestowed, and thereby to be better able to serve her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
with more skill.</p>
                  <p>In my other Letters, as that vvhich vvas to be shevved to her Majestie, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to set dovvn the Popes Nuntios persvvasions he used tovvards a disswading
Monsieur from the Q. vvhich were, First she was an Heretique, Secondarily that
she was old, by whom he could scarse hope after issue; And lastly that England,
which he said he was well assured, vvas the mark he chiefly shot at, might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved,
and that right easily by svvord to his great Honour, and lesse inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
then making so unfit a match. Thus you see Sir hovv they make the
accompt vvithout their host; I hope they shall have more vvill then povver to
hurt us, and that God vvill still reserve our poore Country for a sanctuary for his
poor persecuted flock. To vvhose tuition I commit you, most humbly taking my
leave.</p>

pleased you of late both to recomend the same unto Mr. <hi>Secretarie,</hi> as also to
the B. of London, so that the hinderance I was like to receive by Mr. <hi>Haddo's</hi>

of the Trumpet, without any great pompe of Ceremonies, by reason of the new
Queens sickness, who is now in way of recovery.</p>
                  <p>Of late by her Majesties commandment, I dealt with the King about <hi>de la
Roches</hi> attempt in Ireland, who denieth that ever he was acquainted with the

of like promises, in like cases, it will be but all in words, for such is the
expedition of this Court, in promise speedy, in performing slow. At this time
surely there are great practises in hand for the invasion of Ireland, wherein the
Pope and Spain joyn: And as for the Cardinall <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> as he may may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
he faileth not to further the same to his uttermost.</p>

some weight, whereof you willed our Secretary by your private Letters to him to
advertise us, concerning some motion made unto you by <hi>le Sieurs de</hi> upon
certain conferences had by the King with him, and therein we find that which
you answered to the said Sir, J. A. to be discreet and agreable to our mind, and
and if you shall find any likelihood that such a matter may be further dealt in,
and that it be meant <hi>bona fide</hi> to proceed further, we would have you not only
as of your self, but as occasion shall be given to further it in our name, for we do
hold it so good and beneficiall, as we rather doubt that some impediment may
grow to hinder the successe thereof then of any speedie furtherance: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you shall do well to look well into the matter what likelihood there may
be to have it go forward before you discover our intention to the King, otherwise
then as you find necessary to provoke him thereto.</p>
                  <p>By some other your Letters, we perceive that the King there is well content
that the Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> shall come forward notwithstanding the sickness of
the Q. and so we would have him proceed notwithstanding the same. After we
had caused thus much to be written hereof, we thought good to will you to take
some occasion of speech with the King of Spains Ambassador there Resident;
and first to let him understand, that now about the tenth of this moneth we have
here received a Letter from the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> signifying thereby to us that
the matter vvhich he had to impart to us from the King his Master, vvas only
an offer from the said King to do any good office that in him might lie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
some good end of the cause betvvixt us and the Q. of Scots, vvithout any
particular respect to himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only for the common quietness of us both, and
of our Countries. And in this behalf the Duke requireth to understand, in what
sort we will have the King to deal, assuring us of the said Kings earnest intention
to pleasure us in any thing he may. Of thus much you shall say, vve thought
good to advertise the Ambassador, and to let him understand, that vve do very
thankfully accept the Kings offer, and would be glad to take the good vvill and
friendship, if there vvere any cause thereof in this office, as at this time there is
not; for he shall understand, that we have already entred so far into a treatie
with the Q. of Scots for all causes and differences betwixt us and her, as there
remaineth nothing of any great value or difference betwixt us, so as the finall
ending thereof resteth upon the execution of the matters accorded, and some
further treatie remaineth now to compound certain matters betwixt her and her
Subjects; for which purpose there be commissioners already come hither from
her, and a part of the Nobility of Scotland; and such as are to come as Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
from the other part, are (as we think) on their journey hitherward.</p>
                  <p>We have also by these last Letters of the Duke in expresse words, that he
himself is earnestly disposed to do any thing that may maintain the Amitie that
is betwixt the King and us, and particularly that he hath accorded to have resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
made, as our Merchants on both sides have thought it meet, and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to send over some speciall person of credit to explain some small differences
rising thereof, and to put the whole in execution. These kinds of dealings and
offices you may say are very agreeable unto us, who by many means made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
that the late differences have not grown of us, nor as we think) of the Kings
own disposition, but by untowardness of ministers; and now whilest we are well
content therevvith, vve are sorry to think that certain reports vvhich vve heare of
Spain should be true, either in whole, or in part; and as vve vvould be gladest they
vvere false, so are vve desirous that vve might knovv them certainly from the

and readiness by the way of <hi>France,</hi> certifie the King, and procure some
Answer, we have heard and known it to be true, that certain savage Rebels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men of no value, had fled out of our Realm of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their lewdness, and to procure both relief for themselves, and such like as they
be in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they do pretend their departure out of the Realm for matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
when indeed they be neither of one nor other Religion, but given to beastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity,
and yet have they wit enough to shew hypocrisie for their purpose. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
the first arrival of these, we know also, that an Englishman, a Subject
of ours, namely, <hi>Stewkley,</hi> not unknown, as we think, for his former prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
life both in <hi>Spain</hi> and other places; and notwithstanding great favours shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him divers times, upon hope of amendment, and some tokens of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
he did this last summer (pretending to come out of <hi>Ireland</hi> hither, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
turn his course into <hi>Spain)</hi> and as we hear, hath light into the company
of the aforesaid Fugitives and Rebels; pretending by his superfluous expences,
which is altogether of other mens goods, to be a person of some quality and
estimation, and able to do some great thing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereas, indeed, he
hath not the value of a Marmaduc in land or livelihood, he hath so solicited the
King, or some about him, with vain motions, as it is by him bruted, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
also with some credit reported unto us, which yet we do not believe, that the
K. will send a Captain of his, such a one as <hi>Iulian Romero,</hi> or such like, with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Souldiers into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to follow some vain device of those Rebels; whereof
we cannot but marvel that the King, or any of his Councel, being of experience,
can so lightly give any credit to such a companion as <hi>Stewkley</hi> is, which could never
live long in any quiet condition at home; of whom we are not disposed to say
much, because we cannot say any good of him: But may say, it shall be sufficient
that his conditions may be only enquired of; and then we doubt not, whosoever
shall know them, will take heed how to adventure any thing with him. And yet
whatsoever it is, we cannot but find it strange, that he or any such Fugitives,
moving matters of attempt as Rebels, either should be allowed or hearkned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
For whatsoever hath been conceived that any person of any degree, being the
King of <hi>Spains</hi> Subject, coming into our Realm of late years, as many have done
for safety of their lives, for matter of their consciences (as we alwaies under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood)
yet we do assure by our Honour, that there was never person of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that did motion unto us any matter offensive to the King or his Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
when opportunity served for such purposes, that was ever allowed by us,
or any such motion, or that ever received reward or comfort therein, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected;
such hath been our sincerity in these times, not to give any comfort to
the hurt of the King, or of his Countreys. And now if these reports which
we hear should be true, we might think our selves evilly recompenced, and
should be provoked for our defence to use such means, as otherwise of our selves
we did never allow or like: And so we trust in reason the Ambassador
himself might think, and—the conservation of the Amity betwixt the
King and us, and the restitution of the former—and Trade betwixt our
Countreys and Subjects; so we pray him to solicite some Answer in
this case. For whilest we should remain in doubt hereof, we cannot but
foresee, and to procure how to impeach any such attempts; wherein would
appear that whereof we shall be sure that we have some cause to doubt of the
Kings good will. Thus you see how we mean to have, by this occasion,
some knowledge (if it may be) of the Kings intention, although we meant
not to omit otherway to come to the truth hereof, doubting not but you
will also use such good means as you can to discover the truth, and not
forget the former matter, concerning that which certain of the French Kings

and should receive at his hands from time to time during his abode here,
any honour or favour he could shew him; and as I was departing, he called
me unto him, and asked me, what was done touching the Queen of Scots
matter. I told him, That of late I heard nothing, saving by certain Letters,
that there were Commissioners come out of <hi>Scotland</hi> from both parties; so
that as I thought the matter was fallen now to some Treaty. He willed me
to recommend the matter in his name to the Queens Majestie, and to tell
her, that he doubted not but by her good means, it should grow to some
speedy end, as should be to her honour and his contentment; and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
his Majestie not to fail in that behalf, I departed for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
I shall therefore desire your Honour to inform her Majestie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
as also, to procure at her hands what answer I shall make in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
                  <p>Touching the state of things here, I learn secretly by the F. that the
House of <hi>Guise</hi> seeketh to make a match between the Cardinal of <hi>Este</hi> and
the Kings Sister, for that the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> hath no issue, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
opinion is like to have none; which thing they seek the more earnestly,
to impeach the likelihood of marriage between the Prince of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the
said Kings Sister.</p>
                  <p>The 22 of this moneth, my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> is looked for here, his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and all other things fit for his entertainment being provided at the Kings
charges, if promise be kept. The new Queen is now well recovered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth
from <hi>Madril</hi> to this Town the 20 of this moneth; so that I purpose my
Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> shall have access unto her, whereof she is over dangerous, a
thing not very well liked of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>Touching <hi>la Roches</hi> attempt, I can learn nothing more then that I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised;
neither can I learn that in <hi>Britain</hi> there is any preparation of ships,
but of such as belong unto Merchants. And thus leaving to trouble your
Honour, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>SIr, I would be loath in any Letter that is to be shewed unto her Majestie, to
make mention of any thing that may any way concern Monsieur, for that her
Majestie doth suspect that I am inclined that way in respect of his Religion; and
therefore, Sir, I shall desire you to use this Letter as private to your self; and as for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54478:31"/>
my inclination to Monsieur (for that I hear he may be drawn to be of any religion)
I see so great necessitie of her marriage, as if it may be her Majesties content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the benefit of the Realm, by judgement of those that are fit to deal
and advise in a matter of so great weight, I can be content as becometh me, to
subscribe the same. The matters that I thought to make you privie of in this
private Letter, are these;</p>
                  <p>First, I understand that Monsieur not long sithence, hath given out certain
speeches to those that are nearest about him, that he maketh no great account
to match with the Queens Majestie, through the perswasions of the House of
<hi>Guise</hi> and the Spanish Ambassador, who do not stick to use many dishonorable
arguments to disswade him from the same: Besides, they use some arguments of
danger towards us, making the conquest of England a matter of no great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
in respect of the intelligence they have there, no small number of evil
affected Subjects, and of those, some of no mean quality. The A. of late had
talk with  <gap reason="symbol" extent="6 letters">
                        <desc>〈☐☐☐☐☐☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> touching the opinion of the enterprise: he shewed me that
he whosoever he was that should attempt the matter, should fail of his reckoning,
like him that made accompt without his host. The A himself seemeth to
to have no great liking thereof, but seemeth to be very well inclined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

                  <p>The Spanish A. to divert them from Flanders, would be glad to set them in
hand in England, and yet would he be loath that France should have any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
interest in England, then it hath. And as for the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they mean to make an unnatural match between Monsieur and their
Neece, they would be loath, in respect of her possibilitie, that he should
have any further foot in England then he hath; but they both think it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silier
atchieved by Marriage, then by Sword, aud would be glad to divert
him from the way of likelihood, and to direct him to that way that carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
least possibilitie. These being the things I thought worthy of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
at this present, I leave further to trouble your Honour, most

                  <p>MY very good Lord, as there is nothing more desired of one sort then two
marriages; the one between the Queen my Mistress, and Monsieur, the
other between the Prince of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Kings sister; so is there nothing
more impugned by the contrary part, wherein the Popes Nuncio, and the

thereof: And in this behalf they want not what assistance the House of
<hi>Guise</hi> and their adherents can yield. For the let of the first, they alledge He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.
For the let of the latter, they secretly seek to match between the
Cardinal of <hi>Este,</hi> and the Kings said Sister; for that the Duke of <hi>Ferara</hi>
his Brother hath neither issue, nor by common judgement is like to have any.
This is rather intended, then any just cause of hope conceived that it will
come so to pass, for that as I hear Queen Mother seemeth not to like
thereof.</p>

                  <p>SIr, if my sickness alone were considered, or my irksome business laid thereto
perused, I cannot think but you would excuse my not writing with my own
hand, or any long Letter by my enditing of the hand of another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now I am enforced for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ittle I have to say, to use another hand. You
shall perceive by the Queens Majesties Letters, what I have been inforced with
some pain to indite, by reason of my restless sickness and business; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I mean not to repeat any part thereof unto you, wishing you to supplie any
defects in the manner of writing, with your own natural discretion.</p>
                  <p>This I will add, that I do hear out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that one is coming hither
named Monsieur <hi>Senigam,</hi> to make an end of the long talk that hath been of
the mutual restitution of the Ships and Wares arrested; and thereupon it may
be, that some further Treatie of the opening of the entercouse may follow. It
is also written from thence, that one is come to take the place of this wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Ambassador, who I think shall be of the low Countries, named Seignieur
<hi>Front,</hi> one of the long Robe, that was here in Commission with the Marquess
<hi>Vitells.</hi> Here do daily come into our Ports, by drifts of winds, certain Hulks
of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> with great riches, which though they are to be stayed,
yet surelie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I trust, there shall lack no diligence to cause the riches of them to
be duly preserved for the owners. And if you shall hear any other report (as
it may be) I assure you it shall be against the good meaning of her Majestie
and her Councel.</p>
                  <p>For the matters of <hi>Spain,</hi> besides that which is written in the Queens Letters,
I do hear, that <hi>Stewkley</hi> hath caused one Mr. <hi>Huggins</hi> to be imprisoned, charging
him to the King, that he hath advertised sundrie things of that Court to my
Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> and me, wherein <hi>Stewkley</hi> sheweth his traiterous meaning to
his Countrey.</p>
                  <p>We find it so hard here, by reason of this restraint, to send any meet person
into <hi>Spain,</hi> to discover things there; and I cannot tell, whether you might find
some there that might be trusted, in respect of the common accord of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to be used under some other colour of Errand thither, to discover this
Kings practises; and if you can so do with any reasonable charge, I wish you so to
to, and the same shall be satisfied.</p>
                  <p>Since the writing of the Queens Letter, I find that the <hi>E. Morton</hi> was come to
<hi>Barwick</hi> the fifth of this moneth, with the rest of the Commissioners of that part,
so as I look hourly for his arrival here; and that may you affirm to the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some there that be so greedie in the Queen of Scots cause: It is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the Queens Majestie, that there shall be a plain somewhat before
<hi>Easter,</hi> which is desired not to continue long, and so I wish it.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but by this time, the Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> hath either visited the King,
or known when he shall; and I trust my Lord of <hi>Rutland</hi> hath been a Courtier
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54478:32"/>
before this time; for whom I dare be bold to thank you, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
I have that you shew him friendship, which I know he will of
himself deserve; yet I cannot but adde thanks to his deserts, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
I have to see good proof of him to the honour of himself, and of his
Countrey.</p>
                  <p>I have no other thing, but that this afternoon God hath called to his mercie
Sir <hi>Nicholas Throckmorton,</hi> having been sick not past six or seven daies of a
Plurisie, joyned with a disease called Periplen, he doth but lead the way to us,
whereof I for my part have had sufficient schooling by my present sickness.
I pray you commend me to my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> and whilest he is there
an Ambassador, I think you may do well to make him partaker of your
charge.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honorable Sir William Cecil, her Majesties prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIr, it may please you, to advertise her Majestie, that according to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
I repaired to the Spanish Ambassador, and declared to him from
point to point, so much as is prescribed by her Majesties Letters, especially not
forgetting to dilate that point that concerned her Majesties good opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him, in respect of the good offices that he had done from time to time
to salve the differences and unkindness that depend between her Majestie and
his Master.</p>
                  <p>His answer was, in the Spanish tongue, which I understood not, and other
tongue then Spanish he would not vouchsafe to speak; and therefore, Sir, I may
rather tell you by gess then otherwise.</p>
                  <p>First, he seemed to be agreived, that he never heard any thing of the
message he sent about three moneths sithence by Sir <hi>Henry Norris,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
that point; that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> lately hath communicated to her
Majestie touching the Kings offers, to be a Mediator between the Queen of
Scots and her Majestie; he said, that she did never use <hi>Don Francisco,</hi> for so he
named himself, but by fits, who from time to time towards her Ambassador, had
alwaies used himself so sincerely, as they could not but report, that <hi>Don
Francisco</hi> was a Gentleman of great sinceritie: And if it had pleased her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
to have used him throughlie, he would have done offices worthie of
<hi>Don Francisco.</hi> When I came to that point that concerned the brutes
touching the King his Masters intention in attempting somewhat that might
not best agree to good Amitie; whereof though her Majestie had cause
somewhat to doubt, in regard of his intertaining of her Irish Rebels, and
the Countenance given to <hi>Stewkley;</hi> yet being of her own nature, not easily
drawn to condemn upon brutes, without good ground, especially being late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertained by friendly offers, arguments of good meaning, therefore
desired him onely to be a mean to procure at the Kings hand some good as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
that these be but vain brutes; and that his meaning is to continue
good Amitie, and to avoid all such occasions as might breed any contrarie ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
To this (after some time spent in exclamations and admirations) he
answered, That nothing could seem so strange unto him, as her Majestie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54478:33"/>
a Prince of that wisdom and experience that she is of, should once give
ear to such vain bruits, as thereby to doubt that his Master (considering the
long Amitie that hath been between the House of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>England)</hi> would
now attempt any thing that might breed any breach thereof. And as for sending
to his Master, he said, the way was long, and that it would be two moneths at
the least, before he could have any Answer. He said therefore, he would write
to the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>I shewed, that my Commission was to request to procure satisfaction from the
King; and as for the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> her Majestie lacked no means to send un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, no more she did not to send unto the King; but would have been
glad, as one well perswaded of him, to have used his help therein, as a thing
as beneficial for his Master as for her Majestie. In the end, he said, he would
write, but that it would be two moneths before he could receive answer;
in the mean time, he wished her Majestie to think of his Master, as she
would wish him to think of her: <hi>Stewkley</hi> he protested never to have heard of.
If in the rest he be no sincerer then in this, then is he <hi>Don Francisco</hi> not so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
as he protesteth. As for any attempts by <hi>Iulio Romero</hi> to be done
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> tell your Mistress (saith he) in few words, that you her Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ere knoweth, that they be no Spaniards that have the enterprize in hand.
I told him, that whatsoever I knew, he might assure himself her Majestie could
not be ignorant of. And whereas, said I, you think that they be Frenchmen, I
assure my self to the contrarie, for that the King hath so assured me. He shewed me
that he thought the King in that behalf sincere; and that if there were any such
matter, it proceeded not from him, but from others.</p>
                  <p>This, Sir, was in effect what I could ghess proceeded between us; never spake
I with a prouder man, or with one more disdainful in countenance, and in speech.
I suppose he is somewhat disquieted to see the honourable entertainment used
towards my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> and therefore think him the rather to be excused;
besides, he seemeth to be no better affected towards me, then I am towards him,
which is such, and no further forth then may concern her Majesties service; I mean
to have little else to do with him.</p>
                  <p>Sir, touching <hi>de la Roches</hi> matter before my Lord of <hi>Buckhursts</hi> repair to the
Court, we upon conference agreed, that he should make some entry into the
matter, and then afterwards cause the King to call me to inform what I had
learned touching <hi>Roches</hi> proceeding in that behalf. And so at the time of access,
according to the order agreed between us, being called by the King, I shewed his
Majestie, that (notwithstanding he was otherwise informed) the said <hi>de la Roch</hi>
had been in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that he had left certain Souldiers there: For whose safety
he had brought hither two sons of one <hi>Fitzmorice,</hi> to be here in place of hostages,
who remain now in <hi>Brest</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> at a Kinsmans of the said <hi>de la Roch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ther I shewed him, that the said <hi>de la Roch</hi> was lately departed out of
the Town; who before his going, secretly gave out, that he was dispatched
about some enterprise. I desired therefore his Majestie, that according to his
promise, and the great Amitie, he professed to her Majestie my Mistress, he
would procure some redress in that behalf, which he with great earnestness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
to us.</p>
                  <p>I also desired his Majestie, that it would please him to give me leave to deliver
to some one about him a memorial, to put him in remembrance thereof, which
his Majestie willingly granted, and appointed one <hi>Ger<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lomo Gondi,</hi> a Gentleman
of his Chamber to be the partie.</p>
                  <p>The like speech I used to the Queen Mother, who gave great assurance, that
there should be speedy redress thereof. I look shortly out of <hi>Britain</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54478:33"/>
throughly, by a Messenger that I sent expresly for that purpose touching
the enterprise; where also I have taken such order, as I shall not fail to be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
from time to time of such preparations as there shall be made, whereof
there may grow any suspition of any intention to attempt any thing that may
touch her Majesties Dominions. Concerning the having of any intelligence in
<hi>Spain,</hi> I hope to procure, that one of the Kings Ambassadors men, upon some
pension, shall advertise from time to time how things pass there.</p>
                  <p>According as her Majestie hath commanded me, I will not be unmindful touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the league, hoping not to omit any occasion or opportunitie that may serve
that purpose, so far forth as my poor skill and experience may stretch.</p>
                  <p>Touching my Lord of <hi>Buckhursts</hi> entertainment here, which is very honorable,
and such as the like hath not been used towards any other, I refer you to his
Lordships own Letters. I find him a Gentleman very wise and discreet, and very
careful to do that thing that may be for her Majesties Honour, wherein he spares
no cost. And leaving further to trouble your Honour at this present, I most
humbly take my leave, beseeching God to send you better health, then by your

                  <p>MY Lord Ambassador, I thank you for your Letters lately received from
you, the last being the ninth of <hi>Febr.</hi> wherein you give very good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
touching the matter of Monsieur; and for my own part, I am of the same
mind, to wish sinceritie and honourable dealing in it, that either upon very good
deliberation it may be embraced, or in time, and in best sort put from too much
entrance; for neither is our case meet to dally, nor his person for to be abused, as
he will think if he miss his desire, how fair soever we speak him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore for my own part, I wish all things to be throughly considered of
him, that her Majestie may fully understand the condition of his person before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
which is one of the causes that moved me to say unto you, as I did before
your departure; for I find matter that is like to come in question, and I perceive
her Majestie more bent to marry then heretofore she hath been: God make her
fortunate therein to his glory and our comforts. Touching the matter of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
Master Secretary made me privy to your Letters, and you do well to follow the
matter earnestly, and to enquire further thereof by all means you can devise; for
her Majestie is also advertised, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath like intention, and
almost ready to put his practise in execution; whereupon, her Majestie doth mean
forthwith to take some order for that Realm. We have lost on Monday our good

                  <p>YOur Lordships of the 14 I received the 16 of this present, and was most
sorry (as I had just cause) by the same to understand of the loss of
so dear a friend as Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> was unto me, whose lack, if it were but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
only to his Friends, the loss were great; but if it be weighed general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in respect of her Majestie and our Countrey, the want of him will then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
greater: For, be it spoken without offence to any, for counsel in
peace, and for conduct in war, he hath not left of like sufficiency his successor
that I know. I will not dwell upon this matter, for that it is no less unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
for your Lordship to read, then for me to write. And leaving further to
trouble your Honour at this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honorable Sir William Cecil, her Majesties prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIr, as I wrote unto you in my Letters of the 25 of <hi>February,</hi> the Spanish
Ambassador came to visit me; who after some superfluous talk of love mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
entred to talk of the unkindness that reigned between the Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
and his Master, expressing with words of great vehemency, the desire that
they were drawn to some accord, as a thing to the benefit of both Princes, for
(saith he) as the League between the house of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>England</hi> hath been
the preservation of both the Countreys; so the breach thereof might make them
both a prey to their neighbours.</p>
                  <p>I shewed him, that I was glad to hear that he was of that good opinion, and
therefore I doubted not, but that he will use all those good offices that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ght
salve the unkindness.</p>
                  <p>The first, to cause all those occasions that might breed any suspicion of evil
meaning, to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>The second, to procure some grateful Ministers to be sent from the King his
Master unto her Majestie, to enter into some Treaty of accord.</p>
                  <p>To the first, he said, that her Majestie, whatsoever was given out to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
needed not to doubt of the Kings sincerity towards her.</p>
                  <p>To the second, he said, he saw not how the King could do it with his honor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how the D. Marquis <hi>Vitelli</hi> and the King his Masters Ambassador were
rejected.</p>
                  <p>To that I replyed, the offence grew by two of them, and therefore ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and most unfit to deal in that behalf. And as for their having no direct
Commission from the King, but from him that had bred the offence, in reason
he was not fit to be imployed in that care. The end of our talk was, that he
for his part, and I for my part, would not fail to think of those things that
might best tend to breed reconcilement between our Princes. But, Sir, to the
end you may know the ground and spring of this alteration, of so strange, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
so familiar and curteous, you shall understand, that not past three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he presented unto the King, three requests from the D. <hi>Alva.</hi> The first,
for that the D. vvas given to understand, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> maketh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54478:34"/>
in Germanie for Flanders that therefore it would please him (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the aid his Master had sent him in his civill troubles) to send him the like
number of Reisters, for the better understanding of the said Princes entreprize.</p>
                  <p>The second, that it would please him, that he might leavie here such number of
Catholiques<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as would willingly serve his Master against the said Prince.</p>
                  <p>The third, that it would please him to stay certain ships there a preparing a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Rochel on the Princes behalf.</p>
                  <p>To the first the King answered, That his treasures were so near spent, that he
took more care how to pay the Reisters (to whom he was indebted for service
in the last troubles) then he was well able at this present to provide any succour
or aid for the King his Master, and hoped, that seeing his necessity was such, his
said Master and good Brother would bear with all.</p>
                  <p>Touching the second, he answered, That if he should condescend to the leavying
of such Catholiques as would be content to serve, that thereupon the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gonots</hi>
would take occasion to put themselves in Arms, suspecting that the said leavie
were but colourable, and a device that might reach to themselves.</p>
                  <p>To the third he answered, That he was informed that the said ships were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
onely to be revenged o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> certain of his Masters Subjects that had taken cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ships of those of the Religion, and had drowned divers of the men, and others
they had delivered unto the inquisitors.</p>
                  <p>These answers falling not out to his contentment, maketh him, as I suppose,
to think, that the friendship of England is worth the having.</p>
                  <p>The first of this moneth there arrived here the Count <hi>Olivares,</hi> sent by the
King of Spain to congratulate the marriage; his train was onely in number 11.
he is reported to be of livelihood fortie thousand Crowns a yeare; his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
here is nothing answerable to that my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> hath receive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>: I
mean to repair to see him, as also to propound unto him if I see occasion thereto,
what by her Majestie I was appointed to declare unto the Spanish Ambassador.</p>
                  <p>The second of this moneth, which was the day my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> took his
leave, there was set up a Bull, which was at <hi>Ponte de St. Estienne,</hi> of the same
day that <hi>Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ans</hi> was, containing the self same matter, which a servant of mine
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by reason he saw divers flocking about it, tore it down, and brought
me the same, whereupon my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> &amp; I, upon conference, before his
said accesse, immediatly broke with the King in that behalf. The King called me
unto him, and asked me the contents of the said Bull; whereof being advertised,
as also I presenting unto him so much of the said Bull as was given me by my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
he shewed himself very much moved thereat, in such sort as we might very
well see it was unseigned: forthwith he called <hi>Lansac</hi> unto him, and willed him
to take order with the Judge Crimniall, for the searching out of the setter of the
same, assuring us, if by any means he could be found, he should receive such
punishment as such a persumption required; considering the good Amitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and his good Sister.</p>
                  <p>I shewed him, that if he did not take order in this, the like measure might be
measured to himself. He answered, that he did perceive that very well, and that
whosoever he were that should seem to touch in honour any of his Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
he would make account of him accordingly.</p>
                  <p>After my departure from the King, <hi>Lansac</hi> told me in mine ear, That he had
g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at cause to guesse, that this was some Spanish practise.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, having made you partaker of such things as I thought me for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>MY very good Lord, I leave to my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> to shew you how
every way he hath b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

onely will I say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That such hath bin my Lords good demeanour, as also, of
the Gentleman of his train, as the King and his Court resteth very well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and giveth both him and them great commendations; protesting that
sithence his coming to the Crown there was not an Ambassador of like Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosur
here, which I do not learn at those hands that will report otherwise then
they hear, to speak that which may best content us; but from them at whose
hands I do assure my self to have received the truth; and for the increase of
this good report, he spareth to use no cost or liberality to such as (by the
King appointment) have given attendance on him. Touching other things,
the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> is lately departed from the Court with discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for that the Precedentship is adjudged to the Duke of Nemours; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing,
That so long as the Queen Mother liveth, he will not come to the
Court, for he judgeth her to be the cause thereof. I heare secretly, that there
is not the best liking between the two Queens, whereof the young Q. is like to
have the worst by common judgement; for that here, whatsoever our Mother
commandeth, taketh place, and standeth for law. And therefore, if her
Majestie desire to take any profit of France, she must onely be the Messias
and Mediatour. I could therefore have wished, that her Majestie had amongst
other things bestowed some Present upon her. The Kings Request unto the
Pope for Count <hi>Galli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

if all the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in France were incamped about Rome, he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him. The King with this proud and disdainfull answer is very much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
I would he would give the <hi>Hugonots</hi> leave to make some proof what
they could do for his delivery. Touching a Bull set up against the Queen, the
Kings discontentment therewith, and certain requests presented by the Spanish
Ambassador here to the King, I referre your Honour to Mr. <hi>Secretaries</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;

Resident for the Queens Majesty in France.</head>
                  <p>MY Lord Ambassador, since my last Letter, unto you, I have little new
matter worth the writing, saving now we are much troubled with the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
causes, the Commissioners of both parties are now here; &amp; to write unto you
what the end will be certainly as yet, I cannot: we find both sides very stiffe, and
hitherto those for the Kings partie very resolute for the maintenance of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie;
her Majesties scrupulosity touching his Title and Government, we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know. The unworthiness of their Queen to rule she granteth, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of their cause to depose her from her dignity, she can hardly yet be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
in, so yet she remaineth much perplexed; on the one side, she is loth to
set her up, or to restore to her her estate again. On the other side, she is as loth
to defend that which she is not well perswaded to have justice with it. Between
these, her Counsell chiefly seek for these two things; that her self may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in suretie, and the true Religion maintained assuredly: For as the state of
the world standeth, and upon through examination of this cause, it appeares,
that both the waies be dangerous touching the Q. of Scots; for there is danger
for delivering of her to her Government, so is there danger in retaining her in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
her friends abroad begin to speak proudly for her; we were wont also to
have friends of our side if need were, but as farre as I can see, there is none
of that side of the sea to be found that be Princes absolute; well, our case
is the harder, and we must say, <hi>Si Deus nobiscum quis contra nos.</hi> Touching
this matter, as soon as it shall grow to any likelihood, either of the one side, or
of the other, I will advertise you, and withall send you the reasons of the advice.
In the mean time, whatsoever you may hear, believe me, there is no man in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
can tell you which way it will go; yet in respect of the King there, and his
continuall dealing for the said Q. her Majestie rather giveth in words more favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
that way then the other. Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> is arrived here yesterday, being Shrove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunday,
when Mr. <hi>Secretary</hi> was created Baron of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> and I think ere it be
long shall have the office of privie Seal, but as yet remaineth Secretary still; and
within a day or two Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> is like to be called to assist him. The
Parliament is to begin the 2 of <hi>Aprill</hi> next, the Queen Majestie, thanks be
to God, is in very good health, so are all your friends as you left them, save
Sir <hi>Nicholas Throckmorton,</hi> our good friend. Your wife was here lately to take

                  <p>BY your Lordships of the 26 of <hi>February,</hi> I find that there is some entrie
made in the Scotish matters, and that you see them so full of difficulties, as
whether on retaining or releasing there should be more safety, you can hardly
di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cern things well weighed as well at home as abroad.</p>
                  <p>The common opinion of such as are of judgement here, and wish well unto her
Majestie and our Country, is, That if the pretended match between her Majestie
and Monsieur should not go forward, then nothing can be so dangerous as her
delivery; for here they stand upon this point, that neither the King can be safe,
nor the Realm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uiet, unlesse Monsieur be provided of some other harborage.</p>
                  <p>The places likely to be attained, and fit for his calling, where they would place
him, are two, England and Scotland; if England refuse, then is Scotland more
ready to receive him. This well weighed, though your Lorship with the rest of
the Comissioners, are both wise and of great experience, notwithstanding so full of
danger is the Cause, as no resolution can possibly grow to you, that shall be void
of perill. I pray God therefore in this hard case, that that course may be taken
wherein is least perill, and most safety for her Majesty.</p>
                  <p>At this present, there is no matter here worthy of your Lordships knowledge,
only I am to trouble you with mine own particular estate, my charges grow here
to be so great, through the excessive deareness of the place, as necessity forceth
me at this present to make my moan unto your Lordship, and to desire
your aid, that I may not be (as I am) overburdened; whereby the care how
to live, may hinder the onely care I ought to have, how to serve. I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
hitherto to expresse my grief, to the end that my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst's</hi>
report might add some credit to my complaint. And though my service
cannot deserve so much as I am allowed, yet my place, and my estate requireth
consideration to be had of the present time; for otherwise, I shall not be able to
do that which shall be for her Majestites Honour and service: when men of live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
were imployed in this calling, alwaies change of time, bread change and of
Allowance. If any time therefore required consideration, this chiefly; for that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was the like dearth here; and if any mans estate was to be weighed, none more
then mine, that am far inferior in ability to any other that ever supplied this place.
I will not longer entertain your Lordship with this private cause, but commit it
to your good consideration, assuring my self of any furtherance that you can
give me. And so leaving further to trouble your Honour at this present, I most
humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <head>To my very loving friend Mr. Francis Walsingham <abbr>Esq</abbr> the
Q. Majesties Ambassador in France.</head>
                  <p>SIr, I have received your Letters, both by Mr. <hi>Wigmore</hi> and <hi>Beale,</hi> as by
<hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rcourt</hi> I did late advertise you. And having made her Majesty partaker,
both by hearing them read, and by her own reading, I am in this sort directed to
answer you. To the first of the second, that is, to that of the 13 of <hi>Febr.</hi> brought
by <hi>Beale,</hi> her Majestie maketh good accompt of the person of him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> by the intelligence which he gave you; but it
breedeth some doubt in her, that the certainty can be no otherwise understood,
in that it is informed you, that the practise continueth by late dispatching of an
Englishman of high stature, and lean of visage; wherein is such incertainty, as
no man can thereby attain either to discover the practise, or withstand it, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
the party: and surely, Sir, her Majesty cannot but think, but they
that can attain to the knowledge of the practise, may aswell attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the parties name; for they that are trusted with the matter, may be
trusted with the persons; and so her Majestie wisheth you to endevour your self,
with such as you shall think good, to come to the knowledge of some persons, by
stay of whom such a matter might be deciphered. For mine own part, I think it
likely that these practises are devised, but without more apparence I see no
evident reason to move me, that in the time when the Queen of Scots her self,
and her Factors, are in hope to be delivered by treatie, and with the favour of
our Queen, there should be any attempt otherwise for her escape; wherein, how
cunning soever men be in device, yet the execution standeth upon many adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and any mischance hapning, might breed ruin to the whole enterprise.
I have been acquainted with many of these like advertisement. But surely,
I never found any substance in them in the event; but yet with them, and without
them, I ever find it good to be circumspect. I write not to have you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
from hearing and reporting of any the like, but my experience serveth
to move you to procure the givers of such things, to discover the matters more
certainly, and so they are of more value.</p>
                  <p>The message sent you from Rochel, of some dangerous intent upon Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
from Spain, hath more apparence; for that we also hear it from Spain
confirmed, and it is the same that before I advertised you concerning
<hi>Stukelie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I also smell some purpose of the Count <hi>Lodowicks</hi> coming with his ships to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Low-Countries, to accompanie the designe; for his brother the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> whereof I would look for some better successe, if I had not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
thereof so many waies; for the force of that enterprize should consist in
suddenness and secresie, which are not like to take place. Thus much for your
first Letter.</p>
                  <p>Now to the second brought by <hi>Wigmore,</hi> the Q. Majestie liketh well of
your proceedings with the Spanish Ambassador there, and marvelleth that he
should be so coy with you, considering the reports of his former curtesies; but
by likelihood, some other accident moved it, which by you next speech will
be better discovered. The cause why that Ambassador could not be answered
sooner of the matter whereof he advertised her Majestie from the Duke of
<hi>Alva,</hi> was, for that her Majestie could not sooner hear thereof from the
Duke. If you shall find it convenient to impart matters to the said Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
you may let him know of these things following; One Monsieur <hi>Senegen</hi>
a Low-Countrie-man, is comming to end the Treaty for rest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tution on both
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54478:37"/>
sides of the Merchants goods; There are lately come into the ports of the West,
certain Hulks laden from Spain and Portugall, driven by Tempest. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they should be well used, the Ambassador here for the King, though
in other things he be not used, hath been dealt withall to name certain
strangers (Merchants) to resort to the ports, and they have speciall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
from us to put the same in all good safety, and that no dealing shall be
by any to the impairing of the said goods; And this speciall favour is shewed,
because the time of restitution is at hand. And therefore we mean not to give
any cause of quarreling. There were also certain other ships of Warre that
came from Spain, being of the company which conducted the Queen of
Spain into Spain, which being furnished with Souldiers, were favourably
entertained, and permitted to depart at their pleasure. Of these things you
may give him knowledge, to make him have a better taste in his mouth; he
may perchance contrariwise complain of spoile of his Masters Subjects by
Pirats hanting the narrow Seas, and specially about the Isle of Weight: and
I cannot deny the spoiles, but surely they are committed by one <hi>Lubresst</hi> and
others belonging to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> which we cannot remedie; and
yet Mr. <hi>Horsey</hi> is presently dispatched with Authority to set forth certain
ships, either to take them, or to drive them from our Coast. I confesse to
you privately, they are too much favoured <hi>(lucri causa)</hi> but you may avow
truly, that the Q. Majestie doth in no wise favour them: thus much to your
second Letter.</p>
                  <p>Now to some credit given by Mr. <hi>Beale</hi> concerning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you should shew your self willing to advertise, and so you shall doe

                  <p>The retardation used herein by H. is not liked by A. and the good will of
L. in the furtherance is allowed. By this you may perceive how to order
your self; and surely this principle I hold, that no on thing shall warrant
more suretie and quietness to the Queen Majestie the 3 5 7 in; but the manner
and circumstance are of the substance of my principall, and not accedents. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I deal boldly with you; I find nothing in your writing or doing but
allowable, if otherwise I did, I would advertise you for friendship to your self,
and for good will to the office you bear.</p>

me what I should write unto you, of the great matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I desired
might be in a Letter from her self to you, but her Majestie thought it
sufficient to be imparted unto you in this sort following; If any person of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54478:37"/>
value shall deal with you to understand your mind in the case of her Majesties
mariage, you may say; That at your coming from hence, upon some common
brute of such a matter concerning her Majestie and Monsieur <hi>D. Anjow,</hi> you
sought what to think or report thereof, and this you are assured that at your
coming out of England, her Majestie, upon consideration of the benefit of
her Realm, and to content her subjects, resolved to marry, if she should find a
person in estate and condition fit for her to match withall; and that she meant
not to marry but with a person of the family of a Prince; and you may add,
that you cannot by any means perceive, that her Majestie is altered from that
disposition; so as you may conclude, that if any such matter should be moved
to you, by any meet person to deal therein, you will advertise her Majestie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and so would her Majestie you should do. If God shall order this mariage, or
any other, to take place, you may well judge no time would be wasted, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then honour may require. I am not able to discern what is best, but surely,
I see no continuance of her quietness without a Marriage. And therefore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

<hi>Stenklies</hi> attempt, he protested they were but bruites. I shewed him that the
Queens Majestie was advertised otherwise, and upon such likelihood, as she
had good cause to believe it. For first, (said I) the King giveth him a daily
allowance. Secondarily, he hath advanced him to the Honour of Knight-hood.
Thirdly, that the said <hi>Stenklies</hi> should entertain about him certain Engineers.</p>
                  <p>To the first objection he answered, that the King his Master was glad to
entertain any Gentleman of countenance, that offered him service, as also to
honour them with the honour of Knighthood. I then made him acquainted
with the couse of <hi>Stenklies</hi> life, as also how little he had to take to, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
willed him to consider how unworthy he was of any honour or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in respect of himself. But (said I) being as he is, a Rebell unto the Queens
Majestie, with whom the house of <hi>Burgundy</hi> hath had so long Amitie, and to
be used with that honour and entertainment at his Masters hand, gave her oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

                  <p>And whereas an ancient, and very good servant of ours, Sir <hi>Thomas Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
Knight, hath occasion to complain, as he informeth, of the evil deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one <hi>Loen de la Hay,</hi> a Subject of the French King; who being once
our Prisoner of War, and licensed to depart upon his faith, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to redeem and send home freely a son of the said Sir <hi>Thomas Cotten,</hi>
then Prisoner, or else within a time limitted, to return again as his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
hath performed neither of both; besides, a good sum of money
which he lent to <hi>de la Hay</hi> at his departure, yet unpaid: We have thought
good to recommend the same matter unto you; and for the better instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
therein, you shall receive herewith the request of the said Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Cotten,</hi> praying you to take some convenient time to open the
matter to such of the Kings Councel, or to himself, if occasion may
serve, and to such other as you shall think able and well-affected to do
any good therein; and to seek by all good means that some reason
may be had of the said <hi>de la Hay,</hi> in this so plain and justificable a
case; so as our said Servant may have no further cause of Suit to the
King for lack of justice, the partie being well able to pay, as is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>If you shall have any occasion to deal with the Spanish Ambassador there,
you may be bold to shew him of these reports that we hear from Spain; and
if he shall hear of any our preparations by Sea and Land, that the same
is for our defence; and if we shall be offended, we will use them not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for defence, but to offend for our Revenge.</p>

                  <p>HEr Majesties of the tenth of March I received, the vvhich I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
her Majestie hath sundrie vvaies advertisements of the Irish
enterprize; vvhereof as I had cause before to doubt, so have I novv more
cause then before, and therefore am glad to understand that there is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
taken for the vvithstanding of all events that may happen in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
                  <p>It may therefore please your Lordship to signifie unto her Majestie that
the 24 of this moneth, the Archbishop of <hi>Cassels</hi> sent unto me two of his
Servants to know whether he might come to speak with me or no. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
them, that whensoever he would come he should be verie welcome;
and for that he should not lose his labour in coming, I shewed them that he
should find me at home both that day, and the day following. So the next
day, being the 25. he repaired unto me; his first speech tended to his justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for departing out of <hi>Ireland</hi> without her Majesties leave; saying, that
being deprived from his living, and another substitute in his place, who he
confessed to have outraged before his departure, necessitie inforced him to
depart, to seek maintenance some other where; and the rather, for that in
respect of the said o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>trage committed, he hath justly incurred the Lord
Deputies displeasure. I shewed him, that his confession of his fault, was
an argument of penitence. And therefore, that I doubted not, that if he
would seek pardon at her Majesties hands, he should find her Majestie
graciously affected towards him, who hath alwaies been more naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to remit then to revenge. I asked him, how long it was since he
departed out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> He shewed me, that it vvas about two years past.
And after he embarqued for <hi>Spain,</hi> where ever since his departure from
<hi>Nantes</hi> he hath continued, having received ever after his arrival, very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
entertainment at the Kings hands, who yearly gave him 2000 Docats pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
He shevved me nothing of his con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erence he had at <hi>Nantes</hi> vvith L. and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54478:39"/>
the <hi>C.</hi> neither did I seem to understand any thing thereof, but made alwayes
shew unto him, to believe whatsoever he said, as though I had never heard of him
before, nor of his proceedings. I proceeded further with him, and asked, when he
departed out of <hi>Spain.</hi> He shewed me about the latter end of <hi>Ianury.</hi> I told
him, that there were brutes given out here, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had some
intention to invade <hi>Ireland.</hi> I asked him, whether before his departure he
heard any such matter. Then he brake and shewed me, that about <hi>September</hi>
last, one <hi>Stewkley</hi> arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> who after his access to <hi>Madrill,</hi> before he
had conference with the King, or any great Personage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he sent unto the said
Archbishop to desire to come and speak with him. To whom he returned
answer by his Messenger, that if he would come unto him, he should be
very welcome: Whereupon <hi>Stewkley</hi> repaired unto him; and after protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had, how glad he was to see him there, whom he knew to be Catholike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bent, he shewed him, that his intention of his repair into that Countrey,
was to deal with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> about the reducing of <hi>Ireland</hi> unto his
Government, whereby Heresie might be expelled, and true Catholique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
planted; and therefore desired him, for that he was well acquainted
with the Cardinal <hi>Spinoso,</hi> President of the Councel, that he would deal
with him, to procure him access unto the King. To whom he replyed, that
he thought that the King, in respect of the good Amitie between him and
the Queens Majestie, would be loath to deal therein: And further, that he
for his own part, though he desired the Catholique Religion to be there
planted, yet did he mislike of the means, for that he would be loath to see
his Countrey under any other Government then that of the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
and her Successors: And therefore he desired him to hold him excused, in
that he could not, for those respects abovenamed, be a mean to bring him
acquainted with the said Cardinal, President of the Councel. Whereupon
<hi>Stewkley</hi> departed from him, and went to the Duke <hi>Feria,</hi> and him acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the cause of his repair thither, and desired him to procure him access
unto the King. So the said Duke brought him to the King; whom the King,
after conference had with him, used very honourably, and appointed him a
very fair house, and gave him six thousand Docats: And besides that, he
doth give him daily allowance for the maintenance of his table, which he
taketh to be great; for he spendeth at the least Thirty Ducats a day. Two
dayes after the King had conference with the said <hi>Stewkley,</hi> the King sent for
the Archbishop; and asked him whether he did know the said <hi>Stewkley.</hi> To
whom he answered, that he never saw him but here in <hi>Spain;</hi> but by report
he had heard, that he had been a Pyrate on the sea, of life dissolute, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
prodigal, of no substance, neither a man of any great account in his
Countrey; notwithstanding he heard he was a Gentleman born, and descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from a good House. Then the King told him of the offer, that he had
made touching the request of <hi>Ireland;</hi> assuring him, that he had dealt so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his coming with the Irish Nobility, as he should find them ready to
receive such Forces as he should send. He wished the King not to be so light
of belief; for that <hi>Stewkley</hi> was not a man of that credit with the Irish Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to be able to bring any such matter to pass, whom they knew to be but a
shifter, and one who, for the maintenance of his prodigality, seeketh to abuse
all men. With that the King replyed, that besides <hi>Stewkleys</hi> own report
of his ability in that behalf, he was besides recommended to him by his
Ambassador, who willed to credit whatsoever he reported. Upon the
mentioning of the Ambassador, he made a digression; and told me, that
the Ambassador did great hurt in <hi>England,</hi> which he did not learn by hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:54478:40"/>
say, but by sight of his Letters; and therefore wished, that her Majestie would
not long harbour so ill a gest. The grand Prior was at the same time
with the King, and present at the Communication, and said, that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
would be loath that his Countrey should come under the Kings Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which he marvelled at, considering the Kings liberality bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him. To whom he answered, that so far forth as he might with his duty
towards God and his Countrey, the King should find him serviceable at all times
towards him; for whose prosperous estate, for that his calling so required, he
would pray: And so after this Communication had with the King, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
                  <p>Not long after <hi>D. Feria</hi> meeting the said Archbishop, entred into talk with
him, and asked his opinion of <hi>Stewkley.</hi> He answered, that he had made the
King acquainted with his opinion, and that he feared that if the King do deal
with him, he would abuse him. Then <hi>D. Feria</hi> said, that the likelihoods that
<hi>Stewkley</hi> shewed the King of the enterprize, were such, as there were great
cause why the King should imbrace the same. For, saith he, besides the Irish
Nobility, he hath won a great number of the Queens Garison to be at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
as well Souldiers as Captains. If the King, saith the Archbishop, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what he saith, then will there be no great difficulty in the interprize; but
when it cometh to the tryal, it will fall out otherwise. Well, said the Duke, I
perceive you are not willing it should go forward, and therefore you seek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
this Gentleman, whom we honour here with the name of the Duke of
<hi>Ireland.</hi> To that the Archbishop replyed, that that Title and Calling was
more then ever <hi>Ireland</hi> was acquainted withal; and the more strange it will seem
unto them, for that he hath there nothing to take unto. No, saith the Duke
I am sure if he might enjoy his own there, it would well maintain that Calling.
Surely, saith the Archbishop, if the rest of his talk prove no truer then this,
then shall you see the King much abused by him. After this talk passed between
the Archbishop and the Duke, <hi>Stewkley</hi> came and challenged the said Archbishop
(as he saith) and told him, that if he were not as he was, a man of the Church,
he would be revenged of him for the report he made of him. In the end,
after report made of this, talk passed touching <hi>Stewkleys</hi> proceedings, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that the cause of his departure out of <hi>Spain,</hi> was onely that he saw great
likelihood that this enterprize should go forward; and therefore would be loath,
as one descended from the house of <hi>Desmond,</hi> to be suspected by his abode
there, to be a favourer of the said enterprize, hating nothing more then the name
of a Traytor. I told him, that I was very glad to here this talk pass from him;
whereof I promised him not to fail, to make her Majestie privy, hoping that
he meant sincerely touching the practice. I shewed him, that her Majestie
was neither ignorant nor unprovided of the remedy, notwithstanding I did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him that her Majestie could not but take it in good part, if his meaning
and words agreed; both his withdrawing himself from thence, as also, in that
he did discover unto me her Minister here, what he knew touching the same.
I prayed him therefore to use plainness with me; and told him, that if it fall
out otherwise: First, he should be reputed a Traytor, and so little trusted of
those whose turn he should seek to serve; it being held for a common rule, That
a Traytor to his own Countrey, came never to be true to another. Secondarily,
that if he were partaker of the enterprize, the matter was provided for, and so
their attempt not like to take effect, whereby he should grow odious to those
that he should procure to enter into the same. And lastly, I willed him to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
what benefit would grow to <hi>Ireland,</hi> his Countrey, if it should be reduced to
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Government, who doth rule altogether by Tyranny, as divers of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54478:40"/>
the Countreys where they do govern witness, whereof he as a Traveller
could not be ignorant; whereas now, they enjoy as great liberty as any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth; and if there be any defect, it proceedeth fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m themselves, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
yield to imbrace such good orders as her Majestie carefully for their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
hath sought lately to place there amongst them, to reduce them from Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barousness
to Civility. He then protested, that her Majestie should find him
sincere, though he were out of hope of all favour, in respect of his honour, and
the love that he bare to his own Countrey. But, saith he, if it might please
her Majestie so far forth to be my good and gracious Lady and Soveraign, as
for that my Successor is dead, to restore me to my Countrey and Place, I will then
give to you in writing, her Ambassador here, both the manner of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
as also the remedy. I shewed him, that I would not fail to advertise her
Majestie thereof; notwithstanding, I thought good to desire his return at this
present, considering the suspicion conceived of him would breed some doubt
of sincerity; for that it might be thought, that his coming home now was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to give notice to the evil affected Subjects of his Countrey, how things
passed in <hi>Spain,</hi> then otherwise. He replyed, that if he had meant any such
matter, he might have gone directly from <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Ireland.</hi> Then he told me,
that he feared that your Lordship had not conceived very well of him through
<hi>Huggins</hi> report. I made as though I never heard of <hi>Huggins;</hi> and shewed him,
that your Lordship was not one that would lightly condemn any man; and
therefore willed him not to doubt, that if you might find him sincere, none
would be more ready to further him in getting her Majesties favour then your
Lordship. Unasked, he shewed me, that <hi>Huggins</hi> was returned again to Prison,
which thing I seemed not to regard. I asked him vvhen <hi>Stewkley</hi> vvas to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark.
He thought, not much before the end of <hi>April.</hi> I asked him, vvhether
it vvas true, that <hi>Iulian Romer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> vvas appointed to that enterprize. He told me,
that he heard so</p>
                  <p>This vvas in effect the talk that passed betvveen us, vvhich I thought good to
set dovvn at length, to the end that your Lordship might the better judge, both of
the matters, and of the man. For my ovvn opinion, I cannot tell vvhat to think of
him; to suspect that he meaneth not good, faith I have these causes: First, I am
informed, that tvvo Irish men, sent from him out of <hi>Spain,</hi> vvere the cause of
<hi>Roches</hi> enterprize. Secondarily, I am also informed, that he vvas sent for out of
<hi>Spain</hi> by the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain.</hi> Thirdly, for that he vvisheth the young Boy
<hi>Iames Fitzm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rice</hi>'s son, in <hi>Spain,</hi> that is novv at <hi>Brest</hi> in <hi>Brittain.</hi> Lastly, I do
not forget his Nation and Religion. I have placed some especially about him,
to vvhom he repaireth, as also vvho repairs to him. I find the Irish Captain here,
(vvhom I desired my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> to recommend unto her Majestie) ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
in this behalf. It shall go very hard, but I vvill give a great ghess of the
cause of his coming. He desireth to knovv vvithin tvventy daies, hovv her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
inclineth to his request. The onely hope I have of him is, that I imagine that
he mislikes that <hi>Stewkley</hi> should have the glory of the enterprize that they both
pretended, and that he first set abroach, and therefore vvould be glad to do any
thing vvhich might impeach the same.</p>
                  <p>Novv having made your Lordship acquainted vvith that vvhich passed betvveen

                  <p>TRusty and well-beloved, we greet you well; forasmuch as by the Lord of
<hi>Buckhurst</hi> we do understand in what sort the Queen Mother hath moved
unto him the matter of marriage for her son Monsieur <hi>D' Anjou</hi> with us, and
in what sort both the King, her Son, her Self, and Monsieur, being the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
are desirous that the same might take place, and that for the first entry into
the matter in respect of the doubtfulness that is generally conceived of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
determination to marry, that is by the Queen Mother required, that
none might deal there in the same, betwixt them and us, but you as our Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador;
and that with none of their Councel, but with Monsieur <hi>de Foix;</hi> we
have thought meet plainly to inform you, in what sort you shall deal, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but you will so use the same to all respects, as may concern our estimation
in due honour, according to the place we hold, and for the quality of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and sex. And because you shall the more orderly proceed herein, we do
conceive our answer by way of Articles, which we do understand were by him
shewed to the Lord of <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> in writing; as followeth:</p>
                  <p>The first Article of their demand was, to understand, both very speedily and
certainly of the truth of our firm resolution to marry.</p>
                  <p>To which you may constantly answer, that as the Lord of Buckhurst hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
said; so are we resolved, for the benefit of our Realm, and contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Subjects to marry with some person of Kingly blood and quality,
meet for us and our Countrey; and that we are free from all manner of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
to marry where we shall please. And because that we perceive that
notwithstanding the like answer hath been made in our name by some other,
who hath of late time earnestly required to know our mind in this case; yet it
is doubted by sinister reports, that we have not a resolute mind to marry, but
that we have a disposition rather to hear of motions and suits for Marriage with
Princes, and great Estates, then finally to accept any of them, how honourable
or reasonable soever the conditions might be that should be offered. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you shall in times convenient, and as you shall be by some objections pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
say, that we are very sorry that our former dealings in like cases of
Marriage moved to us from other Princes, hath not been better understood on
our behalf, then it seemeth they have been; whereby some prejudice is grown
to make more doubtfulness to be conceived in our Answers, then we mean. For
the alteration of which untrue conceptions, we cannot but generally answer, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it were particularly remembred with vvhat Prince, moving matter of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to us, we did deal doubtfully. And therefore you shall say, that it is not
unknown to the world, for how many Kings, Princes and Estates, motions of
marriage hath been made to us; and if the same were well considered, and our
answers from time to time truly known, certainly there was no cause to mislike
the same, though the motions took no place; neither could any of the
parties think themselves touched in honour by this, though their desires took
no effect.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of our Reign, that is not unknown how vve had no dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of our own nature to marry, no otherwise then it is manifestly known,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54478:41"/>
that vvhen the King our dear Father reigned, and many times pressed us earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to marry; nor vvhen in the late King our Brothers time, the like vvas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevved
unto us; even for such as then presently vvere in real possession of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
vvhen vve lived but in a private state as a daughter, or as a sister of a King,
yet could vve never induce our mind to marry, but rather did satisfie our self with
a solitary life. If also it be considered, vvho they vvere that in the first part of
our Reign motioned marriage unto us, and hovv inconvenient such a match vvas
both for our self, for matter of conscience, and for discontentation of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as then the time vvas, vve doubt not but vve might challenge to our selves
some praise, in that vve yielded not thereto, vvhen all other vvorldly respects
of honour, wealth and greatness, besides the worthiness of the person, were
evident to have provoked us thereto, But therein, and in all other motions of
marriage following, our answers were such, as if they were known with their
circumstances, we would not doubt but to have a general allowance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
for our sinceritie in dealing; as now it seemeth that the world, which
commonly erreth in such reports, hath also erred in this and sundry other things
touching us, which time we doubt not shall make manifest; for truly, whilest
we continued, as it were, settled by natural disposition in a determination not
to marry, we did so also plainly answer all persons, and required that the motions
might be stayed; wherewith if the parties or their Ministers would not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but would continue rather still their motions; what default was this in us?
Yea, it is very true, that some parties being answered by our own mouth, and
that deliberately and frequently, yet would they not accept the same for a final
answer; wherein as we could not but esteem their affection very great towards
us, so truly did we give them no new cause to hope of any change of our mind
to marriage.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, after some course of years passed, we confess that the state of
our Realm, the continual urgent and frequent solicitations, not only of our
Counsellours, to whom we alwaies think meet to give ear, but also of the whole
Estates of our Subjects, being many times assembled in our Parliament, did stir
us to some further consideration by the weight of their reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s, then naturally
of our self we had been induced unto.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we yielded thus far to their importunitie, that for such great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
concerning the universal state of our Realm, as were plainlie laid before
us, we would not refuse to hear of any honourable motions to be made to us for
any person of a Royal blood, that might be meet for us and our Realm; and
that we would commend our heart to be directed by Almighty God, to follow
that which might be to the comfort of our loving Subjects: And this mind
we did continue, and did so far proceed, as reasonablie we might with our
honour, and with regard to the estate of our Policie. And howsoever the world
may mis-judge of prolongation of such matters by us, certainlie the same was
not of any intent in us to continue the same without purpose to conclude: But
such were the terms and difficulties in some points necessarilie to be provided, as
the lack of satisfaction of us therein, was the onelie cause to us known of the
prolongation. All this we find meet at length to impart unto you, to the end
that you may also in like manner thereby, with truth, satisfie the hard opinion,
that as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> seemeth is conceived of us, because it is seen, that many suits hath
been made to us, and by great Estates, for marriage, and none hath taken effect.
And as heretofore of late years, the solicitation of our loving Subjects general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
did induce us, for their sakes, to hearken to motions of marriage, and to
incline our selves thereto: So may you for more assurance of our firm determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to marrie, affirm to them that have judged doubtfullie of us, that we do
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54478:42"/>
now indeed find in our own judgement, upon good respects, the motions of our
people, not only necessary for them, our Realms and Dominions; but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for our selves, so as a person may be offered to us, agreeable for
our honour, and meet for the state and pollicie of our Kingdoms. And thus
much may fully satisfie for justification of our doings against sinister concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and also, for a certainty for our determination, being accompanied with a
further resolution growing of our judgement otherwise then aforetime.</p>
                  <p>The second points is to know, whether now that we have perceived by the
Lord of <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> the good disposition of the King and the Queen Mother to
offer the person of Monsieur, they might be assured of our continuance in this
resolution; and whether we will accept this motion in good part, and will be
pleased to hear further of it.</p>
                  <p>To this you may answer, That for continuance in our resolution generally to
marry, we trust there is no cause to doubt, the things before affirmed being
remembred; and how we will accept this offer of Monsieur, we cannot but plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confess it an argument of great good will in the King, and the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
considering how that the King is married, there can be no greater nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
offer made by the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> then of Monsieur D. Anjou; and
therefore we do thankfully accept it: But whether we shall be pleased to hear
further of this motion, is very doubtful for us to answer thereto; not that we
are ignorant what answer were meet, but that the interpretation thereof may be
conceived otherwise then we mean: And if any impediment shall hereafter just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow of the cause, without our default, the same might be imputed to us,
as others in like cases have been: And surely knowing the wisdom of Queen
Mother and her experience in such causes of matrimonie, we would think, that
without demanding this point of us, she herself can best tell what is meetest to
be further done herein. For now that she knoweth our resolute determination
towards marriage, and with what manner of person, it is to be considered by her,
that if such things as are requisite for the contentation of both our persons, and
for the necessary conditions of the whole cause, shall be found agreeable, then
this offer shall not onely be thankful, but by all good probabilitie take the effect
that is by the offer intended. And if otherwise, there should any just and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
impediment happen, either for lack of satisfaction of our own natural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
concerning our person, or of reasonable accord, upon the conditions
requisite, specially for such as may conserve the state and policy of our Realm;
yet we see not, but the good will of either party should be allowed, as well in
us for yielding to hear and consider of so honourable an offer as for them that
made it. And herein you shall say, that we pray the Queen Mother not to be
over curious in requiring so precise an answer, until the matter may be further
treated upon and explained; and not to think it any touch to the honour of her
Son, to be named a Suitor to us, as others of as great degree have been, though
the motions took no effect, rather for other impediments, then for any mislike
of the persons. And thus much we would have her perswaded, that as we did
at the first honourably forbear to hear of some offers, because the impediments
were at the first beginning manifest, although the persons were worthy to be
liked. So in this cause, if we did perceive any such impediment of weight and
apparence, or that we had conceived by any report, any just cause of misliking
of this offer, we would surely deal plainly with the King and Queen Mother, and
would most heartily thank them for so honorable an offer, and yet give them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
occasion to forbear; And truly we cannot give any ansvver hereto, but leave
this point to the vvisdom of Queen Mother, vvho is not ignorant vvhat is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to such a matter as this is, specially tovvards us, being a Queen never
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54478:42"/>
married, and having Kingdomes to be provided for with reasonable conditions,
for satisfactions of our loving Subjects, whom though we know are so desirous
to have us marry, as they will not mislike of any marriage that may content
us, yet shall we not take such advantage of their free good will but that they
shall plainly understand, that we will joyn with our private satisfaction the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their quietness and surety.</p>
                  <p>The third is not by us dissallowed, that this matter may be treated
upon between you as our Ambassador, and Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> untill
the matter may be brought to more ripeness, so as the King may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hazarding of his honour, send a Noble Ambassador. And yet you
may add as of your self, that you think that the matter would be more
readily expedited, for the mutuall understanding of our minds on both
parties, by sending of some such speciall person as Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi>
upon some other pretence: And if you can so compasse it, we think
many scruples would be avoided, better then can be by Letters sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you; and if <hi>Foix</hi> may come, then shall you do well to advise him
to think of all circumstance aforehand. And yet afterwards the King, if
cause shall so permit, may send an honourable Ambassage for such a
cause.</p>
                  <p>The fourth request is, that we should send to you certain Articles, for
you to declare our intent toward Monsieur, with authority for you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
thereto, so as the King should first deliver to you other Articles for
Monsieur, wherein we cannot but find many difficulties; For how can we
tell what were meet to propound, untill we may understand what shall be
first propounded by them that make the offer?</p>
                  <p>But if they seem not contented with this answer, that then by your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
motion they will not send any person hither, you may say, that if
they will deliver to you their offers and demands, you will promise that
the same shall not be revealed to any person but to our self, and one or
two about us, whose advice we will use. And if you shall be demanded,
what you think would be looked for to be offered, you may say, that
you think no lesse can be offered for conditions, then was by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Charles,</hi> with King <hi>Philip</hi> to Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> And that further,
of necessity it must be specially prejudged, that Monsieur shall not have
Authority to exercise the form of Religion in England, that is prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Laws of our Realm. And though you be not instructed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
yet would we that you should specially open this matter secretly to
the Q. Mother; and though we mean not to urge her Son to any change
of conscience, otherwise then we wish him to be directed to the best,
yet surely we cannot, nor may not give him any authority to have
any exercise in facts of such Rites as are prohibited by our Laws. And
as for his allowance of our Religion, although we wish he might in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
like it (and if he did understand the form thereof, truly we do
not mistrust but he would not mislike it) yet we shall onely require his
presence in our Oratories and Churches. And this you may say, is one of
the matters of greatest importance to be considered by the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The fifth, that this matter should not be opened to the French Ambassador
here Resident, which because it is required may be observed; for surely we
neither to him nor to any other use to deal in such matters, but as we are
provoked. And yet why it should be kept secret we see not, considering
it hath been already moved to us by sundry, and by some that are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54478:43"/>
bound to the Crown of France, and that do think in their conscience
the matter to be both honourable and profitable to the Crown of France.
And you shall say to the Queen Mother, that she shall not mislike of us,
though we think so well of our selves and our estate, that if God shall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this her motion to take effect, it shall be the best marriage for the honour
of the King her Son, for the weal of his Crown, and for the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Q. Mother, that any Q. attempted this many hundred years for
France. And yet we are content to keep this motion secret, according to
the request, meaning to make none other privy to the same, but to such of
our privy Councell as are known we have just cause to trust, both for their
fidelities and secresie, that is, our Cousin the Earle of <hi>Leicester;</hi> whom you
may say, that whatsoever may be otherwise doubted, we find ready to
allow of any marriage that we shall like, and withall marriages with any
Prince' stranger, most of all this with the Crown of France; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is Sir <hi>William Cecill,</hi> Lord of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> and our principall <hi>Secretary,</hi>
and is well known to be a dutifull servant, in any thing meet and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
for us and our Realm, and so may you make report of them
both.</p>
                  <p>The sixth is, that we would not make delay in answer as we doe
not.</p>
                  <p>The seventh to understand, whether we can be pleased that Master <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcant,</hi>
shall be used any further herein, which we remit to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the Q. Mother, he being an honest Gentleman, and to our
knowledge alwaies disposed to do good offices, betwixt us and the Crown,
and therefore not to be dissallowed by us, if the Q. Mother shall like of
him. And yet we require you to have regard that his dealings therein,
considering that he departed lately from hence, may not be conceived as
directed by us. You shall do well to deal warily with the Q. Mother in
the matter of Religion, for the D. her Son, not as we would presse him
to make a change of his Religion, although we wish it. But that if he should
marry with us, that he should not be warranted to do any act contrary to
our Laws.</p>

of Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to advertise her Majestie that hers of the
24 of <hi>March,</hi> I received the 26 of the same: the contents whereof af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had well weighed, and therewithall considered the great practises that
are daily used here, to stop that the match between her Majestie and
Monsieur might not take effect, which lacketh not also any such help as
may from her own subjects there with you be ministred to breed an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in Monsieur that all is but dalliance, and that he is like to march
in the end in rank with the number of the forsaken; whereupon as it
should seem a few dayes past, he used this talk with Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi>
saying, Monsieur, you and others have brought me to yield to this match,
but I feare that by the next dispatch you shall well perceive that there
is no other meaning in the Queen of England but dalliance, and that
you and I shall be sorry that ever we waded so far; And surely said
he, for my own part, unlesse I shall find the answer direct, I will
never enter farther into the matter. These speeches and practises af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
I had well weighed, and seeing the answers in her Majesties
Letters very fit and convenient to be made by her in respect of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54478:44"/>
the quality of her person and sex, had not the world mistaken her former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in marriage matters. But now in respect of the said mistakings fearing
that the same being made according to the course appointed by her Majestie,
would have seemed more doubtfull then direct, and so have utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
the matter; I was very much perplexed what course to take, when
I my self saw it most safe for me to follow the course by her Majestie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
whatsoever came of it. But when I beheld her Majesty first how
she in her own judgement did think it expedient for her to marry: Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
that if her Majestie did mean to marry abroad this was the only Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
fit for her to marry: Thirdly the discontentment of her subjects for not
marrying: Fourthly how presently she is beset with a number of forrain pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
the execution whereof onely stayeth upon the event of this match,
I then resolved that it was most fit for me to forget my self, and to think
onely of her Majestie and of her safety; like that Roman, that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a Law was made that no man should hazard to come on the Wall
without consent of the Magistrate, yet he seeing the enemy preparing for
the scale, and that the delay of time in asking the Magistrates consent might
have hazarded the losse of the City, preferring a publick safety before his
private perill, repaired to the Walls and repulsed the enemy; the matter
afterward being called in question, he was acquited of the penalty, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
a good member of the City: like consideration made me to take this
course following. In my proceeding with Queen Mother somewhat swarving
from the precise course of her Majesties instructions, yet notwithstanding
keeping my self within the compasse of the same with due regard had both
to her Honour and the place her Majestie beareth.</p>
                  <p>Touching the first point I alleadged precisely and wholly what her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
appointed me to say unto her touching the justification of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in causes of marriage; whose answer was, that that she did object
unto my Lord of <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> she objected rather as a common opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
then that her self believed it, being not ignorant that the common
sort, that understand not the secresie of Princes proceeding are alwaies draw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
to believe the worst, But saith she I hope her sincere and direct proceeding in
this now offered match will breed due justification of her former proceedings in
those marriage causes.</p>
                  <p>Touching the second, I shewed her that her Majestie had conceived by my
Lord of <hi>Buckhurst</hi> that she desired to understand whether the King and she
making an offer of Monsieur, the same would be accepted in good part,
at her Majesties hand; of this second point I left out these words Whether she
would be pleased to hear further of it.</p>
                  <p>In answer of this second point I shewed her, from her Majestie, that she
did impute it as an argument of great good will in both her and the
King, considering how that the King being married, there could be no
greater nor worthier offer made by the Crown of France then Monsieur, and
that therefore her Majestie doth most thankfully accept the same; and further
that she willed me to say unto her, that if her Majestie did preceive any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
cause to mislike of the matter, she would then deal plainly with the King
in thanking him for his good will, and in desiring to proceed no further: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
she seemed to be satisfied.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding for that this match did stand upon two necessary points;
the satisfaction of both their persons, and necessary accord upon certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
that therefore her Majestie desir'd her (as a Prince indowed with
kingdomes, could not but with her own private satisfaction have a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54478:44"/>
of her subjects repose and safety by way of Capitulation) that if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
there should grow any just cause of breach, yet that friendship and good
Amitie might still continue, the good will of either party being to be allowed;
their's in making so honourable an offer, and her Majestie in yielding to give
eare to the same.</p>
                  <p>To this she replied, that she could have wished that the answer had been
more direct, not so much for her own satisfaction as for others in whom
there rested as yet some scruple; and the rather (saith she) for that if in
the handling of this Matter there be used plainness, Ceremonies being set
apart, whatsoever issue the matter taketh, yet friendship could not in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
but continue.</p>
                  <p>Then I proceeded to the third shewing her that her Majestie was well
content that I as her Ambassador should treat upon this matter with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Foix;</hi> which course I shewed her in my private opinion would draw
the matter by often sending to and fro to a great length, whereby that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
would not follow thereof that were to be wished. And that therefore
if that they would not follow thereof that were to be wished. And that therefore
if that they would make choise of some speciall person to send over upon
some other pretence with full commission to treat hereof, many scruples
thereby would be avoided, which otherwise might breed delay of time:
And touching the person, I told her none could be more faithfull unto her
Majestie then Monsieur <hi>de Foix.</hi> In this behalf she told me she would first
deal with the King, as also touching the fourth point, how her Majestie
could not tell what to propound untill she saw what was by them first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
who by order were first to propound: and after she had dealt
with the King touching these two points, she promised I should the next
day have answer by Master <hi>Cavalcant,</hi> which she performed, whose answer
was, that for the more expedition the King and she thought it good to
send Master <hi>Cavalcant</hi> both speedily and secretly over, who should come
fully instructed with their resolute intention touching this match, who
thinketh that he shall bring with him the Articles they mean to propound
unto her Majestie; and further, that if upon his return they find her by
her answers fully resolute to proceed, That then for the better ripening
of the matter against the time that an Honourable Ambassadge should be
sent, Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> should come over upon some other pretence.</p>
                  <p>I forbeare at this present to deal touching Monsieurs having the exercise of
his Religion: first, for that they finding her Majesties answers not wholly
resolute would have suspected it for a quarrel of breach; Secondarily, for
that without all suspition in due place it may be be propounded amongst
her Majesties Articles.</p>
                  <p>Touching the first point I forbeare to say any thing for that they mean
sometimes (as I learn) to use their Ambassador there Resident with her
Majestie, as one whom they esteem and trust.</p>
                  <p>I did not forget to tell her that her Majestie for the more secret hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the matter had made choise of two onely Counsellors, unto whom
she had communicated the matter; the one the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> whom
she findeth well to allow of any marriage which her Majesty liketh, though
otherwise wrongfully doubted, so specially of this that is now in Treaty.
The other the Lord of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> of whose fidelity her Majestie hath had
tryall ever since she came to her Crown.</p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o this she answered, that these two Councellors being of her Majesties
choise, she would not but very well allow of; and as for my Lord of Leicester
she said she had many waies good cause to judge him a furtherer of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54478:45"/>
match, and therefore was glad of her Majesties choise, and hoped thereby of
the better successe.</p>
                  <p>The last point concerning Master <hi>Cavalcant,</hi> she said she thought him fit
to deal in it as one that before time had done good offices between the
two Crownes, and therefore she rather wished him to be admitted a Dealer.</p>
                  <p>I may not omit here to say mine opinion of him, which is that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
could not have allowed a Gentleman more faithfully inclined to her
Majestie, nor more fit for his discretion and secresie to deal in a matter of
such consequence.</p>
                  <p>In the end having finished this point, to leave the better taste with her of
the matter, I concluded, being so warranted by my instructions, that if this
motion of hers should take effect, the like never happened these many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares in respect of the great profit that would redound to both the
Realms.</p>
                  <p>To this she answered, that as she never desired any thing with like earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as she did this, so if the same should not take place nothing could more
grieve her. For (saith she) besides the great benefit that will grow hereby
unto both the Crowns, on the successe of this match dependeth the quietness
of all Europe.</p>
                  <p>This being all the talk that passed between Queen Mother and me. I
leave to trouble your Lordship any further, humbly taking leave.</p>

                  <head>To my very friend Sir Fr. Walsingham Ambassador for the Queens
Majestie in France.</head>
                  <p>I Have upon the receipt of your Letter, written by Sir <hi>E. Gilbert,</hi> dealt with
her Majestie touching your chargeable dwelling there; I trust her Majestie will
have due consideration thereof.</p>
                  <p>You shall perceive by her Majesties Letters her further pleasure touching
Monsieur, whose cause hath been broken to her by my Lord of <hi>Buck,</hi> from the
Queen Mother: we perceive they deal very daintily, and doubt much her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
intention to marriage, at least, that she had rather hear of it then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it. But assuredly I do verily believe her Majesties mind herein is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then it hath been, and more resolutely determined then ever yet at
any time before: yet doe they mean to deale so secretly on that side, as
though they will not yet believe it. And accordingly her Majestie mindeth
not to deal but as privatly as may be devised, that if that should not take
effect, the lesse reproach is to either party: her Majestie hath onely broken
this matter with my Lord of <hi>Burleigh</hi> and me, and I think will not use any
more till some apparance fall out what is like to become of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>The person of Monsieur is very well liked of, his conversation is harder to
know. I see her Majestie misliketh not of his estate; For she is of mind
to marry with the greatest, and he is left almost alone the greatest to be had.
The conditions will be all: wherein I am right glad, and we are bound to
thank God to see her Majestie so well to stand to the maintenance of the
cause of Religion: For as there will be no great difficulty in respect of his
person and estate to cause a marriage between them, so yet I perceive with
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54478:45"/>
the impeachment any way of the true Religion here now established, she will
for no cause deal with him, as you may perceive by her Majesties own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to you. Albeit she doth not mean in respect of his policy, to drive him
in open shew in the mean time to renounce his own profession; but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,
that if they should match, then wholly to maintain this aswell pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly
as publiquely. God send her Majestie alwaies during her life so to stand
to the defence of so just a cause, and withall, his blessings upon her for us all,
that we may live and see her bring forth of her own body, as may hereafter
suceed her aswell in that happinesse, as in the enjoyning of her kingdome. So
not doubting but we shall shortly hear from you, I commit you to God.</p>

conferre with you, and to utter unto you certain things from us, wherein
you shall give him credit and also to procure from the King our good Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

likewise to return; wherein we pray you to use some diligence to obtain
the same for our said servant as (you can consider) the cause doth require,
we have instructed this said bearer of the Queen of Scots cause, and have
willed him to impart the same to you; and having well conceived it, we
would have you there to let the Queen Mother understand so much thereof
as shall be meet, that she may know our sincere dealing therein. And in your
speech to her, you may say, that we do somewhat marvell, that she doth so
often sollicite and presse in the said Queen of Scots cause, considering that we
have not omitted to do any thing for her benefit, which time and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity

                  <p>AFter I had sealed up my other Letters with Mr. <hi>Cobham,</hi> I received yours
of the 18 by Mr. <hi>York,</hi> whereof I thought good to give you knowledge.
I am also to ascertain you, that although the contrary may be reported, my
Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> finding just occasion thereto, doth by all good means, to
my knowledge, further the marriage; and therefore I think it reason that
by such good means as your self may think meet, both the Q. Mother
and Monsieur <hi>de Anjou</hi> might understand his disposition, so as he may be
well thought of herein. And if he find that his doing may be liked there
(if God be content with the cause) it is very probable that it may take effect:
you see how plain I deal with you, and the rather, because I find by my
Lord of <hi>Buckhurst,</hi> that upon the hope you have of the amendment of
Monsieur in Religion, you do not mislike of the matter: Surely if Monsieur
be not rooted in opinion of evill Religion, as by his young years it is not
likely, there might be argument made that marriage here with England would
be becoming a Professor of the Gospel: considering the towardness of him to
be a Martiall Prince, he may prove a Noble Conquerer of all Popery in
Christendome, with such aids as may joyn with him in the Empire, and other
where. I wish he were capable of such a designe: You see still the more
I write the more open I am; and yet considering the trust I have in your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie
I trust nothing hereof shall have light to do me any hurt, and so it is

                  <p>THis bearer shall make you Lordship acquainted with the present state of the
matter, which of credit you committed to his report, at his last being with
you; and as at that time I did most earnestly request your Lordship, that if

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
So I cannot but renew my said request, for surely in this my service, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would more grieve me then that they of the Religion, whom I wish
chiefly to further, should receive by me any hinderance: Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
your Lordship most earnestly so to use it, as thre may grow to them
rather helpe then hurte; on at the least, if there be no likelihood that that
will fall out that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> be desired, which is help, yet that the other might be
avoided, which is hurt.</p>
                  <p>And although it be my office to advertise and not to advice, yet I shewed your
Lordship at my departure, that I vvould presume sometime as a private man,
and not as one that beareth a publique office, to write my private opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such accidents as should happen here, which I do assure my self that your
Lordship will keep privately unto your self, whom I am bound to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
vvith my follies, in respect of your promise, to admonish me of my faults.</p>
                  <p>Reasons in pollicy to give aid secretly, I see to be these, by consideration of
the Circumstance of the time:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54478:46"/>
First, in respect of the Spanish practise against <hi>Ireland,</hi> thereby to divert them
from the said enterprize.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, in respect of the likelihood that there will grow wars, if the
practise go forward between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> whereby <hi>England</hi> shall live the
quietlyer.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That if the M. go forward, then shall it be annexed unto
<hi>England,</hi> for that it is meant that M. shall be the head of the enterprize,
if the matter in the beginning take good success, which in reason cannot do
otherwise, especially if <hi>England</hi> win in the same, by reason of the Match;
and surely in my opinion, no one thing will sooner draw Monsieur to encline to
Religion, then the hope of F 6.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, that whereas it is thought, that amongst other Articles in the
Treaty of the Marriage, he will request some yearly pension, if God should
take away her Majestie, he having no issue by her, he may be perswaded by
her Majestie, giving assistance in the said enterprize, to content himself with
such a portion as shall fall unto him by Conquest; for that her Majestie
assisting, full account is made that Spain, the Inhabitants of the Low-Countries,
being quite aliened from him, as they are, shall not be able to defend the
same. And so desiring your Lordship to pardon this my swerving from
my function; which, as I said before, is onely to advertise, I most humbly take

                  <p>SIthence my last Letters unto your Lordship, touching the Archbishop of
<hi>Cassels,</hi> I have thus proceeded; I procured Captain <hi>Thomas</hi> the Irish man to
repair unto the said Archbishop, and to do him any friendship and service, he
might here shew him in this Court, in respect he was a Nobleman, and of his
Countrey; which being at my request, he willingly did: And the Archbishop
seemed to take the same in very good part at his hands; whereupon he desired
the Captain to procure him access unto the Cardinal of Lorrain. And so not
long after he accompanied him to the Cardinal of Lorrain; who talked with
him the space of two hours: but what Communication passed between him
and the said Cardinal, he could not draw from him; yet thus much he signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him, after his departure from him, that hereafter there might
be some occasion offered to imploy him to some good service; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he should do very well to make such report of him, as that he might grow
in credit here; and further, that he should say, that the Archbishop was a man of
a noble family, and of great reputation in his Countrey, that <hi>Ireland</hi> of it self
was but weak, and easie to be gotten by the Enemy, and such like talk to
this effect. After the Captain had made me privy hereof, my counsel was,
that he should bear the Archbishop in hand to do so; nevertheless, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
him, that unto the Cardinal he should report, namely, that true it was,
that he was of a noble familie, and allyed to the best in that Countrey, yet
of no such credit and reputation, whereby he might be able to do much in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54478:47"/>
his Countrey, for that the heads of the house of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>smond,</hi> whereof he was
descended were under guard in <hi>England.</hi> And if he should enquire of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> that he should say, it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot so weak as the Archbishop reported
it to be; but that whosoever should attempt any thing against it, should
find it able enough to resist a multitude, now that her Majestie had caused
Garrisons, and appointed certain ships to go on the seas. Two days after
the Captain was sent for by the Cardinal; and being demanded, what manner
of man the Archbishop <hi>was,</hi> of what estimation in his Countrey, in what
case <hi>Ireland</hi> stood in, &amp;c. answered to every point as I required him. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
which time, I learn, that the Cardinal maketh not that account of
the Archbishop that he looked for at his hands. And therefore consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Archbishop cannot take effect here, and that he is in some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
(as by Letters he wrote to the Cardinal of late I perceived) I think
he would easily be gotten to utter such things as he knoweth of this Spanish
Enterprize, so he might be well assured of the Queens Majesties favour, and
be restored to his former living. I have appointed another Irish Souldier to
give attendance on him, and to mark diligently whither, and to whom he
resorteth; what company in like sort come unto him, and to certifie me
thereof. Thus much have I learned of his proceedings since his coming to
Paris, especially through the Irish Captains means, who hath dealt very
dutifully in this behalf; and hath been so ready to do what I willed him, as
I cannot but recommend him unto your Lordship. He is very honest, and
civil; and one that hath taken profit with these Civil Wars here, besides
of good Parentage, breed and born in the English pale. Sir <hi>Henry Norris</hi>
hath heretofore had tryal of him; we both have promised him, in respect of
his dutifulness (as one worthy the entertaining) to be a means unto her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
for him; and so of late, in respect of this imploying of him, have
taken upon me to assure him, that he shall receive some comfortable words
from her Majestie; and therefore I am to desire your Lordship to move her
Majestie therein.</p>
                  <p>The 29 of <hi>March</hi> the Archbishop sent one of his men to me, willing me
to send some trustie servant of mine, to whom from time to time, he might
communicate the Spanish Enterprize, and so gave me knowledge thereof; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whom passed this speech following:</p>
                  <p>After ordinary salutations done, I shewed him that your Lordship willed me
to signifie unto him, that you had written to the Queens Majestie in his
behalf; and that you hoped shortly to receive some answer; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
receipt had thereof, you would not fail to advertise him. Further,
that you willed him to deal plainly with you, as you for your part mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to deal honourably with him; and that if it pleased him to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
your Lordship of any thing, either by word of mouth, or by writing,
that you promised of your honour to to keep the same with all secresie, and
that you offered your self most ready to pleasure him in any thing that you
could do for him.</p>
                  <p>I thank my Lord Ambassador, quoth he, in that it pleaseth his
Lordship thus honourably to deal with me; and if that by his good means
I may be brought into my Princess's favour, and enjoy my living, I
should think my self most bound unto him; and besides, make him
privie of all <hi>Stewkleys</hi> practises. The onely cause of my coming out of
Spain, was to obtain license to return into my Countrey with my
Princess's favour, if it might be, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>schew the name of a Traytor;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54478:47"/>
although one <hi>Huggins</hi> (whom for certain unseemly words he used against Mr.
—the Queens Majesties Ambassador) I reprehended hath written divers
Letters to Master Secretarie <hi>Cecil</hi> and the rest of the Councel, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
them against me, as that they have me in great suspicion. After
this he asked me whether I knew if any should be sent into Spain about this
matter. I told him, I knew not. Yes, quoth he, your Lordship told him
so. I answered, that it might well be so, but that I knew nothing thereof.
Well (saith he) it is more then time that she did send, both for that the
Queens Majestie hath many Traytors in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the Irish men and
English Souldiers there; and also, because the King of Spain doth what
he can to win the French Kings Brother on his side. And surely, saith
he, if the match go not forward between her Majestie and Monsieur,
it is to be feared that he will joyn with the King of Spain in that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
                  <p>I told him, that the common report was here, that Mounsieur did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in all things with the King; and that the King himself had made such
Protestations of Amitie and Friendship towards the Queens Majestie, as
that he, in respect of his honour, would not, nor any of his Subjects,
for fear of his displeasure, durst not attempt any thing to infringe the same.
Well (saith he) I beseech God they may long continue in Amitie. In
the mean time I will remain here as one not known, until I know her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties,
pleasure. If I might go into my Countrey with her good leave and
license, I doubt not but what I could do much good there, for that the
most part of the Nobility are of some affinity with me; and will, I am
assured, be much ruled by my counsel. If I cannot obtain this benefit
at her Majesties hands, after I have dispatched my business here, I will
return into Spain, where I have been most honourably entertained at the
Kings hands; having had, during the time of my abode there, besides two
two thousand Ducats for my annual pension, sometimes one hundred Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats,
sometimes two hundred Ducats, and sometimes three hundred Ducats,
when the Court did remove, And to this end, saith he, have I left four of
my train at Nantes in Brittain, with some part of my goods, to the end
that if I go into <hi>England,</hi> I might send for them hither; if not, I might
take them with me when I go into Spain. He told me further, that
<hi>Fitzmorice'</hi> s son was at <hi>Morles</hi> in Brittain; that <hi>Stewkley</hi> had sent one out
of Spain, to learn what he did there, and to discredit him, if it were
possible. That the Duke <hi>D'alva</hi> hath offered thirty thousand Ducats for
the Earl of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> ransome. And so fearing that I have over
troubled your Honour, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>TRustie and well-beloved we greet you well; we have perceived by your
Letters written to the Lord of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> in what sort you have lately
conferred with an Irish man, naming himself the Archbishop of <hi>Cassels,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion sought by him to make his submission and suit to us for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in departing out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And considering the conditions of the
party, and the profit that might follow by his discovering of the practices
wherewith he is so throughly acquainted, we can be content, that if you shall
find it likely that he meaneth dutifully to ask pardon, as he pretendeth by his
speech, that then you shall give him comfort to continue with the same duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and loyal meaning, and provoke him to make repair hither into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
where you may assure him, he shall not find lack of grace, if he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
desire it, and by his truth hereafter deserve it. And if you find him very
difficult to be perswaded with such general speech, without further assurance
from us; you shall say, that you have written so effectually unto us, with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirmation
of your good liking of his dealing with you in so plain terms, as he had
done; as ye have power from us to warrant him to come into this our Realm
safely, and to make his means unto us for our favour: If he shall shew himself
repentant of his former fault, and disposed to live hereafter dutiful, he shall
be provided of as good a living as heretofore he hath had. And if he shall not
obtain our favour as he desireth, at his coming, your warrant shall serve him
to return safely out of our Realm; which manner of usage, you shall say, is very
rare in us, but upon your instance we have yielded thereunto. And so we pray
you use it, and give him warrant under your hand accordingly. And if you
shall find that he hath sought to abuse you, as we perceive by your Letters you
have some reason to doubt, then shall you forbear to deal with him in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
sort; and yet procure so much intelligence as you may at his hands; and
after you shall discover his continuance in falshood and practise there, as you
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54478:48"/>
can see occasion, and can gather matter against him, so deal with the King
there, as by all good means that may be, specially considering the Amitie so
often, of late time, assured to us by the King, he may be delivered as an open
known Rebel and Traytor, especially in these practises used by him in <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>n,</hi>
however he himself hath discovered his evils, with the excuses. And we
have some cause the more to doubt his lewdness there, for that <hi>Rogers,</hi> who
brought your Letters, reported, that after he was come from <hi>Paris,</hi> about
St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> he met with an Irish man; who told him, that this Archbishop
had been secretly at the Court, and was readie to be dispatched away into <hi>Spain,</hi>
by the means of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> which if it were true, we cannot
think but you have within a short time after been made privie hereof by the
Irish man. And so according as you shall find the matter, we leave it to your
discretion.</p>
                  <p>The Scotish Ambassadors, who have been here with us, the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi>

                  <p>BEfore the receit of her Majesties, bearing date the eighth day of <hi>April,</hi>
the Archbishops enterprize offered up to this State, through the discreet
usage of the Irish Captain, was quite overthrown. For the same day that he
should have conference with Monsieur about the matter, the said Captain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the Archbishop to send him unto Monsieur, to know when it would
be his pleasure that he might wait upon him, and so he according repaired un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Monsieur. Monsieur asked him divers questions touching the situation of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> the manner of the Government of the same, to whom it appertained,
and divers other such like questions: At the length he asked him, if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
were fruitful; and what commodity the Q. Majestie received by the same.
Whereunto he answered, that the Countrey was very poor, and that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
was at continual and yearly charges in keeping of the same, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
any commoditie from thence. Then he asked him, what the Bishop
was. He answered him, that he was banished out of his Countrey for certain
disorders there committed. And that sithence his departure from thence, he
hath been in divers Countreys, seeking at Princes hands such relief as he might
get, bearing them in hand, that he is able to do much in his Countrey. And
after that Monsieur had heard this report, giving him credit, as one whom he
knew; he willed him to tell the Arthbishop, that he doubted that he should
not be at any leisure to confer with him, being now entertained in Counsel with
matters of great wait; and further to say unto him, that if he did lack any thing,
upon knowledge thereof given, he would be a mean unto the King for the
same: Whereupon the Bishop by his Letters made Monsieur acquainted with
his poverty, and order was taken that he had sent him two hundred Crowns.
This I thought good to set down unto your Lordship at large, for two respects;
the one, to the end you might the better know the Archbishop; the other,
for that there may be by your good means unto her Majestie, some considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had of this Irish Captain, who from time to time hath been a very good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
for the discoverie of the practises against <hi>Ireland,</hi> which he hath done
with the hazarding of his life, if his dealing with me, or with Sir <hi>Henry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
                     </hi>
were known. I have taken upon me to put him out of doubt, that this service
of his will not be unconsidered by her Majestie. Surely, my good Lord, if when
we promise in these causes consideration, and no regard be had thereto, neither
can those of my calling promise reward; nor they to whom we promise, give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to our words, when no fruits follow. I beseech your Lordship, therefore, deal
earnestly with her Majestie in this behalf: he, without respect of this present ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
as I have before written, deserveth entertainment, in respect of his sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and hability to serve her Majestie through the skill he hath gotten by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
had of these latter wars here.</p>
                  <p>After the receipt of her Majesties Letters of the eighth of April, according to
the charge given me in them. I dealt with the Archbishop in respect of the
secret practises he promised to reveal: Such perswasions as I could, I used to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
him to make his repair into <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gland,</hi> shewing him that her Majestie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
grace and pardon, if he would humbly desire it at her hands, and purposed
by his dutiful loyal meaning hereafter, to deserve it. And to the end that he
should not doubt of her Majesties sincere dealing herein, I offered him my safe
conduct, having authority from her Majesties so to do, to warrant him to go
safely into the Realm, thereby to obtain her Majesties favour, with more safety
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54478:50"/>
of his person, and to return in like case safely out of the Realm, if he should
misuse the same: whereunto he once willingly accorded; but afterwards, by
what sinister counsel I know not, he changed his mind; in the end he came to
this issue, that unless it would please her Majestie to grant him this rude request,
which also I send your Lordship, signed with his own hands, he would never
return either into <hi>England,</hi> or into <hi>Ireland.</hi> I told him, that it became not
a Subject, and an offendor, as he was, to stand in such terms with his Prince,
but with humble submission, and acknowledging of his fault, to crave pardon,
and to esteem this favour offered as rare; and not to be refused, but with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to be received. If it shall please her Majestie to grant him his pardon,
his request is, that he might have knowledge thereof within these twenty
dayes; for that otherwise, he is minded to repair again into <hi>Spain.</hi> At this
present he is gone to <hi>Nantes</hi> in <hi>Brittain,</hi> there to dispatch certain businesses, as
he saith, promising to return, and not to depart out of this Countrey these
twenty days.</p>
                  <p>The 19 of this month there arrived here two Gentlemen named <hi>Conniers,</hi>
and one other named <hi>Beamont,</hi> who said they imbarqued at <hi>Newcastle</hi> the 12

departed by Post into <hi>Flanders.</hi>

may conclude with assurance, that the revealing of their intent to you, shall
in no wayes by our means prejudice their purpose. And so we pray you use
the matter, as they report our answer to the best; we mean, with expedition
to return Mr. <hi>Cavalcant</hi> thither with so much of our resolution as we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently

                  <p>HEr Majesties answer contained in her Letters, bearing date the 13 of <hi>Aprill,</hi>
I delivered unto the party, who awaited for the same, using the best
words I might to breed contentation. The reply was, that he hoped the suit
being so small, the surety offered sufficient, and the benefit that thereby
might have risen unto her Majestie so great, that the same would not have
been denied; for saith she, Let her Majestie assure her self, that Spain will
never forget the arrest of the money, which she shall find when occasion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
shall be offered.</p>
                  <p>They do here with great desire expect Mr. <hi>Cavalcants</hi> coming, and as I judge
by some Letters received from their Ambassador, they conceive great hope to
proceed; certain speech passed between <hi>Tilligney</hi> and the King, which I have
imported to my Lord of <hi>Leicester,</hi> maketh me think that the Religion will be
no let, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>SEeing her Majestie hath good liking to proceed, as appeareth by your

certain speech lately passed, between the King and <hi>Tillign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y,</hi> that Religion
will not be the let, which is the chiefest thing I respect in this match.</p>
                  <p>About an 8 dayes past, the King entring into talke with him concerning
this match, <hi>Tilligney</hi> shewed him, that it seemed strange to the world, that
Monsieur (considering that this matter was in treaty) grew every day more
suspicious then the other. To that the King replied, That his Brother (if
there fell out no other let but Religion) would be ruled by him; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(saith he) I may the better bring the matter to passe, I will have my
Brother with me out of this Town, and divide him from certain super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
Fryers, that seek to nourish this new holiness in him; And I doubt
not (saith he) within these few dayes so to work my Brother, as he will yield to
any thing that I will require.</p>
                  <p>Two dayes after the King called again <hi>Tilligney</hi> unto him; and asked him,
whether he lately had any talk with his Brother. He shewed him, that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54478:51"/>
the same day at dinner, Monsieur called him unto him, whose whole course of
talk was onely in commendation of the Q. Majestie, and of the great desire he
had to have so happy and so honorable a match; whereby (saith <hi>Tilligney)</hi> I see
him so farre in, as I hope he will not make any difficulty at Religion, which
will be the chiefest matter the Queen will stick in. No (saith the King) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
my Brother well, &amp; you shall see him every day lesse superstitious then other.</p>
                  <p>This I thought good at large to set down, aswell in respect of the match;
as also, that your Lordship may see the great hope that may be gathered by this
speech, of the Kings revolt from Papistry.</p>
                  <p>Surely, I am of opinion, that if this match go forward, it will set the triple
Crown quite aside. According to your Lordships request, I have sent you this

                  <p>RIght trusty and welbeloved we greet you well, you shall understand that the
French Ambassador and <hi>Cavalcant</hi> having speciall credit to move to us the
matter of marriage with Monsieur <hi>de Anjou,</hi> have propounded to us certain
Articles in French, whereof you shall herewith receive a Copy, To the which
after some conference had by our commandment betwixt our Councellors the
Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Burleigh</hi> for us, and the said Ambassador
and <hi>Cavalcant</hi> of the other party, our said Councellors have delivered such
answers in writing to them, as also we send you herewith. In the debating
whereof, the Ambassador hath with great earnestness, misliked sundry of them in
this manner following; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat in the first he maketh doubt, that the usage of the
matrimony by the orders of this our Realm, may contain matters which should be
repugnant to the Dukes conscience, and namely, that he should at that time be
urged to receive the Sacrament according to the institution of this our Church
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54478:52"/>
whereupon, such words as are now at the last agreed in the answer, we think
ought and doth satisfie them, though he pretend still some doubt; And yet if
by the answer they there shall not be satisfied, then you may do well to impart
to Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> the very order of the Book for that cause; And though
the receiving of the Sacrament at that time, be in some part there mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
yet that being not out of necessity, you may of your self give them
some cause to hope, that it may (for reasonable respect) be forborn, and
so they shall have reason to be content with it. The clause to have the
Dukes Ministers in, was inserted upon such motion made by the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador.</p>
                  <p>In the second he hath found most difficulty, for that by our answer he
saith no grant is made by us, that the Duke shall have liberty for himself and
his domestiques to use his own Religion; which he saith he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
but to be permitted withall these cautions and conditions; That he
should use his Religion in secret place and manner, and with such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection,
as thereby no manner of publique offence should grow to our
Subjects; but hereto he could not have us yield, being answered, That
we doubted not but that Monsieur <hi>de Anjou,</hi> would (by the advice of
Queen Mother) be contented with our answers, being well weighed; in that
we are content that by no means he, nor his Domestiques shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to use the Rites of our Religion; otherwise then shall be agreeable
with his conscience;</p>
                  <p>But as for exercise of his own Religion, being specially forbidden by our
Laws, we cannot without manifest offence and perill to our State accord
thereto. And so we would have you to use all good perswasions to induce
them to be content with our answer in this behalf: for the better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
whereof you may require, that it may be considered what perill it
might be to the quietness of our State to have one that should be our husband
(by his example in our house) to give comfort to our Subjects that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
are well devoted to obey our Laws, to break them; which may so
fall out in processe of time, as we might repent that ever we had been so
evill advised. And therefore specially you shall require Queen Mother to
have good consideration hereof, as one that by her own experience of
Government hath tasted of no small trouble growing by such permission,
although she have now at length prudently brought a stay in the Realm;
and in any wise you shall give them no other comfort in this behalf, but return
to us their answer.</p>
                  <p>The third Article is agreeable to the like Article, conceived in a treaty
of marriage betwixt King <hi>Philip,</hi> and our late Sister Q. <hi>Mary;</hi> so as thereto
no exception hath been made by the Ambassador.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, though it was misliked by the Ambassador; yet it cannot
be otherwise by us ordered, and so the Ambassador was peremptorily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
                  <p>The fifth, though it did not like the Ambassador, for that there is no
expresse sum of yearly revenues named to be allowed to the Duke, yet he
hath accepted it with generall words. And herein to maintain our answer, you
may truly affirm, that King <hi>Philip</hi> had no manner of thing allowed him,
but sustained all his own charge, and gave also to Noblemen, Gentlemen, and
Yeomen of our Nation good entertainment.</p>
                  <p>In the sixth, the Ambassador hath alledged no misliking, but on our part
you may see by the latter part of the Article, that it is meet that we should
know the interest that the Duke hath in his severall Dominions, and how
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54478:52"/>
the same are to succeed to his children, as well Sons as Daughters, if
there be no Sons; and so you shall require a particular answer thereto.</p>
                  <p>The seventh is agreeable to the like clause of an Act of Parliament, whereof
you shall receive better information in another writing, containing such
thing as on our part are to be demanded. And yet the Ambassador hath ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
required, that if the Duke should overlive us, and have a child living,
that should be Heir to the Crown, he might continue the Title of a King,
with his addition to be called <hi>Rex pater;</hi> and if no child should be living, that
then he may be called <hi>Rex dotarius,</hi> which we think rather of matters of
form then of substance, and meeter to be thought of when greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are accorded, then now; and so we have forborn to alter the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</p>
                  <p>In this sort you see the manner of our answers. And although by our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
yesterday we signified unto you, that we would give some instructions
how to propound other things to our benefit, and so we did also let the
French Ambassador understand; yet upon some better consideration, we
have forborn, thinking it meet, that this matter concerning the point of
Religion, were first on both parties determined, before we should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the rest; for this being accorded, there is no great difficulty in
the rest; and this being not accorded to our contentation, the rest are not
to be dealt in; and if it be misliked that we do not give you Commission to
propound other things, as perchance the Ambassador here will give them some
hope that we now meant to do, you may confesse, that we have indeed consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of other things requisite, wherein we think there will rest no difficulty.
But we hold it most agreeable to the Queen Mothers own intention, that
the matter might be so dealt in, as it might speedily appeare what were to
be hoped of herein. And considering this matter, for the Religion seemeth
of such substance, as none of the rest is, we think it best to have this first
treated of; And so either to proceed or forbear, wherein, we trust our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
shall well appeare. And so we would have you to expresse our good
meaning.</p>

                  <p>SIr, after I had written my other Letters yesterday, there happened some
alteration in this great matter of moment; Where the Queens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54478:54"/>
Majestie had determined (besides her answer to the French Articles) to
have also sent you certain other Articles to be demanded of them there,
whereby the whole cause should be opened, and nothing left behind in silence;
so that both parties might have understood their mutuall intentions. Now
suddainly her Majestie hath thought good at this time to send onely the French
Articles, and her answers, and for the rest she meaneth to reserve untill she
may understand how her answers are taken, and specially how the knotty
point of Religion will be smoothed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the cause of this change (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture)
groweth of some late intelligence brought thence, that if the Queens
Majestie will stand earnestly upon that point for Religion, it shall be assented
unto, which causeth her to proceed thus confidently. And for my part, I
wish most heartily that it may so succeed, but that onely I must fear, except
you shall moderate the matter better, they there will imagine that this matter
of Religion is but projected to colour the delay in breaking off; for indeed
in like cause so did the Emperor for his Brother the Arch-Duke <hi>Charles.</hi> As
I cannot instruct you how to dissolve this doubt there, but as cause shall be
given; So, I know your wisdome sufficient to invent sufficient answers to
mollifie their hard conceits. Thus you see how inwardly I deale with you,
and trust you will so use it. I find Mr. <hi>Cavalcant</hi> very well disposed and sorry
to see these occasions given, though surely he seeth here the Queen Majesties
disposition directly to his contentation.</p>

out of this Town, the one to St. <hi>Disier,</hi> the other to <hi>Monceaux</hi> to bring the
Duke, and Dutchess of <hi>Lorrain</hi> onward on their way. It was agreed between us
that he should repaire the next morning to <hi>Monceaux</hi> to Queen Mother,
there to deliver her Majesties Letters as also her answers to the Articles
propounded by the King. Touching his proceeding with her I referre your
Lordship to his own Letters. By him I understood at his return that Queen
Mother would speak with me, at her repaire to the Town, if I had any
thing to say unto her; So the 26 of this moneth she repaired hither, and
for that during the time of her abode here she could have no leasure, she
sent me word that the next day in the morning I should repaire unto her, to

honour of my Son, so far forth, that if he should yield thereto, the Queen
your Mistress should also receive some part of the blemish, by accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a husband such a one as by sudden change of Religion might
be thought through worldly respects void of all Conscience and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>I replyed, that I was willed to say to her from her Majestie, that she
doubted not but that Monsieur her Son by her good perswasion would
take in good part her said answers, who meant not such sudden change of
Religion, as that he or his houshold should be compelled to use the Rites
of the English Church, contrary to his or their Consciences: But forasmuch
as the granting unto him the exercise of his Religion, being contrary to her
Laws, might by an example breed such an offence as was like to kindle
such trouble as lately reigned in <hi>France,</hi> whereof both herself and her son
had good experience. She therefore hoped, that he who (if the match pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded)
was to sail with her in in one ship, and to run with her one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
would not require a thing, that she by no means could yield to,
who tendred nothing more then the quiet and repose of her Subjects, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in respect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hereof, could by no means consent to any such permission, as
might by any likelihood disturb the same.</p>
                  <p>To this she replyed, that the not having the exercise, was as much as to
change his Religion; which thing he could not do upon a sudden, without the
note to be of no Religion; which dishonour I am sure no respect can
draw him to endanger himself. And as he in respect of the said ignominie,
is resolved fully not to yield, so can I with no reason perswade him thereto;
and as for any peril that may happen by the same, I think it shall be the
best way of safety of your Mistress, who alwayes by the way of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
sword, should be the better able to correct any such evil Subjects
as should go about to disturb the repose and quiet of her Estate, which
she may assure herself he will do, without having respect to any Religion,
whereof some tryal lately hath been made by his consenting with the
King, to have some good justice and example of punishment done at
<hi>Roan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In answer whereof, I besought her to consider as well the Queens damage,
as her sons honour. I shewed her, that of this permission great mischiefs
would ensue: First, the violating of her Laws. Secondarily, the offence of
her good and faithful Subjects. And lastly, the encouragement of the evil
affected: Which three mischiefs if you will weigh, said I, together with
your Sons honours, you shall finde them of great moment; and that
the Queens Majestie my Mistress hath great cause to stand to the denial of
any such permission, whereof is likely to ensue such manifest peril. And
as for the ayd of the Kings sword, I shewed her, that the example by
permission, would do much more hurt then either his own or his Brothers
sword could do good, for that the issue of our mischief by civil dissention,
falls out commonly to be sudden and short, but very sharp, and were not drawn
in length, as those that happened in other Countreys, we having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
walled Towns nor Fortresses to retire to, thereby to protract our
Wars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:54478:55"/>
To this she answered, that her Son would soon be overcome by the
Queens perswasions in that behalf, who was more zealous then able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Religion, whereby the same inconvenience of example will not long
last. For, saith she, it is generally feared by the Catholiques, that this
match will breed a change of Religion throughout all Europe. In the
end she concluded, that neither Monsieur, her Son, nor the King,
nor herself could ever yield to any such sudden change for any respect
whatsoever, neither could her Majestie desire it, considering how much it
would touch his reputation, whom she is to match withal if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <p>I asked then of her, whether she would have me so to advertise her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie.
She desired me in any cause so to do; and to know directly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by yielding or not yielding to the said second Articles with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
cautions, she meant to proceed or forbear; whereof she desired
her Majestie at the farthest to give answer within ten days, for that the
King stayeth his progress onely upon that; and if so be she mean to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
then to send the Articles that are to be propounded by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>de la Mothe Fenelon</hi> (as I learn by Monsieur <hi>de Foix)</hi> hath given
very honourable report of the Queens Majesties proceedings, assuring them that
there is nothing but sincerity meant.</p>
                  <p>If her Majestie resolve to proceed, I learn then, that Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi>
shall come over with the Kings Answer, to such Articles as shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by the Queens Majestie, and so to grow to some through conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
And so having nothing else to advertise her Majestie at this present,
I most humbly take my leave of your Honour.</p>

                  <head>The CONFERENCE between me and Monsieur

                  <p>FOr my first entry in our Conference, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> shewed him, that I was glad
that it was my hap to be appointed to deal with him, who did concur
with me in like affection towards this cause, being drawn by publique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
as wishing well unto our Countreys and Princes; and therefore the
rather hoped that the success would be thereafter. I shewed him, that
great matters, before they could be brought to an end, could not but be
full of great difficulties; which if by the good discretion of those which
are Dealers and Instruments in the same were not qualified, a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
matter might by evil handling quail and take no effect. I shewed
him therefore, that this matter being in appearance so good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to both our Countreys, as I for my part would not fail to do therein what
there might lie in me to remove such difficulties as might rise, so far forth as
might stand with the Queens Honour and Safety. And if I did any way fail,
it should be for lack of judgement and experience, and not lack of good will. I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54478:55"/>
shewed him, that by perusing the answer to the Articles, I found only the
difficulty to be in Religion, which by his good help, might be reduced to
accord, there was no doubt but that the matter would take that effect we both
desired.</p>
                  <p>To this Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> answered, that he was the rather willing to deal
in this matter, for that he was well perswaded of my good inclination in that
behalf, protesting, that he never more earnestly travelled in matter in his life,
which Monsieur could very well witness, whose perswasions to him chiefly
to enter into the matter, through the honourable report he made of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
rare vertues and gifts; wherein through the Counter practises of divers
other, he found no small difficulty, Monsieur being by them perswaded, that
it would be his hap to march in rank with the forsaken; which scruple being by
me, saith he, removed, if the matter should not take that success I desire, would
be no less cause of displeasure, then otherwise of comfort, if the same take good
effect.</p>
                  <p>Touching the present difficulty of Religion; if her Majestie continue still
resolute to maintain her answer, I see the matter at an end. For (saith he)
Monsieur hath either Religion, or no Religion. If he have Religion, then
Religion being a constant perswasion, confirmed by time, cannot but in
time be removed, and not upon the sudden: if he have no Religion, then
he is unworthy of your Mistress, and the place and degree he beareth. And
surely, saith he, as Religion in all persons is to be desired, so in none more
then in Princes, who have no other bridle to stay them from evil, then
Religion. And as for Monsieur, saith he, I know him to be religious in
his kind, wherein, I suppose, he is not so assuredly grounded, but that there
may grow alteration and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hange thereof in time, through the Queens good
perswasions, whereof we have seen good experience of womens vertue in
that place: <hi>Constantine</hi> was converted by his Mother <hi>Helena;</hi> the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi> by the Queen his wife; and therefore can I not doubt
but this match proceeding, Monsieur will be turned by his wife, who is
of that good disposition and nature, as in all his proceedings he is not
transported and carried away by passion, but guided and conducted by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>To this I replyed, That the Queens Majestie wished not such sudden
change of Religion, as might breed irreligion, but onely the forbearing of the
exercise whereof, might breed by permission both offence and stirrs in her
Estate; and as for the Examples of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the rest, they are common
for both; for as many wives have been turned by their husbands, as husbands by
their wives.</p>
                  <p>To this he answered, that to live without exercise of Religion, was as
much as to be of no Religion; and saith he, the Queens Majestie I know
is honourable, and would not have him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>aitly to tye her self to, as
of two to become one, who is to participate with him both in honour and
dishonour.</p>
                  <p>To this I replyed, that if it were true that I had heard, Monsieuer
was not so far from our Religion, having had some introduction therein
by <hi>Curuvalet</hi> his Governour lately deceased; and therefore if it please
him to water those seeds, that he had already received by some confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he should be able easiely to discern that the change of his
Religion, should breed unto him no dishonour at all, it being no less
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54478:56"/>
fault to continue in error, then commendable to come from error to truth.
I desired him to consider with me, both the inconvenience that would grow to
Monsieur by persisting in his Religion; and also, what greater inconvenience
would come unto the Queens Majestie my Mistress, by permission of exercise of
the same.</p>
                  <p>Touching the inconvenience that would happen to Monsieur, I told him,
that it is held for a general Maxime, that no Prince that is a stranger, and
cometh to rule in a Forraign Countrey, can be welcome, or well received by
the Inhabitants: Therefore Monsieur coming into <hi>England,</hi> except it were by
accident, in respect of the partialities (said I) as you know are to Protestants and
Catholiques, either of these two would be glad to be assured of Monsieur. In
reason now it is to be weighed, with which of these two he is to joyn; with
the Protestants, he shall favour those whom the Queen especially favoureth;
he shall concur with her in the maintenance of the present State and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
he shall gain the favour of her Majesties Councellours, in whom she
reposeth her greatest trust; and lastly, he shall continue the Realm in repose and
quietness: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> on the other side, he persist in his Religion, first, he shall not
gain the Catholiques, unless they may have the like libertie as he himself
enjoyeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, they are already devoted unto the Queen of Scots, and so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
nothing more then of his Marriage, doubting thereby to grow the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of her Title; whereby we may conclude, that by all likelihood, by
having of it, he shall not joyn the good wills of the Catholiques, unless they
may participate with him in like liberty; and on the other side, it will breed
misliking of him with the Protestants, doubting the exercise of his Religion
will breed some unquietness in the State; and consequently, he will be misliked of
both, which inconvenience of misliking, I wished him to perswade Monsieur
well to weigh.</p>
                  <p>Touching the inconvenience that would grow to the Queen, I shewed him
the same would rise three manner of ways: First, by breach of Law. Secondly,
by offence of her good Subjects; and, Thirdly, by the encouragement of evil
Subjects. Which, said I, if you will well weigh, are of much more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then any may happen to Monsieur, he being only touched by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
in honour, the Queens Majestie my Mistress both in honour and
safety; he as a private person, she being as a Monarch and a Prince, whose
Kingdoms were to participate any inconvenience that might befall unto
her.</p>
                  <p>To this he replyed, that his relenting in Religion being matter of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
was an inconvenience of more weight then any that might happen to
the Queen. In the end, after many replications on both sides to and fro, he
concluded, that he was well assured that Monsieur in no case would be brought
upon a sudden to yield to any change of Religion for no respect; and yet that
he doubted not but within a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> after the Match, the same would easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be brought to pass without any great difficulty. He willed me to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how much this match was misliked by the Catholiques; and how much
on the other side, desired of those of the Religion here, and that in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and conscience nothing could more further Religion throughout Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
then this match.</p>
                  <p>To this I answered, that her Majestie was on the other side fully bent to
maintain her answer to the second Article, or otherwise resolved not to proceed;
and so we ended.</p>

naming himself Archbishop of Cassel; and having considered his
request in a Paper subscribed with his hand, we do not so much disallow
his request to have our pardon, and his restitution of his Bishoprick, if
we shall so please, as the slender manner of his suit, being void of all recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition

submission to recover his pardon: And therefore we would that you should
inform him by Letters, or by Message, and upon your informations of his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
we do not allow of his manner of so slender submission and petition.
And if he will not humblie require pardon for his offences, and shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

(as I am enformed) to what end I cannot learn.</p>
                  <p>I have enformed Captain <hi>Thomas</hi> how her Majestie, upon information given
by me, doth accept in very good part his late service in the discovery of
the pretended Archbishops practises; and that she meaneth to consider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
Whereupon he hath desired me in his name, most humbly to desire her
Majestie to be so good and gracious a Lady unto him, as he may have some
charge under her Majestie, either in <hi>Ireland</hi> his native Countrey, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
as one that desireth nothing more then to imploy the experience he
hath gathered in these Civil Wars in her Majesties service: Here there is
very good account made of him: And notwithstanding that the most part
of the ordinary bands are discharged, as well Captains as Souldiers, yet hath
he allowed by the King sixteen Crowns a moneth pension. His Father, whose

Letters of Credit to the King of Spain, promising to be at Madril the 20 of this
present moneth. Touching the matter of secresie committed unto him, I can learn
nothing as yet; notwithstanding I thought it my part to advertise your Lordship
of thus much, who perhaps by other advertisements can give some ghess what the
same importeth. The Scots here have some enterprize in hand, as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the party whom I appointed to observe the Lord <hi>Seatons</hi> doings. The
Ambassador of late hath been at Court, and is returned from thence with answer
not altogether to his liking; and saith, that so long as the Marriage is in Treaty,
there is no hope of good here to be done for the help of their cause. <hi>Birack,</hi> who
lately returned out of Scotland, is in hope to return with new Forces, which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
he saith to his Friends dependeth onely upon the resolution of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
now in hand. The Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> departeth hence out of hand into <hi>Flanders,</hi>
being sent for by her Majesties Rebels there, who have somewhat in hand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
to be executed. They of late have very importunately been in hand with
me for passports; but understanding they have such enterprize in hand, I thought
good in that behalf to make some stay for a time, alledging, that I have some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from her Majestie to make some stay therein, until I be further advertised
of her pleasure, <hi>I</hi> hope her Majestie will not dissallow of this my doings, though
I do it without warrant. Out of Brittain I am advertised, that <hi>la Roche</hi> had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
unto a Kinsman of his, that his enterprize in <hi>Ireland</hi> was, to have exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
a plot of Conquest, devised by <hi>Peter Strozza</hi> in King <hi>Henries</hi> time; which
if the match go not forward, he is promised that he shall go in hand withal: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it doth well appear, that the expectation of this match is the onely stay of
divers pretended mischiefs.</p>
                  <p>Here they are in some perplexitie, for that they hear nothing of her Majesties
answer, being given to understand by the Ambassador, that her Majestie had
signified her mind unto me in that behalf. Queen Mother denieth now, that she
prefixed a day of answer, and that I did mistake her. I must needs confess, that
in requiring the same, she used such words, as her Majestie hath no cause to be
justly offended, which omitting to impart unto her Majestie, I do most humbly
crave pardon at her hands, being most heartily sorry, that through my default,
there should grow any unkindness between them. Her words were as followeth:
First, she asked me, after she had willed me to signifie unto her Majestie the Kings
and her resolution in what time I might have answer. I shevved her, that I hoped
vvithin ten or tvvelve days; the rather, for that I knovv my Mistress to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
and therefore the matter required the less deliberation. Then she desired
me to vvill her Majestie, that they might have ansvver within ten dayes, if it
might be. These circumstances by me omitted, I perceive her Majestie the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to mislike the limitation of the time; for the vvhich as before, so again I most
humbly require her Majesties pardon. And so, &amp;c.</p>

somewhat perplexed, for that the answer is so long deferred, being advertised
from their Ambassador, I had order from her Majestie in that behalf: Your

our Ambassador Resident with our good Brother the
French King.</head>

                  </opener>
                  <p>RIght trusty and welbeloved, we greet you well; after we heard the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of your Letters sent hither concerning your communication with the
Queen Mother, and also with Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> upon the answer we sent
you by <hi>Cavalcant</hi> to the Articles brought by him, we understood also by the
French Ambassador here resident, that he had received Letters from the Q.
Mother and <hi>de Foix</hi> concerning the same matters. And though the answer
made to you (as by your Letters we conceive) were more peremptory, then
such as the Letters to this Ambassador (which we have seen) did purport, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereunto some dulcimes to qualifie the same, especally in answering that
which we could not but object as strange; that the Q. Mother required to
have answer from us within the space of ten dayes; yet to omit rehearsalls,
either the contents of your Letters, or of the Letters sent to this Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador;
we think best to impart unto you, which we will you shall impart to
the Q. Mother, or to the King; which is thus, we find more great and urgent
causes to move us to persist in our former answer in the Article of Religion, both
for our conscience, our safety, honour, and quietness, then can be be alledged
or imagined for the conscience and honour of Monsieur <hi>de Anjou,</hi> and the
reasons hereof as apparent in this sort following: First, if we shall grant a permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to Monsieur to have the use of his Religion, which we take principally to
consist in the having, saying, and hearing of the private Masse, though the same
should be secret for the place, and rarely for the time, and not frequented with
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54478:59"/>
numbers; yet it might seem doubtfull to us how without offence of conscience,
such a tolleration might be by us permitted. Secondarily, though our conscience
should not be offended, yet we are well assured, that our realm being not void
of diversities of opinions herein, though indeed presently we find no disobedience
worthy of any accompt against our Laws, there could not any such exercise of
Religion be used by our sufferance (by a person of such estimation, as one being
allowed to be our husband, should be) but that the same would breed such a
misliking to our best subjects and servants, as surely should diminish their great
love toward us, and consequently hazard some inward troubles within our
Realm, by occasion that one part now dutifully obeying us, would grow doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of our conscience in the observations of our Laws, and another part would be
imboldened by example of that which our husband should be permitted to do,
should attempt to neglect our Laws, and multiply occasions, discords, and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and these perills are so evident to follow, and so dangerous if they should
follow, as surely if we should not aforehand so consider them, we might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
our selves of great folly, as not having due regard either to our own
particular estate, or to the common quietness of our Realm; whereof hitherto,
we thank Almighty God (through his speciall goodness) we have had the effects of
much contentation. On the other part, we see no such matter of weight to be
considered for Monsieur, that either his conscience, his honour, or safety should
be troubled, impeached, or indangered; although we perceive that the Queen
Mothers speeches seem to tend thereto; for where it is said, and that by answer,
if he should come hither, and live without his own Religion, he should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
as one of no Religion, and in time comming he should be (as <hi>de Foix</hi>
saith) an Atheist, and so neither could we in right esteem him to have any faith;
neither should he keep the reputation that he hath. Of all which, certainly,
if we could think that by our answer, and his yielding thereto, any hurt might
happen to him, we should utterly condemn our selves, and readily Reform
the same, or else forbear to give any answer at all; but you shall say,
That we require the Queen Mother, or the King, or if the cause so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
Monsieur himself, to consider better of our answer; we leave him
freedome to use our Religion, in that we are content not to constrain him,
or any of his otherwise to use it, then it shall please him, saying, That
we think it expedient, that if he should be our husband, he should accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
us to the Church, and why he should not, or may not use our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of prayers and divine Service, certainly we think no reason can be yielded
by any that knoweth the same, and will compare it to that which the
Church of Rome doeth use; For in ours, there is no part that hath not been,
yea that is not at this day used in the Church of Rome, as of late the
same hath been allowed by the last Councell at Trent; and if any thing be
more in ours, the same is part of the holy Scripture. Now therefore why
it should be objected, That Monsieur should live here without Religion, if
he shall be present at ours, there is no cause, except it may be objected,
that ours is in the English tongue and not understood; but to satisfie that,
the same is also in the Latin t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>gue as the service of the Church of Rome,
and so ordered to be used in our Universities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if the Latin tongue
should not content; it is also, or may be translated into the French, either
of which his own ministers might use at his pleasure, in places convenient;
whereby he might serve God devoutly, and thereby not to be counted irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
or an Atheist: And if it should be objected, that by this means
it might be esteemed that he might make a change of his faith in matters of
questions in Religion; certainly herein it might also be truly answered,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54478:59"/>
that although we can be glad that all persons should by Gods inspiration change
from ignorance, or errour, to knowledge and truth; yet mean we not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to him, or any person, that they should at our motion, or in respect of us,
change their Religion in matters of faith; Neither doth the usage of the divine
Service of England properly compell any man to alter his opinion in the great
matters now in controversie in the Church; Onely the usage thereof doth
direct men daily to heare and read the Scriptures, to pray to almighty God
(by daily use of the Psalter of David,) and of the ancient Prayers, Anthemes
and Collects of the Church, even the same which the universall Church hath
used, and doth yet use.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if any one part of our Articles and Ceremonies should mislike him,
as surely we cannot conjecture of any such; Yet therein (the rest not being
by him misliked) some tolleration might be to forbear the same, untill he
might better consider thereof. And to that which is said, That we permit
Ambassadors to use the Religion of Rome: First, we never made any grant
thereof to any, whereby in that respect his conscience is free. But being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
that is to say, not molested, therein by any of our ministers of our Laws,
the difference is apparent between another Princes servant comming onely but
as a Messenger, or tarrying to do Messages, which is the office of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador;
and one that is to be our husband, that is, in respect of Religion
our head, and in order to be joynt Governor of our Realms, and subjects with
us; that is, to assist us in maintenance of our Laws, in punishing offenders, in
giving good example to our Subjects, in counselling us how to maintain the
quietness of our estate, and preserve to us, and to himself for our sake, the
love which he shall find is born to us by our subjects. And how contrary it
shall be to all those that he may doe, as Ambassadors are suffred to doe, in whom
neither we, nor our People can have any such Opinion of carriage for us, or
them; or for our Laws or quietness, every person understandeth. Yea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
Subjects think the contrary of all Ambassadors of strange Princes,
though all give not like cause; Thus you see what we think meet to answer at
this time, having some reasonable Causes to move us to think, That if the
matter be as earnestly meant, as is by the Ambassadors words pretended, they
will not be so precise as to demand any conditions in the case of Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
our estate may come in danger, or our present quietness come in doubt; And
therefore you shall be the more earnest in setting forth the dangers that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
may follow. The Ambassador hath required us to send you the rest of
such demands as is meet for our part; whereunto we were once inclined, and
have them in readiness; But now we find it convenient, first to understand the
resolution of this matter of Religion, before we will propound the rest, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
no delay of time shall follow, if in the first we may accord; for we may spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
by Post send you the same demands, if cause so require.</p>

Resident in France.</head>
                  <p>SIr, by the Queens Majesties Letters you shall understand, what you are directed
to do and say; and therefore I must forbear to deal therein with you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
you are prescribed; But I will friendly let you know how the answer
hath proceeded; and so the cause and circumstance known, you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conceive the inward sense of the Message. At the first coming of your
Letters hither, with the answer from Queen Mother. In—A was very
sorry to judge the matter so perplexed, and almost desperate; Whereby I then
judged there was here a plaine forward intention to proceed in the cause, if this
let for Religion should not be a stay. After two daies the French Ambassador
had Letters, and the Queens Majestie was by some informed, that saw the
Letters, that there was no such difficulty in that matter of Religion; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
the Ambassador himself being appointed to conferr with my Lord of
<hi>Leicester,</hi> and me, made the cause very hard, alledging directly, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
would never sustaine that dishonour, as to come hither with an accompt
to the world, that he should have no Religion; and then I answered, as is
contained in the Queens Majesties Letters, setting out the neerness of ours, to
such as was good and found in the Roman; adding, that we omitted nothing
but those which were impious and doubtfull to be against the Scriptures: And
so with us he ended, with this request, that the Queens Majestie would grant
these words <hi>(quod)</hi> which sentence I found imperfect, and so yet do; I reported
this to the Queens Majestie, After this, I was by one of some value secretly
informed, that if this matter of Religion were earnestly sticked unto, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
pressed, it would be obtained; whereupon the answer was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and I commanded to report it to the French Ambassador; who hearing
it; seemed much dismayed; and concluded, That he saw not but this answer
should make a breach and end of the whole: For, if the answer (saith he) be
grounded upon the Queens conscience, then saith he, there is no qualification
to be hoped for. Thus I reported, and thereupon I saw her Majestie was
perplexed, and wished I had forborn to have made the principall foundation
upon her Majesties conscience, which I was commanded to do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no fault in me. And to remedie the matter, I was willed speedily to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise
the Ambassador secretly, that I was larger in explication of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
conscience, then I see since my speaking with him was meant; and that
the principall reasons were the other of the misliking of her good subjects, and
of the danger to lose their good wills, &amp;c. And so did I by a little writing
advertise him; whereby, what conceit he gathereth, I know not; but by some
others I heare that he still judgeth it broken. After this, I was commanded
also to temper the sentence in the Queens Majesties Letters, as you perceive;
for it is not as it was, an assertion of direct necessity, but of possibility. Thus
having some circumstances to give you some light, but what you shall find by
your light, God knoweth: I doubt the worst, and so I have said; but yet
the opinion conceived by her Majestie maketh her to believe the contrary.</p>
                  <p>It were strange that any one man should give comfort to the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
in the cause; and yet the same man to perswade the Queens Majestie
that she should persist; both these things are done, but I dare not affirm by
any one; and thus I end. In Scotland; the Q. partie have recovered Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh
Town by <hi>Granges</hi> favour; And yet presently he tearmeth himself
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54478:60"/>
the Kings subject, and so they are like to fray together, or else to come to consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
amongst themselves, to govern the Realm without deciding the Kings
title, or the Queens; I cannot tell whether the greater part like better a
or of none, for so their writings and words purport; making no mention of King
or Queen, but of Magistrates to conserve the peace and liberty of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
And so I am forced to leave of, and so I end</p>

that therefore she would consult with the King and Monsieur in that behalf;
and that the next day I should receive answer. By certain that wish well to
the cause, I was advised to deal with Monsieur himself; so repairing unto him,
I shewed him, That I was appointed by her Majestie to make him understand,
the great inconvenience that would follow by such permission as he required
touching the exercise of his Religion; as also, that her Majestie (though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
she could wish him reduced from error to truth) yet did not presse him to
any such sodaine change of Religion, as might cause him to be reputed for an
Atheist; onely this she desired, that he would forbear the use of his private
Masse, in respect of the great inconvenience that would follow; and that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would examine, whether he might not with good devotion serve God
with such form of prayer as publiquely is used in our Realm, being in effect
nothing else, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this he answered, That he rather desired to be a meane
to redresse inconveniencies, then to breed any; to be a comfort, then a discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
and that he thought it would otherwise fall out.</p>
                  <p>After he had thus ended, he replyed, That though he was of years young, yet
any time these five years there have been overtures of marriage made unto him,
and that he found in himself no inclination untill this present to yield to any.
But (saith he) I must needs confesse, that through the great commendations
that is made of the Q. your Mistress, for her rare guifts, aswell of mind as of
body, being (as even her very enemies say) the rarest creature that was in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope
these 500. years; my affection grounded upon so good respects, hath
now made me yield to be wholly hers. And that therefore (saith he) if I
thought that there could ensue any inconvenience to her disquiet, through me,
I would rather wish my self never to have been born. Touching my request for
the exercise of my Religion, considering the same toucheth my soul &amp; conscience,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54478:61"/>
being but private for my self, in some private place, I suppose there will grow
no such offence thereof as will breed any disquiet, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> alteration of state; and
therefore I hope she will dispence with me in that behalf. I replyed, That I
hoped that when he had well weighed the inconvenience that would follow; that
without scruple of conscience he might well (with good devotion) frequent the
exercise of our Church service, he would not insist upon any dispensation. To
that he answered, that he knew not how God hereafter would dispose his heart,
and (that therefore for the present) he desired her to weigh in her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
what it were to do any thing with scruple and remorse of conscience,
and so desired me to present on his behalf his most affectionate and humble
commendation; and to assure her, That she onely had Authority to command
him. The next day, as I was appointed, I repaired to the Court, and there
having accesse unto the King, I shewed, that I doubted not but that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had made him acquainted with such reasons as lead the Q. Majesty my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris
to maintain her former answer in respect of the great inconveniences that
would ensue, aswell perjudiciall to Monsieur his brother, as to her Majestie.
I shewed him, That I was now onely to request him from her Majestie, that
he would perswade his Brother, that in respect of the said inconveniences, not
to be so resolute in requiring a tolleration that might prove so dangerous; as also,
to advise him to examine, whether he might not with good conscience serve
God, according to such form of prayers, as is usually practised throughout her
Dominious. To this the King answered, That the reasons alleadged by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
were of great moment; he willed me therefore to desire her Majestie, in
his name, that the Articles by her to be propounded might be sent, that the
whole matter might be joyntly considered of. And to assure her, that he
doubted not but that his Brother would be ruled by him so farre forth, as
might stand with honour, reason, and conscience.</p>
                  <p>After I had thus euded with the King, I repaired to Q. Mother, to whom
I made report of such answer as I received from the Kings hands, which she
said, I had well conceived, for that it was the self same that they had resolved
on between themselves; she willed me to desire her Majestie that her demand
might be at the first propounded reasonable and well qualified, to the end
this matter might come the sooner to conclusion, and therefore she wished,
that if it might so lie in her, that the Ambassador might be made acquainted
with them before the sending of them over, who can give before hand some
light what the King in reason will consent unto, whereby to breed the more
expedition; she concluded with me, that I should assure her Majestie, that
aswell touching Religion, as other points, reason should decide on their parts
all such difficulties as should rise. It is thought that Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> shall be
sent over with the Kings answers unto her Majesties demands; he sheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
not unthankfull for such honour as he hath received at her Majesties hands,
who earnestly travelleth to remove such difficulties as do rise in this matter, and
to stand in her Majesties defence against those that seek any way to touch her
in honour, your Lordship shall therefore do well to move her Majestie, that
you by your private Letters may signifie unto him, that her Majestie doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
those good offices done by him, in very good part. It is further
thought, that Monsieur <hi>Montmorency</hi> shall be the Nobleman, that shall be
sent to ratifie such Articles as shall be accorded unto by the King: he hath
since his repaire unto the Court, marvelously furthered this matter, and
hath caused them to grow so reasonable. Monsieur <hi>de la Mot</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
(by his Letters) make very honourable report of her Majestie, touching
her proceedings in this cause.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:54478:61"/>
Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> hath willed me to advertise your Lordship, that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
direction to me, and her speech delivered to their Ambassador did not
agree; for he writeth, That her Majestie promiseth some qualification of her
answer unto the second Article, and I deny the receipt of any such thing; he
writeth, that I should deliver unto the King her Majesties demand, and I deny
to have received any; he therefore wisheth, for the advoiding of jealousie,
that the same were reformed, that the Articles be sent before the return of this
bearer: I do not mean to be known of the receipt of them, untill I hear fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of her Majesties pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordship shall do well; by the next, to send a Book of Common
praiers translated in the French, that I may present it unto Monsieur; I
have seen of them printed at Garnesey. C. <hi>Lodowick</hi> desired me most earnestly
to move her Majestie, that it would please her to licence <hi>Hawkins</hi> underhand
to serve him with certain ships; which favour (if it please her Majestie to shew
him) he hopeth she shall not have cause to forethink the same, which Letter
shall well appeare, whensoever occasion shall be offered, wherein he may do
her service. Mr. <hi>Cavalcant</hi> is here a very good instrument in this cause in hand,
and doth deal therein both sinceerly and discreetly, and worthy of the trust that
her Majestie doth put in him, whose assistance by no means I could have
lacked. Thus leaving further to trouble your honour <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Ambassador here had dealt with her and Monsieur about some attempt against
Ireland, that she, and Monsieur for his justification, do avow, that he never

but chiefly to deal with her in some particular causes touching himself; wherein
if he should falsify his faith, his comodity would be but small, in respect of the

Ambassador in France.</head>
                  <p>SIr, you must beare with my slow dispatches in returning your servants, for
that I cannot obtain such resolutions as may give cause to write; whereupon
I am forced to beare here patiently the lack I find, and you must do the like
on your part; hoping that <hi>Deus dabit meliora.</hi> Now I send away this bearer,
meaning and hoping to send herewith the great answer; and to give you some
light hereof; Thus it is, the French Ambassador upon the receipt of his last
answers, agreeable with your Letters, pressed the Queens Majestie to have the
rest of the Articles on her part, which in no wise she would agree unto, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that without a resolute answer to the Article of Religion this could
not be; wherewith the Ambassador was so wounded as indeed in conference
with him I found him desperate of the matter, and entred into passions. But
after some speechs used with him, I pacified him, with hope, that the Q. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
might be by further perswasions induced to shew the rest of the Articles;
and so with some long labourious perswasions her Majestie was induced to agree,
that the Articles should be made ready and shewed, as things earnestly pressed
by that King and his Ambassador here, with which pretence her Majestie
thought her honour saved well, hereof I was appointed to inform the Ambassador,
and then was I also commanded to put the Articles in readiness, which were not
unready, as I conceived; but ere I could finish them, I was commanded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them with a request to have <hi>Calais</hi> restored, a matter so inconvenient to
bring forth a marriage, as indeed, I thought it meant to procure a breach, and so
the matter continued in my opinion desperate; but with good help it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied.
I desired that the Queens Majestie would let my Lord Marques, the
Earles of <hi>suffex</hi> and <hi>Leicester</hi> to see the Articles, and so they did, and very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably
and wisely gave counsell to forbeare that Toy of <hi>Calais;</hi> and generally
did further the prosecution of the marriage, as a matter of all other most
necessary at this time. And now we take it that her Majestie intendeth it
earnestly; whereupon, yesterday in the afternoone my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> and
I have delivered unto the Ambassador a Copy of the Articles, which at the
first hearing he did not mislike; what he will do this day I know not, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they are very reasonable. Thus farre are we passed: so I trust on Wednesday
to dispatch <hi>Harcourt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yesterday came <hi>de Pine</hi> with Letters to my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> from the King,
the Q. Mother, and Monsieur, which will much further the matter, and it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> be assured of favours both there, and at home;
for some that like not this match, may otherwise engender doubts in his
Lordship; And yet surely at this present he dealeth earnestly with her
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54478:62"/>
Majestie in the furtherance of the match; you shall do well to let his Lordship
understand what good opinion is had of him for so doing. The matters in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
go hardly for us, the Queens party, by <hi>Granges</hi> means, occupieth <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
and the King is constrained to keep in <hi>Sterling;</hi> both parties are in arms,
which yet are used defensive. The Queen party hath had Money and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
from <hi>France.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>Ross</hi> is still restrained, and so deserveth.
The Queen liketh not of the Bishop of <hi>Glascows</hi> coming into the Realm. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

good opinion of my devotion for the furtherance of the matter of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

for that he desired speedy dispatch; to whom I have imparted the state of that
matter, which onely doth stand upon the Article of Religion, to which her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
will by no means relent: All other Articles are reasonable; and her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
hath shewed her Demands to this Ambassador, and hath dispatched the
same to you, which I think will be with you before this. For the other point,
touching Religion, if I might advise them thereof, they should not speak of
it at all; for sooner will her Majestie yield to reason himself, that shall have
that interest in her, that shall be her husband, then by any Contract or other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.
And finding her Majestie disappointed upon the argument of that
point, to proceed as she hath seemed in the matter, I cannot but hope of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good success, to which for my part, in respect of her Majesties surety and
hope of universal good to the cause of Religion, I must with well, and further the
best I can, according to your advice, whereof I thank you, and am glad to see
your consideration thereof. This Bearer shall further declare some part of my

                  <p>RIght Trusty and Well-beloved, we greet you well; although we did
heretofore think it reasonable to forbear the sending of any Articles
to contain the Demands on our part, until we might have a resolute An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from the King to our former Answers made to his Articles, sent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by <hi>Cavalcant;</hi> and namely, to the Article touching Religion: Yet
finding by your Letters, and the continual solicitation of the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
here Resident, how earnestly the King desireth to see our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
which when he shall have, he will make answer to the former,
we are, contrary to our own disposition, induced by these means to send
the same at this time, as you shall receive the same in Articles; whereof
you shall advertise the King and Queen Mother, and let them understand,
that were it not for the earnest solicitation of the Ambassador, we would
have forborn so to have done; for that we take it it may be interpreted
in some manner to touch us in honour, that not having knowledge how
the King will satisfie us in the matter of Religion, which is the principal,
we should pass further into the Treaty of all the rest, altogether upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
what to hope in the principal. But to their satisfaction herein,
you shall say, that we not onely caused the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> and Lord
<hi>Burleigh,</hi> whom onely of our Councel we have used herein, according to
our former agreement, to impart our Demands in certain Articles to the
French Ambassador; but have also sent them now in writing, to be by you
shewed unto them, having therein followed for the most part the form
of things granted to our late Sister, of Noble Memory, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> as
by the Treaty of Marriage betwixt King <hi>Philip</hi> and her may appear. And
further, you shall say, that these Articles are but briefly and summari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceived by our foresaid Counsellours, who have not the knowledge
of the forms of Law requisite in such case; so as we reserve to our
selves power, if the substance of them shall be granted, to cause the same
to be in form of Law inlarged, by such others of our Councel, as by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
can better do the same. Besides, we do deliver these Demands to be joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considered with the Articles of our first Answer to the Demands on their
part brought by <hi>Cavalcant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We perceive by the French Ambassador, that certain Clauses which
we agreed should be added to some of the first Articles, were not
contained in the Writing by you there shewed: And not knowing
whether in the writing of them there, the same Clauses were omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for more surety we send you a new Copy hereof, to be shewed
as you shall have occasion: And if indeed those Clauses shall appear to
have been omitted in the former, the same was omitted but by the
Writer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:54478:63"/>
If the King or any other shall press you to understand of our proceedings
with the Queen of Scots, as in misliking the restraint of the Bishop
of <hi>Ross,</hi> or in not determining her cause; you shall for the first say, that the
evil parts done by the Bishop of <hi>Ross,</hi> are such, and so dangerous to us, and
our State, as no Prince could suffer, as we think, the like, without some
sharp revenge: For where in the late Rebellion in the North, we understood
that he had given the Heads of that Rebellion comfort to enter into the
same, which he could not deny, being charged therewith, but that secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they had sent to him for ayd and comfort afore their Rebellion, although
he yield the same unto them, nor thought it meet to utter the same, and
so we were content to pass over the same, with hope that he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his causes only according to the place he held, to be as an Agent or
Minister for her, and not to intermeddle as he had done with our Affairs,
and to trouble our State; nevertheless, within a few moneths after he did
eftsoons secretly by night, which was the last Summer, enter into such
intelligences and practises with some of our Nobility, as we could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the same, but for a time restrained him of his libertie, until he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
never to be found in the like to offend us: Contrary whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
he hath now of new entred into practises by his Letters and Ministers
to stir up secretly some new Rebellion in our Realm; and hath for that
purpose dealt by his Ministers with certain our Fugitives and Rebels in the
the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Low-Countreys: As also with the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi>
and further prosecuted his intentions to that purpose, by sending both
to the Pope, and to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> of all which his doing we have
full proof, and in certain part to prove the same his own Confessions, and
manifestly argue his guiltiness.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore you shall require the King or his Mother, if they shall
deal with you herein, to interpret well of our doings, for that we may
not endure such kind of dealing as may so indanger, or at the least trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our Estate. And for this purpose, if you shall be required, why we
do refuse to grant to the Bishop of <hi>Glascow</hi> passport, you shall say, it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the self same ground; for we do well know his conditions, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
how unmeet a man he is to come hither to do any good office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Queen his Mistress and us, who we know hath rather been a
maintainer then a pacifier of discord betwixt us in times past. And for
our intention towards the Queens of Scots, although her Minister the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Ross</hi> hath otherwise deserved; yet we do continue in minde to
proceed to the hearing and ordering of her cause, upon the coming of
certain Noblemen out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> both for her and the King her Son,
the delay whereof hath lately grown by the renewing of arms on both
sides, whereof being by an express Messenger of ours now very lately sent
into <hi>Scotland</hi> to both parties earnestly charged by us, either of the parties
do charge the other, and excuse themselves; and yet at length they
are now content to re-enter again into Treaty offering to send hither
their Commissioners. For which purpose we have even this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

                  <head>To the Right Honourable and my very loving Friend Mr. Francis Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham
Esquire, Ambassador Resident in
France.</head>
                  <p>SIr, as I promised by my last Letters, sent by your Italian, so do I now
dispatch <hi>Harcourt.</hi> By her Majesties Letters you shall see your charge,
wherein God give you good success; as I for my part sincerely mean, even
for his glory, and for the surety of the Queen my Soveraign, and weal of
my Countrey; wherein if I do dissemble, I wish, as I am writing, the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Almighty Lord of Hosts. The cause of the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
persisting so hard in the cause of Religion, wherein I rejoyce, as the
allowance of the matter is, as I find and do disclose secretly an opinion, that
her Majestie conceiveth, that if she will stand fast, they will utterly yield.
Now how true that will fall out in the event, or why she is so informed, if it
be not too certain, you may ghess. I hear by some other, that <hi>du Pine</hi>
saith so; unto me he neither saith so, nor doth answer to it, though I do
ask him thereof directly. But this he saith, that Monsieur will be content
to have the point of Religion left free, without any Capitulation. This I
pray you keep to your self, for it may be mistaken of some. I send you a
a Book in French of the Common-prayer, which is hardly gotten, as this
bearer can shew you. I fear the first Articles were mistaken, in that the
Ambassador saith they lacked some clauses. And I perusing my Copies,
find both sorts remaining with me; that is, one sort without these clauses
added, and another with them, whereof I do now send you one. I did
name to the Ambassadour for the Queens Majesties Dowry, Fourty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Crowns; and since I find the Queens Majestie content with Thirty
thousand; for so was Queen <hi>Maries,</hi> by the name of Three thousand pounds
Flemish, after fourty grooz to the pound, which maketh but Thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Crowns French. The Ambassador, since he had his answer, wrote
to me to procure a more certain Answer what Monsieur should have; and
though it be not expressed in the first answers, where properly it was to be
answered, yet I think it shall be no less then the Dowry of Kings Wives
here hath been, which is Ten thousand Marks, or Twenty thousand No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
Now I must wearily, being assaulted with business of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
which is now in Arms, and dangerously for our part, and also fore <hi>Ireland,</hi>
which is onely in trouble for want of money, give over, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>IT may please your Honour to advertise her Majestie, that the 19 of this
Moneth, having access unto the King, I shewed unto the King her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Articles, using such speech before the delivery of the same, as by mine
instructions from her Majestie I was directed. The King shewed me, that he
could not but accept in the best part her Majesties frank and confident dealing,
and that therefore he found himself most bound unto her, willing me
to assure her Majestie from him, that this sincere and direct dealing
should receive the like aquital at his hands. Touching his answer unto the
said demands, he told me he would confer with his Councel, and would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a day or two send for me to the Court, to understand what would be his
resolution. The eighteenth of this Moneth he sent for me, and there shewed
me, that upon conference with his Councel, he was resolved forthwith to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
a Gentleman of his Chamber, named <hi>de l' Archant,</hi> being Captain of
his Brothers guard, to give her Majestie thanks, for that it pleased her to deal
so frankly with him, and so sincerely, as she had done in the Treaty of this
weighty cause in hand; which honourable proceeding of hers, he willed me to
assure her, that he would never forget; and further to signifie unto her, that
he made choise of the Marshal <hi>Montm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rency,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> to send
over with his full mind touching the Articles that have been propounded of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side; and that he therefore desired by the said Gentlemen to understand
when it shall be her Majesties pleasure that they shall come over to treat in
that behalf. Having then done with the King, the Queen Mother called
me unto her, and told me, that of late certain had gone about to perswade
the King her Son, that her Majestie meant nothing less then to proceed in
this marriage, using sundry perswasions to induce her to believe the same:
Notwithstanding she assured me, that such is the great good opinion that
they all have of her Majesties sincerity upon good grounds, in respect of her
Majesties honourable dealing, as no such brutes and sinister practises can prevail
with them to make them think otherwise then honourable of her Majestie, and
yet she did assure me that the same did proceed from such persons, as they might
easily have been abused, had not her Majesties own sincere dealing assured them
of the contrary. I shewed her, that if she or the King should otherwise think
of her Majestie, they should do her great wrong, and give her just cause to
think her sincere dealing unsincerely requited. This was the effect of my
present negotiation. And so &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I Have written by <hi>du Pine</hi> of late to you, and before that, as I think, you
have received her Majesties Answer, and such Articles as she doth think
meet to be demanded. Her Majestie doth stand still very stiff touching the
point of Religion required of that side; and as far as I can perceive, she
will hardly relent to any other qualification then you know of; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
granted to her, I suppose there will be no other difficultie. And surely in
this, if Monsieur remit the whole to her Majestie, there is no doubt but by
that means he shall obtain more then we wish, and more then is reasonable,
or at the least convenient to be openly contracted by them: For as by the
one that may be had, which is to be born withal for a time, in hope of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
so by the other, it will altogether encourage such as are already too
high and most meetest to be kept under, even for both their sureties. For
this cause it is onely to be wished: for these respects; the first, to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
good of the cause of Religion; the other, for the quietness of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Estate: And for these causes sake, I pray God to prosper it accordingly;
and I see no cause gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>atly to doubt, if that point of Religion be yielded on
that side unto. The Ambassador here doth very honestly and well in the
matter, and surely doth good offices between their Majesties. For my part,
I perceive by you, that I have cause to thank him for his particular affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards me, I can but thank him here. And I pray you, as you may
have occasion, use this favour for me, as it may appear to the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
there, how much his Ambassador hath made me know of his good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of my good devotion towards the encrease of the good Amitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
our good Soveraign and him, which doth give me great encouragement
to go alway the more forward, so far forth as with my duty to her Majestie I
may. Thus having no other matter presently to write to you, I bid you fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</p>

                  <p>RIght Trusty and Well-beloved, we greet you well: Forasmuch as the

of the Guard of Monsier <hi>D. Anjo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Marshal <hi>Montmorency</hi> and others, nominated with him for the French King,
might come hither (as they say) to treat and conclude the matter moved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and the said Monsieur, we think it necessary to impart unto you what
hath passed therein at some length; which we have ordered to be put in writing
by the Lord of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> to the intent that on the one part, you should not be
ignorant; and on the other part, you should be better instructed how to treat
upon the matter, both with the King or any other that shall in this matter
have Commission to treat with you. In all our dealings with them you shall
find, that we have in no wise yielded to grant to Monsieur a liberty for
exercise of his Romish Religion; neither have we any inclination to yield
thereto; and yet for the benefit of our Realm, rather then for any particular
inclination to marriage, we have resolved this marriage to be meet for us, so
as the difficulty of Religion be well accorded. And where in the last end, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conference had by the Ambassador and Lord of <hi>Archant,</hi> with the Earl of
<hi>Leicester</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> it may appear to you, that they finding a
resolute determination of their Ambassadors, should demand of us a liberty
for Monsieur in the cause of Religion, it should be denied, then did they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
seem to yield, and by way of demand require to know, how it might be
liked, if the demand of Religion were utterly forborn and put to silence. Our
meaning is not, that you should make any mention hereof to the King, or any
other, except it be first moved to you. And then in that case you may well
say, that if it be not demanded by them in Treaty, then shall there need no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to be made in Treaty; and if they think the honour of Monsieur pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in that, it is not denied him; as likewise the honour of us should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
in that we have not assented thereto: And that there shall not be no
further meaning by Monsieur herein; but that as it shall not be by way of
Treaty demanded before Marriage; so he will be also content after marriage to
forbear the use of it, then may you seem to agree thereto. For otherwise you
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54478:66"/>
may plainly say, either to Monsieur himself, or to some other in credit about him,
whom you may trust, that the forbearing of it by way of Treaty shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
us only, but also the forbearing of the use of it. And so we require you to
express the same plainly, where you shall see cause; for we cannot esteem it a
plain dealing to pass it over with silence in the Treaty, and yet to be in doubt
whether the same shall be used indeed, and thereby move a new controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and us, of more danger then is meet to be suffered, to follow for lack
of plain dealing with them: herewith included shall you have in writing, the sum
of the Conference had at this time, by which you may be fully informed. And
whereas prssport was required by <hi>de l' Archant</hi> for the Marshal <hi>Montmorency,</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Chiverny,</hi> we thought once to have sent it
unto you, to the end if the King would send them, you might deliver the same; but
sithence we have thought better to stay it, until we might know the Kings answer

be demanded on her part, which her Majestie had done upon earnest solicitation

thought fit to send this Gentleman to notifie their great liking to proceed, and
to finish the matter; and therefore were determined to send hither an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage

Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Chiverny</hi> Chancellor to Monsieur, to treat

               <body>
                  <head>To this her Majestie answered,</head>
                  <p>That she also thanked the King and the Queen Mother for their manner of
friendly dealing, in prosecuting this matter so earnestly; and for her sincere
dealing with them, she doubted not but her doings should always thereof make
good proof. But as to the matter of Monsieur and her, she could not understand
that it was in such forwardness, as by their speeches she gathered, that the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
might come in such sort, as by their speeches it seemed to end and conclude
it; for that she, as yet, understood not the difficulties risen upon the first answer,
that were by the King conceived, namely, in the matter of Religion; neither
yet how her last Articles of her Demands were accepted by the King, althogh
she confess that she thought there could be no mislike in those last Articles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
there was nothing contained in them, but that which already had been
granted by King <hi>Philip</hi> to Q. <hi>Mary</hi> her sister; so as then her Majestie concluded,
that except the King would declare his contentation and his Brothers, agreeable
to her Majasties minde already declared in the matter of Religion (that is, that
she could not grant unto Monsieur liberty to exercise the Roman Religion in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54478:66"/>
any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> contrary to her Laws) she saw it but labor lost to send any Ambassadors.</p>
                  <p>To this the Ambassador &amp; l' Archant, for answer, used long speeches, in declaring
how the King, Q. Mother, and his brother, desired nothing more then the honor of
her Maj. and the weal of her Estate; &amp; so likewise hoped that her Maj. would have
due regard of the honour and estate of Monsieur, that should not be judged by the
world to be without a Religion; which must needs be, if he should live here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the exercise of his Religion; and yet his meaning was not, to use the same in
any sort to be offensive to her Majestie, or to breed offence to the quiet estate of
the Realm. And so further, they used many arguments to move her Maj. to yield
to their desire. But her Maj. persisted in her former determination, that she could
neither with conscience, nor yet in respect of policy, grant to Mon. such liberty as
was required; and added, that she was not of mind that Mon. should be constrained
to live here without exercise of religion; for if the form of the religion in <hi>England</hi>
as it is established by the Laws of the Realm, were considered by them, as it might
easily be, considering that it was published, and to be seen both in Latin &amp; French,
it should be found that there is nothing in the same contrary to the Roman religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
differing only, that the same is translated out of the Latin tongue into English,
and that some things, for reasonable respects, are omitted, and not used in the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> so as whosoever shall use the same service, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
without Religion, nor to do any thing repugnant to the Roman Religion.</p>
                  <p>In this sort, with speeches at more length tending to these ends, they departed
from her Majestie upon their first access; and afterwards they made means that her
Maj. would be pleased to give them some better answer; and in like manner her
Majestie thought her determination so reasonable for her to hold, as she rather
thought that they had some further power to yield to her. And because her Maj.
understood that the French King had concluded this matter with the rest of his
Councel, and by nominating Ambassadors, had made the cause patent, her Maj. hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
having not imparted it to any others, but with two of her Councel, as she
was required so to keep it secretly on the French Kings behalf. Now she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
that the whole proceedings from the beginning should be declared to
her Councel; and so being done, the same were very well allowed by her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,
and her Maj. was earnestly moved by them all not to stay in this matter of
her marriage with Mon. <hi>de Anjon,</hi> so as he might be induced to consent with her
in Religion, or at the least not to have any exercise of Religion contrary to hers.
After this, the Ambassador, with <hi>l' Archant,</hi> came again on Friday to her Maj. and
renewing their former reasons, requested of her Maj. to know her answer, whether
the Marshal <hi>Montmorency</hi> should not come in ambassage, as before was signified to
be the Kings desire. Whereunto in brief the substance of her Majesties answer
was, that as she did greatly esteem the Kings amity, and was desirous to conserve
the same with mutual good will, so was she very careful not to accord to any thing
that in her opinion might in any wise impair the same, by giving to him any cause
or colour of unkindness; and therefore she wished that the K. would well consider
this matter &amp; difficulty of Religion, before he should send his ambassage: for consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
with her self, on the one part, that she could not chang her mind herein, nor
as she thought could by any perswasion hereafter, be moved to alter her determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
(although in most matters it is doubtful to determine <hi>de futur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>)</hi> but such
was her mind resolute at this present; and on the other part, if the K. should hope
that his Ambassador might by treaty alter her Majesties mind herein, and that then
indeed they should not be able so to do: And thereupon the matter might break
off, she doubted how the French King might conceive some unkindness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hereby,
although she her self were altogether free from giving cause thereof; and for
that purpose her Majestie required them, in her name, that the King would
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54478:67"/>
accept it for answer in as sincere part as she uttered it, which was with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ambassador instanted to give them a more comfortable answer, for that thereby
the King and his brother might doubt of her Majesties intention in the principal
matter. She answered them, that truly this cause of Religion was directly for it
self, and that being assented unto by the K. and his brother, she knew no cause in
the rest of the things, on her pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, to move any doubt, but by reasonable treaty
they might be accorded, which, said she, did the rather declare to them, because the
K. might not think, that if the point of Religion were by him and his brother as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto, that her Maj. had a meaning to make any difficulty in other points,
and that the rather, because she had declar'd her mind plainly in two several writings:
the one, being an answer to the K. demands; the other, containing demands agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the like, as were accorded betwixt K. <hi>Philip</hi> &amp; Q. <hi>Mary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and so she conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that she must remit the coming of the Ambassadors to the K. own judgment.</p>
                  <p>And thus they departed, as it seemed by their speeches, doubful of the substance
of the matter, and therefore they required to have the next day some conference
with the E. of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and the L. of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> to declare their conceits upon the
Q. Majesties answer: and so they had on the next day following, being <hi>Saturday,</hi>
where they stil pressed to have some reasonable answer, that although the Q. would
not presently assent to their request, yet that if the Ambassador should come, the
cause might not be thus peremptory desperate, but that in some sort it might be
obtained, that neither on the one part Monsieur should be condemned to the
world, and taken as a person excommunicated from the rest of Princes, if he should
not have the use of his Religion, neither on the other part, the Q. Majestie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
should take any offence, or that the least part of her Estate should be troubled;
for such was the resolute determination of Monsieur and his profession, that from
the first time he should enter into the Realm, he would in no wise offend the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
subject the had; with many such speeches tending to perswade that Mon. would
so use his religion, or so forbear it in times and places, as not to cause offence.</p>
                  <p>They were answered, that the Q. Majestie could not give any other answer, and
that they might well perceive her sincerity in dealing, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tter plainly her mind, as
she did; and many reasons to maintain her resolution, were to them remembred, as
principally her conscience, next the desire she had to preserve the State in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which by granting him that should be her husband, a power to break her laws
in matter of such weight, must needs induce an alienation from her of the minds
and hearts of her good subjects, being of her R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and indurate the minds of
others, that though secretly, yet truly are loath to obey the Laws, if they might
have any maintenance to the contrary; which though Monsieur would not give
them, yet they would conceive a boldness to offend, in the hope to be allowed by him.</p>
                  <p>In the end, it was moved to know the opinions of the said E. &amp; L. <hi>Burleigh,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they thought it good that the Ambassadors should come. Whereunto it was
answered, that the consideration thereof did more directly belong to the K. and
that also they two could best give advice therein, for they saw what was likely to
be the issue of their coming: If the stay were not in Religion, there was no evident
let seen in the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to speak truly, she said two Lords said, they could give
them no hope that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

would demand of her Majestie a grant or toleration for Monsieur, her Majestie
would deny it. And therefore if they could not like with the denying of it, they
must forbear to demand it. Hereupon there followed some opinions on bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

proceeded since the arrival of Monsieur <hi>l' Archant</hi> you may perceive by her own
Letters, wherein also somewhat is touched for our dealing with them; what the
said <hi>l' Archant</hi> shall of himself report, or what he shall bring from the Ambassador,
we cannot tell, but percase you shall hear somewhat thereof. Indeed we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that her Majesties answer did not content them, whereupon we being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
that they should not conceive thereof worse then was meant, did confer
with them on <hi>Saturday</hi> last as is mentioned in the Q. Majesties Letter; and after
long maintenance of her Majesties reasons, and therewith giving them sufficient
hope, so as the matter of Religion might be concluded, they descended to the
devise of forbearing that article, whereunto her Majestie hath directed you what
to say, if it be treated upon, and thereto we refer you.</p>
                  <p>As for the inward intention of her Majestie in this case, we cannot certainly give
you to understand more then it pleaseth her to utter. To the matter it self, she

that may be well accorded or well buried, we see no impediment of any moment:
we can but counsel you, as we use do our selves, that is, to do and serve as she di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth

                  <p>MR. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> you shall at length understand her Majesties resolution
touching her answer to the Gentleman Monsieur <hi>l' Archant:</hi> for mine own
part, what opinion I have of this great matter, I will deal plainly with you, even as
I find her Majesties disposition. For her desire to marriage, I perceive it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
still as it was, which is very cold; nevertheless, she seeth it is so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as I believe she yieldeth rather to think it fit to have a husband, then willing
to have any found indeed for her. And I fear so it will appear in this matter with
Monsieur. For as you shall perceive by the Articles passed already, there is
among them all but one that maketh the difficulty, which is his demand to have
his private exercise of his Religion: so it doth appear, if he would omit that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and put it in silence, yet will her Majestie straitly capitulate with him, that
he shall in no way demand it hereafter at her hands: Which scruple, I believe,
will utterly break off the matter; wherefore I am in small hope that any marriage
will grow this way. I pray God that some other amity may be accepted, and yet
I was at the first in full conceit that her Majesty meant earnestly to proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and that she had so advisedly thought of the matter, as any reason being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
it should not be refused: whereupon, as my part was, I did deal to the
furtherance thereof by all the good means I could, which not taking effect accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
I shall be most sorry; albeit I do not mistrust the goodness of God, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall fall out, it is his providence for the best, or at the least for our just
scourge for our deserts towards him. I can say no more, but Almighty God
strengthen her Majesties true zeal to Religion; and failing of this match, that she
will allie her self with such other Princes abroad as will earnestly joyn with her
therein. And for this matter of her Majesties marriage, you shall do well to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
all their doings upon this answer, and gather the certainty, as you may, what
they intend, whether to yield to her Majestie absolutely or no: if they will yield,
then it must needs proceed; if not, then must we provide in other sort, and
the sooner the better; and if they do accord to her Majesties request touching the
cause of Religion, certainly she saith, there shall be no other difficulty. God
direct us to his glory, and so I make an end of it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Cobham</hi> is returned out of <hi>Spain,</hi> where we have no cause to look for
any friendship. The King used him gently, but those of Authority and Credit
about him most proudly and arrogantly: What terms we stand in in other places,
is easily known. Thus are we with our neighbor, in all places without friendship.
God protect and defend us, who is onely able, and must do it for any policy is
used. Thus, with my most hearty commendations, I bid you heartily farewel.</p>

what resolution is to be taken; they have continued in Councel, chiefly about
this matter, about the space of five or six days, and yet cannot resolve what to

is, to send some person of good quality, as well to thank her Majestie for
her honourable proceeding in this cause, as also to desire continuance of good
amity. Of thus much I thought good to advertise her Majestie before hand and

me, touching your opinion of their cause. There is bred in them here now of
late, such a doubt before <hi>l' Archants</hi> arrival, of her Majesties disposition to marry,
as they know not how to proceed. This doubt is nourished by advertisements
come from the Scotish Ambassador there with you, who pretendeth to know all
secrets of State: If this distrust were not, no doubt of it Religion would not be
the let; but to yield in Religion, and afterwards to miss of their purpose, they
think would be a great touch in her. This difference, I fear me, will quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the matter; and therefore it behoveth her Majestie to look about her, being
invironed with many practises, the executions whereof have staid upon the event
of the match. I do what I can to procure continuance, or rather increase of amity.

between them, but that matter, as far as I can learn, will prove but a dream; and
now this match not proceeding (as they seem much to doubt it) the King, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
will be loath to attempt any thing against <hi>Spain,</hi> though his will that way be

Her Majesties liberality bestowed on <hi>l' Archant</hi> was very well imployed; for
none can speak more honourably of her then he doth; and as for your Lordship,
you have no cause to repent any courte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie shewed unto him, so good a report
doth he make. The like also doth one <hi>Cornet</hi> make, that accompanied <hi>l' Archant.</hi>
The Ambassador there, Monsieur <hi>de la Mot</hi> doth seek to salve all things
that may breed an opinion in them here, that her Majestie dealeth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then sincerely: his good offices that he hath done as well in this
cause, as otherwise, deserve honourable considerations at her Majesties
hands.</p>
                  <p>They have by the space of five or six days sate very hard in Councel about
this matter; no Councel dare devise, as I can learn, any thing in respect of the
distrust they have. I am put in good hope, that if they mind not to proceed,
yet they purpose to make choice of some one of good calling to send over, as well
to thank her Majestie for her sincere dealing in this matter, as also to desire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of amity.</p>
                  <p>This is as much as hitherto I can learn, touching their intention concerning
this matter, wherewith I thought good to dispatch this bearer; and after the

Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to advertise her Majestie, that after I had closed up
my first packet, thinking to have sent this Bearer presently with the same, Mr.
<hi>Cavalcant</hi> came unto me, sent by the Queen Mother, to request me to forbear
to sent to her Majestie for a day or two; in which time they would grow to
some through conclusion touching their answer; and that then it was the Kings
meaning to send for me, and to impart the same unto me; whereupon, I thought
good to stay for the satisfying of her request. According to her promise, I was
sent for by the King; at my access, he told me, that they had deliberated upon
the answer received from her Majestie by <hi>l' Archant,</hi> for that the same was of
great weight; and that his resolution, after long deliberation, was to send Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Foix</hi> forthwith unto her Majestie, with his full intention touching the
same, who he hoped should find her not so resolute touching the point of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And further, he willed me to tell her Majestie, whatsoever should come
of the cause, that in respect of her honourable and sincere dealing in the same,
and the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d to repose in him, she might assure herself as
much of his friendship, as of any other bodies in the earth; and that she had
full power to dispose of him, and of his Realm, to the benefit of her self, and
of her Subjects, whose sword should be always ready to defend her against any
that should attempt any thing against her. He joyned his words and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
so together, as great demonstration outwardly of inward good will could
not but be seen.</p>
                  <p>Having ended with the King, I repaired to Queen Mother, who used long
speech in shewing the great affection she bare to the cause; and that she was
sorry that so hard a point as Religion should be the let to hinder a match, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

                     </gap>,

she could hardly do that, for that it was a thing that touched his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
and reputation. I willed her again on the other side, to weigh what great
reason the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ueen my Mistress had, not to yield to that point. She shewed
me, that she could not deny but that her Majestie had some cause so to do
notwithstanding she hoped there would be some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elp found; the party whom
the King meant to send, being so grateful unto her Majestie, and having
sundry reasons to alledge, to shew both how inconvenient it would b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for her
Son to live without some kinde of toleration; as also, that there would
not follow by the same that inconvenience in her Estate, as she fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed. In
the end she concluded, whatsoever in the matter through this hard poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
should become, that both she and the King were infinitely bound unto

that for her own part, she would bear no less affection towards her, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nks for the great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
bestowed on his servant <hi>l' Archant,</hi> who had made such report of
her Majesties rare and Princely vertues, as it was an intolerable grief unto
him to see so great a block to lie in the way, as the point of Religion,
which so nearly touched both his Honour, and his Conscience, to keep
him from the attaining to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> good hap that ever in the world could
happen unto him. He protested how he wished, so that the same were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

fall out, I shall desire her to make account of me, as of a Champion
ready at all times to hazard my life in her defence during my life, against any
that shall attempt any thing against her.</p>
                  <p>This in effect is as much as passed from them at this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

affected as he is to her Majestie, he may stand her in great stead, therefore you
shall do well to advise her Majestie both honourably to use, and liberally to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him: And as for your particular part, you cannot be more beholden to
a stranger; I doubt not therefore, but that your Honour will use him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Touching the point of Religion, though some hope came lately from their
Ambassador of some toleration, they are grown more stiff in that point then
before. I am not to advise in so great a matter: What my opinion is in that
behalf, I refer your Lordship to my former Letters. Great practises are here for
the impeachment of this match; the <hi>P. Nuncio, Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> are daily
Courtiers to disswade this Match: The Clergy here have offered <hi>Monsieur</hi> a great
pension, to stay him from proceeding. In conclusion, there is nothing left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
that may be thought fit to hinder: For a day or two it was given out, that
the matter was quite broken, and that Monsieur had no meaning to procced. In
respect of this brute, at the time of my being at the Court, he used great words
of assurance, that there was no such matter; and that he remained still most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
affected; saying, that if it were his mishap not to proceed in this match, he
could not but think himself most unhappy. He protested, that he wished the loss
of an arm or a leg, as that difficulty might be so ordered, as he might not be
touched in Conscience and Honor. I used sundry perswasions to induce him
to content himself with the form of our Prayer, and not to stand so much
upon a toleration, which might be prejudicial both to her Majestie and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the match proceeding: In outward shew he seemed to have no dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>The desire I have to dispatch this bearer with some speed, will not suffer me any

I know not, because it hath so many overthrows both here and there: If it may

duly considered, this block may be removed, and the Amity that will be proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
profitably received.</p>
                  <p>The house of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> till of late days, was ever inferiour to <hi>England,</hi> and
so depended thereon, but now being tyed to the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> he is grown to
the greatness, as of inferior he is become superior; of a good quiet Neighbor, a
most dangerous and ambitious Neighbor; which we shall speedily finde, if we
do not speedily provide for it.</p>
                  <p>How evilly they rest satisfied with us in respect of the Injuries received, it is
well known; how naturally they are inclined to Revenge, the world hath had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
tryall of. If presently they forbear, it is not for lack of good will, but
in respect of the incommodity of the time, which if the jealousie between them
and <hi>France</hi> were taken away; we should soon see the experience thereof to renew
traffick with them, before they do think themselves revenged, or that their
pride or greatness be some way abated, were but to present them a fit opportunity
of revenge.</p>
                  <p>Now if the dangerous greatness of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> be well considered,
the miscontentment they have in respect of the injuries received, their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inclination to revenge, and the unseen traffick of our Merchants as yet:
These considerations well weighed, the case may seem somewhat altered.</p>
                  <p>And though <hi>France</hi> cannot yield like profit that <hi>Flanders</hi> doth, yet may it yield
some profit with less hazard, and more safety. In this case two things I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
chiefly:</p>
                  <p>First, That the house of <hi>Austria</hi> is become the Popes Champion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
enemy unto the Gospel, and daily practiseth the rooting out of the
same: And therefore we that are Professors of the Gospel, ought to oppose ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
selves against it.</p>
                  <p>The other, that the entrance into the league with <hi>France,</hi> will not onely be an
advancement of the Gospel there, but also elsewhere; and therefore, though it
yieldeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ot so much temporal profit, yet in respect of the spiritual fruit that
thereby may ensue, I think it worthy the imbracing; or rather to say better, I
think we have cause to thank God, that offereth us so good occasion, both to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his glory, and also for her Majesties safety. I doubt not but your Lordship
will do your uttermost, that this occasion offered may not grow to be fruitless.
And so most humbly desiring your Lordship to pardon these my scribled lines,
I leave further to trouble your Honour.</p>

                  <p>THe Spanish Ambassador having audience the sixth of this moneth, declared
to the King, that his Master could not endure the great spoils made by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ships of the P. of Orange, harboured in Rochel, where they made open sale
of the said spoils they take, contrary to all good amity. Besides, he shewed the
King, that he heard that C. L. had secret conference with his Majestie, who was a
Rebel, and sought to disquiet his Master by his indirect practises; therefore
he protested, that unless there grew some speedie redress thereof, there could
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54478:71"/>
not but grow was betwixt him and his Master. To this the King answered, that
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was a P. of the Empire, with whom he had good amity,
and therefore could not deny him the use of his Ports, no more then he doth to
all other Princes his Confederates. And as for conference had with the Count

                     </hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> he told him, that he was misinformed. But if it were so, said
he, what just cause should your Master have to complain, or to think himself
injured, he being also a Prince of <hi>Germany,</hi> and neither Pensionary nor Subject
of his Masters; and therefore he may not look to give Laws to <hi>France:</hi> And
as for fearing us with wars, you do mistake us; let every one, saith he, do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
what best liketh him. At Queen Mothers hands he found the like answer,
who is very much incensed against <hi>Spain,</hi> being throughly perswaded that her
daughter was poysoned.</p>
                  <p>They here of the Religion, do most humbly desire her Majestie, that in talk
with Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> it would please her to use some speech of liking of the
Kings calling of the Princes and the Admiral to the Court; and that it would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like her Majestie to say, that so rare a Subject as the Admiral is, was not to
be suffered to live in such a corner as <hi>Rochel:</hi> and though the King be now very
well affected towards him; yet they do assure themselves, that her Majesties
commendations (in respect of the great good will and reverence the King bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her) will very much advance his credit; for as I am informed sundry waies,
the King is glad when he may take occasion to praise her Majestie, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
how much he is bound unto her.</p>
                  <p>The King requested me, by Secretary <hi>Pynart,</hi> to recommend unto her Majestie
one <hi>Morris Chamails</hi> suit, whereof I send your Lordship herein enclosed, a copy
of the Bill he exhibited unto the King. I find them here reasonably inclined to do
justice with such expedition as this Countrey yieldeth in such causes as I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                  <p>We have received order from the King to repair to <hi>Blois,</hi> where the Princes
and the Admiral are to meet him about the first of this next moneth. There
are many practises to overthrow this journey, but the King sheweth himself to
be very resolute. I am most constantly assured, that the King conceiveth of no
subject that he hath, better then of the Admiral; and great hope there is, that the
King will use him in matters of greatest trust; for of himself he beginneth to
see the insufficiency of others: some, for that they are more addicted to others,
then to himself; others, for that they are more Spanish then French; or else given
more to private pleasures then publike: There is none of any account within this
Realm, whose aswel imperfections, as vertues, he knoweth not. Those that do
love him, do lament that he is so much given to pleasure; they hope the Admirals
access unto the Court will yield some redress in that case. Q. Mother seeing her
son so well affected towards him, laboureth by all means to cause him to think
well of her: she seemeth much to further the meeting.</p>
                  <p>The marriage between the P. of Navarre and the L. Margaret is not yet
throughly concluded, Religion being the onely let: the Gentlewoman being most
desirous thereof, falleth to reading of the Bible, and to the use of the Prayers used
by them of the Religion. The marriage between the P. of <hi>Conde</hi> and the Marquis
of <hi>List,</hi> is throughly concluded, as I hear. I refer your Lordship, touching the
privat state of my diseased body, as also of my purs, unto the bearers report, whom

                  <head>To the Right Honourable, and my very good Lord, the Lord of
Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to understand, that after C. L. had had sundry
secret Conferences with the King and Queen Mother; as also with certain
chosen Counsellours, he sent unto me, desiring me to devise some means how
we might meet secretly; whereupon we agreed upon the means, and so came to
conference.</p>
                  <p>First, he protested unto me, that upon the great good opinion he conceived
of me, by the report of those whom he did well credit, he did frankly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
unto me, both what passed between him and the King, and also the
present state of their cause. First he shewed unto me, that he declared unto
him, that he enterprize wherewith he had been made acquainted by others;
as also, he was presently to recommend unto him, might seem to be such
as he could neither in Honour nor Conscience imbrace nor attempt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he thought it fit for him to declare unto him, all such necessary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as were fit for him to know in that behalf, as well for the satisfying
of his Majestie, as also for his own honour, who would be loath to be so
evill an instrument, as to perswade a Prince to attempt that thing that
might not stand as well with Honour as Conscience. First he shewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, that the cause of taking up of Arms in the Low-Countreys, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
onely, upon that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> sought to plant there by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,
the foundation of a most horrible Tyranny, the overthrow of all
freedoms and liberties, a thing which his father <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, went about
to have established there; but seeing the same so much impugned by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the said Countrey, and that without their consent it could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
unless he should violently by tyranny seek the establishment of the
same, contrary both to his Oath and their Priviledges, he forbore to proceed
in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>After the resignation of his Government unto his Son, the Cardinal of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> practised secretly with the Cardinal of <hi>Arras,</hi> wars being then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>France</hi> and the Low Countreys, wishing them to advise the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> to grow to peace, discovering to him, that the King of <hi>France</hi> his
Father was reduced to that extremity, as he should be forced to yield to any
thing that the said King would request. Further, he signified unto him, that
unless there might grow peace between the two Princes, the Catholique Religion
could not long continue neither in <hi>France</hi> nor <hi>Flanders,</hi> so great increase
was daily here of Protestants, which could by no means be suppressed, but
by establishing of an Inquisition in both Countreys: Hereupon, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the said Cardinals, there grew a peace, how dishonourable for <hi>France,</hi>
he referred to the Kings own judgement. After the conclusion of the said Peace,
then did the Cardinal of <hi>Arras</hi> labour what he might, by sundry practises, to
plant the said Inquisition, seeking first by perswasion to induce men to like therof:
but as well Papists as Protestants misliked it, alledging, that it was against the
Kings oath, to seek to establish a thing so prejudicial to their priviledges, which
they were bound to maintain, whereof they could see nothing but mischief
would ensue, and general destruction of that Countrey; forasmuch as it would
overthrow all Forreign traffick, by which the Countrey was chiefly maintained<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
when he saw it would not be planted by way of perswasion, then sought he to do
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54478:72"/>
it by violence, which the Nobility foreseeing, they joyntly presented unto the
Regent a Bill, containing a declaration of the great and sundry inconveniences
that would ensue, if they proceeded in the establishing of the same. Further,
they made choice of two Noble men, whom with one consent they sent into
<hi>Spain,</hi> to declare in all their names, the great mischiefs that should follow if the
King should proceed therein; and that it lay not in their power to retain the
people from taking arms, so much were they incensed against the said Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and therefore they desired that the allowing or disallowing of the same
might be committed over to the Assembly of the three Estates. Of these
doubtful means no redress followed, but still the said Cardinal and his fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
proceeded in seeking to establish it, contrary to all order and equity. How
afterwards the people took arms, how the Nobility that were joyntly united
to oppose themselves against the said Inquisition, were after by practise and
corruption divided, what Tyranny hath been used by the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>
since his coming hither, and how insolently he hath behaved himself, both
towards his Majestie and the Queen of <hi>England</hi> (although unhonourable for
them both, in respect of their greatness, at such a petty companions hands)
how his brother the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> sought their delivery from so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a servitude, though it pleased God at that time to make him the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who onely knoweth a sit time of the deliverance of the oppressed
by the said Tyrant, seeking by all means to be rid of the same, did of late
exhibite unto the Emperour at his last Assembly at <hi>Spires,</hi> a book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
their griefs, requesting him, with all humility, to be a means for
their delivery from this their oppression (a thing appertaining to his calling,
and the place he beareth in Christendom) To this the Emperour, in respect
of the hope he hath of <hi>Spain</hi> gave a cold ear. They now seeing themselves
void of all help, their natural Prince being so carried away by corruption of
Councel, from the due consideration that belongeth to a good Prince to
have of good Subjects, as he neither regardeth his Oath, nor maintenance of
such Priviledges as were confirmed by his Predecessors, nor the dutiful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the proceeding of the Nobility in seeking by way of humble petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
redresses of their griefs, thinking themselves in conscience discharged
from all duty of obedience, they now throw themselves down before his
Majestie with all humility, beseeching him to take them to his protection,
and to procure their deliverance from the present Tyranny. Now your
Majestie seeth the state of their cause (saith he) you shall do well to weigh
with your self, whether the goodness thereof may incourage you to become
Protector of this people, reduced by Tyranny to great extremity by seeking
their deliverance. If you think in Conscience and Honour you may not, you
shall do well to forbear, for otherwise the success cannot be good: If you
think you may, then weigh in policy how beneficial it will be for you,
and how much your Father would have given to have had the like opportunity
offered unto him, that is now presented unto you <hi>Gratis,</hi> which if you refuse,
the like you must never look for. With this he shewed me, that both the
King and Queen Mother seemed to be very well satisfied; and that the
King said, that like Counsellours by violating of his Edict, had well
nigh brought him into like terms with his Subjects, whereof ensued the
late trouble; and that therefore now he thanked God that he had opened
his eyes to discern what their meaning was. The King thus imformed by him,
touching such circumstances as might induce him to think the enterprize both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
and just: he then proceeded, as he shewed me to declare the easiness and
great liklihood of good success of the same. First, he shewed me, that all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54478:72"/>
of the Low-Countries generally, aswel of the one religion as of the other,
do mislike the Spanish tyranny, and do desire nothing more then to be rid of the
same. Secondarily, that all the Towns M. A. are ready to receive such Garrisons as
shall be sent thither by order from his Brother. Thirdly, that other Towns
upon his Frontiers whensoever they shall see any forces approach, will be ready
to receive them. Fourthly, that the present forces that the King of Spain hath
there (whom he may trust) are not in number 3000. Fiftly, that with a dozen
ships beside those that presently they have, they will keep the Seas, as no Spanish
Forces shall come thither by Sea. Lastly, that the Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> are most
willing to joyn in the said enterprize; so that the King will be content with
Flanders and Artois, which once pertained to the Crown of France; and that
Brabant, Gelderland, and the land Luxenburgh, which once were fees of the
Empire, might be united again to the same, and as for Zealand, and the rest of
the Islands (said he) they wish the Q. of England had them, so that she would be
content to joyn in this enterprize.</p>
                  <p>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter he had made the King acquainted with these likelyhoods, he seemed
very well to like them, especially if the Q. of England might be brought to
be a party, and to joyn with him, and the Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> in the said en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
and therefore wished shee might be moved as from himself, to see how
she were inclined in that behalf; for, saith he, if she being Lady of the narrow Seas,
do joyn in the matter with us. I weigh not the King of Spain, nor all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates.
He told me then that he shewed the King, that (as he thought) she
had been moved in that behalf already, and that as he heard she was not enclined
to be a dealer therein, howbeit he knew not how her Majestie, upon better
consideration, might sithence like thereof. The matter being thus propounded
to the King and Q. Mother, afterwards it came to be considered of by certain
chosen Councellers; who all liked of the enterprize, and saw great reason not
to neg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ect it: Onely they saw two things to be provided for, before they could
advise them to enter into the same; the one, that he should first establish some
goo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> league with England, the Princes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and that he meant presently
to send <hi>ae Foix</hi> into England, whose friendship and confederacy imported him
very much, for that the Princes of Germanie depended onely upon knowing
how she would be enclined, for that without her they would enter into no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy.
For the help of the second, he said, the King meant to tax generally
through his Realm the Clergie with the payment of one years revenue.</p>
                  <p>This is asmuch as he imparted unto me, touching his proceeding with the
King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saving that he shewed me, That it is secretly agreed on between him and
the King, that <hi>Strozza,</hi> who should imbarque about the midst of the next
month, shall do some enterprize in Spain, onely to amaze the King there, whom
the King here meaneth notwithstanding to disallow openly.</p>
                  <p>Touching their State, he telleth me, they have much to do to bridle the people
of the Low-Countrey from discovering of themselves, by committing some rash
enterprize; and that they find the Papists no lesse inclined then the Protestants, to
seek with hazard of their lives deliverance from their present tyranny. They
find lack of money the greatest let, having been much disapointed by them
here, the greatest help they have that way is from the D. of F. Before winter
they mean to do nothing, and then onely their intent is to enter into the T. M.
then in the spring following (if God shall so direct their intentions) they me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> also their

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> desired me to propound to her Majestie on his behalf these particular points
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54478:73"/>
following. First, whether her Majestie can be content to joyn with him and the
Prince of Orange in the enterpize. Secondarily, whether upon the former assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
offered, her Majestie can be content to lend unto them the sum they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
Thirdly, that it would please her Majestie to suffer <hi>Hawkins</hi> underhand
to serve them with certain s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ips, and also to licence him to furnish them with
certain victualls to be transported from thence, whereof they have present
need. Lastly, that it may please her Majestie to suffer certain Walloons, being
presently in Rye to the number of 800. to embarque themselves to repaire hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For the first, he desireth her Majestie to consider how it will be no less
honour for her to unite Zealand to the Crown of England, then it was dishonour
for her sister to lose Calais: and further, that by having Zealand, she shall have
the key of the Low-Countries; she shall have a place allwayes for her ships
to enter in unto to avoid thereby aswell the danger of the enemie, as of the
tempest. Besides, she having Zealand, shall be better able to gather the Princes
of Germanie, enjoying Brabant, and the rest of the Countries (which were late
federatories to the Empire) to bridle F. for being overgreat. And lastly, that
this enterprise being done by Protestants, they receiving the honour thereof,
shall be better able by increase of credit with the King; to continue his good
devotion toward her, in respect of the rare favours which they have received at
her hands, which they both do and alwayes will acknowledge. For the second,
he desireth her Majestie to consider, how evill affected Spain is towards her:
how he thinketh himself injured in respect of the arrest; how naturally they
are inclined to revenge, though outwardly (till convenient time do serve) they
can dissemble their malice: how he intertaineth at his great Costs a subject of
hers lately departed out of Ireland, as also other Rebells of hers that daily repaire
into Flanders, who onely are stayed from molesting her at home, in respect of
the fame that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi> hath of his Brothers enterprize; And lastly,
how he is become a Protector of the Q. of Scots her dangerous enemy (which
she knoweth to be true.) Now if the lending of so small a sum may somewhat
enable them to abate the pride of so great an enemy, and cause her Majestie to
spare the spending of ten times so much besides the hazard of her estate and
people; he desires her Majestie to weigh it in reason, whether the disbursing may
not stand with good policy. Touching the third, he saith, that by having
those ships of <hi>Hawkins</hi> he shall be able to keep more Spaniards (who being
settled there may become dangerous neighbours) from landing in Flanders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the victuals presently required, shall serve to furnish <hi>Strozza,</hi> whose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
going forward, cannot but kindle warre betwixt France and Spain,
though the King disavow him, he being a person of that quality here in respect
of his office, whereby at the least her Majestie may be looker on with her
more safety: For the last, he hopeth that her Majestie will make no difficulty,

                  <p>After he had thus imparted unto me, those things which he would have me
to propound unto her Majestie; as also, such reasons as might induce her to
like thereof; I shewed him, that I would do the duty of an Ambassador, I
would advertise them, and referre it to her Majestie to resolve therein as
might seeme unto her best to resolve with her honour and safety; and that for
my part I could neither put him in comfort or discomfort. He requested me
to beseech her Majestie in his behalf, that it would please her to send her
resolution to those points with some convenient speed, for that their case requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to know her intention in that behalf out of hand; and therefore she would
hold him excused for his importunity, being pressed thereto by necessity.
Furthermore he desired me to advertise her Majestie, whereas he understood
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54478:73"/>
that divers (under colour of serving his Brother and him by sea) had committed
sundry ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

doth utterly dissavow, wishing her Majestie to extend towards them such
punishment as they deserve. And for the avoiding of such inconveniences, they
mind hereafter to send some secret token to the <hi>L. Admirall,</hi> wherby they indeed
that do serve them may be discerned from them that falsely do usurpe their
names; leaving the same for a colour, having no other intention then to spoile
aswell friends as foes. Thus leaving further to trouble your honour at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,

                  <head>To the Right Honourable and my very good Lord, the Lord of
Leicester.</head>
                  <p>I Referre your Lordship to my Letters written to my Lord of <hi>Burleigh,</hi>
touching my conference with A. I beseech your Lordship so farre forth as
you may further his requests, as those that tend to the advancement of
Gods glory, and the Q. Majesties safety, I think it dangerous to advise a Prince
to wars, for that the issue of wars is doubtfull: notwithstanding things may
so fall out sometimes, as nothing can be more dangerous then not to enter
into wars; wars grounded on ambition for increase of Dominion, are alwayes
unjust; but warres grounded on necessity, for safety sake are necessary.
I leave to your Lordship to judge by consideration of the state of things, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
at home as abroad; whether necessity doth not urge us thereto at this
present one supplying my place, onely beholding the state of things abroad, and
not understanding the inward secrets of home matters, may rather gesse then
presently know, what is meet in so weighty a cause; notwithstanding I am bold
privately to discover unto your Lordship my folly, in setting down mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of a matter, both without the compasse of my calling, as also my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
First, I conclude, that we rest in evill terms with Spain, whereof
there must grow redresse either by composition, or by sword. Redresse by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
may seeme scarce sure, as that which will serve their turn but for awhile,
they can disguise their malice for a time. Redresse by sword comparing our
forces with theirs, may appeare at the first sight to be void of all possibility; but,
if you consider the oppertunity that this present time offereth, that doubt to
mans judgment may soone be avoided, though victory (aswell as other things else
are) is in the hands of God, who many times disposeth the same contrary to
mans judgment; but foreseeing and judging of likelihoods, as men may foresee
and judge, there is great appearance, that the pride of Spain may be so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
daunted, as we need not feare their mallice. The remedie perhaps may
seeme more dangerous then the disease, for, in seeking to abate the pride of
Spain, we may advance another, whose greatness will contain no less danger.
For the answering whereof, your Lordship shall understand that thus standeth
the case: The Princes of Germanie, who can be content to be parties in the
enterprize, do foresee, that if the whole Low-Countrey might be united to the,
Crown of France, it would grow too great; they mean to capitulate with him to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54478:74"/>
content himself with Flanders and Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ois, which once pertained to the Crown.
And as for Brabant and other parts, which once pertained to the Empire, they
mean to reduce them to their old state, committing the goverment thereof to
some P. of Germanie, which in reason cannot be but to the Prince of Orange.
Holland and Zealand they wish were united to the Crown of England, which
they desire for two respects; the one to make the enterprize more easie, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her assistance, the other, the better to bridle France; if he seek to exceed
his portion. If the enterprize might proceed in this order, both the remedie
will prove lesse dangerous, and also the successe more likely to be proseperous.
These 3 united (all circumstances considered) to mans judgement, the matter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but take; for whiles this is a doing in the Low-Countrys, Spain must not
look to be quiet in Italy? but if her Majestie will not be a party, then neither
can there grow unto her that honour, profit and surety that otherwise were to be
wished. If these then may take place, upon the likelihoods, two mischiefs may
thereby be avoided. First, the malice of him that is mighty, and hath good
will to revenge. Secondly, the greatness of another, who perhaps otherwise may
grow a dangerous neighbour. A third mischief may be avoided, of no lesse,
or rather greater consequence; which is, that those who otherwise will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
live quietly at home, may be kept occupied by being imployed abroad.
For the avoidance of these three great mischiefs, it seemeth, that to enter into
wars hath necessity for ground. These (as I protested unto your Lordship) to one
that seeth but the outward bark of things, may seeme to carry great consequence
of reason, but to your Lordship, who seeth inwardly into the matter, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to contain more danger then safety, howsoever it be, our diseased state,
through inward division, well considered, though her Majestie be no dealer in
the matter, yet it behoveth her to incourage others, and that she may (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
she hath done) take profit of others troubles; for surely we must make
this accompt, that their peace will be the beginning of our wars. In my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
we are rather to weigh inward, then outward mischiefs; the outward great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of France, cannot endanger us so much as the inward dissention at home,
which lacketh but some foreign aid to bring the matter to some dangerous triall;
the case then standeth so, as for the staying of our inward mischiefs, we are to
seek for outward remedies, which is, to grow by other mens harms. I do not
doubt, but that your Lordship will do what you may so to deale with her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
as that some of the C. requests may take place, whereby the fire that
is now a kindling may grow a flame, and we take comfort of the heat thereof.
I preceive nothing will so much advance the matter, as for her Majestie to give
some countenance to the same. The proud Spaniard (whom God hath long
used for the rod of his wrath) I see great hope that he will now cast him
into the fire, that he may know what it is to serve against God. I would
your Lordship knew the Gentleman; for courage abroad, and counsell at
home they give him here the reputation to be another <hi>Ol:</hi> he is in speech elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
&amp; pithy; but which is chiefest, he is in Religion, as Religious in life as he is
sincere in profession. I hope God hath raised him up in these days, to serve for
an instrument for the advancement of his glory. I beseech your Lordship to
credit this bearer touching my particular state: To whom, leaving to trouble
your Honour at this present, I refer you. I beseech your Lordship to procure out
of hand, that I may know what her Majestie meaneth to do in this matter.</p>

Foix</hi> came to her Majesties presence. I fear the offers of so great Amitie will
diminish or divert the former intention of the marriage, without which the French
Amity shall serve to small purpose, but to make us ministers of their appetites,
and those fulfilled, to cast us off. Surely I could have wished that the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

days near hand first, by reason of the other matters which <hi>de Foix,</hi> who had his

He standeth stiff to have Religion for Monsieur, her Majestie standeth as stiff in

                  <p>TRusty and Well-beloved, we greet you well; and though we think you
had some great desire to hear how Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> hath here proceeded
with us in his charge; and the rather, because we understand, that within a
few days after the first Speech with us, and Conference with our Councel,
he dispatched Letters or Message thither; yet surely, until this present,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54478:75"/>
we could not ascertain you of any thing certainly concluded with him, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that he being not satisfied with our answers, doth still persist in seeking to
induce us to reform our answer more towards his satisfaction, But now you
shall understand, that he and the Ambassador Resident having had sundry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
with us, and apart with our Councel, at all times the weight of the
matter hath chiefly depended upon the cause of Religion: For they requiring a
toleration, and we denying, they offering to have it tempered and moderated, as
our Councel shall devise, to avoid offence of our Conscience, and of the Dukes,
the same was found always either impossible, or so hard, as by no device such a
mean in plain terms, by words or writing, could be found to satisfie them or our
selves: So as in the end they desired, as we would be content to agree secretly,
that he should not be impeached in the secret use of his Religion, if we would not
consent to a toleration; and so you shal see by writing, which you shal receive here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
what hath been said by our Councel thereto; and with the same writing also
two answers to two other matters by them onely propounded, because to the same
there was no answer satisfactory given in our former writings to their first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
In this writing now delivered to them, we perceived them most
troubled with a phrase added of great necessity for our purpose, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for satisfying of our conscience, that the Duke shall not be molested
for using of any Rites not repugnant unto the word of God, which words
being in a writing delivered unto them first the one and twentieth of this
moneth, was afterwards now in the last of <hi>August</hi> by their importunity, as now
you see altered from the words <hi>Verbo Dei</hi> to <hi>Ecclesiae Dei,</hi> which in our judgment
is all one; and yet finding themselves therewith better content then with the
other, we yielded to have it so altered. Besides this writing, because we know
not how our answer in the Article of Religion shall be there imparted, we have
also by express speech declared to Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> that as we shall be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that our answer may satisfie Monsieur <hi>de Anjou</hi> for his honour, for that we
have in some sort yielded to him to use other Ceremonies then ours; so that as
they be not repugnant to the Church of God, and with such other cautions as in
our writing are further contained; so our meaning is to be declared plainly to
Monsieur <hi>de Anjou,</hi> that we cannot permit him at his coming to have the use of
any private Mass, which speech we have plainly uttered unto him because there
should no misconceiving be gathered of our answer, whereby the Duke might
hope of a sufferance; for that we cannot find it, without peril of our Estate, and
quietness to yield thereunto. And thus having imparted unto you how we have
answered him, we will that you also after the consideration of the same, and of
the answer given unto him in writing, which we herewith send, shall resort to the
King, and affirm the same to be our mind. And if you shall find them doubtful
how to interpret our answer, that is, whether we having our mind satisfied in the
cause of Religion, can be content to proceed in the marriage. You shall assure
the King, that the rest of the things being by him assented unto, and ordered
to be performed; we mean, sincerely to proceed in further treaty of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
according to our former answer. And if they shall so move it unto
you, we can be content that special Commissioners may be sent from thence
hither, to treat and conclude with us and our Councel, as reason shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
And for that we have causes to think, that sundry there, and some
being of Credit, will seek to provoke the King to a misliking of our answer,
and to conceive that we have not had a sincere intention in this matter from
the beginning, you shall do your best, and so we warrant you, to assure the
King of the contrary, whatsoever malice shall devise against us: And where
we had occasion by some of your Letters to some here, to think that now at
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54478:75"/>
Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> coming hither, though the matter of the Marriage should
not take effect, yet that some motion of a further league of Amity might
be made betwixt us and the King. You shall understand, that not only no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath been made thereof unto us, but upon indirect speeches used by some
of our trusty Ministers to <hi>de Foix</hi> in that purpose: he hath earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that without prosecution of the marriage, he had no Commission to
deal in any other matter at all; but said, that he usted that the King his
Master would continue Amity with us, except contrary cause should be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by us. Now therefore considering you may see that we have not made
any great difficulty in the matter of Religion, which we cannot see how it may
be yielded unto Monsieur and his Domestiques, though the number shall be
never so small without peril, by discontentation of our best Subjects, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to the worse, it shall be your part to insist earnestly to let it be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
how sincerely we have dealt therein, and how free we ought to be
from the calumniation of certain persons that will never be content to say
well of us, how well soever we do. The occasion of the long abode here of
Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> shall appear to you, we doubt not, by the Letters of my
Lord of <hi>Burleigh.</hi> As for satisfaction of your desire to have some to assist
you in service now this moneth, whilest you shall attend the recovery of your
health; upon the next answer to be made us of these our Letters, you
shall also have order for some to be assistant to supply your place.</p>

                  <head>To the Right honourable, and my very Friend Francis Walsingham <abbr>Esq</abbr>
her Majestes Ambassador Resident in France.</head>
                  <p>SIr, as we here upon dispatches sent thither to you, do not hear of long time
of any answer from you, are unquiet in our minds for the desire we have to
understand the process of the causes in hand; so I am assured you have not been
out of trouble and care, in that you have not of long time heard from hence,
in what sort Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> hath treated, or rather been handled; but this
shall content you to think, and therefore I do assure you, that the negotiation
hath had almost as many changes, though not in contrarieties, yet in varieties,
as it hath had days of conferences, and sometimes moe: If I may truly report,
that in some one days act, one part of the day hath not been so seasonable as the
other; and therefore judge you, if you had been advertised from one time to
another, how dissonant the same might have been in your ears, how deformed
in your eye; and percase as herewith you may be justly grieved, so would you
ask of me the just cause thereof if you were with me, which I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to declare conjecturally, as I might, but to write hereof, I do forbear, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that by other your friends Letters you will guess. Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> hath
had seven or eight special conferences with her Majestie, and with us of her
Councel. And at the first he found such favourable answers, as he accounted
the matter his own to call you truly the 3368 <hi>tu</hi> wholly added with a certain
circumscribld 4 s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>t</hi> 418 and if any of them have principally or
indirectly impugned the same, as I cannot affirm truly therein, he nor they shall
have hereafter a quiet conscience. Indeed we have cause to think, that some
for proof practising particularity, have troubled quiet waters, God give them
grace to repent their errours.</p>
                  <p>The answers have been since they were first given in words, altered in writing;
and directed so to be to the worse; and thereby the Ambassador have been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perplexed to find the latter harder then the first; and yet now as you shall see
the words for the point of Religion, thus her Majestie is resolved, and so she doth
pronounce to her Councel, whom she seeth earnestly bent by all means to further
this marriage for her own surety, and for the avoiding of the inevitable Ruine of
this <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that surely so as Monsieur will forbear the mass, she will assent to
the marriage; and this she confirmeth with all good speeches to give credit; but
yet all of us are not so perswaded, not for doubt of her assertions, which surely
are agreeable to her mind when she uttereth them, but for doubt that others mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
the same, may indirectly draw her from her determination. If you require
of me what you may say, her Majesties Letters will warrant you for words, but
what you may hope will succeed, I can no more ascertain you, then I can my
self, who am now to expect at Gods hands blessing or vengeance, for it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his Majestie will no longer dissemble his determinations: In the mean time, the
beholding of this cloud, the time to creep nearer by prayer for fear, and reverence
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54478:77"/>
of his mercy, and to beseech him to direct the heart of her Majestie to chuse
that which may be most to his glory. Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> hath had good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
in all external offices, well used by her Majestie, defrayed for his diet
at the time he hath been near the Court; and in coming and returning, my Lord
of <hi>Buck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>urst</hi> hath very courteously and honourably accompanied him, during his
being here; and to increase his honour, I caused my Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi> to attend
on him in sundry places; and by the way from <hi>London</hi> hither to <hi>Wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en,</hi> he
dined at my house, as I doubt not but he and the Resident Ambassador have seen
my hearty devotion to the marriage; and indeed, so is my judgement therein
confirmed; as I am not ashamed to utter my self; howsoever, it may be peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to me when it shall not take place; you see also, how openly I deal with
you. I have declared to her Majestie, the necessary occasion that you have this
present moneth to attend Physick, whereby the place you hold were meet to
be supplyed by some such as her Majestie shall think convenient, but I cannot
have her direction fully to be declared: But she saith, that upon the next an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to come from you, she will give you either authority to appoint <hi>Beal</hi> in
your place as your Substitute, or she will send Master <hi>Killigrew</hi> thither. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Foix</hi> hath very earnestly moved her Majestie to send some one person
of credit to the French King, to affirm and justifie the reasons of her answer;
or rather, if the Marriage shall not take place, to enter into the Treaty of some
straiter allyance and confederacy, which for my part I thought very reasonable,
and did assent and move the same; but finding now that he hath secretly named
me for that place, I do coldlie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> deal therein, knowing both my insufficiency,
and doubting of the success thereof; but whether any shall come, or who shall, I
surely cannot gess.</p>
                  <p>The Queens Majestie would have you to enquire what becometh of <hi>Liggons</hi>
my Lord of <hi>Norfolks</hi> servant, that hath of long time been about <hi>Paris</hi> and the
Court. Here is some matter presently discovered, that my Lord of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
should still mind this matter of the Scotish Queen; for there is intercepted a
good portion of money in gold, that was (and by Letters in Cypher) directed
to my Lord of <hi>Harrife,</hi> for help of the Scotish Queens party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
the same was sent by one <hi>Higford</hi> the Dukes Secretary, who was by order
from hence taken and committed at <hi>London,</hi> and this day is examined by Sir
<hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> who yesterday went thither for that purpose. What will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
I cannot now write, but sorry I shall be that my Lord of <hi>Norfolk</hi> shall be
found undutiful; and yet if he be, I am glad it shall be known, and so I end
with my prayer.</p>

Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to advertise her Majestie, that according to
her order prescribed me by her Letters, bearing date the second of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
I made report unto the King here of that which passed in sundry Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between her Majestie and his Ministers Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> and his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
Resident, as also apart with her Majesties Councel. His answer was,
that he had great cause to give her Majestie thanks for her honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ainment
given unto <hi>de Foix.</hi> until whose coming he could say nothing in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of that which had passed by conference. He protested, that he desired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then straight Amity with her Majestie; and therefore thinking mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
the best means for the accomplishing thereof, it should be no small grief
unto him if the same should not take place, whereby that perfect Amity might
ensue that might be beneficial to both the Crowns: This was the effect of
this present answer. Her Majestie is very much beholding to the D 3. who
standeth most earnestly in defence of her honour, against any that seek any way
to touch the same; she seemeth to think her self much bound to her Majestie,
for that it pleased her Majestie to vouchsafe once to write, I suppose a few lines
of thanks bestowed on her again from her Majestie, would win her to be a good
instrument to give advertisements of such things as are sit for her Majestie to
know. Queen Mother is much governed by her, and therefore she may be the
better able to do the greater good. And if may further please her Majestie to
bestow some ring on her, I think the profit that would grow thereof in time, will
make her Majestie think it well bestowed. Of late there is a great sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to the sum of 15000 franks, made here in <hi>Poictu</hi> by the Queen of Scots
Officers, an the same barrel'd up and sent to <hi>Paris,</hi> and from thence as I hear it
shall be conveyed into <hi>Scotland</hi> to those of her faction there; yet as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that ill success that the money that they sent before had, maketh them to
stand in doubt to convey it by sea, and therefore if they may conveniently, they
would rather make it over to <hi>London</hi> by exchange; whereunto (by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
order) if there may an eye be had, it will easily be discovered, the sum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so great. The Admiral arrived here the twelfth of this Moneth. Touching
the manner of his receiving, I refer you to the report of this Gentleman Mr.
<hi>Lyster,</hi> her Majesties servant, whom I have throughly instructed what I have
truly learned in that behalf. The day after his arrival, he sent a Gentleman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me with this Message, that (in respect of the place I hold) he was bound for
the great favour shewed by her Majestie, generally unto them of the Religion,
in the time of their necessity, as also particularly unto his Brother, to have come
and visited me; but he desired me to consider what suspicion would grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which might rather do harm then good; notwithstanding he assured me, that
her Majestie should always find him ready to serve her, with the hazard both of
life and goods, whensoever any occasion should be presented, to shew the affection
and good will he beareth her Majestie, in respect of the bond he oweth her. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
all those of the religion, who are the flower of <hi>France,</hi> do make like protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
assuring her Majestie, that when occasion or tryal shall be offered, she shall
find them no less ready to serve her, then if they were her own natural Subjects.</p>
                  <p>The Marriage between the Prince of <hi>Navarre</hi> is not so forward as Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was in preparation at <hi>Paris,</hi> who had provided both Jewels and Wedding-garments.
The onely impediment as I hear is Religion.</p>
                  <p>There departeth shortly, towards the concluding of this matte towards the Q. of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54478:78"/>
                     <hi>Navarre,</hi> who is now gone to <hi>Arragon,</hi> to certain Baynes there, for her health
<hi>Byron</hi> and <hi>Bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Co. <hi>Lo.</hi> left a man here of purpose to attend her Majesties answer touching
those things that I propounded on his behalf, in my letter sent by Mr. <hi>Dannet.</hi>
The resolution of that enterprize stayeth onely upon the expectation what her
Majestie will do; and it is feared, that the matter will be so long protracted, as
the opportunity of the enterprize will be let slip; which if it so fall out, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness
between this Crown and <hi>Spain</hi> will be reconciled, which I fear will not
tend most to her Majesties safety, and so do as many fear, as love her Majesty here.
The house of <hi>Guise</hi> secretly doth travel by all means to break the Amity with
<hi>England,</hi> for that they think nothing will more prejudice the Queen of Scots
their Kinswoman then the same. Touching my own private estate, my disease
groweth so dangerously upon me, as I most humbly desire her Majestie to take
some speedy order for some to supply my place. I hope my life shall stand her
Majestie in more stead then my death, and upon these extream points standeth
the defering of the cure; I hope therefore her Majestie will have consideration
of it accordingly. Thus leaving further to trouble your Lordship at this present,
I most humbly take my leave.</p>

Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to advertise her Majestie, that within three days
after Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> arrival, the King sent for me; and after my access un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, he willed me first, in his name, to thank her Majestie for the honourable
entertainment given unto <hi>de Foix,</hi> which he did repute to be done unto himself,
for that it was done for his sake. Secondarily, he willed me to shew unto her, that
he was glad to understand by him, and receive at so good restimony of the great
affection that her Majestie beareth unto him; and of the desire she had, not onely
to continue in good Amity with him, but also to encrease the same. Lastly, he
willed me to shew unto her, that her answer touching the point of Religion is
very hard; and that therefore he trusteth, that the Gentleman whom he is put in
hope she will send over, shall have authority to qualifie the same; as also, to treat
of some other matters to be propounded, that may tend to the encrease of further
Amity, which he above all things desireth, who shall be unto him very welcome;
and that he will strive with her in honouring of such Ministers as shall come from
her Majestie, whereby the good will he hath to honour her may appear. After he
had ended in this behalf, he desired me to recommend again unto her Majestie
<hi>Moris Chamails</hi> the Brittain, on whose behalf he had lately written, and sent his
Letters unto his Ambassador, to be delivered unto her Majesty; and that he hoped
for his sake, that the said party should receive redress, and come to an end of his
long suit, whereby he might have more cause to yield like justice to her Majesties
Subjects, at such time as they shall have recourse unto him for the same. In this
behalf I understand, that the Councel here have promised him, that if by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors means his cause shall receive no end, that then he shall have a Letter of
Mart given him. I find him very importunate, and one that maketh very lewd
reports, how that he hath been put in fear of his life, and that therefore he dare
not return to follow his suit. I beseech your Lordship, that by your means, I may
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54478:78"/>
receive some order from her Majestie how to answer him. I was sent unto by
the Lord Admirall to desire your Lordship to be a mean unto her Majestie,
that whereas there was delivered unto his late brother, the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> a Bill
signed with her Majesties hand for the receipt of certain Jewells engaged, that
it would please her Majestie for that the said Bill is onely signed, and not sealed;
which being sent unto me, they will deliver the other unsealed upon the receipt
of the same. This he willed me to shew you that he doth it rather to content
the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> then that he thinketh the other bill insufficient, who
thinketh his said Brother to have used some negligence in this behalf. Thus
leaving further to trouble your Lordship, at this present, I most humbly take my
leave.</p>

as others in the <hi>Meridionall</hi> have: howsoever Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> or the French
Ambassador shall advertise of the cause now happened concerning the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> this is the truth, and so you may avow it. The money was taken being
by the Dukes commandment as he avoweth and confesseth, received by <hi>Barker</hi> his
man from the French Ambassador, to have been sent to <hi>Banister,</hi> the Dukes man
dwelling about <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> to one <hi>Lowther,</hi> and other of the Dukes servants
secretly kept upon the West-borders, and by him should have been sent to the
Lord <hi>Harries,</hi> and by him to <hi>Riddington.</hi> There was in the Bag also Letters
from the French Ambassador to <hi>Viraque</hi> in Cipher, hereof Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi>
made mention before his departure, and did think there was no other matter
against the Duke, which I would there had not, but sith there was much other
of great danger, God is to be thanked that it is discovered as now it is. There is
found a long discourse about the D. sent from the Queen of Scots, in Cipher to
him the 7 of <hi>February</hi> last, by which the said Q. layeth before the D. how she is
Councelled from Spain, to fly into Spain, misliking utterly of the French, by
reason of the doubt of the Q. marriage with <hi>Anjou.</hi> She doth also use hard words
against the Queen Mother; she doth also in this discourse conclude, that she will
make a semblance to the Spaniard of the liking of Don <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
she assureth the Duke of Norfolk of her countenance; she moveth that
<hi>Ridolf</hi> may be sent to Rome, and to be directed wholly by the Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk;
with many moe things of such sort. The Duke hath confessed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
of this from the Queen of Scots, but denieth he was privie of <hi>Ridolfs</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
otherwise then that he was earnestly required by the Bishop of Ross to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
him, and write by him to the Duke of Alva, to require aid of men and
money for the Queens party in Scotland; wherein he saith, he did refuse to deal
for the perill thereof: He confessed that he had received four Letters from the
Scotish Queen within this Twelve months, and did answer them by Writing,
and all in Cyphering; but his were only of Thanks, and to move the Queen of
Scots to depend only upon the Queens Majesty; but herein the Duke
can make none of us to credit him: He saith also, that before the sending of
this money, he helped the French Ambassador to send his Packet to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racque</hi>
in July: We have also found his Cypher betwixt the Scotish Queen and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54478:79"/>
him, but all his writings are conveyed which he saith were by him burnt: Now
have we great cause to think that he was privy to the dangerous practise whereof
we found <hi>Ridolph</hi> to have dealt in with the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> in offering him that
a Rebellion should be moved here this Summer, if the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> would
assist it; but of this the Duke will not be known. But we do find more presently a
smell that 258. Deep, whereas <gap reason="symbol" extent="26 letters">

                     </gap> are at this time much perplexed herewith, and secretly
disposed to no good; but there is waite laid upon them. Now for Scotland,
the fourth of this moneth, <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Hamilton,</hi> with others to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 300 secretly stole into Sterling in the night, by Corruption of one
<hi>Bell</hi> of Sterling, who had a postern of a wall into the privy Garden;
they addressed themselves to the lodging of the Earle of <hi>Lennox,</hi> the Regent
<hi>Morton, Glencarn,</hi> Lord <hi>Rithill, Mookgill,</hi> and suddenly without any great resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
took them; and was carrying them out of the Town with intent
to have killed them; but rescue came out of the Castle, and so they were all
saved but the Regent, who was slain with a pistolet by one <hi>Calder,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken, confessed that <hi>Huntley,</hi> and Lord <hi>Hamilton</hi> did so command him;
he is executed, and so also is <hi>Bell</hi> that betrayed the Town; the Regent lived
8 houres and died stoutly and godly. The Earle of <hi>Marre</hi> is by Parliament
chosen Regent. The Earles of <hi>Argile, Cassills, Egliton,</hi> and <hi>Crawford,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Bloy,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Iames Finch</hi> are sworn to the Regent. There are Letters
on the way to the Queens Majestie from the now Regent by <hi>Cockburn,</hi> who is
also come into France. A. seemeth very sorry that the matter of Deep, in
which D. at this time is so backward, and still she hopeth that you will set Deep <gap reason="symbol" extent="9 letters">

saith, untill she heare from you, she cannot tell whom to send thither. The
French Ambassador is earnest to have his money again; and I answer his
Secretary, that it must be demanded of them to whom he delivered it;
wherewith he is much offended with me.</p>

                  <p>SIr, after the writing of my other Letters, we understand, that the murther
of the late Regent, by <hi>Huntley</hi> and <hi>Hamilton,</hi> hath irritated the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scotland, that the party of the King is thereby greatly increased, and
the Nobility of that side have made solemne oath and band to be speedily
avenged thereof. The French Ambassador sent yesterday his Secretary to
me, to let the Queens Majestie understand that his Mr. had received Letters
from the French King, directed joyntly to him, and to <hi>dé Foix,</hi> as answering
them two for their Letters which they sent immediately after their first Audience,
noting thereby, that at the writing of those Letters, <hi>de Foix</hi> was not at the

                     </gap> looked for, and therewith he motioned that he might speak with her
Majestie for the relief of the Queen of Scots, considering that she had her num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
lessened and that also he might have his Majesties money, lately intercepted
being sent towards Viracque; herewith her Majestie was so offended that he
should meddle with the Queen of Scots matters, as she commanded me to
say to his Secretary that she could not like his manner of entermedling at this
time with the Queen of Scots causes, considering her Majestie findeth her doings
not only dangerous to her quietness, but bent also to depend upon others then
the Fr. King; and therefore she required him to forbeare, and give her leave to
consider in her own Realm what is meet for her surety, and when time shall
seem meet it shall well appeare, that she hath done nothing toward the Q. of
Scots, but in reason and honour she might have done much more, and she hath
deferred the Ambassadors comming to her Majestie untill she shall be at
<hi>Pichmond,</hi> which shall be about the 27 of this moneth: you may boldly affirm
that her Majestie is well able to prove, that the Q. of Scots hath by the advice
of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> fully resolved to depend upon the King of Spain, and
to match her self with <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> and her Son with the King of
Spains daughter. All these things her Majestie willed me also to signifie unto you,
at this time, and that as you had occasion, you should generally signifie there that
her Majestie hath just cause to proceed, otherwise then hitherto she doth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the practise intended to her estate by the Queen of Scots, and so she
trusteth that the Fr. King will Honourably think of her actions, both with her
own subjects and with the Queen of Scots as shall be necessary for her own
surety, and yet you may assure them there that there is nothing done toward the
Queen, but she is restrained to have such free conference, and intelligence as of
late time she hath had with her Majesties subjects, for otherwise she is right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
entetained and well used. Now must I end for I am fully occupied
in making my imperfect house ready, for the Queens Majestie against Saturday.</p>

she had rather he stood fast to it, and rather increased some hard point then yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

her long preservation. Of the committing of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> to the Tower,
I doubt not but you have heard ere now: his cause goeth hard even to his own
confession: because such causes be doubtfull till they be brought to some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
I will forbeare till my next; but thus much appeareth, vehement suspicion
of more ill then I ever thought could fall out in him, but his deserts crave as they
deserve, and I believe her Majestie will proceed according to equity, and justice,
what cause soever she hath to use little mercy.</p>
                  <p>I have spoke very earnestly to her Majestie touching the relief of your estate;
she hath promised earnestly forthwith to help you. Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> therein
played the part of a right honest Gentlemen, and a very friend, he hath declared
to my Lord of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> and me, and also to her Majestie her self, so much of
your extream chargeable living there, as surely besides that it did much further
the matter, he deserved thanks for such an unlooked for office at his hands; truely
he did it wisely and honestly for you. The Regent <hi>Lennox</hi> is slain of late, <hi>Marre</hi>
is chosen in his place, God defend all my friends from that soile. The money
that you heard my Lord of <hi>Norfolk</hi> did send toward Scotland, was the French

                  <p>SIr, since Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> departure, these things have happened. The D.
of <hi>Norfolk</hi> is charged with the countenance of dangerous practises with the

in the Castle; for proof whereof Letters are intercepted in Cipher by one

but yet the money is said to have been by the Fr. Ambassador delivered to

teach: sure we are, that they in the Castle have been payed divers times with
English Angells and Royalls. There are also found about the Duke certain
writings, by which appeareth that the Duke was acquainted with the voiage
that <hi>Ridolph</hi> made to Rome, and to Spain, hereupon the Queens Majestie is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
offended both toward the Queen of Scots, and the D. and hath strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

the Queens party much diminished by the deserting of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>,</hi> and yet by a stratagem on Monday last as night, the
case had like to have been much altered. The Earle of <hi>Huntley</hi> and Lord <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>
with <hi>Bucklough,</hi> and <hi>Fernichurst</hi> accompained with 40 horsemen entred
by stealth into the Town of Sterling after midnight, they took the Regent in
his bed, and the Earles <hi>Argile, Moret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n, Cassills,</hi> &amp;c. and whilest these being
prisoners were at the Town gate to be carried away with their takers, the rest of
the company spoiling the Town they of the Castle of Sterling issued out, and
so resued the prisoners, saving that in the conflict the Regent and 16 more of
his Gentlemen were slain, as it is written. Thus it is written unto me, but I dare
not affirm it untill I heare it again. As for the motion made by <hi>de Foix,</hi> that
some person might be sent thither to affirme his message, and to maintain that
with the Queen Majesties honour, wherein by <hi>de Foix</hi> I was named, the Queens
Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>estie doth forbeare untill she may heare from you; for according to the
answer that shall be made, her Majestie will send a person either mean or great.
By reason that I was named I have had lesse occasion to motion it, but surely it
had done well to have fed the French humour, and many things may better be
said by an expresse messenger then by the report of an Ambassador Lieger, whose
commission groweth by writing. Truly the more matters are discovered, the
more necessary it is seen that her Majestie should marry. The Queens Majestie
returneth towards London, from hence to <hi>Hundon,</hi> and so to my house in

                  <p>YOur Lordships of the 17 &amp; 20 of <hi>September</hi> sent by <hi>Har</hi> I received the 28 of
the same, which came in very good time for that there is most earnest soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
here by the Ambassadors Lord <hi>Fleming,</hi> and <hi>Duglas,</hi> for present aid to
be sent into Scotland; therefore after I had well perused the contents thereof,
I took occasion by presenting the Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> at his leave taking, to make
Q. Mother acquainted with so much of the same as I thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it for her to know.
I shewed her, that if it might so like her, I would declare unto her at large the
present state of England, as also my private opinion in some points, not by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
as an Ambassador, but as a private Gentleman that desireth nothing more
then good Amity between both the two Crowns, and therefore wish all jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
to be removed, for that there could be no perfection of friendship where
jealousie was a party. First, touching the state of England, I made her privy what
had passed between their Ambassador Monsieur <hi>de la Mot</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk;</hi> touching the money, as also the pacquet conveyed by <hi>Virague.</hi> I made
her also acquainted with the contents of the discourse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

to the Duke. I shewed her further, that Monsieur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>
sending for Audience, to have moved her majestie for relief of the Queen of
Scots did not best like her. In the end I concluded with that point that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi> advice given to the said Queen, aswell for her own mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
as her sons, as also not to depend any longer upon France. Then touching
my private opinion, I shewed her, I was sorry first, that their Ambassador should
have intelligence with the Duke, who was discovered to be a dangerous subject.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54478:81"/>
Secondarily, That he should be so earnest in seeking the liberty of the Queen
of Scots unto the Queen my Mistress, a most dangerous enemy: these things
I feare, said I, may breed in the Queen my Mistress some opinion that the
friendship professed, is not altogether sincere; and therefore I wished that the
King and she in seeking the Queen of Scots liberty, would not forget to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Queen of Englands safety, especially now, seeing the Queen of Scots
seeketh to quit her self of his protection. To this she answered, That as on the
one side she was glad to understand that these practises were discovered, so was
she sorry that there should fall out any thing that might breed any suspicion
in her Majestie of any evill meaning on their behalf, who wished asmuch good
to her Majestie as to their own selves. And as for <hi>de la Mots</hi> doing, I know,
saith she, aswell for his duty towards the King my Son, who would not have
him deale in any thing that might any way prejudice the Queen your Misterss,
as also for the particular good will he beareth unto her, was altogether void of
any evill meaning; and so I hope she will interpret it. The money (saith she) as I
am informed by the Scots Ambassador, was sent by him to <hi>de la Mot,</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the Queen of Scots, who as he shewed quite was void of mony. I then
replied, That the money was sent over to another end, as the Duke himself had
confessed; and that therefore the Ambassador, had misinformed her. She told
me further, that the money was none of the Kings; but part of that which she
hath yearly from hence by virtue of her dowry. By this your Lordship may see
that the Ambassador dealeth somewhat cunningly in this behalf, to gratifie the
Queen of Scots.</p>
                  <p>Touching the solliciting of her liberty, she shewed me that the King and she,
aswell in respect of the ancient League with Scotland, as the alliance by marriage,
could in honour do no lesse then recommend her cause, which she protested
they never did with intention any way to perjudice her Majestie. I then desired
her first to consider whether the Amity of England might not be as beneficiall
to France, as that of Scotland. Secondarily, Whether they had that need at
this present of the Amity and League of Scotland, as heretofore they have had.
For the first, I shewed her that France in respect of the greatness of some of their
neer neighbours, had need of the Amity of both England and Scotland. For
the second, I told her that England had no foot in France; Scotland was rather
chargeable then profitable to France. She replied, That the King notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
in honour, could not but continue Amity and League with Scotland,
though he had not that use as before time. I answered her, That the King might
continue his League with Scotland by joyning with the Queen my Mistris, in
the maintenance of the young Kings government there. To this she answered,
That the king could not in honour abandon his sister in Law. I answered, That
the Kings band towards his sister in Law, is not more then of a naturall father
towards his naturall child; yet if the child grow to be dissolute and lewd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is shaken off by his father, the fault is not to be imputed to the father, but
to the child; even so, if the King in respect of the indignities committed by his
siste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in Law, shall give over the protection of her, the cause thereof is onely
to be imputed to her misdemeannor, unworthy of her calling, and not to him. I
desired her to consider further, that whereas she saith the King in Honour is
bound to seek her liberty, that he is more bound in honour to have regard of
the Queen my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>istris, safety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First, for that she is a Princesse of life vertuous,
in Government guided by Law and Justice, in affection toward him sincere. Now
if by the Queen of Scots liberty procured by him, the State should be disquieted,
what thing could happen that might touch the King more in honour &amp; conscience:
and as for any assurance or protestation that she might make to the King touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54478:81"/>
her peaceable behaviour toward the Q. my Mistress; First, I desired her to
weigh that she was ambitious, and therefore no Capitulation could serve for
a bridle. Secondly, That she is most guided by the advice of those of her kindred,
who have been the greatest cause of the disquiet of <hi>Europe,</hi> whereof she could
be a witness. Thirdly, how that now she meaneth chiefly to depend upon Spain,
who will be alwaies provoking her to the disquieting of England and France.
These considerations (said I) Madam, if you will well weigh, I hope they will
give you cause not to be over earnest in procuring any enlargment of liberty,
especially upon this late discovery of her evill meaning towards her Majestie. In
my private opinion, you shall do well therefore to remit the same untill the
coming of the Gentleman whom the Queens Majestie my Mistress meaneth to
send. So in the end she concluded, that she would confer with the King her Son,
whom she assured me would be loath to do any thing that might any way discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
her Majestie, or tend to her prejudice. J. K. being by me so requested, dealt
very earnestly with her in that behalf, shewing the unseasonableness of the time
to commend a matter so unacceptable, especially having intention to treat of
some straight Amity. <hi>Douglas</hi> in his return hither, passed by Flanders; he was
accompained from Antwerp to Bruxels by the Earle of Westmerland, and a
dozen other of the Rebells, where he had conference with the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi>
and was, as he secretly reporteth to a friend of his, very Honourably used, and
put in comfort that there should be somewhat done shortly for the assistance of
the Queen of Scots faction in Scotland; and further, that he doubted not but that
there would come a time that there should also be somewhat done for her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
which had not now to have been executed, had not the jealousie of some
French enterprize stayed him, <hi>Iunius</hi> the <hi>Co. Palatines</hi> servant, who had his
dispatch at the King hands the second of this moneth, shewed me, that the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
he had in commission to deliver to his Mr. and the rest of the Princes, was,
that the said King was glad the said Princes were both content and desirous to
enter into some straight League with him, a thing necessary for both their preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
and to the end that the same might proceed, he desired them that they
would consider of the points and Articles to be agreed on, as also of some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
place for the meeting of their Deputies: Whereof when he shall be
advertised upon his return again, he would not faile to send some personage of
good calling, with Authority to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>clude such points as shall be agreed upon.
After he had received his message, he shewed me that he told the King, that it
were very necessary that the Queen of England were named to joyn in this
League; whereof he signified unto me, that both the King and Queens Mother
were most desirous thereof; and therefore wished that there might be some
means found, that her Majestie might be moved in that behalf: whereupon he
and I after some conference had what way were best to be taken, agreed upon a
Letter to be sent by me to his Mr. as the best means to bring the same to passe;
which Letters I caused Mr. <hi>Beale</hi> to draw, and sent to Mr. <hi>Iunius</hi> according as we
resolved; whereof I send your Lordship a Copy, to the end your Lordship may
see the course I have taken, which I hope, for that it tendeth to her Majesties
safety, will not mislike her. Thus leaving further to trouble your Lordship at
this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honourable, and my very good Lord, the Lord of
Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to advertise her Majestie; that the 22 of this
moneth the King sent for me, and at the time of my accesse he shewed me
that he was given to understand that her Majestie meant to send certain Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> which thing he would be sorry it should so fall out, for that
then he should be forced in respect of the ancient League, with <hi>Scotland</hi> to
strengthen the Queens party there by sending of forces thither, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he desired her Majestie to forbeare in that behalf, and that that matter
might be referred over to treaty, untill the coming of him whom her Majestie
meaneth to send, whereby all unkindness might be avoided; he willed me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
her Majestie to interprete this is message in good part, and to assure her that
he is void of all evill meaning, whose Amity he most earnestly desireth; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he may not in honour forbeare if he be urged thereto to assist them
in respect of the said League. I shewed him, that I understood nothing of any
such meaning of her Majesties sending of any forces thither, but if it were so, it
then proceeded upon the discovery of certain dangerous practises of the Queen
of Scots, whereupon her Majestie is inforced every way to seek to do that thing
that might tend to her safety, and therefore if any such sending grow upon such
respect he could not but allow thereof, protesting that good will that he doth
to her Majestie: He answered me, that now his meaning was not to recommend
the liberty of the Queen of Scots, but onely to recommend the liberty of the
Country. I told him in that behalf, I doubted not but he should find the Queen
my Mistress inclined to do any thing to agree to reason, and stand with her safety:
but if her Majestie should have any intention to seek the liberty of the Queen of
Scots, in my private opinion, I thought by no meanes he should prevaile, she
now of late being discovered to be so dangerous an enemy, who hath as it were
dismembred her Majesties politique body by corruption of sundry of her best
qualified Subjects, which thing (said I) if your Majestie could consider in the
Queen my Mistress person, I am sure your Majestie would forbeare at any time,
hereafter to recommend her cause. His answer to that was, that he meant not
now to recommend the same; and so he willed me to present his affectionate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
unto her Majestie adding further, that he hoped shortly to see one
from her here, to treat of such things as my tend to increase of good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Amity between them; he desired me to dispatch one with some intelligence,
to the end he may know her Majesties answer. I am given secretly to understand,
that there are certain of the <hi>Guisian</hi> faction, that have made offer unto the King
to go and serve in Scotland of their own charges, and that the King if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
not a good answer from her Majestie is determined to imploy them: there
are some also of that faction that go about to perswade him, that her Majestie
meaneth nothing less then to send any hither to treat of Amity, and that all is
but intertainment untill she have made full conquest of Scotland, the King not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
these lewd perswasions, as I learn, conceiveth a good and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
opinion of her Majestie. As I was writing, I was given to understand that
the morning the King sent for me, there was long debate had in Councell
whether he should recommend the Q. of Scots cause or not. In the end, after
long debating, through the earnest perswasions of some, it was thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to forbeare in that behalf, and so concluded that he should onely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the liberty of the Countrey. I am put in great hope that the King will be
content to joyn with her Majestie in the establishing of the young Kings Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54478:82"/>
Surely, if her Majestie send hither in time, whilest her friends enjoy
the credit of the Court here, some parsonage of good quality, whereby the King
may think she maketh some account of him. I think her Majestie shall obtain
any reasonable thing at his hands that she her self can desire; for she is perswaded,
that no Amity is so fit for him as that with her Majestie, in respect that all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of quarrels are now taken away. If it might so like her, I would wish, that
her Maiestie would in talk with the Ambassador, use some words of excuse, in
that she hath so long deferred the sending of the Gentleman that is here looked
for; as also, two words of assurance of the great desire she hath of the increase
of Amity with the King: This I know, would content him, as also stop the
mouthes of those that perswade the contrary. Thus leaving further to trouble
your Lordship, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

there you have, to be our Ambassador Resident with the French King our good
brother, for the time that you shall be occasioned to be necessarily absent about
the tendance to cure your self of such infirmities, as to our grief, we hear you are
subject unto, and glad therewith to hear, that if you may have some respite and
leisure from business to attend to your Cure, you are in hope to be cured by
certain Physicians that have taken upon them the charge thereof, whereof we
are both willing to further you, and do earnestly charge you, without either
delay of time, or care of our business to apply your self; for that by your good
service hitherto we do plainly perceive that our election of you hath been well
answered, and the continuance of you in that service, is to be much desired by
the recovery of your health. And for that this bearer shall now supply your
absence, whom we know to be a faithful friend unto you, we would you should
instruct him in things meet to be known to him, and to give him assistance of
such of your servants, as shall be to him needful for this purpose. And for our
further knowledge in things presently to be prosecuted and imparted to the
King there, we have also given to him knowledge thereof by special Instructions
in writing, signed with our hand, have informed him, and have willed him to
make you partaker, and to use your advise in what sort to communicate with our

                  <p>SIr, though your leisure were more then it is, yet the coming of this bearer
my brother <hi>Killigrew,</hi> is able to discharge me of all my care to write; but
yet I cannot let him depart without my Letter, how short soever it is; you
know my brother so well, and love and trust him, as I perceive so entirely, as I
think none could come more grateful unto you; and surely so do I find him to
love and care for you, as none can do more to a natural brother. I am greatly
perplexed with the strangeness of 2 4. In Dover 7 0 d m t m o t m: for surely
at this time there groweth daily more cause then other to have 57 Callice A M.
And so when you shall understand the state of things here you will judge. This
bearer can tell you who is likely to come thither; for surely there are many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
why I cannot, but the principal is, for that I am far unmeet to treat
of any thing out of <hi>England,</hi> being as I am known only meet to speak as my

                  <p>Of <hi>Scotland,</hi> this bearer can report to you, and so can he of the Scotish Queen,
of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and all the matter. He can also tell you of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

sick in her stomack, and as suddenly relieved by a vomit. You must think
such a matter would drive men to the end of their wits, but God is the stay of

                  <p>You shall also let the King understand, that since the arrival of Monsieur <hi>de
Foix</hi> there at the Court, we have heard both by Letters of our own Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and since that by the report of Monsieur <hi>de la Mot</hi> the Kings Ambassador,
in what good part the King hath accepted our friendly and plain manner of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him in the negotiation of the matter for the which Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi>
was sent hither; and how well Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> hath reported our good usage of
him for the Kings sake, of all which we are very glad to see our good meaning to
be so well interpreted and allowed, for ever to that end indeed we did direct
our meaning and intention to make some demonstrations of our heartie good
will towards our good brother, especially by many things confirmed to us of
late time, not only in the honourable usuage of our Ministers and Servants, but
in so earnest prosecution of this matter of marriage of his brother the Duke of

into any direct judgement upon our answer given to Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> neither
to accept it, until that some special person of value and credit with us, may be
sent unto them to treat further thereupon: and that he doth certainlie look
that we will send some such person thither, upon the report of Monsieur
<hi>de Foix,</hi> who indeed at his departure, did intreat us so to do; yet he had no
certain promise of us for the same; but that we would first understand
how the King our good brother should allow of our answer, and so thereafter
to do.</p>
                  <p>We now finding not onely the expectation of our said good brother, but his
desire also that one such person might come from us, are minded within short
time to send forth such a one as shall be meet for that purpose to deal with our

which we mean to defer onely until we may at more length, more largely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the whole intention and progress of certain dangerous practises begun
against us and our State by the Scotish Queen, and some of our natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which being lately discovered, doth alreadie manifestly appear to have
been of long time intended, and by Gods goodness staied in such sort, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the execution thereof, we have knowledge of a great part thereof,

and doubt not by the continuance of the same goodness of God, both to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the rest, and to understand the danger intended; whereof when the whole
shall be further known to us, we will make our said brother private thereto,
as to one that for the assured friendship that we conceive in him, will be both
glad that God hath defended us from such dangers, and also willing by his good
concurrency in friendship, to assist us in our State against the like. And yet you
shall say to our good brother, because he shall not be ignorant of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
for such part as shall be to us discovered; you shall shew him, that
whereas about two years past the Queen of Scots had practised to have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

<hi>Norfolk,</hi> wherewith for many great reasons we were justly offended, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her and the said Duke, having for that purpose restrained the said Duke,
but from his common liberty, leaving him the use of all his Lands and Goods,
and meaning by degrees to receive him to our grace, as we did in some part
diminish the demonstration of our offence, upon signification of his repentance,
and protestation never to deal in that matter, or any such like; and the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
did the Queen of Scots make to us from the beginning, both by her
sundry messages, and specially by multitude of her Letters to us, which do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
with us, written of her own hand. And though we had many sparks of
suspetion that their meaning was not fully agreeable to their Words, Letters,
Promises and Oathes, which made us not hastie in the full deliverie of the Duke,
yet now we have manifestly found by their practises with sundrie others, and
by their own Letters, which we have in great number, that even from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
that we did find fault with the said practises for marriage, and that they
did solemnly revoke their intentions with firm promises in writing never to deal
therein any further: They did not onely secretlie continue their first intents of
marriage against our will, but the rest also of our dangers that properlie we did
at the begining conjecture to have been joyned to that marriage, which now
are so manifestlie discovered, as no answer can excuse the same; and that is
in one word to express the whole, under colour of restoring her to libertie, to
deprive us of our Crown, and erect her up in our place; and that by force, not
onely by Rebellion to be stirred up in our Realm, but by bringing in of Forreign
Forces to assist that enterprize, against such power as we should have had of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
natural Subjects in our defence. This intention of the Queen of Scots, you
shall assure our good brother is not to us by conjectures, as for the most part
the greatest Treasons are, that they be not executed, but by manifest writing
of the Queen of Scots own hand, by confession of such as be apprehended,
and are guiltie thereof themselves, and have confessed it voluntarilie, with
tokens of great repentance: And in all these their practises, we are much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
to find it declared, yea, by the Queen of Scots own writings, that she
and her partie much misliked the Friendship between our good brother the
French King and us; and specially gave charge, that in seeking of Forreign
Forces to invade our Realm, none of the French Kings Ministers should be
made participant, judging by plain speeches and words in writing, that she
the Scotish Queen would wholly follow the directions of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and would procure her son to be transported thither; and to entice their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
she would shew her self willing to marrie Don <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria.</hi> This in
sum, you may assure the French King we can in substance manifest, even by
the Scotish Queens writings to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> which we have divers
ways confirmed by writings and Confessions of others. And until this
whole Tree shall be fully discovered, as well in the branches as in the
roots, which we trust God will display afore our eyes, we have thought meet
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54478:84"/>
to impart in this manner so much thereof, praying our good brother
to shew herein the office of a good perfect friend; that is, in case of all
such danger as this is, touching our life, our State, and the ruine of our
Realm and faithful Subjects, not to credit the false report of any, that
to our prejudice shall labour to deprave our doings in the procuring of
our own safety and quietness of our State, and the continuance of
Peace in our Realms and Dominions. For surely we do not herein
any thing but in the sight of God we are bound in nature to do for our
selves, and in dutie for our Realm.</p>

Master <hi>Killegrew,</hi> who delivered me her Majesties Letters, by the which
I have just cause to think my self most bound to her Majestie for accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my simple service; as also, for the care she hath of my health, by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Gentleman to relieve me. I have conferred with him, and made
him acquainted with my proceeding in this charge, as also with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of this Countrey. The chief cause of my sending at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
is to advertise her Majestie of the late victorie had by the Princes
Confederates against the Turk: The particularities whereof, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them from the Venetian Ambassador, were these: That the seventh

                  <p>It is much feared by those of judgement here, that this Victory, though
generallie it may grow to Christendom profitable, yet particularlie it may
prove dangerous to some, in that it is likely to increase the reputation and
greatness of <hi>Spain,</hi> which may breed some change here, and may cause the
King to relent over much to <hi>Spain;</hi> the reason of the fear is, that Queen
Mother, who directeth all things here, is of nature fearful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they doubt that those that incline to <hi>Spain,</hi> who are in best credit
with her, will take profit of the Victorie, and make her an instrument
to perswade the King to dissemble the Injuries received at <hi>Spains</hi> hands, and
to encline him to run one course with him for a time. Of these fears I thought
good to advertise, ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ring the consideration thereof unto her Majestie. One
<hi>Waldie,</hi> servant unto the Countess of <hi>Emden,</hi> being sent from her unto
her Majestie with certain Letters, is stayed in the Town through sickness,
whereby he cannot perform his voyage. He desired me to convey over
these Letters he hath unto her, unto a servant of his Mistris's resident in

Letters, as also to make your Lordship acquainted with the causes of his stay:
His Commission, as I gather by him, is two ends; the one to desire her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
that by her aid there may be some order taken for the clearing of the
narrow seas of Pyrats; the other, to move her Majestie to grant to the
Subjects of the said Commonwealth, an exemption of a certain custom, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the favour shewed her Majesties Subjects. Thus leaving further to

I hear it is to be translated into English, with addition of many other supplements
of like condition.</p>
                  <p>The Queens Majestie hath sent for my Lord <hi>Gray</hi> to come thither into <hi>France,</hi>
and if his health cannot serve him, Sir <hi>Peter Gray</hi> shall come. Her Majestie, with
furtherance of her whole Councel, is certainly resolved to send one thither. My
Lord of <hi>Hunsdon</hi> is at <hi>Berwick</hi> by computation yesternight, and his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is to set a good face upon the matter, to bring <hi>Grange</hi> and the Castle to the
Kings devotion; if he cannot, we of her Councel are of opinion that <hi>England</hi>
shall inforce them. And yet it shall do well, that no such thing be notified to
the French King. My Lord Marquis dyed at <hi>Warwick</hi> on Sunday, the loss of a
good Councellour. The case of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> falleth even out by

                  <p>SIr, such sufficient persons of understanding, credit and acquaintance as this

and therefore I mean to touch things by notes and peice-meals. He can
tell you of the Duke of Norfolks case, but percase not when, nor how it takes
end, neither can I help him to inlarge his knowledge, but I think the Queens
Majestie will therein deal more substantially then many do imagine. He can tell
you how straitly the Queen of Scots is kept, having now but ten persons of
her own of all sorts. She pretendeth a great fear of her life, and craveth a
ghostly Father, being Catholique. He can tell you, that the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
hath plainly notified to the Estates of Scotland, that she will never suffer
the Scotish Queen to have her Government in Scotland; and at this present
we are in hand to make an accord betwixt <hi>Liddington</hi> and <hi>Graunge</hi> in the Castle,
and the Regent, &amp;c. difficulties are rather particular then publike. They in
the Castle look to have their Offices and Lands restored; and for surety, that
<hi>Graunge</hi> may remain Captain of the Castle: The other party are greedy to keep
that they have catched, as of Bishopricks and Abbeys, &amp;c. I think next avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
might help, but greediness and mistrust keeps them asunder, and I fear more
the wilfulness of the Kings party, then the conformation of the adverse. Now
for the principal matter of Sir <hi>Tho: Smith,</hi> I have at such length explained that
in his instructions, whereof he will make you privy, as I need not adde any more,
I. <hi>Dover</hi> A. was never <gap reason="symbol" extent="25 letters">

                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:54478:86"/>
how if K. be not at Court, he might secretly procure to be there at Sr. <hi>Tho.
Smiths</hi> being there; and also by secret means Sir <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> may understand his
opinion in the greatest mater, as one whom we think of such dexterity in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
of such dutifull good will hitherward, as no advice nor direction shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

departure from this place, so as I have not specially informed him hereof, and
therefore I pray you impart this to him; adding this caution, that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
do not appear to any others to deal with him; for so may he best serve the purpose.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, you may think that I am not a little perplexed in this matter, when

my infirmity, as Sir <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> can inform you, hath been so lingring upon me,
as I have bin, though not idle, yet an unprofitable servant, and thereby impedited

I have alwaies heretofore seen in you a good inclination to further the same, as a
matter for her self, her estate and ours all, through the hope of her issue to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by, which, for mine own part, I was and am of like opinion (God is my
judge) only for the same respect, being verily perswaded, otherwise hardly shall
she her self be in safety for her own time, or her people and Realm left in surety
after her, except some such way be taken as marriage, whereof finding now again
an appearance of a full determination in her Majestie to like of marriage, and to
my judgement, resolved not to refuse any reasonable conditions that to her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
shall be offered by that King for Monsieur. I thought good to let you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it, that if the matter be renewed on their parts, that you may deal accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
therein, who being in dispair of her good liking (as good cause both
you and we here have had so to doubt) might perhaps make the less account of it:
and I supposing in dealing with Mr. <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> he will affirm thus much of her
present disposition, which I assure you she hath so earnestly and assuredly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto me, as I verily think, yet once again, that with good handling, good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
will follow. And thus much her Majesty is pleased I should signifie
unto you and <hi>Henry Killegrew,</hi> that you should appoint some trusty
and discreet Messenger fully instructed with all the proceedings hitherto
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54478:87"/>
past in this matter touching the Marriage, to be sent to the Admiral, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
the same wholly unto him, with demonstration of her trust and affiance in
him, to give her the best and friendliest advice, and let him know upon what
points they stick at it: and if he shall seem to be earnest, and to allow of the
matter, and to have it go forward, then would she have him at Court at this
present of Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> being there, that he may the better from time to time be
privy to their dealings, and her determinations also, for that she doth mean free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and frankly to impart all things to him from time to time, that shall concern
her therein, not doubting he will have due regard every way of her Mejesties
honour, and specially to foresee that she be not abused or ill handled by sinister
practises of some that be great enemies to this matter: Her Majesty hath her
self, somewhat opened her mind to the Count Montgomery, who this day hath
taken his leave and is departed, and the sooner to deal with the Admiral herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout:
and as you shall find the Admirals devotion in this matter, so shall it be
well done to use as speedy advertisement as you can to her Majesty thereof.</p>
                  <p>You have often times, Mr. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> wisely warned us and put us in mind
to seek some waies to stablish her Majesteries state, and the lacks declared both
want of friendship abroad, and of our doubtfull state at home, it falls out daily
too manifest, and without some remedy, will prove a danger unrecoverable; the
means for help be easily seen and perceived, and I suppose yet not without hope
to be obtained, God grant us that foresight and wisdom that we willingly refuse
them not: Well, I can but pray for the best, and discharge my duty according to
the small understanding I have, that some good may take place, which I shall never
cease to wish to supply what else doth want in me: and therefore besides that her
Majesty hath here willed me to signifie unto you, which is for the imparting of
the proceedings in the case of her marriage heretofore, how it hath from time
to time past unto the Admiral there. I have shewed you what I conceive of
her Majesties inclination again towards the marriage of Monsieur, which being
a matter of greatest importance to her and us also. I thought meet to let you
know that the matter as it hath been a long while in a manner dead, may be with
more discretion revived, and do not doubt but that it will be opened by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
there again, seeing her Majesty hath not yet clearly there denied it, nor they
fully answered her Majesties demands. Other news we have none worth the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
but of her Majesties good estate, which surely is such as I have not known
been these many years. Thus with my right hearty commendations I bid you
farewell:</p>

the Bishop of <hi>Limoyes,</hi> and Mr. <hi>de Foix</hi> deputed from the French King to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with you on their part, from the 10 of the last month, unto the 20 of the same:
we caus'd certain of our councel to confer with the French Amb. according to his
request upon the same matters, who did exhibit in writing the copies of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
betwixt you and the said Deputies, agreeable for the most part, to those
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were receiv'd from your self; and he did propound four points comprehending
the differences betwixt you and them, the judgement whereof was referred, as he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54478:87"/>
said, to the King his Master our good brother, and us, pretending with many
good words, that since the foundation of the Treaty, was by your good means
and the Kings Deputies with you there, made manifest to be without any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
which was a declaration of a natural good will in both the P. to enter into
some streight League of amity; he doubted not but that these other particular dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences (which consisted but upon words) should be easily and speedily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
The first doubt, as he said, remaining undetermined, was about the
Article for mutual defence of either Prince, against any other person that should
invade either of them or their Countries. In that you shall have these words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferted
into the Article, <hi>Etiam si causa religionis mutatio facta fuerit,</hi> whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
with these special words the Kings Deputies would not agree, neither, as he
said, might his Master without great inconvenience assent thereunto whereof he
doubted not but he would have reasonable respect, and not meaning thereby to
forbear to be bound to do that which the special case of these words might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
And so reporting many arguments to our Councel, whereof he had made
mention unto us two daies before at his last audience, amongst the which, one
was of most weight, as we took it, That if such special mention should be made
for the defence of Religion in a publike Treaty, the King should thereby offend
not only all other Princes Catholiques his Allies, but also the greater part of his
own States and Subjects, which are of the Catholique Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
also is. And yet nevertheless, the King was content (as he said) to have all
other manner of good and effectual words and speeches inserted in the said Treaty,
to bind the King to a mutual defence against all manner of invasion, for what
cause, pretext, or colour soever it were, yea and that without exception of any
manner of cause. Hereunto was answered on our part, That considering there
was no other likelihood of any pretence to invade us, but upon the colour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
only, and that on the Kings part there were many other causes and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
as Titles to Dominions and Territories, and such like other might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
for invasion and disturbance of his estate, whereunto our aid or defence
should be requisite: It might be thought a very unequal Contract by general
words certainly, to conclude all his causes, and by forbearing these special words
of Religion, to leave us utterly unprovided of aid; and as to the remedy to have
other manner of words inserted, considering they should be but general, it might
be doubted, that while the Invasion should be made or attempted against us for
Religion, or but for pretext of Religion, and required for the same, the King
might then (with colourable reasons, being devised by such as were over-vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and passionate in the Religion of Rome, or in that which is called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like)
answer that he might not for his conscience satisfie, or demand for aid in that
behalf, and that could not be intended to be lawfully (that is, by the Law
of God) included in the general words. To this, although the Ambassador re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
in his Masters name, with the great assurance of his intention to give us aid
against any Invasion, though it were indeed for Religion; which he said, could
not be but a pretence of the Invader, for that the Invasion of the Realm was to
be regarded, and not any cause or pretext: Yet the doubt herein remained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them unresolved, and so the Ambassador seemed not therein to be satisfied,
saving that in some secret speech afterward with one or two of our Councel apart
(although he would not have report thereof made) he thought his Master might
be induced by some secret means to make some particular promise betwixt his
Master and us, by writing separated from the publike Treaty for a special point
of a mutual defence in case of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The second part of the doubt moved by the Ambassador, was, for
the forme, manner, time, and quality of the aid that should be mutually given;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54478:88"/>
wherein he pressed to have had the like manner as was contracted in <hi>Anno</hi> 1543.
betwixt the Emperor <hi>Charls,</hi> and the King our Father, at which time either of
the Confederates was bound to give such aid as might amount to the charges
of 600 Crowns by the day for the space of 4 months, in one year, or else some
other aid in certainty, which he could not name; but it may be the Kings Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
there might mean such Treaties as had been before contracted between our
Father and King <hi>Francis,</hi> Grandfather to the King, where there is one example
of the Treaty of 1532. betwixt the said two Kings; in both which Treaties
the aids were born at the charges of the Confederate Prince, that was required
by the Prince invaded. To which motion of the said Ambassador, our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
made such Answers by imparting to him the forms of former Treaties, made
both with the house of Burgundy, and with the French Kings, as he in the end
seemed satisfied with such form of aid to be mutually agreed upon, as you your
self have propounded to them in your Paper delivered the 18 of the last, in an
Article <hi>verbatim,</hi> taken out of a Treaty betwixt the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> and the
King our Father, in the year 1548. being before that first devised in a Treaty at
<hi>Cambray,</hi> in the year 1529, and one principal reason to appoint that manner of
aid better then any other, was this: If the aid should be given in a certainty, and
at the cost of the Prince that was not invaded, upon every request of a Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
there might great inconvenience follow, in that one Prince might oftner
burthen his Confederate in demanding succours without great necessity, and in
greater numbers then needfull, was, if the charges of the said succours should be
maintained by the Confederate that so sent them, and not by himself: Whereas
on the other part; if the Prince that should demand succours, should bear the
charges of them himself, he would never demand the same oftner, nor in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
numbers, nor keep them longer in pay then should be needfull. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
to this reason, it was declared to the Ambassador, That in all Treaties
betwixt this Realm and France, and also Burgundy, the like Covenants were
made in all Leagues, saving one time with the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> 1543. at which
time the Treaty was made both Offensive and Defensive against the French
King; and yet in the same year 1546. the same clause for aid, was by Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the said Princes, revoked, having not been at any time put in execution;
and the ancient manner of aid to be at the charges of the Prince demandant: and
with these, and such like reasons, the Ambassador seemed to be fully satisfied.</p>
                  <p>The third matter of doubt moved by the Ambassador, was, for the cause of
Scotland, that is, in what sort that State might be comprehended in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and thereupon it was said to the Ambassador, That we had no other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the matter of Scotland, but to have the hostility and civil wars to cease,
and the Government of the Realm to be established to the contentation of the
Nation; for which purpose we had sent to both parties at difference, to accord
upon an abstinence from war, so as they might the better Treat and accord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
themselves; which if they would not, we would be content that any
such whom the French King our brother should send thither, should joyntly with
some of ours, imploy themselves, with the credit and amity amongst us two, to
direct them to accord amongst themselves: and therein we had no meaning to
withdraw them from the ancient Intelligence with the Crown of France, but
that they might have and keep the amity with us both. With which answer
and resolution, the Ambassador seemed well content; requiring, as the King his
Master had forborn, at our request, to send any force to either party, whereby
to hinder any accord, so we would do the like; which was agreed unto him.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, He moved the matter concerning the Article for the resort of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to some Ports of France, with such liberties and securities
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54478:88"/>
as they had in other Regions, offering that the King his Master was content to
yield therein to any reasonable demand, to the benefit of our Subjects. To
which, answer was made, That the Case did belong to our Merchants, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what was meet for them, who should be spoken withall, and thereupon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
should be given. This was the sum of that which passed betwixt the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
and such of our Councel as were appointed to deal with him, who
were, the Lord Keeper of our great Seal, the Earl of Leicester, the Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
the Lord of Burghly, and Sr. <hi>Walter Mildmay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, although you may perceive by this Conference had with the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
what be the things that we have cause to like or mislike, upon the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
moved: yet upon some further instruction of you, we will summarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you what we like of the substance of the Articles sent unto us from you,
being propounded as well by the Kings Deputies as by your self. First, to the
Articles in Latine, delivered by the French Ambassador, dated the 17 of Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
we mislike not of the first Article for the continuance of former Treaties in
their force, which is necessary to be specially for the saving of our rights and
pretences to <hi>Callais,</hi> according to the Treaty therefore made, and remaining yet
in force; so as it be added to the end of the Article; with Condition that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in any former Treaty be by this clause continued, that shall be repugnant
or derogatory to the Articles of this present Treaty. The second and third pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
any aid to be given to any persons that shall invade, and to make a
League for a mutual defence against all persons that shall invade upon any
cause. We mislike not the Tenor of the said Articles, so as the words added in
the second Article of your Writing dated the 18 of January, which are these,
<hi>Etiamsi fuerit religion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> causa, praetextu, aut colore,</hi> which we would have you
earnestly press upon such reasons to be inserted, as your self hath already remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred;
and therein we would have you secretly to cause them of the Religion
there, to understand of your demand, and to help to further it; and yet if you
cannot have the same words to be specially inserted, then you may according to
your own offers, insert into the Article these words, <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ub quocunque praetextu vel
colore &amp; quavis de causa nulla omnino qualicunque excepta:</hi> and besides these,
you shall in secret manner move, and most earnestly press it, that some special
promise may be made in a secret writing betwixt the King and us, signed and
sealed mutually with both our hands, for that purpose expresly, if any Invasion
should be made, as though the same had been expressed in the Treaty; without
which secret provision to be made, considering the matter hath been in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we would be very loath that you should accord. We do not like that which
is devised by them, which beginneth, <hi>Conventum est quod quotiescunque ullus
princeps, &amp;c.</hi> wherein they would have aid given, if any person go about to
change or alter any Laws or Edicts against the will of the Prince; but we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like to have the aid only given in case of invasion, or purpose of invading: For
by the words of this Article, we may percase hereafter be required to aid that
King in the breaking of his own Edicts for Religion, in case he himself shall be
thereto willing; and that either of this Subjects, or any others shall attempt or
alter the Edicts that may be made against the Religion reformed.</p>
                  <p>The Article beginning, <hi>Conventum est quod fadus &amp; liga,</hi> is not to be misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for continuance of this Treaty; although the third Article of your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
beginning, <hi>Tempus vero durationis,</hi> seemeth plainer and better, and agreeth
with the like in former times.</p>
                  <p>The sixth being imperfect, beginning, <hi>De tempore antem &amp; modo,</hi> would be
supplyed with the like Clause and Article at length, <hi>mutatis mutandis;</hi> and as
you have excerped out of the year 1546. and as in the last of your writing of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54478:89"/>
the 18 of January. Now for our opinion of the Articles presented by you to
the French the 18. we do like well enough of the Preface; and for the first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
you may perceive well enough what we would have added thereto; That
nothing should be continued in former Treaties, being repugnant to this.</p>
                  <p>The second for a Covenant of a League to be defensive, we think not amiss
thereof, although the second and third of the French contain them plain enough
in fewer words, so as the one or the other may serve.</p>
                  <p>To the third of yours, we like as before is mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The fourth beginning, <hi>Et quamvis supervacuum,</hi> may be forborn, considering
the substance thereof is contained in the second, delivered by the French the 17
of January.</p>
                  <p>The last of yours concerning the manner of aid, we like best, as before is said,
according to the Article of the Treaty of <hi>An.</hi> 1549.</p>
                  <p>As to the third Article delivered by you the 18 of January in one writing to
the Kings party, concerning the Arrest to be made of the Subjects of other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
if any other Subjects should be arrested in a strange Country for matter of
Religion, we would not mislike if you could obtain the same; but for that we
think it very hard to be granted by the French King, as the time is, we will not

                     </gap> you much to press it. But as to the other matter of our Merchants, we do

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the manner of Articles presented by you, and yet we cannot presently

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in what form to have the same conceived fit for our Merchants, and for

                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>; more particularly we would have you insert some general clause
in the Treaty for such a purpose; and besides that, also to move it to the King,
that there may be some Colloquie had here betwixt the Kings Ambassador, here
R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sident, having authority therefore, and such as we shall appoint after confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
had with our Merchants, to Treat with the said Ambassador there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
                  <p>Some other doubts may appear in the Writing sent from you, whereof the
Ambassador made no ment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>n, and yet fit for you to understand or mind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
if you shall thereto be pressed: but except you be pressed thereto by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party, we think it good that you should not remember the same; but if
they will needs move the same unto you, then you shall answer as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>First in the paper intituled with the letter B. and brought to you by Monsieur
<hi>Pinarts</hi> brother the 16. there are two doubts moved in the third Article, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<hi>(A este auxi)</hi> and answer made, though not satisfactory in the fourth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
<hi>Sur le premier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first, we do not mislike, but that one of the Confederates should be
bound to defend the other being invaded; although the other Prince may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that he hath been thereto provoked by the Prince invaded: So as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
be not first given by any open War, or Invasion made by the Prince
that shall require aid; for it is not consonant to reason that the one Prince Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
should be aided by another, where he himself that requireth the aid,
hath by his own Invasion of another Prince, provoked himself to be invaded:
And if they shall not like of that exception where the Prince invaded gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
by former invasion; then you shall accord to have the words general, as
have been in former Treaties. And for this matter you may gather some light
by the Treaty called <hi>L'Esclarissement</hi> of the peace made in An. 1545. in
the exposition of the sixth and seventh Articles betwixt the Emperor <hi>Charls,</hi>
and the King our Father.</p>
                  <p>The second seemeth doubtfull to be answered, that is, considering the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54478:89"/>
of the aid shall be born by the Prince requirant; it may be permitted that
the succours given may continue in the pursuit of the Invader, out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the Prince invaded: But therein it is reason that some time be thereunto
limited, that is, by the space of 6 or 7 daies at the most, to be out of the said
Country, or rather some distance of a league or two; but if the Deputies there
treating with you, can be content to have the cause so conceived, as the aid shall
not exceed the limits of the Confederate Country, you shall like it best. And
so you may let it alone in general words as heretofore the same hath been in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Treaties, without raising up of such questions.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Article beginning <hi>Item à este en avant,</hi> we think it reasonable that
the Prince that shall defend the other, may continue their treats which he hath
with the Prince against whom the aid shall be given, and suffer Traffique and
Commerce for their Subjects mutually, saving only it may be provided that he
shall not suffer any Armor nor Munition of Warre, or other like things to
be carried out of his Countrey to the offence of the Prince whom he shall

                  <p>As to the last Clause of the Writing concerning Scotland, we do not disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of the Answer in the Margent, made by you in Latin, but yet our meaning
is not to have any Article in the Treaty comprehending that matter. In this
sort we have thought meet to instruct you, and considering the former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
betwixt us and the French King, shall continue and be confirmed hereby;
we see no cause to remember you of the inserting of any other necessary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which have been heretofore comprised in former Treaties; so as neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be provided by a special Article, that by this Treaty, nor by any
part thereof, any thing be derogatory to such other Treaties as we have, and be
now in force with any other Prince, and namely with the King of Spain: and
as to the comprehension of any Princes according to the ancient manner of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
we would have you to enquire the intention of the French Kings Deputies,
whom they mean to comprehend, and as near as you can to comprehend the
same, saving only the Bishop of Rome, and that Sea, and not forget the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
besides in person the Princes of the Empire, and the Electors of the
same, and namely the Count and Countess of Embden, and the Count and
Sonetie of Hanze. And if they will needs have mention made of Scotland, we
can be content that the same shall be (if we will not accept the name of the
King) by the name <hi>Regnum Scotiae,</hi> or <hi>Regnum &amp; status Scotiae,</hi> we do for these
purposes send you a Commission under our great Seal of England, wherein we
have joyned with you our Ambassador <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> and our servant
<hi>H. Killegrew,</hi> who is there with you, wherein our meaning is, that assoon as
<hi>Walsingham</hi> shall come thither, he shall joyn with you, and within some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
time <hi>Killegrew</hi> may return according to our first order given to him at
his departure thither: And yet untill <hi>VValsingham</hi> shall come thither, <hi>Killegrew</hi>
may remain as joyned. And considering the whole burden of the matter of
learning, in conceiving the Articles of this Treaty, shall rest almost wholly in
this Treaty, we would that when you are proceeded as far as you can, and as you
think meet, that before you shall subscribe the Treaty, you shall send the same
hither to us to be more circumspectly perused, and thereupon we will with like
speed return it as we shall think meet, and so may you reasonably declare your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to the French King, pretending your instruction of your self, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to use the same as they may not suspect it to come of any intention of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.</p>

Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>YOur Letters sent by the Scot, dated the 6 of this month, I have received; he
willed me to inform you, that since his coming hither, he hath learned that
the King giveth but a deaf ear to their causes, notwithstanding that they hope
that upon <hi>Graunges</hi> brothers coming, who is now at the Court, there will be
somewhat obtained for their relief, which if it take not place, then they mean
to repair to Flanders, where the Lord <hi>Seaton</hi> hath received from the Pope 20
thousand Crowns, who is putting himself in readiness to repair into Scotland.
Further, he willed me to shew your Lordship that the L. <hi>Fleming</hi> looketh for a
Barque of his own to arrive at New-Haven about the end of this month, in the
which he meaneth to repair to Scotland, with such forces as he can get, either by
consent from the King, or by stealth otherwise. This in effect is that which he
willed me to impart unto your Lordship. I find this he saith, confirmed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Intelligence I have. <hi>Graunges</hi> brother (as I learn) meaneth to protest to
the King, that unless they may have Men, Money, and Munition out
of hand for their relief, that then they shall be driven to yield to such composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as will be made to the Queen of England, which will not much tend to the
benefit of France. After Sir <hi>Tho. Smiths</hi> assurance of her Majesties intention,
I suppose the King will perswade them to fall to agreement among themselves,
without further intermedling in their causes.</p>
                  <p>From all the Ports both innormandy and Picardy, Cane only excepted, I learn
there is no preparation of ships: Shortly I hope to understand what is done in
Cane. And so leaving further to trouble your Lordship, I most humbly take
my leave,</p>

                  <p>Your Lordships of the 8, by Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> I have received, and according
to her Majesties order expressed in the same, I have by means of a third person,
who heretofore hath been imployed betwixt us, caused the person you know

to have him at the Court during the time of Sir <hi>Tho. Smiths</hi> being there,
whereby he may the better have the assistance of his advice. Touching the
matter it self, I know not how to judge of it, for that I have been two Months
absent from the Court; as I have cause to doubt, so have I cause more to hope;
to doubt, for that her Majesties long deferring in sending, may have bred some
doubt here of her cold inclination that way, and so cause them to give ear to some
other offers, having small hope of this: To hope, first for that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
match worthy the seeking elsewhere; secondarily, for that they begin to
fear very much the greatness of Spain, and therefore desire to be strengthned
by the Arm of England; and though that may be done by way of League, yet
they think the marriage the surest knot of amity. After Sir <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> hath
had audience, it will then soon appear what is to be looked for in that behalf.
Lastly, for that <hi>Lineroles,</hi> the chief disswader of the Marriage is lately slain.
Marshal <hi>M.</hi> who is imploy'd here by the King, in punishment of the authors of
the late disorder, meaneth to make the more haste to the Court, to the end to

                  <p>SInce your departure from hence, there hath no new thing of vallue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened;
but the discharging of the late Spanish Ambassador, who hath

but in open Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cel, directing his Speech to me, saying, that I had
been and was the cause of all the unkindnesse that had chanced betwixt the King
his Master, and the Q. Maj. whereunto as it became me for truths sake, I answer'd
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54478:91"/>
with more modest terms then he deserved, and referred my self to all the
Lords in Councel, to report of me whether any thing had beene said or
done by me from the beginning of these broils concerning him or his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
or the Arrest that had not been ordered and directed by her Majestie in
Councel, all which the whole Lords did affirm, and my Lord of Sussex in
the Italian tongue did very plainly, and very earnestly confirm it; but yet
his cholor would not be so tempered, and so he was dismissed, and Mr. <hi>Knolls</hi>
appointed to tend on him at his house.</p>
                  <p>This was done the thirteenth of this Month; and untill the 24 he could not
be gotten out of the Town, and then he went to Greenwich; and on Saint
<hi>Stephens</hi> day to Gravesend, where he yet remaineth; but this day or to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
he is to remove to Canterbury, and <hi>Iohn Hawkins</hi> (with whom he is
well enough agreed, notwithstanding the braw that had been for <hi>Hawkins</hi> spoyl
in the Indies) is now appointed to pass him over at Dover to Callais, in a
Ship of the Queens Majesties, and to confirm the continuance of his mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
where there was a full determination made by Treaty, by one Monsieur
of the Low-Countrie, and <hi>Thomas Fiascio</hi> a Genevoise, for a mutual resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
on both parts, and the same part in writing to have been sealed and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; he hath so handled the matter, as by his addition of certain words,
the whole is become void.</p>
                  <p>For if our Merchants should admit his device, they should be without
all surety of their Goods in Spain; and contrariwise, the Spaniards should
first have theirs arrested here, whereby it is likely that the intent of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will break off, and therewith our Merchants are best contented: For
now considering the breaking off proceedeth from the other party, it is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that there shall be a speedy sale of the strangers Commodities; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
our own Merchants shall be duely recompenced.</p>
                  <p>At this present there is another come from the King of Portugal, to move
an end of all arrest, and renew the Traffique between this Realm and his;
whereby it is manifestly seen, that there shall follow a very good vent for
all Commodities that Spain was wont to expend.</p>
                  <p>As yet there is no accord known to us betwixt the Kings party in Scotland,
and them of the Castle, for that they of the Castle cannot have their
reasonable demands for the restitution of their Lands and Goods well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.</p>
                  <p>The French Ambassador lately by the Queens Majesties appointment,
dealt with my Lord of Leicester and me upon these Points following, which
he said he was willed to doe by his Masters Letters of the first of this
Moneth.</p>
                  <p>For offer of Amity by Marriage or League.</p>
                  <p>To complain of the intention of her Majestie to send force into Scotland
to aid the Kings party, with a kind of threatning, that the King might not
endure but aid the other party with force, and in speech hereof, a request that
some expedition might be made to procure the Queen of Scots restitution, with
the Queens Majesties assurance.</p>
                  <p>To demand restitution of money that was intercepted, being sent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Scotland for <hi>Viraque,</hi> alleadging that the one half was the Kings money,
and that though the Queen Mother had otherwise at the first spoken to
Mr <hi>Walsingham,</hi> yet she now understandeth the contrary by the Kings Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers
who sent it.</p>

                  <head>To these was answered.</head>
                  <p>To the first, That you had Commission amply to satisfie the King.</p>
                  <p>To the second, That nothing was intended to be done by force, if they
that were of the Castle would abide by their own offers which they had made
to the Queens Majestie by Messages and Letters, viz. That they would accord
with the other party, so as the Queens Majestie would provide, for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
lives, and their Lands, and Goods, which her Majestie intended to
doe, and therein to doe nothing that should be prejudicial to the ancient
League betwixt the French King and the Crowne of Scotland; and so was
told him that you had Commission to declare to the King; wherewith the
Ambassador seemed very well content. As to devise any way expedient for
the Scotch Queen, absolutely was answered, That the Queens Majestie
would never assent thereto, neither would any Counceller of this estate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
permit any consultation to be made thereof, such was her known malice
to the Queens Majestie.</p>
                  <p>The third, for the money, we told him as plain a tale to the contrary, and
vouched the Bishop of Ross his Confession thereof; but the Ambassador would
still have us believe him, which he could not obtain.</p>
                  <p>This Treaty was long on both sides, and ended in good sort and friendly. In
the end he was earnest for his freedom of impost for 30 tonn; we said that he
should be free from as much as he should spend in his house; but that contented
him not: finally, considering the terms of towardness to friendship, he shall
have his own desire, whereby spending seven or eight tonn, the rest shall pay
for his expences. Of all these things I have thought good to scribble to you
this Childermas day in my bed, and am bold to send this Letter unsealed in a
Letter of Mr. <hi>Walsinghams,</hi> because he shall not be ignorant.</p>

                  <p>On Friday last, the Spanish Ambassador was sent for to the

the same hath beene oftentimes intended, but never put in execution

before this present, and now provoked by intelligence of certain new practises

subject to a combat with a Feaver, whereof this day I have had an assault of a
second fit; I must be excused to hold my hand, where my head is not able to
command it, as this bearer can inform you. Since your Letters which came
when Sir <hi>Tho. Smiths</hi> were brought; I received from you two other of the 17.
by which I see you are advertised from good places, how things passed at the
Court there, and in that matter of the third person newly offered, his age, and
other qualities unknown, maketh me doubtfull how to use speech thereof. The
Ambassador hath dealt, as he saith, secretly with me: And I have shewed no
argument to one hand or other; as I may learn further from thence, I will deal;
but fear occupieth me more in this cause of her Marriage, whom God hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to lose so much time, then for my next fit: and yet truely, I have more cause
then before time, for it cometh of a great cold, and a Rhume fallen into my
Lungs, where it is lodged as yet without moving; but in respect of other things
I see and suffer, I weigh not my own carcase. The Queens Majesty hath been
alwaies a merciful Lady, and by mercy she hath taken more harm then by justice,
and yet she thinks that she is more beloved in doing her self harm. God save
her to his honour long among us. <hi>Mather</hi> hath in presence of my Lord of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,

                  <head>To the right Honourable Francis Walsingham <abbr>Esq</abbr> her Majesties Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
Resident in France.</head>
                  <p>SIr, I heartily thank you for your frequent Letters, and especially for that of
the 9. whereby you will not be afraid of the Scotch preparation of force out
of that Country; indeed they should much disturb our proceedings there pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly;
for Mr. <hi>Drury</hi> and Mr. <hi>Randolph,</hi> are there about this instant, labouring
to reconcile them of the Castle to the Kings side; but this French Ambassador
understandeth the matter to be only about the Treaty of abstinence untill <hi>la
Croque</hi> may come, whose haste I wish were retarded with a fit of my gout. The
Queens Majesty is very earnest that you should return to the Court, specially
because she would have you joyn with Sir <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> in this Treatie; and when
I excused your absence for the recovery of your full healing; she said, that she un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that you were healed almost one month past; and thereto I said, that
as you were healed, so was there as much need for you to rest for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your healing, or otherwise you should suffer a relapse with as great peril
as before. Well, quoth she, see you write to him that it is my desire, and will
him to find means to repair gently to the Court, and there he may rest him:
But for all this, it were better her Majestie should mislike of your tarrying, if
it be necessary, whereby you may after that serve her better, then by
going now to doe one piece of service, thereby be made unable to do the rest of
many.</p>
                  <p>I cannot write you what is the inward cause of the stay of the Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks
death, only I find her Majestie diversly disposed, sometime when she
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54478:93"/>
speaketh of her Majesties danger, she concludeth that justice should be done;
another time when she speaketh of his nearness of bloud, of his superiority in
honour, &amp;c. she stayeth. As upon Saturday she signed a Warrant for the
Writs to the Sheriffs of London for his execution on Monday, and so all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
were made with the expectation of all London, and concourse of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands yesterday in the morning; but their coming was answered with
another ordinary execution of <hi>Mather</hi> and <hi>Berny,</hi> for conspiring the Queens
Majesties death, and of one <hi>Rolph,</hi> for counterfeiting the Queens Majesties hand
twice to get concealed Lands. And the cause of this disappointment was this,
suddenly on Sunday <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

into a great misliking that the Duke should die the next day, and said she was
and should be disquieted, and said she would have a new Warrant made that
night to the Sheriffs, to forbear untill they should hear further; and so they
did: Gods Will be fulfilled, and aid her Majestie to doe her self good. I have
signed your Bill with your special money, which though it be great, yet being by
you expended, I would not but allow. This matter of Monsieur is here grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
in secret taken, and surely as it was not here well used in drawing it out
at length, which was pollitiquely done; so hath it not been there friendly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
and yet I do not so show mine opinion of her Majesties stomaking of
that part which now is to be dissembled where the amity is so needfull. I can
write no more.</p>

               <hi>Barker</hi> being arraigned the last week, confessed the Treasons, and said,
That the beginning of his offence was, in that he regarded more the love and
pleasing of the Duke his Master, then of the Prince, and of his Countrey; and
so freely confirmed the Dukes guiltiness. The next day <hi>Higford</hi> did also
confess his fault, terming it a concealment of his Masters Treasons, and added,
that he did oftentimes disswade the Duke from the same.</p>

                  <head>To the Queens Majesty.</head>
                  <p>PLeaseth it your Highnesse, Yesterday the 21 of this Month, Mr. <hi>Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Killigrew,</hi> and I, had Audience, first of the Q. Mother in her
Chamber, being by the young Queen, and Madam <hi>Margaret;</hi> to the Q. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I declared, That I had received a Packet from your Highness to me, and
another to the King her Son, which I sent immediately, Yea (saith she) we have
received it. The Queen my Soveraign (said I) taketh in very good part the
good inclination of the King and his Deputies, towards a more streight amity,
and liketh well our doing hitherto, so that we proceed to the perfecting and
concluding; and hath sent unto us a Power and Authority under the great Seal
of England, to conclude as appertaineth; and so we are ready whensoever the
Kings Deputies will, to proceed as we have began. To this the Queen answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That she was glad that her good sister took it well; and she may see (saith
the Queen) that we mean good saith, and would proceed indeed to the streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54478:93"/>
amity and love that can be betwixt two Princes; and if you will even to
morrow, it were best to lose no time; we (quoth I) are ready at all times, and
would be sorry to protract any time, for both the Queen my Mistress would
gladly have me at home, otherwise to imploy me, and I my self would gladly be
there; and therefore I pray your Majestie let no time be spared, but from day
to day let us be doing, untill it be perfected, which God willing, shall be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Ye say well, and it is best (said she;) but Madam (quoth I) there is a matter
which I must shew of among other; there is one taken prisoner in Ireland, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Stakbold,</hi> who confesseth that the Card. of Lorain set him up to stirr up a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in Ireland, to the maintenance of <hi>Iames Fitzmorris</hi> a Traitor and Rebel.
There you say this (quoth she) and laughed, I am sure of the good will you bear
to the Cardinal of Lorain: It is true (quoth I) even for the good will I bear
him, for I can bear him no good will that attempteth any such thing, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
against the Queen my Mistriss; but (quoth I) he indeed did it in the Kings
name and yours; the which thing, although the Queen my Mistriss doth know
well enough (for the good will that you both do bear her) not to be true; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
she willed me to shew it unto you, and to pray you to call <hi>de la Rocha,</hi> which is
Knight of the Order, and Gentleman of the Chamber to the King, who was
the Conductor of it, who can tell your Majestie all the proceedings, and
that order may be taken in it, and of this matter Monsieur L. Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> can tell you more. Then Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> declared the
case unto her, and that he had moved her in it almost a year since.</p>
                  <p>I am remembred (said she) that there was such a thing about to be done by
the stirring of a Bishop that came out of Spain; it was the Arch-Bishop of
Cassils (quoth I) in Ireland, as he calleth himself. You know Monsieur L;
Ambassador (saith she) to Mr. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> that the King my Sonne disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed
it, and staied <hi>de la Roche,</hi> that he should not go thither, and that he
should revoke all his Power: Yet (saith Mr. <hi>Walsingham)</hi> there be twenty
Harquebusiers, or thereabouts remaining still, and have remained there ever
sithence in a Castle; if it please you to speak with <hi>de la Roche,</hi> he can tell your
Majestie how it doth stand. He is here in the Court (saith she) and goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
shortly, he shall be spoken withall, and if any men be there, the King
my Sonne knoweth not of it, and they shall be revoked.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> said there was two Hostages taken of that <hi>Fitzmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
who were at <hi>Nantes</hi> in the Governours House, he prayed that they
might also be delivered; the Queen said she would send thither.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. <hi>Killigrew</hi> delivered your Highness Letters unto her, which she
read very dilligently; and for that matter she writeth to her Majestie, —I am
sure will tell your Majesties Highness.</p>
                  <p>From thence we came to the Kings Chamber, where I said to the King,
that we received a Packet from your Majestie, and another for him, which
we sent to Monsieur <hi>Pinart,</hi> and that your Highness was well pleased with
our doings: I have received the Packet (said he) and I am glad the Queen my
Sister doth like of your doings here; I would it were done, saith he, so soon
as could be; and if it be the longer a doing, so it be well done, it is well; for
I would have it substantially and firmly done as might be. I desire nothing
more. I have also (said I) such Power sent me under the Great Seal of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
as is required; howbeit without that, whatsoever I had agreed unto, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> am
sure the Queen my Mistriss would not have gon from it; but at the Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it was then necessary to have had the power, the which I have now; and
for other matters, I trust we shall shortly make an end. And for the general
matters touching the Merchants to bring that Traffique into your Countrey,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54478:94"/>
and the benefit which the Low countrey had by it, and would not acknowledge
it; but for the particularities of the Priviledges, and such things, because it
would have some tract of time, the Queens Majestie, if it did so please you,
doth wish that you would send some power to your Ambassador Resident to
Treat with her Highness Councel thereupon. You say well (saith he) and my
Ambassador hath written so to me; and I will send to you when you shall see
the power that I will send him, that you may judge of it; but when meet you
next? To morrow Sir (quoth I) if you please, and so from day to day untill
we make an end: Best of all (saith he) let it be even so.</p>
                  <p>Then I told the King, that even now at this time by chance, in examining of
a prisoner in Ireland, it falleth out and appeareth plain, that the Cardinal of
Lorain had not done enough to raise up troubles to your Majestie in your Realm,
and to trouble England and Scotland, but he could not let the poor Realm of
Ireland alone to be in quiet, but there he would stirr upon Sedition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
also; at the which the King laughed heartily; and (quoth I) in this he
abuseth your Majesties name; and as of gift he would give the Counties of
Ormond and Oosory to one <hi>Iames Fitzmorris,</hi> a Rebel, and promises aid of men
and munition for them there to rebel against the Q. my Mistress. In my name
(quoth he) I never heard of it; Jesus! (quoth he) I could never think any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or hurt to my good Sister. Sir, (quoth I) here is the Article of Confession
of one <hi>Stackbold,</hi> who affirmeth this: Here is at the Court, as I hear say, one
<hi>de la Roche,</hi> Knight of the Order, and Gentleman of your Chamber, who was
the doer of it, he can inform your Majestie at the full of the matter: Well,
let me alone (quoth he) with it, I will see it redressed well enough. Then Mr.
<hi>Walsingham</hi> somewhat more declared what had been done in the matter, and
shewed the King what the Queen Mother had said to us, that <hi>de la Roche</hi> was now
in the Court, and therefore prayed him that he might be sent for, and see order
taken in that matter, as appertained to the good will which he had to the amity
of both the Realms, which the King said he would. After he said to the King
that Mr. <hi>Killigrew</hi> should now depart home, seeing he was come to his old
Room, but that we desired him to stay a day or two to heare our next meeting,
and to see how near we should come to agreement, and so to bring to the Q.
Majestie some good contentment. Whereupon the King said that thing should
be ordered, and with such expedition, that he should come home well-pleased,
and bring the Queens Majestie such word as she should therewith be contented,
peradventure more then she would think, and so departed for that day. This
day we looked to be sent for, but the King went on hunting, and pretence was
made to us that the Councel hath had the Bill which we delivered to the King
in consideration, and that they would have his Majesties advice of the day, time,
and place of our meeting; after they had consulted upon it to the intent we
might after we once began, continually travel untill the end were made. This
is so much as hitherto is done. Thus we commit your Majestie to Almighty
God.</p>

                  <head>To the Queens Majestie.</head>
                  <p>PLeaseth it your Majestie to be advertised, the last of <hi>February,</hi> when the
Treaty of the League was in manner at a point, and Master <hi>Killegrew</hi>
was ready to take his leave of the King and Queen Mother, we demanded
audience, and came all three to the Court; we were first brought into the
Kings Chamber, where was also the Duke of <hi>Alanson,</hi> and other Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
where I first declared to the King, That his Deputies and we were
now almost at a point, and in all other things we thought we should agree.
He said, he had understood that, and was very glad of it, hoping that this
was but a beginning, and that the Amity should increase daily, and bring
forth more fruit. But Sir (quoth I) there is yet the matter of Religion
not fully agreed upon, without the which well provided for, I know not
how the League can go forward, or be sure. The King said he could not
have it put in the League, but it should be in such general words made,
that the matter of Religion should be contained. Sir (quoth I) that
cannot be, nor no general words can contain it, if the party that is bound
will say, that it is against his Conscience, or he meant it not. Why,
saith the King, for that I will write to the Queen my sister with mine
own hand what I mean even to that; and that I will as well defend her
in that case, as if it were expressed in words. Sir (quoth I) if you will
have it in an Article by it self, and as concluded betwixt you, so as it
be put it writing, and sealed with the Great Seal of <hi>France,</hi> as the true
interpretation of your meaning in the League, then we can be content
with it, although in the Treaty it be not specially put in, but in general
words; for being so made, it shall be of as much force by the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as the League. Then Master <hi>Walsingham</hi> declared, That it was
more honourable for the King, and more assurance, that it were put ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
in the Treaty; for then not onely the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> but
also other Kings, which be of the Religion, would be right glad to enter
into it; and by that means onely you should (saith he) be able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> yea, and all the rest of <hi>Europe</hi> that should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing against you; whereas if it be done in general words, or
underhand, they will not trust the matter so much, nor have so good co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
or occasion to desire to enter into this League with you; and what or
whom need your Majestie fear, being so well proped up and fortified
with this so strong a League. This may be, saith the King, hereafter, my
Councel telleth me it should be dangerous for me at this present, to have
it in express words; but what maketh it matter, I mean it so, and what I
once say, I will keep it, I will rather dye then not keep my promise: Here
I say it to you, and will write it to the Queen my Sister. How do you
mean Sir (quoth I) in a writing, after the fashion of a Treaty, and sealed
with your Great Seal of <hi>France,</hi> or but in a Letter close. In a Letter
close (saith he) signed with my hand, where I will express the same words
are meant as you would have put in the League; and I will promise that
I will be ready to defend in that case, as well as in any other, and so I
will indeed; and that I say I will keep, to dye for it. Sir (quoth I) for
you I do think no less, and I am sure that the Queens Majestie our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris
and we do take your Majestie to be a faithful Prince, and constant
in your words as any is living; but vvhen we speak Treaties, they be
<pb facs="tcp:54478:95"/>
not made in words, nor in such Letters missive, but after another authentical sort
sworn and sea led; without which order I cannot, for my part, take that it is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
and orderly done; and besides that, this Treaty is not personal, but is
perpetual, and is for you and your Successors. Why, saith he, it is made for our
two lives and one year after, and then within that year, if I should dye, such a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may be gotten: And if my Son, or whosoever should come after me, should
not keep his promise, which he hath spoken and written, I could wish him stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
and not alive. Saith Mr. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> though the Queens Majestie should
peradventure be content with such assurance, yet some of her Councel would not,
and leagues must be made not onely to satisfie the Prince, but also the Subjects,
especially of such a one as this, which is a comfort, and assurance of all parties. For
when upon this hope, they shall traffique here abroad in your Countrey and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and see in the Treaty no assurance (for general words is holden for no as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance)
in this case they will be afraid to traffique or travel abroad: And Sir, ye
had need consider well of it; for as there be that do favour this league, as we do,
there be other I warrant you which be of the Spanish faction, and would be loth it
should go forward: and if they taking this advantage, should perswade the Queen
from it, and in the mean while bring her some other offer; and then this break off,
it would be hard to get it again. Break off (saith he) I had rather dye, I will satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Queen my Sister well enough, I do not doubt it, though you be never so
stiff; I understand she will be content with such assurance, as I tell you I do assure
you. Sir (quoth I) I do not know so much, and think verily she will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
and until know more from her Majestie, I must still think so. Well,
saith the King, ye have coursed me a vvhile, novv must I course you again; for the
Queen of Scots, I must have that my request put into the Treaty for her, make
vvhat ansvver you vvill, she is my Kinsevvoman, and my Sister in lavv, and she was
my Soveraign; and you do knovv the league vvhich is betvvixt that Realm and
my Realm, I can do no less then have the same inserted into the league. Sir
(quoth I) as vve have vvritten to your Deputies, vve have no Commissions
or Authority to treat of any such matter. Touching the late Queen of Scots,
she vvas your Soveraign, thanks be to God she is not novv (vvith that he laughed)
and it is thought, vvhen she vvas Queen here, she deserved not very vvell nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of your Realm, nor of your House; and she is your Kinsvvoman, so is she
also to the Queen my Mistris; but if she vvere your daughter or your son, if he
or she vvould procure your death, or to have your Crovvn from you, vvould
you not see justice done on him or her that should attempt it. What is that (saith
he) so I repeated it again, that if his son should attempt to depose him from his
Crovvn, or procure his death, that he should be content that justice should
rather be done, then to be still in that danger. Why (saith he) I do not require
to have it put in the same league. Saith Mr. <hi>Killegrew,</hi> fire and vvater cannot
be together, the one is contrary to the other; the league is made for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
and strait Amity betvvixt you and the Queens Majestie of <hi>England,</hi>
and you vvould treat for the Queens most mortal and dangerous enemy;
this cannot stand together, you must take her novv for dead, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell vvhether she be dead or alive, and vvhy should you then require her
to be put in the league. And if it be so (saith the King) vvhat remedy,
then there can be no more suit made for her, and so vve took our leave. And
from thence vve vvere conveyed to the Queen Mothers Chamber, vvhere vvas
the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> and a great number of other Ladies, vvhere first I declared
to the Q. that vvhere she had promised me, that for the Merchants that be in the
Staple or Hanse, they might have the exercise of their religion after the maner of
the English Church; now when we come to put it in the Treaty, the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54478:95"/>
will not agree to it. They say they heard nothing of it. Yes (said she) I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
that they might have it in their house, with the doors shut, and in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
tongue. (Quoth I) I pray you let them know so much, for I do not think that
ye have told them. Yes (saith she) but you must not have this in the Treaty, but by
another way. So (quoth I) Madam, you still cut us off something, as we but half
agree to every thing; but how shall it be, that I might once see the manner of it,
and judge of it. But for the greater matter we have with the King, as touching the
League, in the which except these words be expressed, we think the league not to
bear the meaning which we do take it should; and yet to please the King, and to go
so near as we could, we were content, if the King will, with another Article or
Treaty declarative, made apart betwixt his Majestie and the Q. my Mistris, under
the great Seal of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> declare that in general words he doth mean,
also in the matter of Religion to demand nothing else; but the King now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to us to do it by a Letter close missive, the which for my part I do not esteem
in such a case as this is, and know not what it is, and how it can be. Why did you
think (saith she) that the King my son would deceive you, the Q. your Mistris, my
good sister, would be content with it we know well enough. Madam (quoth I)
we know not so much, nor I cannot believe it for my part: But if she would, what
is that for us that be her Ministers, which must be (so much as our poor capacities
will extend) that we do wisely, surely and substantially in such affairs for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
as she doth put in our credit, till we understand her mind be otherwise chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
if you understand her mind to be otherwise then we yet do know, she is our
Soveraign and Mistress, we must be content to obey. Other talk we had about
the matter, each of us three with her, much after that we had with the King; but
ever when she was brought to a strait, that was her shift, she knew well enough
her Majestie would be content with such a letter, and that so she was given to
understand: Till at the last I said, that except there were further assurance for the
matter of Religion, we could not, nor durst not subscribe the Treaty, until we
were better certified that your Highness would be so content, for my conscience
was against it, to leave so great a point upon so little a hold. Then (as the King
said) he would speak with his Councel, and we should know more. The Queen
Mother said, she would speak with her son in the matter. Then I required her,
that she would do so much as call for Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> and shew him how she
was agreed for the Merchants, and that he would make haste with the Treaty, as
it was agreed upon, saving for the mending of three or four words; for I saw novv
I must be fain to send into <hi>England,</hi> before I can subscribe it. She said, she would
not fail; but that (said she) if it be but that doubt, or some such small thing, it
might be let alone, till one should come out of <hi>England.</hi> The King my son
will send over the Marshal <hi>Montmorency,</hi> because the Queen your Mistris de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
it; and he desireth again that she would send hither my Lord of <hi>Leicester,</hi>
whom he desireth to see and honour for the good affection that he beareth to
the Amity betwixt the two Realms, and to acquit himself for the presents which
he hath divers times sent unto him, and then she doubted not all things should be
done as your Majestie would desire. Nay, Madam (quoth I) I know the fashion of
leagues, it must be first agreed upon betwixt the Commissioners, that no words be
altered, then subscribed with the hands of both the parties, your Commissioners
delivering the part signed with their hands to us, and ours next to them,
then the Prince causeth it to be made under the great Seal of the Realm,
and so causeth it to be delivered each to others Ambassador; he that cometh
to see it sworn to, may make a new League, if the Princes will so, to alter
that he cannot; for the Princes be bound to ratifie and swear to that, the
which the Commissioners were agreed upon. And it were not wisdom to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54478:96"/>
send such personages as your Majestie speaks of to an uncertain League, you may
consider my Mistress will not do it. Well (saith she) I will speak with the King
my self, and send you Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> who shall treat with you of all these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Then Mr <hi>Walsingham</hi> asked her, if any thing were done as touching <hi>de la
Roche</hi> and the matters in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And she said, yea; and that <hi>de la Roche</hi> saith it
is nothing, and that there is not a French man there, and that he will lay his head
on it. I pray you send home word, that it may be tried out, and if he do not say
truth, that he may feel smart for it, and be well punished. Then Mr. <hi>Killegrew</hi>
took his leave of the Queen Mother and the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> as he did before in
the Kings Chamber, of the King and the Duke, for so they name the Duke
d'Alanson of all whom he had gracious and gentle words, as he can shew your
Majestie he could not, for divers respects, conveniently have taken his leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The younger Queen is taken here to be undoubtedly with child; for she
hath all the tokens of a woman that hath conceived, and they gess she hath gone
three moneths and more, whereof the King and Queen Mother is not a little joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Thus we most humbly commit your Highness to the tuition of Almightie
God.</p>

                  <p>YOur Lordship by Sir <hi>Tho: Smithes</hi> Letters unto her Majestie, shall be
fully informed what hath passed in Conference, as well with the King as his
Deputies, touching the League, to which I refer you. Of late I caused one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the colour of a Catholique, to repair unto one <hi>Darbishire</hi> an English Jesuit in
<hi>Paris,</hi> for that I understood that there is a concurrency of intelligence between
him and those of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> as also with those of the Scotish Queens faction. The
party I sent, did seem very much to bewail the evil success that the late pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
took in Scotland, and that now he did fear their case will grow despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
especially for that <hi>Mathers</hi> enterprize was also discovered. To this the
Jesuit answered, that the evil handling of matters was the cause that they took
no better effect; notwithstanding (saith he) be of good comfort, and assure
your self there are more <hi>Mathers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> then one, who will not admit, when
time shall conveniently serve to adventure their lives in seeking to acquit us of
that lewd woman (meaning her Majestie) For (saith he) if she were gone, then
would the hedge lie open, whereby the good Queen, that now is prisoner (in
whom resteth the present the right of this Crown) should easily enjoy the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For besides that all the Catholiques within the Realm of <hi>England</hi> are at her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion;
there are (saith he) God be thanked, divers Heretiques that are well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
towards her, which is no small miracle, that God hath so blinded the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their just desert, unless they return unto the Catholique faith. The other replye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
that for his part, he could never hope to see her at liberty, nor long to see her ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

way. Well (saith the Jesuit) I tell you truly, that I dare assure you she shall have
no harm, for she lacketh no friends in the English Court. And as for her liberty
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54478:96"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o much to seek it either by
hook or by crook, as no doubt but there are some good men that will venter a
joynt to bring it to pass: For if she were once possessed of the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
it will be the onely way and mean to reform all Christendom, in reducing
them to the Catholique faith; and therefore you must think that there are more
heads occupied in this matter then English heads, and that there are moe ways to
the wood then one; and therefore be of good courage, and ere ever one year
be at an end, you shall know more: Besides his villainous and undutiful language
of her Majestie, he used very lewd and bitter speeches against the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi>
and your Lordship. This was the sum of their talk, which I conferring and
weighing with the former intended practises, made me think it worth the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement,
that her Majestie may see how much they build upon the possibility of
that dangerous woman, whose life is a step unto her Majesties death; for that
they repute her for an undoubtable successor; or rather (which is a more danger)
for a right Inheritor. And though I know her mischievous intentions are limitted,
that they can reach no further to her Majesties harm or prejudice, then shall seem
good to Gods providence; yet is her Majestie bound for her own safety and
her Subejcts, to adde to the same his good providence, her just policy, so far
forth as may stand with justice. And so leaving further to trouble your Honour
at this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>YOur Lordship at large by Sir <hi>Tho: Smithes</hi> Letters unto her Majestie, shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
to what issue we are grown to touching this Treaty: We can by no
means nor perswasions we can use, draw the King to any other interpretation of
his meaning touching the point of Religion, then by private Letters, for that it
should seem that their Ambassador from hence hath assured the King here, that
her Majestie will be content therewith. For my private opinion, seeing this League
is to indure but during the lives of the two Princes, and that the substance of all
Leagues consisteth, chiefly in the sincerity of the matters, and that this Prince hath
given great shew to the world of great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>incerity, I think the private Letter bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as much in honour, as any other Instrument or Contract that can pass between
them can do in Law: For if they should break, the matter is not to be tryed in
the Chamber imperial, by way of pleading of what value the instruments are, God
and the Sword must be Judges, so that then pleading must give place. But this
my good Lord is for my private opinion; in matters of so great weight as
leagues are, I profess, altogether ignorance. If her Majestie can content her self
with this private interpretation of the Kings meaning, then if it would please her
Majestie, through your good motion, to use some words of assurance towards the
Ambassador there, of the great good opinion she hath of the Kings sincerity, and
that she buildeth more upon his words, then upon contract; I know nothing can
more content him, for he desireth to be reputed a Prince that esteemeth his word
and honour above his life; Besides, he wisheth himself to be in her Majesties good
opinion before all other Princes; and doth often take occasion to say, that he
hopeth there will be no less earnest good will and strait Amity between him and
her Majestie, then was between her Father and his Grandfather. To nourish this
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54478:97"/>
opinion of Amity between them, I take it to be the office of all those who truly
love their Majesties, as that League that tendeth greatly to both their sureties,
being knit together in perfect Amity; which beside their particular safety, will
breed a great repose in all <hi>Europe,</hi> especially for the cause of Religion. And
surely (my Lord) for the increase and nourishment of this friendship, nothing
can yield more furtherance then your access hither in ratification of the League,
a thing very much desired of their Majesties here, as you perceive by Sir <hi>Tho:
Smithes</hi> Letter. The motion at the first being made by the Queen Mother,
seemed strange unto us for her to name a particular person, but when she shewed
unto us, that her Majestie the last Summer desired the Marshal <hi>Montmorency,</hi>
whereunto they did condescend; and that they also mean to send him now for
the confirmation of this League, we had nothing to reply. They say that the
King, in respect of the good offices that you had done between the two Crowns,
the great honour you had used towards his Ministers sent hither, and certain pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
that you had sent unto himself, desireth very much both to see you and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
you. Besides, she said, that your coming should be so grateful unto her and
the King her Son, as you might obtain any thing at his hands for the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Majestie, so far forth as he might with his honour grant. Surely,
my Lord, though this voyage to your purse cannot but grow very chargable, yet
for the furtherance of the common cause of Religion, for the increase of Amity
between the two Princes and Crowns, and for their own particular reputation,
never was there offered to your Lordship greater occasion, both generally and
particularly to do good, then at this present. Your Lordship can do more good in
one hour here, then twenty such petty companions as my self is can do in a whole
year, or possible in all our lives time. I would I could so well hope of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
leave, as of your Lordships liking to take this journey upon you, and then I
would assure my self of your coming; and by the same, of as great good to ensue,
as ever followed of any others imployment in this voyage, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>IT may pleas your Lordship to understand, that Monsieur <hi>de la Mothe</hi> hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
their Majesties here, that the Q. of Scots cause in <hi>England</hi> is not so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
as we make it, for that lately she hath received so much increase of liberty,
as that she went a Hawking with the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> which advertisement
here, maketh them more earnest in her cause then they were wont, for that they
doubt one day she will come to the possession of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> either by
succession or prevention; and therefore the Councel here do advise the King so
to deal for her, as may continue in her an opinion that he is careful for her well
own safety, and cannot but do justice, then call things proceed well; and her
Majestie may well perceive, that any favour shewed unto her, doth not onely
breed disfavour, but also danger and hindrance towards her self, whereof Mr.
<hi>Killegrew</hi> can inform her Majestie at large.</p>
                  <p>The opinion of the wisest sort of the Gentlemen of the Religion that are here,
is, That the League it self shall not do more good, then the imployment of two
honourable Personages for the ratification of the same; and therefore they desire
me most earnestly to move her Majestie to concur with the King in this respect,
who hath to that end made choice of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> hoping that her Majestie will
choose one of quality somewhat answerable to his calling: Besides, the King and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54478:97"/>
Queens desire, as may appear by Sir <hi>Tho: Smithes</hi> Letters, the said Gentlemen
do desire much the Earl of <hi>Leicesters</hi> coming, as one very grateful unto their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
here; and therefore shall be able to do very much good by the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their causes, whose increase of credit cannot but be beneficial unto her
Majestie, in considering the great good affection they bear towards her, in regard
of the great honour and benefits they have received at her Majesties hands; and
therefore their increase of credit shall breed increase of Amity, a thing not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
for her Majestie, considering how she finds some of her neighbours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
abroad, and her Subjects inclined at home. Besides, if her Majestie should
not seem to be desirous of <hi>Montmorencies</hi> coming, considering that he is no less
willing to come, then his Master is to send, it might give him occasion to think
that her Majestie maketh not that account of him, that his great good will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
towards her deserveth, whereof he letteth not to make demonstration out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
as otherways; of the which, besides mine own experience during the
time of my charge here, Sir <hi>Tho: Smith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Killegrew</hi> can give good testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and therefore I doubt not, her Majestie wil have good consideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
accordingly. Your Lordship at large, by Sir <hi>Tho: Smith,</hi> is advertised how
strangely the Article of Provision for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was taken by his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Surely if her Majestie persist in that point, to have him specially provided
for, I perceive then, that this Treaty is at the best, for that they themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that the end of this League is onely to bridle his greatness; therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for his safety, who seeketh both their destructions, they cannot tell what
to judge what it meaneth, especially seeing, that of late he hath no way deserved
at her Majesties hands any such favour. If therefore her Majestie do think that
this Prince is of any value, who is towards all men sincere, towards her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
well affected, towards Religion <hi>pius Inimicus,</hi> she must not weigh him in one
ballance with <hi>Spain,</hi> who is of word unsincere, in affection towards her Majestie
maliciously bent, and the common Enemy to our Religion. If her Majestie mean
to take profit of his friendship, the next way shall be, to strengthen her self with
the Amity of others in such sort, as she shall have no need of it; for it is the nature
of a proud man to make best account of them that least esteem him, for whosoever
yieldeth to him, increaseth his pride, which thing those that deal with the Spanish
Nation find to be most true.</p>
                  <p>So long as the late Catholique League made remaineth in force, her Majestie,
nor any other Princes of the Religion, can promise unto themselves any thing at
<hi>Spains</hi> hands, but as much mischief as he can do them; which thing her Majestie,
with the rest, shall find to be true, by too dear an experience, if the same be not
holpen by some counter league. The consideration whereof maketh the German
Princes now (who otherwise are slow in their counsels &amp; determinations) to think
it necessary for them to joyn in this counter-league; which thing your Lordship
may perceive by this inclosed letter, which lately I received from the <hi>Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>

of the Treaty, as the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> her self told Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> and
me, standeth her in very good stead, whom she sent for the 7 of this moneth
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54478:98"/>
to come and speak with her. At our access she told us, that she did not send for
us, before she did make Queen Mother acquainted therewith; not (saith she) in
respect of my self, but in respect of her Majestie, towards whom I would be loth
to ingender any jealousie, considering that she is growing to so good Amity with
this Crown: For as for my self, I am not afraid to make known to all the world the
great good will I bear towards her Majestie, to whom I am as much bound as ever
one Prince was to another. And because (saith she) you are Ministers to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
here, I thought good to make you acquainted in what state and terms the
Treaty of the marriage standeth betwixt their Majesties here and me (saith she)
there is no difference, but only the manner of solemnization. I have alledged
the Treaty which you sent me, whereunto they take exceptions, such as are of
no great value; and therefore (said she) I cannot tell what to judge of the matter,
because amongst the rest of the exceptions, they say it was no true Copy of
the Treaty. I have sent for you Monsieur <hi>Smith</hi> (saith she) to know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you were a dealer in the same, whether you will not justifie it to be a true
Copy, to whom Sir <hi>Tho: Smith</hi> answered, that knowing the great good will her
Majestie did bear her, and how much she desired the good success of that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
as a thing that tended to the advancement of Religion, and repose of this
Realm, he could not but in duty avow the same, and be willing to do any good
office that might advance the said marriage. She made us acquainted with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other particularities, which I thought good rather to refer to the report
of this bearer, then to commit them to writing. The Copy of the Letter
which I send unto your Lordship here inclosed, sent unto her from her Son,
which she delivered unto us secretly to read, may shew you how full of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
the matter is, and therefore until the same be concluded, I hold it for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
She findeth here a great stay of Count <hi>Lodovicus</hi>'s advice, who surely is

the next day (because the King himself was yet in his Diet) we did speak with

that by Letters from her Majestie we had understood two things, whereof we
were sorry; the one, that your Highness having received the dispatch from us of
our negotiation here, as touching the league and amity, &amp; willing to dispatch our
Currier again with your resolution, which we doubt not should be to her and the
K. contention, their Ambassador Resident required that your Majestie would not
write your answer or resolution unto us, until he had his Currier come, for whom
he looked every day. Saith the Q. that is, because he would coucur with you. I
think so (said I) and it is well; and I trust we shall so concur to a perpetual and
strait Amity. I hope (saith she) but yet he vvrote not so much to us, that he
spake to the Queen to forbear his resolution to you, but onely that he looked
for his Currier. The other is more grievous to us, because we take the time
lost, and some evil suspicion may be conceived; but I trust the Amity is so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun

send for that purpose for aid, and even at the same time, were letters intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> whereby she giveth her self,
her Realm, and her Son to be in the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Spain.</hi> And with that the L. <hi>Seton,</hi> who had been there, and sithence with
the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> driven by a Tempest into a Haven, which by the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
was appointed where the <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> should arrive, disguising
himself like a Mariner, went from thence and came as I told your Majesty, into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and into the Castle of <hi>Edenborough</hi> with some other of the Queens
Majesties Rebels; his papers and instructions being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound, declared that in her
Majesties name he had assured the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> that with a small power they
might bring into their hands the yong King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and so carry him into
<hi>Spain.</hi> Then giveth comfort to other of the Rebels by other letters, that
shortly they shal return into <hi>Scotland.</hi> This Madam (quoth I) is enough to make
the Queen our Mistris to awake, and to look about her, and even at that same
time cometh Monsieur <hi>de Crocque</hi> with the Kings letters, and requireth the
Scotch Queen, to be set at liberty, and to be sent into <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Madam (quoth I) I pray your Majestie consider of the case, and
imagine you were the Q. of <hi>England</hi> my Mistris, and that all these things at
one time came to your consideration, what would you think. Ah Monsieur
L'Ambassador (quoth she) we did know then of no such intent of the Q.
of Scots, you may be sure, we would be as loath that any such thing should be
attempted and rather loather: Madam (quoth I) I do not doubt, considering
this good amity which is so forward betwixt the two Realms. Well (saith
she) she is allyed to the King and to me, and brought up here, and we for our
part could do no less then intreat for her, what we could obtain at the Queen
my sisters hands. She seeketh another way to ruinate her self, to hurt her
friends, to deserve no pity nor favor, and sorry we must be for her, and if she
be so dangerous (as it appeareth) we cannot nor dare not require liberty for
her which is so perilous to the Queen my sisters state: yet if it shall please her
for our sake to give her her life, and for the rest provide for her own safety as
reason is she shall do a deed of price, and in this matter we will trouble the Q.
your Mistris no furth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. Then (quoth I) one other thing there is touching
Monsieur <hi>de Crocque</hi> his power or Commission (for so we call it) is not large
enough, for he hath (as he saith) but Commission to move them to Peace and
Agreement. To the which now of late they of the Castle do shew themselvs
very obstinate, perverse and unreasonable by reason of some offers from the
Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and some hope peradventure received from hence: For where
before they were content to require the Queens Majesties aid to come to a
good agreement with the adverse faction, so that the surety of their Persons,
Lands, Goods, and Honors might be provided for, now they be so puffed up
that they will not come to any abstinence of Civil war amongst themselves.
And surely the Queen my Mistris meant no other then to have brought them
into quietness among themselves. To the intent that the Realm might after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
within it self, enter into this League with the other two Realms, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
as it were for defence one whole Realm, and so I have always told you
Madam. It is so (saith she) and we desire no other. Well Madam (quoth I)
if you then will concur with us, the matter will be soon at a point. Then Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Crocque</hi> must have a larger Commission then yet he hath; for he saith he
hath but (as I said before) a Commission to make them to accord amongst
themselves, to choose a number of men to govern the Realm, and never make
mention of King nor Queen. Why (saith Master <hi>Walsingham)</hi> that were a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54478:99"/>
headless Government, and when will they agree to it? he that knoweth that
Nation, will never think that will come to pass; and therefore that should
be to make more dissention amongst them, not to make a Peace. Madam
(quoth I) that Commission hath no Order nor Authority, but as is
said to continue trouble. But Madam, as in all matters hitherto we have well
agreed betwixt the two Realms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> I pray you let us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in this. And if we speak reasonable, the King shall concur with us; if
not, let us hear answer to the contrary, and we will answer. The Queen my
Mistris hath propounded this, that they shall all agree to acknowledge the
young King for King. For as the for Queen, she hath good cause not to trust her,
nor you neither. Then for compounding, how one shall agree with th'other for
their Lands, Offices, and Goods; that to be agreed by the mediation of wise
and indifferent men, whereof your Ambassador, be it Monsieur <hi>de Croque</hi> or
any other, to be an Umpire, and whom the Q. my Mistris shall appoint to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
So that they shall well know, that these two Crowns as friends will
make them by perswasion to agree to reason, if not to joyn together, to make
them take reason against their wills. Ye say well Monsieur Amb. saith she, and
you speak roundly and plainly, as you were wont to do; and I will speak
with the K. my son, and you shall have answer. Madam (said Mr. <hi>Walsingham)</hi>
Monsieur Amb. saieth here plainly unto you. Yea (saith she) so he is wont, I
know him well enough. Yea (saith he) but while two shall be at strife, if ye
would set up again the Scotch Queen, whom (by reason) the Queen our Mistres
cannot abide, if in the mean time a third should come and set foot in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
would it not trouble you and us also? Yes, saith she, and we should be as
loath to see that as you: Well Madam (quoth I) then take heed of the pick-thank,
for he is ready; I know whom you mean (quoth she) and he is ready
indeed, and loves to be medling in every place, but I doubt not but the Queen
your Mistris and we shall agree, it is our desire, and that this amity may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
to make us both strong, for all that Coast, I hope so (quoth I) and
would be loath that all labour for so little a matter should be lost. Lost (saith
she) fear you not, your Queen can desire no reasonable thing at our hands, but
we will agree to it, you shall judge your self, and to morrow you shall have
answer God willing, but hear you nothing else of the other matter? Madam
(quoth I) I know not what you mean, but surely not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing is spoken, not so
much as from Mr <hi>Killegrew</hi> nor of the league, but we look every day that our
Currior should be here, and then we shall be able to inform your Majesty. Ye
shall not marvail (saith she) that I be so inquisitive, for gladly would I learn
somewhat of the Queen my sisters minde, and make this Amity <hi>Si estroictè</hi> as
may be. This is the sum of that which passed at that time. <hi>viz.</hi> the last day
of <hi>March</hi> betwixt the Queen mother and us. The next day the first of <hi>April</hi>
Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> came to our lodging at afternoon, and shewed that upon our
talk with Q. mother, of the which she had at large declared unto the King,
because some things were in doubt; the King according to the promise of the
Q. mother had sent them to us both to be satisfyed in our doubts, and to give
us a reasonable answer: betwixt them and Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> and me, all was
repeated again. The doubt your Majestie and your Councel found, and the
insufficiency of his Commission was at all points debated again at full, each of
us serving others turn to make probable what we said, and they what they said.
And first we beat them with reason from the choosing of indifferent men, that
should rule neither in the Princes nor the Queens name, that we said was
rather the <hi>Aristocratia</hi> as they would have it. First the <hi>Scots</hi> will never choose
such; they of that Nation were never wont to be governed but under a King,
yea and hardly would their Kings govern, of whom the most part they have
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54478:99"/>
slain themselves. Then they have elected already and Crowned their King, to
whom by right it is due: For as for their Queen, she is by them deposed. She
is in <hi>England,</hi> and worthily kept so straightly, that when it pleased her Majesty
she might justly have the reward of her deserts, and if they were too earnest to
set her up, or for her liberty they may peradventure be an occasion to shorten
her life, It was also brought in, that the League that <hi>France</hi> had, was not with
the person, but with the Realm and seat thereof. They said the King could
not with his honor, so long as she lived consent to the deposing of her, being
his Allie and confederate, nor to the setting up of her son, who is not a Kings
son, but hath all his right from her onely. Why (quoth we) then you do
wrong, will you interrupt the doings of the Realm, whosoever is King there,
and acknowledged King, to him are you allyed. They came to this, that if
the Scots did universally agree to it, they must be content. And as for the Q.
they had heard and known too much by her, and although some excuse may
be made for her by the grief of her long imprisonment: yet she hath gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
too much, and against her own friends, and her own safety, and her sons,
and the whole Realms But (say they) <hi>Scotland</hi> is a free Nation, and we do
claim no superiority over them, and therefore the King cannot command them
nor compel them, but by perswasion and by intreaty what can be gotten by
them to be done, that is reasonable, and now that the Q. is prisoner with you,
and not like to come to them, why should they not obey the yong Prince, whom
if his mother were dead they must needs obey, and why should not all be done
in his name, as when we had King <hi>Iohn</hi> prisoner, did not all <hi>France</hi> obey to
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his son? To him (quoth we) as Regent: but now if the one
shall obey as to the Prince, the other as to the King, there shall be no rule nor
order. Upon this was some dispute between us. In fine, we concluded <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulere
in Commune,</hi> that they should send such Instructions to Mr. <hi>de Croque</hi> for
that purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> so in accord, that they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
agree to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Articles of his Instructions might be such, as your Majesty shall think them
reasonable for your Majesties surety. And those to be shewed to your
Majesty to judge upon, upon which your Majesty shall also joyn for the same
purpose, with the same or such Articles as ye shall devise, that by common
consent of both the Realms, such an accord shall be made by the consents of
the Scots themselves, or by the mediation common of both your Ambassadors,
That neither your Majesty, nor the King shall be accounted to lose any thing
of the old Amity of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but joyntly to aid them, to be of one accord, &amp; in
subjection to one K. that both your Commissioners or Ambassadors shal declare
that as Princes united in most straight Amity, that which shal please the one shal
please the other, and to the contrary, who shall displease either, shall displease
both. And if any shall be so obstinate that they will not come to accord by
good and reasonable conditions, that they shall look for no ayd from hence by
any means but rather the contrary.</p>

said that for so much as we could understand we liked them well, and
they had gone as far as yesterday they told us they could go. But to give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of liking or not liking them, we referred to your Majesty. And if <hi>du

Crocque</hi> do shew the same to your Majesty, we doubted not but whosoever the
Q. did send by her commandment, also should be shewn to him or to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
the Instructions and Commission which your Majesty would send by
him, so that there may appear plain dealing and perfect union and intelligence
betwixt these two Princes, and that no other subtlety or craft was meant, but
sincerely to follow the true amity which now was begun, That both in heart,

                  <p>TRusty and well beloved, We greet you well; where the French King our
good brother did of late send hither to us Mr. <hi>de Crocque</hi> with his letters,
signifying to us thereby, that upon such an agreement as had been lately made
between you as our Ambassadors, and his Deputies to have some Gent. sent on
either part into <hi>Scotland</hi> to cease the Arms there, he had for that purpose cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
and sent hither the said <hi>du Crocque.</hi> And besides that, did by the same let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54478:100"/>
give charge to the said <hi>du Crocque</hi> to make request unto us affectionately,
to put the Q. of Scots into liberty, and to send her surely into <hi>France,</hi> which
he did earnestly move unto us in speech, adding another desire by words of his
own, that he might also repair to the said Q. of Scots, and visit and speak with
her; hereupon you well might think that we did finde all these proceedings
very strange, and not answerable to such other overtures of the inward friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which our said brother hath professed to us by many other ways, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to such things as you have declared to the said King, to the Q. mother,
and other his Ministers on our behalf, concerning the dangerous practises of
late time attempted by the said Q. of Scots against us, both for our person
and Estate, and so we did in some part declare unto the said <hi>du Crocque,</hi> and to
the French Ambassadors. And yet we did not hereupon refuse that he should
repair into <hi>Scotland,</hi> although we did mislike of the request made for the Scotch
Queens liberty at this time, and did deny to him to repair to her; but we did
require him by way of advice until he might hear of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in what terms
the parties stood. So as we might before his going, by conference with him
consider, what means were best to use to bring the divisions to an accord in
<hi>Scotland:</hi> After which done, within few days we understood that the L. <hi>Seaton</hi>
who had been long in <hi>France</hi> for the Scotch Queen, and after had been in the
King of <hi>Spains Low-Countries,</hi> with Commission and Title to be the Queen
of Scots Ambassador there, had by tempest of Seas been driven into <hi>Harwich,</hi>
and from thence passed disguised as a Mariner into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so entered into
the Castle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> with no smal comfort to them to persist in their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie
to maintain Civil war, and by Gods goodness (which in all causes we find
always ready) there were afterwards found in the ship at <hi>Harwich,</hi> such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in writing, to prove the earnest continuance and prosecuting of the Scotch
Queens practises against us, the intention, that they in the Castle should by no
means come to accord, &amp; that our Rebels in the Low-Countries should short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
return into <hi>Scotland,</hi> that we were justly occasioned further to consider of this
matter, and to encrease our doubt herein, we were shortly after these things
discovered, advertised out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that in very deed upon the Lord <hi>Seatons</hi>
coming to the Castle, upon intelligence of <hi>du Croques</hi> voyage thitherward, and
the L. <hi>Flemings</hi> journey to come by the West Seas with aid out of <hi>Britain,</hi>
they in the Castle were become very obstinate, to hearken unto the reasonable
offers either for Peace or for abstinence of war. Whereupon we did cause
by consent of our Councel, to be imparted to the French Ambassador, and
to <hi>du Crocque</hi> the substance of the premisses which moved us to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the journey of <hi>du Crocque</hi> should be meet for us to assent unto, without we
should first impart our Conceptions to the French King, and so required them
to allow thereof, and that we would write to the King, and according as we
should receive answer from him, so they should understand our further pleasure.
At which time we understood that both the Ambassador and he took this stay
somewhat strangely, thinking that it might likewise seem strange to the King
their Mr. considering that the said <hi>du Crocque</hi> coming thither was by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of you our Ambassador, and the Kings Deputies. And though the same
was not denyed, yet in our part it was said, we doubted not but when the King
shall understand that new occasions with the matter discovered, tending in this
his matter of voyage rather to the increase of the troubles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then to
the pacifying thereof, and likewise rather to our manifest perils and troubles,
then to our comfort and surety, he would as our good brother and friend, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at this time, being entring into so straight a profession of friendship, as
he maketh shew of, would allow of our considerations of this stay, and by
some new order from him, and Commission to <hi>du Crocque,</hi> would provide for
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54478:101"/>
the remedies of the said inconvenience. Thus much being passed, the said <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
Croque</hi> within two days after desired to speak privately with one of our Counc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l
by name the L. of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> and for some considerations, it was thought good
that he should speak also with some others, and so did with the Earl of <hi>Suffex</hi>
L. Chamberlain, and the L. of <hi>Burleigh,</hi> with whom together he heard such
reasons alleadged for the stay of his journey until the King might be thereof
advertised, as in the end he did not shew any other misliking, but that he would
willingly tarry here and send to the King his Master, to understand his further
pleasure, and wished that we would likewise advertise the King by our Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
there. And thus you see how we have dealt with <hi>du Croque</hi> since his
coming, and what either the Ambassador or he shall advertise, we know not;
but besides this which we have written unto you, you shall understand by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
in writing, which you shall receive from the L. <hi>Burleigh,</hi> the further
circumstances of the Conferences had at two several times betwixt our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
and him, which when you have considered, with these the premises afore
written, we would have you to impart the same to the King in the best sort you
shall finde convenient to move him to interpret these our doings to the best
as reason ought to do. And in the end to procure that <hi>du Croque</hi> may have lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Commission to treat of the matters in <hi>Scotland</hi> in such sort, as we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
thereto with our surety: For otherwise you may well say that the labors
of us both shall be but lost. You shall further understand, that since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hither
of Mr. <hi>Beal</hi> with your last letters, and other writings of your negociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
about the new Treaty, we have considered thereof, and have forborn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
what our Answer shall be to the points by you suspended, until we may
have further conference with this Ambassador here, who hearing of the return
of our servants <hi>Hen. Killegrew</hi> and <hi>Beal,</hi> hath required that we would forbear
to resolve, and to return our answer unto you, until he might have commodity
to speak with us, which he looketh daily to have by the coming of a Currier
from thence, which he doth hourly look for, and this is the cause why at this
present we do stay the return of <hi>Beal</hi> unto you, wishing you in the mean time to
give them no occasion to doubt, but that our answers of the Treaty shall be
found reasonable.</p>

                  <p>SInce I wrote last to your Lp. there hath here fallen out nothing worthy the
Advertisement. The matter of marriage between the Prince of <hi>Navar</hi> and
the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> continueth doubtful, whereof Sir <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> and I have
more cause so to judge, for that the 4 of this month it pleased the Q. of <hi>Navar</hi> to
send for us to dinner. Immediately upon our coming she shewed unto us how
with the consent of the Q. mother, she had s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt for us (as the Ministers and
Ambassadors of a Christian Princess, whom she had sundry causes to honor)
to confer with us and certain others in whom she reposed great trust touching
certain difficulties that were impeachments to the marriage, which thing she
would communicate to us after dinner. She said to us that now she had the
Woolf by the ears, for that in concluding or not concluding the marriage, she
saw danger every way, and that no matter (though she had dealt in matters of
consequence) did so much trouble her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as this, for that she could not tell how to
resolve; amongst divers causes of fear, she shewed unto us that two chiefly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
her.</p>
                  <p>The first, that the K. would needs have her son and L. <hi>Margaret,</hi> the marriage
proceeding to be Courtiers, and yet would not yield to grant him any exercise
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54478:101"/>
of Religion, the next way to make him become an Atheist, as also thereby no
hope to grow of the Conversion of the L. <hi>Marg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ret,</hi> for that she would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
to any Sermon.</p>
                  <p>The second, that they would needs condition with the L. <hi>Margaret,</hi> remaining
constant in the <hi>Catholike Religion,</hi> should have whensoever she went into the
Country of <hi>Bern</hi> her Mass, a thing which in no wise she can consent unto, havin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
her Country cleansed from all Idolatry. Besides, saith she the L. <hi>Margaret</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
a Catholike whensoever she shal come to remain in the Country of <hi>Bern</hi>
the Papists there wil take her part, which will breed division in the Country, and
make her more unwilling to give ear to the Gospel, they having a staff to lean to.</p>
                  <p>After dinner ended, she sent for us into the Chamber, where we found a dozen
others of certain Gent. of the Religion and their Ministers. She declared unto us
briefly what had passed between the K. Q mother, and her, touching the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
as also what was the present cause of the stay of the same, wherein she desired
us severally to say our opinion, and that sincerely as we would answer unto God
The stay stood upon 3 points. First, whether she might with a good Conscience
substitute a Papist for her sons Proctor for the Fiansals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
she might. 2ly, whether the Proctor going to Mass incontinently after the
Fiansals, which was expresly forbidden by his letter procuratory, would n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t
breed an offence to the godly. It was agreed, that forasmuch as he vvas justly
forbidden the same by his letter procuratory, the same could justly minister no
offence, for that he vvas no longer a Proctor then he kept himself vvithin the
limits procuratory of the letter procuratory.</p>
                  <p>3ly, Whether she might consent that the vvord Fiansal might be pronounced
by a Priest in his priestly attire, vvith his Surplice and Stoal. This latter point
vvas long debated, and for the Ministers concluded, that the same, thought it
vvere a thing indifferent, could not but breed a general offence unto the godly:
she protested that she vvould never consent to do that thing vvhereof there
might grovv any publike scandal, for that she knevv, she said, she should soincur
Gods high displeasure: upon vvhich protestation it vvas generally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oncluded,
that in no case she might yield thereto, her ovvn Conscience gainsaying the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so that novv the marriage is held generally for broken. Notvvithstanding I am
of a contrary opinion, and do think assuredly, that hardly any cause vvill make
them break, so many necessary causes there are why the same should proceed. By
the next I shal be able to advertise your L. of the certainty of this mariage. What
hath been done upon the receipt of your Lps. dated th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 6 and 11 of this month,
you may perceive by Sir <hi>T. Smiths</hi> letters vvritten at large. Of late I learn by
one that lately is come out of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that there is a great league grovvn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt
the D. of <hi>Alva</hi> and the K. there, and that there should be some practise
in hand there, for some enterprise to be done, either in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>England.</hi> For
the accomplishment thereof the D. desireth of the K. certain ships. Touching the
said amity grown of late between the K. and D. this Ks. Ambassador there, doth
advertise thereof, and sheweth that the same cometh about by the corruption of
M. a Burgonian, who altogether ruleth the K. He therefore adviseth the K here
to enter into amity of <hi>Suevia,</hi> who shall always be abl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to bridle <hi>Denmark,</hi> and
that he findeth by advice had from <hi>Suevia,</hi> that the K. will most willingly enter
into league with him. <hi>Standen</hi> who lately came out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and arrived here se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
the 23 of this month, gave out some speech unto a Frenchman whom he
trusted, of some hope there would be in <hi>England</hi> of change or ever Summer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
He staid here only one night. I have written to <hi>Paris</hi> to have his doings ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
to which place he is repaired. At our access unto the Q. mother I shewed
her what I had heard out of <hi>Britain</hi> touching the L. <hi>Flemings</hi> doings. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desired her M. to move the K. to write to the Governor of <hi>Britain</hi> to have
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54478:102"/>
an eye unto him, and not to permit him to do any thing more then his pasport
beareth, lest otherwise it might breed some jealousie, which thing she promiseth
to do. I know the K. hath lately written to the Governor of <hi>Newhaven</hi> to suffer
none to imbarque for <hi>Scot.</hi> nor to do any thing that may any way offend her M.
I send your Lp. here inclosed, that lately I received from <hi>Paris</hi> from a Spaniard
of mine acquaintance, who is both wise and religious, honest and learned. The
only cause why I send it, is for that it toucheth an imprisonment. I refer it to
your Lp. to judge thereof as you shall think good. I used the less hast in adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
for that otherwise advice hath been given in that behalf. The <hi>Navar</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
is not yet concluded, notwithstanding there is great hope that the same wil
take place. I forbear to send with the Ks. pacquer, for that I attended the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
of Count <hi>Lodowicks</hi> man, thinking to have sent by him, but after that he
understood her M. had banished these leud sea-robers, it caused him to stay, and
yet he meaneth to send a gentleman to thank her M. for that undeserved favor
she had shewed to these lewd Ministers. He hath great conference with Q. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Monsr. daily, which maketh men to discourse diversly. As soon as he is
grown to some through conclusion he telleth me, that he will send a gentleman
over to her M. The Admiral is shortly to be looked for here, and great hopes
conceived of the compounding of the discord between him and the house of
<hi>Guise.</hi> For the conclusion of the <hi>Navar</hi> marriage, there is 8 chosen, to whom the
matter is committed, 4 for the K. and 4 for the Q. of <hi>Navar.</hi> For the K<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is chosen
<hi>Birage,</hi> Count <hi>de Rets, Biron, Malalieur.</hi> For the Q. Count <hi>Lodowick, Francourt</hi>
her Chancellor, <hi>De La Nove,</hi> and her Secretary. They are all as it is thought, so
well affected to the marriage, as there is no doubt made of some good conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so having nothing else to impart to your honor at present, I most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
take my leave,</p>

                  <p>TRusty and right well-beloved, We greet you well. Since the receit of
your Letters to us from you, both joyntly dated the first of March, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your later Letters of the 8 directed to the Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> in which your
later Letters you did at length expresse your Negotiation in this matter of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the points not resolved; we have had some cause to prolong our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
otherwise then we thought at the first, partly at the request of the French
Ambassador here, who motioned unto us not to proceed to a final resolution of
the matters in doubt, untill he might receive some direction from the King his
Master; which when he had, then were we also impeached from consideration
of the same, by reason of sudden sharp accident of sickness, which as it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
with us some time; so nevertheless in 7 or 8 daies, by Gods goodness,
we were eased, and do now take our selves to be very well recovered, both of the
danger and trouble thereof, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> lacking nothing but some small time to recover
the strength which we lost with the sharpness of the sickness. And so now we
have after some conference had with the Kings Ambassador, resolved upon the
matters in doubt, and all the rest of the Articles of the Treaty, which you
shall understand to be in this manner following; Where you did move to have
inserted into the said Article, the Clause of the mutual defence, to be by special
name for Invasion upon colour of Religion; considering upon debate thereof,
the King hath offered to expound the same Clause, to be meant by a special Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
according to a Coppy sent to us by you, dated the 8 of March, and on the
backside marked with us. We do not mislike the Contents of the Letter, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
we would wish the effect thereof to be written in Latine, as the Treaty is
with the Kings stile, so as it may also have the great Seal annexed thereunto.
The like thereof we will for our part accomplish and deliver to this Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.
And so have we caused our resolution to be declared to their Ambassador;
and in some part of the Letter we have added some words to make the same both
plainer and fuller, whereof we send you a Coppy in English. And yet if you
cannot obtain it to be put in Latine and under the great Seal, we find no cause
to stay the Treaty for that, but to accept it as a Letter missive under the Kings
hand and signet, as it hath been already offered.</p>
                  <p>The second matter concerning the aid which now is by the Kings Deputies
reduced to a specialty, although we could have been content to have had it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in generality, yet the same being no greater then it is, and the charge to
be borne by the requirant, we are contented therewith; and think it neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
meet that the causes appointing the wages and stipends by either of us, might
be more particularly and certainly expressed for avoiding of ambiguity, that is,
that the Prince requiring the aid, and to pay the wages, shall pay to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
both Captains, Soldiers, and Officers, according to their several qualities,
both by Land and Sea, wages certainly expressed how the numbers shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted,
whether fully, or with allowance of dead paies or lacks; wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there may be diversities betwixt the usage of the two Countreys, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
would be set down according to our manner. As for example, in the
computation of the Band of 100. the manner here is to allow 8 dead paies to the
hundred, and no more; which if they like they shall be so accorded; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
as they shal think it meetest, so as the Article may be reciproque for us both,
as well in charge as in number.</p>
                  <p>The third matter in question is for Scotland, wherein we have found great
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54478:103"/>
difficulty, finding the Ambassador here more precise then we looked for, or was
reasonable, considering the foundation and scope of this Treaty is to make a
streight friendship betwixt the King and us; and directly now to the contrary,
we see the pressing of the matter for the Queen of Scots, as it is urged by the
Article offered unto you, which may seem to be of a strong Condition to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
into a Treaty containing a Form Historical, or Narrative (as they call it)
and not conventional. The like also we find by the manner of <hi>du Crocques</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
here for the said Queen of Scots, neither of both being agreeable with
the scope of the amity pretended. And therefore we have caused the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to understand how much we mislike this manner of proceeding, shewing
him reasons for the same, which we need not report unto you, for that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therefore is at hand to every indifferent person. And we have moved
him, that either the matter of Scotland might pass now in silence, or rather the
King would be contented that it may be Covenanted that we both shall defend
the Kingdom of Scotland as it is possessed by the King, as in all like cases in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the King and Prince being in possession, that hath been used by other
Princes neighbours and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>onfederates: But hereunto the Ambassador would in
no wise agree, using no other reasons of value, but that his Master shall thereby
be taken as one that hath deprived the Queen of Scots his good Sister of her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
which indeed cannot justly be gathered, for that our meaning is not to
have it otherwise ordered, but to have the state of the Realm to be preserved as
we both find it, which we take to be in the possession of the King, being already
Crowned and acknowledged by the 3 Estates of the Realm in full Parlament,
and acceptance of the Realm shall alter, we must and ought to accept it as we
should find it. But this not satisfying the Ambassador, we caused the writing
which he required to be further considered; and hereupon have caused another
form to be drawn, agreeable to such part of theirs as we may like; and leaving
the other part not by us allowable, which hath been shewed unto him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much argument, not utterly misliked, so as he might have some words of
his own inserted into the same, altogether prejudicial to our meaning, which was
declared unto him to be: and so we would have you to do the like, that con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the King is possessed of the Crown for the present, and come to the same
by order of the Laws of the Crown, with the consent of the 3 estates, and in
Parlament; our meaning is, that he should be also defended by the form of the
Article by us devised. And so we send you the same Article in Latine, although
it was to him shewed in French, which we would have to be inserted, except o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they will be contented that the whole matter of Scotland be put in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
and yet if they shall content themselves with the Article in form by us
conceived; then you shall move them to assent, that in some one Article there
may be a reservation made for the King of Spain and his Countries by name;
or if that cannot be contained, then we would have you to procure that in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Article, being the 23 in number, which Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> hath noted <hi>(De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendum)</hi>
may be restored into the Treaty. Of which Article mention being
made to this Ambassador, he seemeth to allow thereof. The Article devi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed
for the suspencion of the Law of—<hi>Aubani</hi> for Goods of strangers dying in
France, we like very well according to the Coppy brought to you the ninth of
March by <hi>Florence;</hi> which we return to you by these our Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ters, so that you
make the word <hi>Francia, Gallica,</hi> or else add to the words, <hi>in Francia, sive alibi

                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, We think it good that some special Article be conceived to bind the
King that all these things concerning the matter of Merchants within the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
should be inrolled and emologed in their Parlaments within some conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54478:103"/>
time, and the like to be done as the case shall require within our ordinary
Court of Records at Westminster.</p>
                  <p>As for Commission to be sent to you <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi> our Ambassador
Resident concerning some Treaty with the Merchants of that Country, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
We will understand the manner of the Commission sent to this Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador,
and so give order for the like. This Ambassador hath been very earnest
with us that <hi>Du Croque</hi> might repair into Scotland, and until we may hear what
the French King answereth to you in that matter, upon the reasons as we did
lately impart unto you, whereupon we did stay him; we have no meaning to
let him depart: For certainly we perceive that if the L. <hi>Seton</hi> had not come out
of Flanders, nor his coming expected from hence, the matters of Scotland had
been at an end before this time, and now we go forwards. Since we had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
upon the Articles of the Treaty, the Ambassador hath dealt with him
very earnestly to have some change of words, which we newly sent to you to be
placed instead of the Article that <hi>du Foix</hi> would needs have had for the matter
of Scotland, first in the second Article and fifth, he would have <hi>praesentis status
commutandi conditio.</hi> And in the beginning of the eight he would have these
words added, <hi>Aut unus illorum seperatim, de consensu tamen alterius;</hi> but we
did not accord thereunto; whereof he seemed very doubtfull how the King
would assent to the rest; and although it may be that he shall be also earnestly
pressed therewith, yet except you should see it stay the Treaty, we would not
have you yield. But otherwise we do not mean you should stay the Treaty for
these few words. And where in the former part of our Letter we have willed
you that there may be a special Article of reservation of Treaties with the King
of Spain; if you find that offensive to the expedition of the Treaty, then we
can be content only with the general Article of the 34. We require you to use
all speed that you can herein, for it may be we shall send the person that shall

                  <p>SIr, I heartily thank you for your sundry Letters, all which with one Letter
and many thanks must be answered. I have imparted unto Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> such
things of publique as I know he will impart unto you and the rest, as common to
you both by the Q. Majesties Letters. I am very sorry to see you so decayed by
service, and of so good cause, I mean good sound service, so evil effect: but so
blind is Fortune, as sometimes she dealeth blanks instead of good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>I have not omitted to express your charge, your expence, your decay, and yet
your request to return without her Majesties burthen; but as the first have been
and are hurtfull unto you, so the last, which is your return, shall be most hurtfull
to her Majestie, and so she well considereth. And so I trust she will presently
refresh you, though not restore you as I have desired; and so I think you shall
understand from Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay,</hi> your very friend, and mine also in very
deed most assured, who was present when her Majestie yielded to some part of
my request for you. You did very well to press the King as you did in the case
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54478:104"/>
of <hi>la Roches</hi> practising in Ireland, which is very true, howsoever he denieth it, and
you may avow that he hath the Rebels son, I mean <hi>Iames Fitzmorris,</hi> son in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage
at Britain, he would be hearkened for, and demanded to be delivered. We
hear daily of great preparations in Britain, upon pretence of a Voyage into the
Indies, or into Flanders, I wis they seek no Indians in Ireland or in Scotland. As
soon as it shall be determined who shall come from thence, I will send thither,
or deliver to this Ambassador a safe conduct, for so the Ambassador requireth.
By my next you shall receive a Commission for your self to Treat for the matter
of the Merchants. And so now wearied, I end.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honourable, and my very good Lord, the Lord of Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>BY your Lordships of the second of April, I perceive that through your
Lordships most carefull and friendly declaration made unto her Majestie of
my decayed estate, she doth graciously consider thereof, and meaneth to doe
somewhat for my relief, that I may with the better courage imploy my self in
her service: I hope her Majestie shall find my care and diligence in this service
such, as she shall have no cause to think any consideration had of me evil bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
I crave no recompence, I only desire to return home in no worse state then
I went forth.</p>
                  <p>Touching the chief stay here made in the conclusion of the League, I refer
your Lordship to Sir <hi>Tho. Smith.</hi> Such as here do not affect the same, did
what they might to procure a new sending about the Scottish Earl, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that time by delay, might have brought forth somewhat to have overthrown
the whole. Both <hi>Monsieur Montmorency</hi> and <hi>Monsieur de Foix,</hi> did deal ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
effectually and earnestly to bring the matter to that good conclusion that it
is come to. And the King in the end shewed himself very resolute in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as he doth in all those things that concern his honour and benefit, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked
the doubt propounded by those that went about to perswade him to think
otherwise then honourably touching her Majesties intention concerning the
Scotch Affairs: That <hi>Strozzas</hi> preparation should tend either for Scotland or
Ireland, your Lordship need not to fear; such as he is chiefly guided by in that
matter, are very well affected towards her Majestie. Of late there hath been
hard hold for the overthrow of this enterprise; the King is resolute in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
otherwise it had been quite broken. They of the <hi>Robe Longue</hi> do fear that
it will breed a pile betwixt this Crown and Spain; and they would be loath the
King should now enter into Wars, for that they doubt that the managing of the
Affairs should come then to the hands of others. They perswade —2—i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
diminish. They perswade 4 that if 3 have good success therein, it will dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
his reputation. These respects do make the said parties to become enemies
to the Wars, because lack of money is the only let that is alleadged; they do
all that they may to hinder all such devices from taking place as lately have been
offered to supply that want. Amongst these difficulties it will be hard to judge
what will be the issue of this matter.</p>

                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:54478:104"/>
By the last advertisement out of Spain, they write that D. <hi>Medina Celi</hi> stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Voyage into Franders, only in doubt that <hi>Strozza</hi> should doe some
enterprise in those parts; I am assured that they have seen A z. with 1 <hi>T t)</hi> 6 a.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Egremont, Ratcliff</hi> and <hi>Genney</hi> are departed from Spain, they giving out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their departure, that they went to return into Flanders. This day there is
a Gentleman arrived sent hither from the Kings Agent in Flanders, who bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
word of some alteration there, the particularities I cannot yet learn.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>T.</hi> sent me word that he was glad that the League was concluded, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he willed the messenger to tell me, that unless the Queen my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
did proceed roundly in cutting off the inward diseases at home, this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
medicine would stand her in no stead; and hereof (said he) you shall see
by dangerous experience, unless the remedy be applyed in time. The same
party (if your Lordship remember it) gave me warning of a practice for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of the Queen of Scots; and therefore it is the rather to be weighed; and
I judge it cometh from the L. who hath it from <hi>A.</hi> he will by no means make
me to understand any particularities: for fear of <hi>w.</hi> he dares not repair to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of the Communication which you had with the Count. Here is all covert
means to let them of the Low-Countries pass home, to the help of the liberty
of the Countrie; and I wish it were done rather by themselves then by others,
that percase would not suffer them long to enjoy their liberty when it should
be recovered, percase it will not be liked here. I cannot write more presently;
for I do this in haste, being absent from the Court, and have not your Cypher
about me. I have written of more matters to Sir <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> who will make
you thereof partaker.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> Like as I am to yield you my hearty thanks for your pains
and travel bestowed about the recovery of <hi>Clerk</hi> my boy; so do I most
earnestly pray you to present my humble thanks unto the Kings Majestie there,
for the honour and favour it hath pleased him to do me in that behalf. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by the Post of Roan, he is retained with the Cardinal of Burbon, in which
respect, because I have not my self any acquaintance with the said Cardinal. I
have written my earnest Letter to Monsieur <hi>D' Anville,</hi> requesting him to deal
earnestly with the said Cardinal for restitution of the boy, which I do not desire
so much for any account I make of him, as to make him an Example unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our servants, not to persume hereafter so to abuse their Masters. The truth
is, he was a poor mans son, being left unto me, I had some care to see him well
brought up in vertue and good qualities, especially in Musick, wherein finding
himself to have a little cunning, away he is thus run from me (desirous belike
of more liberty) without having been any waies evil intreated, or for any other
cause in the world; the which if I should over-slightly let slip, it would no doubt
give too much encouragement to others his like after, to play the like lewd part.
Therefore as you began, so I pray you continue your friendly travel therein,
that I may have him sent over unto me again; which I only desire (as I said) for
example sake: For if I wisht that the said Cardinal or any other Noble man in
those parts had any liking to him, I would most willingly either send him again,
or some other of that profession, perhaps better quallified then he, and so I pray
it may be signified unto them from me. Thus with my hearty commendations
I bid you farewell.</p>

                  <head>Letters to my Lord of Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>MY very good Lord, what hath passed between the King here and Q. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and us, we have at large written to the Q. Maj. what hath past between
the Deputies and us, You shal perceive by the whole draught of the League now
ready to be signed unto us: But because in the instructions we were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to signe it before it were sent thither into England to be better considered,
we thought best to make the stay thereupon, that except the express words for
Religion were in it, we durst not signe it, and unless we did first understand her
Majesties pleasure, whether so she would be content, there is no alteration from
the Article of 1546. in the <hi>Esclaircissement,</hi> which Article is also in three
Treaties with France, 1515. and 1546. saving they have specified the number
of Souldiers both by Sea and Land. The which we could by no means obtain
of them to leave it in generality. After that we had gotten of them that it
should not be <hi>sumptibus requisitis,</hi> which to bring to pas we had very much to do.
And seeing it is reciproque and no great number, we thought it not much amiss:
All the rest went easie enough, even that of the Merchants, and they confessed
that in these general words the matter of Religion is also contained: So that if
for the inquisition our matters be staied, if the Queens Majestie do require that
aid for their deliverance, as is there expressed, the King is bound to do it because
there is—<hi>Iusserit aut permiserit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The greatest debating was for two things, The one to have Religion expresly
mentioned in the Treatie, the which I perceive some of the Deputies, partly
having benefices, and looking for more Buls from Rome, and partly fearing that
some change may come, and then it may be laid to their charge, would needs
shift it from them, and let the King do it alone. And when once they had hope
given them by their Ambassador in England, that the Queens Majestie would
so be content to have it in general words, you might be sure we should never get
them further, but to be delivered as slightly as they could of that matter; ye
shall receive that fashion that we required in the figure <hi>O.</hi> delivered to Monsieur
<hi>de Foix,</hi> Feb. 28. ye shall receive also that which Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> delivered to
us, as a copie of a Letter whereby the King doth think w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> should be satisfied,
noted and delivered to us the 29 of February; and to it we have put what fault
we do find with that Letter, although the Queens Majestie should be content
with that form. This is the issue whereupon we do now stand.</p>
                  <p>The other great debatement was for the Queen of Scots, which held us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
at every meeting to have her mentioned in the Treatie, and that earnestly
handled of them the 23 and 26 of February, that I was fain once again to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the evil deserts of the late Queen of Scots towards the Queens Majestie,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54478:106"/>
with her other behaviour at the whole length, because Marshal <hi>Montmorency</hi> was
not at the first Declaration; and there Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> and Mr. <hi>Killigrew</hi>
helped me with supply so far, that at that present they seemed to give over, and
we in no wise would have her mentioned in this Treaty; yet the 28 of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Mr. <hi>de Foix</hi> brought to us a writing for her, which we send you noted M. to
which you sent him the next day a Coppie of the same noted with our answer
N. The same day at the afternoon we had audience of the King, where he was
also earnest with us, as you may perceive by our Letters to the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
B. the Queen Mother that day, as good chance was, had forgotten her self;
but the next day, the first of March, Mr. <hi>de Foix</hi> came to us and brought us a
draught of the whole League in French, because he said he was commanded to
translate it into French, that the King might understand it; and so he gathered
it as he thought of that which we were accorded, we perused it with our Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phils,
as Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> termeth them, <hi>schediae</hi> or <hi>adversaria,</hi> I mean those which one
way or other by yea and nay had gone betwixt us (some other tho will have
them called pieces, as some Frenchmen do name them) and we did not much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree;
and although he had made a new Preface in such matters, we do not stick.
I am old, I love not much talk, and I would fain be dispatched honestly home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
so the effect be there indeed, and our Queen not deceived, I care for no
more, that done, and referred again for again, seeing they were offered unto us
in Latine, he came to us with a new Charge of the late Queen of Scots, in the
Queen Mothers name, saying, that by our other talk she had clean forgotten her;
but to do that thing which should do our friend (he meant the King his Master)
good, and us no hurt, vve could not say nay; he for affinity and consanguinity,
and that she vvas once his Soveraigne, vvas bound in conscience and respect of
the vvorld to require so much, and to have it testified to the vvorld that he had
done those good offices; vve may ansvver as vve vvould it should not touch us,
they vvould take our ansvver, vvhatsoever it vvas. I told him vve had ansvvered
first to the Deputies in vvords, and had good causes vvhy vve could not do it, of
which she was one, after that we had given our answer to him in writing. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we had also spoken with the King, and made him a direct answer, that we
could not meddle in any wise with that matter in the League, we had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
we were precisely forbidden to meddle in that matter: And therefore
I never spake more of that matter to have that put in the Treaty, for that will
not be.</p>
                  <p>Upon that he began to amplifie in another long Oration; for all his Reasons,
I was fain to say, he must pardon me, I know he is a good Rhetorician, and he
had Rhetorical ornaments at will to make; and so had I on the contrary side,
if I would bestow my time on that sort: We were the Queens Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
we have shewed our Reasons so good that no man could deny that we
should not agree upto it: We have written the sum of our answer also, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they ought to be content.</p>
                  <p>Oh (saith he) she hath great kindred and alliance here in the Court, and they
will say that the King nor we have done our duties. Will ye see the ansvver
(quoth I) I thought once to send, mary I vvould not have it sent. This I send
your Lordship to see it N. noted, not to be declared (quoth I) because
we would be dispatched of such matters, yet as gently as we could,
and with as little evil speeches, especially of such persons. This I like
well (saith he) let me have it I pray you; belike (quoth I) you vvould please
Mr. <hi>d' Aumale</hi> and the Cardinal of Lorrain vvith it. It is even for that (saith
he) they shall see that the King hath done so much as he can. No (quoth I) it

It is no marvel though other would <hi>Inire gratiam cum anula &amp; hoste ejus
quam aliquando regnaturam putant culpa sua,</hi> and we thought not good to leave
in their hands in writing, <hi>tam acerbum, de illa testimonium.</hi> But surely if her
Majestie go no better about to establish her Crown and surety, she doth not
then follow <hi>Solomon,</hi> in making away <hi>Adonias</hi> and <hi>Ioab</hi> for the same purpose:
And I am afraid, <hi>quod erit novissimus error pejor priori.</hi> I thank your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
for your Letters of the 16 of February by <hi>Edwards,</hi> and also of the 22 of
the same by the Post. Although you write not so many Letters as I, yet if you
write so much stuff, and answer all, it is all one to me; but in two things I yet
find fault; the one, that in the Letter of the 22. you wrote nothing of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and that you make no mention at all of the Duke of Alanson. They
here look very undoubtedly for some hope</p>
                  <p>The other grieveth me most of all, that now the League is full done (as I take
it) and almost as well as we can with, yet I must not come home, but tarry
here still in this Countrie, where I have felt since Candlemas, the greatest cold
that ever I felt, and most continual, except it were at Tholous, where it did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
cost me my life, and there had made an end of it, if it had not been for the
strong matters which I do use for my stomack morning and evening, and yet it
is scarce able to resist the extream cold of the weather, and now about 30 daies
continual frost and snow, and here is neither wood plenty, nor good chimneys
for fire, and in my bed-chamber I can make no fire: Good my Lord dispatch
this Bearer with as much speed again as may be, as it is promised in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</p>
                  <p>This day the Queen of Navarr is looked for in the Court, and hoped that the
marriage shall go forward. The foolish Cardinal went away as wise as he came,
he neither brake the marriage with Navarr, nor got no Dismes of the Church of
France, nor perswaded the King to enter into the League with the Turk, nor
to accept the Tridentine, or to break off Treaty with us; and the foolishest
part of all at his going away, he refused a Diamond which the King offered him
of 600 Crowns, yet he was here highly feasted; he and his Train cost the King
above 300 Crowns a day, as they said. Thus I bid your Lordship heartily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>

                  <p>MY very good Lord, I received your Letters by Monsieur <hi>de Crocques</hi>
Kinsman, after Mid-Lent-Sunday, which was dated the sixth of March:
the King had then entred into a Diet, which he keepeth still in his C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Some said it is because he had some hurt in one of his leggs, which I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perceive but he was one of the activest in all his actions as the Barriers,
Justs, and other such Martial feats, which were <hi>simulachra belli</hi> of all the rest in
the Company. Other (of whose opinion I am) think it is the Mothers drift to
make him take (under pretence of Phisick) some rest from his inordinate hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
so early in the morning, and so late at night, without sparing frost, snow, or
rain, and in so desperate doings as makes her and them that love him, to be
often in great fear. And the Queen possibly being now undoubtedly with
child, to cause her also to rest from that travel, that both he may get somewhat
more flesh, and the Queen to retain more surety of that which is conceived.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54478:107"/>
Because of that Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> and I wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t not what to do; but Monsieur <hi>de
Malvosire</hi> coming to us as he is appointed, to see that we lack nothing, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
and dineth commonly with us, we told him merrily, that his Mistress (for
so we call the Scotch Queen) had played now a wise part, for she hath opened
her self again, and the good favour she beareth to Spain, to make a perpet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>al
broil if she could betwixt England, Scotland and France, for she hath practised
by Letters of late, and sith the Dukes trouble, which Letters are now come
to light, and known to have practised with the Duke of Alva, to convey the
young King out of Scotland into Spain; the which thing I am sure you would
like as ill as wee. Yea (saith he) they may be counterfeit and made to hurt the
poor Queen. No (quoth I) the original Letters were shewed to Monsieur <hi>de
Crocque</hi> and <hi>de la Mott,</hi> and yet by the same <hi>de Crocque,</hi> the King wrote to the
Queens Majestie for her deliverance and sending of her into France: What
would she do here at liberty, if being streightly kept, and the matter so plainly
known, for the Bishop of Ross wrote sith he was in the Tower to her, that all
was discovered, which he could not denie: Well (saith he) indeed I have heard
of such a thing; but will you tell the King (quoth I) that so much I have told you,
and that the Queens Majestie is not very well pleased, that she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hould write so
earnestly for her who will never cease to seek mischief and trouble to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
and her Realm, yea and set all the Princes together by the ears if she could;
he said he would: and when we would come home to walk in the Garden, at
such time as the Queen Mother doth customarily walk there, he would find the
means we should speak with her; when he came again he brought us word that
it was true that he said, for <hi>de la Mott</hi> had written the same to the King, and
the King so told him that it was true, and said, Ah! the poor fool will never
cease while she lose her head; In faith they will put her to death, I see it is her
own fault and follie, I see no remedie for it; I meant to help, but if she will not
be helped, <hi>Ie ne puis mais,</hi> that is, I cannot do withall.</p>
                  <p>The 17 of this Month at afternoon, Mr. <hi>Walsingham</hi> and I went with Mr.
<hi>Malvosire</hi> into the Kings Garden at Blois, and after a while walking, the Queen
Mother came to us; to whom we declared, That of late there was Letters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
of the Queen of Scots to the Duke of Alva, the effect whereof we
were willing to declare to the Kings Majestie or to her, which was indeed to
make a perpetual pique betwixt England, Scotland, France and Spain, for that
it was, that he should take and convey away by his practise, the young King,
and convey him into Spain. And so (quoth I) where now by Gods grace we go
about to make a perpetual amity betwixt England and France, and by that joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make a good union and peace in Scotland, that the civil Wars might be
compounded and cease, and so these 3 Realms to be as it were all one for mutual
defence; this is a devise to make a perpetual pique, broil and jealousie amongst
us all and Spain.</p>
                  <p>Sait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Mr. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> betwixt England and France, thanks be to God, no
quarrels be pretended: We demand nothing of you at this time, nor you of
us. The occasion vvhy your League vvas so sure vvith Scotland to annoy us,
novv there is no such cause standing so sure on amity, and therefore belike
Spain vvould make that a pique to trouble us vvithall both, and make us Warr
and trouble that vvaies.</p>
                  <p>Saith the Queen, There is no doubt but they vvill do vvhat they can, for
the King my Son is advertised that there is nothing that grieveth him more then
to understand of this good League and perfect Amity vvhich is begun, and I
trust, novv at an end betvvixt us; they vvote not vvhich vvaies to turn them
to break it. But Madam, (quoth I) these tvvo things coming together, she to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54478:107"/>
go about that disturbing of Scotland and England, and that thing which should
be as much displeasant to you as to us, if your Majestie do well mark it, and at
the same time the King here to write for her delivery, and to come into France,
and that when the chief treating of amity is in hand, you shall not marvel
though her Majestie do take it ill, and I assure you that it is written to us, that
but that her Majestie hath known of long time the good affection that you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
and the King your Son did bear to her, and that we that are here now Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
and Mr. <hi>Killegrew,</hi> all with one tenor have written so much of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
and sound dealing of the King and you, and bound our credit therein,
that good faith was meant in all points, her Majestie would have doubted; and
so we are willed to tell you.</p>
                  <p>The King my Son (saith she) meant no evil in it, she is allied to him, she hath
many friends here; and I tell you she hath one of the fairest Roses or Diamonds
in France; she meant her Dowry, which is, as is reported, 120000 Franks by
the year, and therefore my son could no less doe then write earnestly for her;
mary not to offend my good sister the Queen. We think surely that the Queen
your Mistress will shew mercy unto her, she is of so good nature; and then if she
were here, she should be the less able to trouble you. Yes Madam (quoth I)
and you to, she is now kept streighter then ever she was, and hath not past ten,
as I hear say, allowed about her of her own, and yet she can do this, and still
practice the disturbing of the Queens Majestie and her Realm; what would
she doe being here at libertie, it would not be long before she convey her self
into Spain, and then I doubt whether you or we should be long without Warr.
Because you say so (saith she) he that is the King my sons Ambassador in Spain,
now wrote of late that the Duke <hi>de Medina Celi</hi> is yet in coming, and taketh
in men daily; but he doth it with more leasure, because he doth attend to hear
word of some attempt to be done in England, and then he cometh away strait.
This they look for still there, whatsoever it be, and so you may write to the Q.
your Mistress.</p>
                  <p>Then she asked whether the Duke were executed; we said no, that we could
learn. No (saith she) belike the Queen will pardon him. We answered, we
could not tell; I would (saith she) she were in quiet from all these broils: doe
you know nothing how she can fancie the marriage with my Son the Duke of
Alanson? Madam, you know me of old, except I have a sure ground, I dare
affirm nothing to your Majestie. Why (saith she) if she be disposed to marrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I do not see where she shall marrie so well; and yet (saith she) I may as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
justly be accounted partial; but as for those which I have heard named, as
the Emperors Son, or <hi>Don Iohn d' Austria,</hi> they be both lesser then my Son
is, and of less stature by a good deal; and if she should marrie, it were pitty
any more time were lost.</p>
                  <p>Madam (quoth I) If it pleased God that she were married, and had a child,
all these braggs, and all these Treasons would soon be appaled; and on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
she had a child by Mr. d' <hi>Alanson,</hi> for my part I cared not if ye had the Q.
of Scots here; for ye then would be as carefull and jealous over her for the Q.
my Mistresses suretie as we, or as her self is. That is true (saith she) and without
this marriage (saith she) if she should marrie in another place, I cannot see how
this League and Amity would be so strong as it is. True Madam (quoth I) the
knot of bloud and marriage is a stronger Seal then that which is printed in wax,
and lasteth longer if God give good successe; but yet all Leagues have not
Marriage joyned with them, as this may, if it please God. I would it had (saith
she) then surely would I make a start over and see her my self, the which I do
most desire of all things. Madam (quoth I) if I had now as ample a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54478:108"/>
for Mr. <hi>de Alanson,</hi> as I had at the first for Monsieur, the matter should
soon by Gods grace, be at an end: Would you had (saith she) and if you had
such a one when you are in England, would you not come over again to execute
it? Yes Madam (quoth I) most gladly to so good an intent I would pass again
the Sea if I were never so sick for it. Then saith Mr. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> And surely
it was no Religion that made that stop in the marriage of Monsieur, but some
other thing: No surely (saith she) he never shewed to me any other cause. I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
you Madam (saith Mr. <hi>Walsingham)</hi> I can marvelous hardly believe it, for
at Gallion he was so willing and so well affected, that me thought it did me much
good when he spake of the Queen my Mistress, or with any of her Ministers, I
perceived it in his words, in his countenance, in his gesture and all things; but
again, when he came to Paris, all was clean changed. It is true <hi>Monsieur L.
Ambassadeur</hi> (saith she) and it made me much to marvel at it; but even at Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
all other things liked him well; but at the Religion he made a little stop,
but nothing so as he did after. Upon this I bare him in hand (for it grieved
me not a little, and the King my Son, also as you know) that of all evil rumors
and tales of naughty persons, such as would break the matter, and were spread
abroad of the Queen, that those he did believe, and that made him so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
And I told him it is all the hurt that evil men can do to Noble women
and Princes, to spread abroad lies and dishonourable tales of them, and that
we of all Princes that be women, are subject to be slandered wrongfully of them
that be our adversaries, other hurt they cannot do us; he said and swore to me,
he gave no credit to them; he knew she had so vertuously Governed her Realm
this long time, that she must needs be a good and vertuous Princesse, and full
of honour, and other opinion of her he could not have; but that his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and his Religion did trouble him that he could not be in quiet, and nothing
else.</p>
                  <p>Other communication there was, as is commonly wont to be in such meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
but this is the sum of that which is worth the writing, that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt
us.</p>
                  <p>The 21 of this Month I received your Lordships Letters dated the 10. of
the same. The next day I spake again with the Queen Mother in the Garden,
and shewed her that the Queens Majestie did perceive that the King and she were
carefull to advertise any such occurrents as might trouble her Highness and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
the which as she must needs take in most thankfull part, so she had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to acquite the same with as much carefulness as may be, and therefore willed
me to signifie unto their Maj. such things as now of late be come to her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
And say that at Harvvich, vvhich vvas the Port that <hi>Rodolph,</hi> and other
of that conspiracy, appointed that the Spaniards and Flemings should arrive at
from the Duke of Alva, if the Treason had gon forvvard. At that Port arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Lord <hi>Seaton,</hi> whom she knevv vvell enough, and from thence vvith
tvvo other of the Earl of Northumberlands men disguised, vvent into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and novv be in the Castle of Edenburgh; and this being understood, the
Ship vvas stayed and searched; and amongst other, the confirmation of that
vvhich I told you before, vvas in the Scotch Queens Letters, that she gave her
self and her son, novv the young King of Scotland vvholly into the hands of
the King of Spain, to be governed and ruled only by him, and assure him
that if he vvould send any povver, the young King should be delivered into his
hands. For in the Ship it doth appear that the Lord <hi>Seton</hi> by his instructions is
named the Scotch Queens Ambassador tovvards the Duke of Alva. A good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ambassador (saith the Queen.) And there in his Ambass. he offereth
the young King to be delivered into his hands, to be conveyed into Spain. And
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54478:108"/>
to animate him more to set up again the Scotch Queen, and take the protection
of her, that she hath right both by Gods Law and mans Law to be Queen of
England and also of Scotland, and that she hath not only all those that be in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
now, but a great sort more in England on her part, so that the King by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her up, should not only govern both these Realms, but shall also set up in
both again the Catholique Religion.</p>
                  <p>Alas (saith the Queen) that head of hers shall be never in quiet. This (quoth
I) toucheth us most, the next toucheth the King your son. I will shew unto
you as I have it, my Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> writeth it unto me. In the same ship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other was found a Letter of the Countess of Northumberland, who
was one of the chief stirrers in the last Rebellion. Her husband the Earl is
now prisoner in Scotland for the same purpose. The Countess in her Letter
writeth to her husband, that the Duke of Guise hath of late been with the D.
of Alva disguised, and she affirmeth to her husband for certainty, all the house
of Guise and that faction will follow in all points the direction of the King of
Spain. Saith the Queen, he was not, for by reason of his Treaty of accord,
(she meant between the Admiral and him) which hath been long time in doing,
and yet taketh that small success; every four daies we either hear from him, or
send to him, so that we know certainly where he is, and that he hath not been
there; he might well enough send some other person; but somewhat there is
we know well enough (saith she) that they incline somewhat that way of Spain,
and it may be nothing, for it is the Spanish practice to aid themselves with lies,
and spread abroad, that those and those be of the Faction, to bring other in,
when indeed it is nothing so; that used the Emperor <hi>Charls,</hi> and so brought
some by this means unto his lure before they were aware: and that is a shrewd
art (quoth I) to abuse rash fools. Yes (saith she) but when at the last it is espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it makes them the more to be hated, and other the harder to be abused by
them. Then she left that matter.</p>
                  <p>Jesu! saith she, and doth not your Mistress see that she shall be alwaies in
danger untill she marry? That once done, and in some good House, who dare
attempt any thing against her? Madam (quoth I) I think if she were once mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
all in England that had any traiterous hearts, would be discouraged: for
one Tree alone may soon be cut down, but when there be two or three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is longer a doing, and one shall watch for the other; but if she had a
child, then all these bold and troublesome Titles of the Scotch Queen, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that make such gapings for her death, will be clean choaked up. I see she
may have five or six, saith she, very well; I would to God we had one. No, saith
she, two boys, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t the one should die, and three or four daughters to make
alliance with us again, and other Princes, to strengthen the Realm. Why
then (quoth I) you think that <hi>Monsieur le Duc</hi> shall speed. With that she
laughed, and said, <hi>Ie le desire infinitement;</hi> and I would trust then to see three
or four my self at the least, of her race, which would make me indeed not to
spare Sea nor Land to see her and them. And if she could have fancied my son
<hi>d'Anjou,</hi> saith she, as you told me, why not this of the same house, Father and
Mother, and as vigorous and lusty as he, and rather more, and now he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to have a beard come forth, so that I told him the last day that I was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with it, for now I was afraid he would not be so high as his brethren. Yea
Madam (quoth I) a man doth commonly grow in height to his years, the beard
maketh nothing: Nay, saith she, he is not so little, he is so high as you, or very
near: For that matter, Madam (quoth I) I for my part make small account, if
the Queens Majestie can fancie him. For <hi>Pipinus Brevis,</hi> who married <hi>Bertha</hi>
the King of Almains Daughter, was so little to her, that he is standing in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisgrave,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54478:109"/>
or Moguerre, a Church in Almani, she taking him by the hand, and
his head not reaching to her girdle, and yet he had by her <hi>Charlemain</hi> the great
Emperor and King of France, which is reported to be almost a Giants stature.
And your <hi>Oliver Glesquim,</hi> the <hi>Briton Constable</hi> that you make so much of,
and lieth buried amongst the Kings at St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> if he were no bigger then is
there pourtrayed upon his Tomb, was very short, scarcely, four foot long; but
yet he was valiant, hardly, and couragious, above all in his time, and did us Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
men most hurt.</p>
                  <p>It is true, saith she, it is the heart, courage, and activity that is to be looked
for in a man; but hear you word of the Queens affection that way? can you
give me no comfort? No I assure your Majestie (quoth I) for the Letters
were written the 11 of this Month, the same day or the next that our Currier
went with the dispatch from hence.</p>
                  <p>Thus, with much other talk in such sort, the time was passed that day betwixt
her Majestie and me. All the world doth see that we doe wish her Majestie
surety and long continuance, that her marriage and issue of her Highness body
should be the most assurance of her Highness, and of the Wealth of the Realm.
The place where, and the person whom, I for my part remit to her Majestie;
but what doth her Majestie mean to maintain still her danger, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for her surety? I assure your Lordship I can see no reason. God preserve
her Majestie long to Reigne over us by some unlooked for miracle; for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see by natural reason that her Highness goeth about to provide for it.</p>
                  <p>Thus I commit your Lordship to Almighty God.</p>

not yet cease in you, you may be assured it doth as little cease in us: calling to our
remembrance, and laying before our eyes the trouble, the uncertainty, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
the peril and danger which had been like to follow, if at that time God
had taken from us that stay of the Commonwealth and hope of our repose,
that Lanthorn of our light next God, whom to follow, nor certainly where to
light another Candle; but if the Queens Majestie do still continue in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to promise, in recoveries to forget; what shall we say but as Italians do, <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sato
il pericolo gabbato il fanto:</hi> And you shall perceive by our proceedings, what
justly may be required, is easie to be done, and done if her Majesty deceive her self,
and with irresolution make all Princes understand, that there is no certainty in her
Majestie nor her Councel, but dallian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shall first discredit her Ministers, which is not much; but next, and by them,
discredit her self, to be counted as uncertain, irresolute, unconstant, and for
no Prince to trust unto, but as to a Courtier, who hath words at will, and true
deeds none. Your Lordship must pardon me, for I have here kept so long, that
I am now in an Ague, both in body and spirit: nor seeing no cause why Mr. <hi>Beal</hi>
cometh not, nor any reason shewed neither in her Majesties Letters nor yours,
why he doth not come; as the humours in my body maketh an Ague in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
whereof I would it should make an end; so this irresolution there with you
I hope will help to conclude, that I shall feel no more miseries, which I fear
those that come after us shall feel, <hi>Quia non videbimus tempus visitationis nostrae.</hi>
Thus I commit your Lordship to Almighty God. From Blois this Good-Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,

                  <p>Because the French King doth deal so plainly, faithfully, and frankly with the
Q. Majestie at this time touching the matters in Scotland, I pray move her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
to deal as frankly with him, and let <hi>de Crocque</hi> be privy to your Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and let them be conformable to his; and if he shall think so meet, you may
add more to them, for they would have the Commission to be, joyntly to doe,
and with common consent, all things.</p>

                  <p>MY very good Lord, With much difficulty at the last we have concluded
the League, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of all together. The last Instructions seemed to us so precise for the Scotch
matters, we taking them as concluded between the Queens Majestie and Mr. <hi>de
la Mot</hi> their Ambassador Resident there, that he did not so conclude, nor had no
such authority, but that it was referred again to us. In fine, after five or six daies
debating, the 14 of this month we came to this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We yielded to put out, and in
those words as be in the Instructions, as <hi>de la Mott</hi> required, and to
change one or two more which varied not the sentence, but made it more clear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and remitting to us the last Article of reservation to the Scots; we remitted also
to them the 24. because we would once be at a point. And where reservation is
needless in a League defensive, where is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54478:110"/>
yet we would not that the Queens Majestie should seem any more to
relent to them, then they to her Highness. All the rest they accorded to us as
we would desire, and in all points as is required in her Highness Letters to us,
as ye may perceive by the Treaty, and by our demand in Latine; and that which
we followed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or gave us reason, why not; which we send unto you; indeed that
word <hi>present,</hi> is not so necessary nor effectual: for when we speak <hi>Statum Scotiae;</hi>
and if you put <hi>praesentem,</hi> and now it is in trouble, and doubt may be made whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you would maintain the troubled State or no; and so <hi>present</hi> shall be, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminatio

publicas Soctiae Leges consuetudines &amp; Parliamenta,</hi> it is understood by
common sense, <hi>praesentes,</hi> for Laws and Statutes abrogated or antiquated, be
not Laws; so they confessed unto us that they got nothing by putting out <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentem,</hi>
or <hi>praesentis;</hi> but that it lay not so open unto cavillations, as though
they should by special words maintain the troubled State, or allow the Parlament,
whereby the Queen was deprived, and the King allowed; although indeed in <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite</hi>
they would not deny but it was allowed; and in the plain sense of the words
wherein they said they did much for the Q. Maj. that they were content to make
no mention of the Q. of being so their friend and allie, but gave her over to the
Q. Maj. and in all things relent to her Highness desires, so they may have any
colour to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ve the K. their Masters honour. Likewise where the maintaining of
Rebels, done by the Scots, and the expulsion to expell them, was set in the
writing as a thing confessed, both by the King here, and the Q. Maj. they would
have the rehersal made, as of her Majesties relation; and yet the thing done as her
Highness requireth, as you see in the Treaty. These things when they come to
conclusion, your wisdom knoweth be not to be sticked upon; so that the Q. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with her Honor hath done all that is desired of her Highness. And as I hope
and trust, the best League that ever was made with France or any other Nation
for her Majesties surety. As yet we have not signed the Treaty, but to morrow
or the next day we shall have. There hath been such variance betwixt us for some
words, and somewhat for slowness of Writers. Thus in few words you have the
reasons of our variances and agreements, so that with the said, and other which
your Lordship can adjoyn, all doubts and objections if any, may be answered. And
so I commit your Lordship to almighty God,</p>

convenient to take of him and send it your Lordship by <hi>Cavalcant,</hi> somevvhat
to consider of it before, for their Ambassador shall present it to the Q. Majestie,
to have the like of her Highness. Mr. <hi>Cavalcant</hi> also doth partly understand the
reason of it, vvhich is to satisfie such as would be glad to find any cavellation to
mislike the League. And therefore for our part vve vvish that her Majestie should
condiscend to so much as conveniently her Highness may do, because the King
here dealeth so frankly and roundly vvith her Majestie.</p>

And straightly after that I had written so farr, came Monsieur—brother, and
brought us a copy of a League in French, and also of the reciproque Letters for
the explication of the general words thereof, to be understood also in matter of
Religion. This League in French serveth for three purpose; the one, the King
here understands French, and not Latine; the other, for the aid of horsemen and
footmen. The Latine at this day is forced to signifie the manner as it is now dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
although it be the manner of the Romans: the French is proper to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the War at this day, which be better known by that Language now then
by Latine. Now you having both, the one may serve for the interpretation of the
other; although the very League is that which is in Latine, and signed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>MY very good Lord, I most heartily thank you for your Leters of the 28 of
April, wherin I greatly rejoyc'd that <hi>du Crocque</hi> is sent at the last into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
the staying of him was not well taken here, for it bred some suspicion as of
no plain dealing; and the King here meaning surely, for any thing I can yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
nothing but sincerity and plain and faithful dealing towards her Maj. is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for his part suspicious; but I wil not swear for his Councel: within these three
daies there was a Letter of <hi>du Crocques</hi> to the King, sent from the Court hither to
<hi>Mr. de Montmorency</hi> and <hi>du Foix,</hi> who sent to us immediately <hi>du Florence,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
very much that <hi>du Crocque</hi> had written to the King that he was in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of his going into Scotland, he thought verily the Q. would not let him go.
This thing somewhat amazed us both; but so soon as we received your Letters,
which was yesterday the 8 of May, and with them a Letter of <hi>Iohn Woods,</hi> that
<hi>du Crocque</hi> went into Scoland in May; we went streight to visit the Marshal and <hi>du
Foix,</hi> imparted to them the news we knew, and especially that <hi>du Crocque</hi> was gon;
we shewed them also the Articles propounded by her Maj. and their answers of
the Castle, wherein they might understand how sincerely the Q. Maj. meant. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>du Crocque</hi> came, they all liked very well, yea and also that <hi>de la Mott</hi> and <hi>du
Crocque</hi> did accept instead of that 5 Article, and they doubted not both the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
once binding themselves together to set a quiet in that Realm, both the parties
must needs content themselves to yield to reason. And if the young King be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
there, as I have often written, the K. here, and the wiser of his Councel do
desire no other. Marry he must not seem to be the doer of it, nor the condemner
of her cause. As for those Articles, neither I nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> as we told plainly,
and I am sure Mr. <hi>du Foix</hi> will say as much in England, did neither allow nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow,
for we had no Commission, as we said; and because it was referred to her
Maj. we could not but leave them whole and intire for her Highness to judge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I marvel my L. Admiral is so long before he set forward; Marshal <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi>
and <hi>du Foix,</hi> and all that should go with them, be ready, and attend only to
hear when my L. Admiral doth set forward. A man would marvel what a number
of great persons both of the long and short Robe, do desire to go with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
and to see England, and what shift he is fain to make to cut off his train, and
shake them off that desire to go, let he should have too many; he is surely a great
Prince here, marvelous wel belov'd, and one that loves the Q. Maj. and our Nation
as much as any Noble man in France. I hope the Q. Maj. will give him the Order
at his being there, that he may follow his father therein; he will esteem it much:
and I know not how it cometh to pass, here is a rumor already spread, that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54478:111"/>
others, was elected on S. <hi>Georges</hi> day, and your Lordship also, whereof I
pray God give unto you long joy, and many years to wear that Order. I am glad
the Treaty is liked. Now it cannot be said her Maj. is altogether alone, having so
good a defence of so noble, couragious, and so faithfull a Prince of his word, and
so near a neighbour, provided for and bespoken before hand against any need,
partly that, and partly the trouble in Flanders, which I trust God hath provided to
deliver his poor servants there from the Antichristian Tyranny, shall make her
Highness enjoy more quietly both England and Ireland, and a better neighbor of
Scotland. Thus I commit your Lordship to Almighty God.</p>

when we went to take our leave of the Marshal, he shewed unto us that certain

unless they could bring testimonial from us that they departed the Realm with
her Maj. favour and licence, notwithstanding I judge there are some under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to be of his Train, that wil pass over; wherfore I thought good to advertise
your Lordship, to the end there may be some order taken in that behalf. There
is one <hi>Chambers</hi> a Scotchman, somtimes a Mr. of the Requests in Scotland, who

                        </gap>nry Norris</hi> his time was a great doer for the Duke of Chastelheraud, he
came over in Mr. <hi>de Foix</hi> Train, whom I made privie that he was not very grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to her Maj. and therefore wished him to leave him behind him; he shewed, that
though heretofore he hath not bin the best instrument in the Scotch divisions,
yet he now wisheth nothing more then accord, wherein he promiseth to do his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost,
and thinketh he may be able to do a great deal of good; whereupon he
hath made choice of him at this present, for that he thinketh that if <hi>du Crocque</hi> do
no good in the appeasing of the Scotch troubles, that then the Kings pleasure is
to imploy him in that behalf; not withstanding he telleth me that his meaning was
never to have him with him into Scotland, if percase he shal be imployed in that
behalf, without making her Majestie privy thereof; for that the King his Mr. hath
no other meaning but to consult in common with her Maj. touching the best
means to appease the said troubles; for the best justifying of the said <hi>Chambers,</hi> he
did protest unto me most earnestly, that both the Cardinal of Lorrain, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Glasco, did what they could by their friends in Court, to impeach that
<hi>Chambers</hi> might not go. If <hi>du Crocque</hi> do no good, I hope her Maj. shal find Mr.
<hi>de Foix</hi> a very good instrument in those affairs.</p>
                  <p>Touching Flanders matters, if the long gowns had not done somewhat to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach

in Zealand to have hindred the siege of Middleburgh. I hope shortly to send you
word of somewhat done and put in execution to divert the said Spaniards, for that
I think it necessary for her Majesty to know how this thing past; I mean to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise

                  <p>I doubt not, but others do certifie you of our Parliament proceedings, wherein
there can be found no more soundness then in the common house, and no lack ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in the higher house, but in the highest person such slowness in the offers
of surety, and such stay in resolution, as it seemeth God is not pleased that the sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
shall succeed. To lament that secretly I cannot forbear, and thereby with it and
such like I am overthrown in heart, as I have no spark almost of good spirits left in
me to nourish health in my body, being every 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day thrown down to the ground,
so as now I am forced to be carried into the Parliament-house, and to her Maj. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
and to lament it openly, is to give more comfort to the adversaries. These
are our miseries, &amp; such as I see no end thereof; and amongst others, shame doth as
much trouble me as the rest, that all persons shall behold our follies as they may
think, imputing these lacks and errors to some of us that are accounted inward
Counsellours, where indeed the fault is not; and yet they must be so suffered, and
to be so imputed, for saving the honour of the highest. I think to send you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
the Commission to authorize you for treating of the Merchants causes, not
determined by the Treaty, but hitherto I am not informed how to instruct you;
for indeed I see no likelihood of any great moment thereby, so are our Merchants

matters of the Low-Countreys were hot awhile, but now the Flemings are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
cold. The Duke incroacheth upon them of Zealand, having by the treason
of the Townsmen in armour, recovered it, and put in Garisons of the Spaniard.
Now notwithstanding Flushing, which is not well governed for lack of a head, we
have suffered as many of the strangers to depart from hence as would, but that is
but a simple help. If the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> doth not follow this opportunity, his
case will never be recoverable hereafter.</p>

I pray you be most earnest to have him delivered. As for Religion, upon my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
he never knew what a Papist was till he came there, from his cradle he hath
been bred a Protestant, but his brother served me thus before, which if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,

of Leicester.</head>
                  <p>YOur Lordships of the 21. I have received touching your servant; I shall
not need say more then was contained in my last Letters. Here at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
we are altogether entertained with Flanders matters, having received cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
news from thence, that certain by order from Count <hi>Lodovick,</hi> are seised
of Valentiennes and Monts in Henault, where it is said the Court remaineth, and
that from thence he sent Mr. <hi>de la Nue</hi> in great diligence towards Bruxels with
six hundred horses, where if he hap to find the Duke <hi>de Alva,</hi> he hopeth to
make short Wars, the Town of Bruxels being better affected to the Count
then to the D. It is said here that Doway and Lisle should also be taken by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
appointed by him for the purpose; but that is not certain. If the Duke of
Alva retire to Antwerp (as it is thought he will) then those of judgement here
are of opinion, that the whole Country will revolt.</p>
                  <p>The heads of those that he doth imploy of his Country are, <hi>Ianlis, de la Nue,
Buckanans,</hi> the number of his horsemen are twelve hundred, the most part of
them Gentlemen. Of footmen he hath only five thousand, the most part of them
Gascoins. It will shortly be seen to what issue this Tragedy will come. If occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
so fall out, I mean to advertise often, thinking it necessary for her Majestie
to know how things proceed there; and yet when I consider how things of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
tending to safety proceed at home; I know not what to judge necessary,
unless it be for every man particularly to provide for the cross. And so leaving
further to trouble your Lordshop at this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>AS I wrote unto your Lordship in my last Letters, that I thought it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for her Majesty to know how things proceeded in Flanders, so I thought
good to put the same in execution at this present upon certain advertisements
lately come from thence. A Currier past this way, as I am credibly informed the
27 of this month, sent by the D. of Longueville to the King, with this news, that on
Saterday last the 24 of the same, Valentiennes should be taken, and the next day
after Monts in Henault; and that from thence with great celerity the C. <hi>Lodovick</hi>
should send five hundred horse to Bruxels, under the conduct of Mr. <hi>de la Nue,</hi>
where if he hap to find the D. of <hi>Alva,</hi> it will grow to short Wars, in respect of
the intelligence they have with the Town, who undertook with the aid of 100
soldiers, to take the D. prisoner: if he retire to Antwerp (as it is thought he wil) then
is it likely that all the whole Country will revolt. I the rather credit this news for
that it agreeth with the plot laid by C. <hi>Lodovick</hi> before his departure from hence,
who told me that he hoped to give the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> an alarm ere 8 daies came
to an end, in place where he should least look for it. There will shortly be great
guess given what wil be the event of these matters. The Prince of Orange most
assuredly is onward on his way with 4000 horse, whose enterprise on the other
side is like to have the better success upon this good beginning laid by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

I hope things will be so ordered, as others shall not grow over great, wherein
I have been no evil instrument. I send your Lordship by this bearer, a note of the
names of those of quality which doe accompany the Marshal, as also the
number, which I had sent before with this bearer to deliver a note thereof to
such as shall be appointed by her Majestie to receive the Marshal at Dover.</p>

                  <p>I forgat in my last that Mr. <hi>Montmorency</hi> at the request of certain Italians,

her to write a Letter unto his Master, desiring him to write unto his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor

who is imprisoned there by the Inquisitors; a thing, that his service done
unto the Crown of England, did as it were crave at her Majesties hands,
who he knew being naturally pittifully inclined, would do any thing that might
seem to tend to his delivery. For mine own opinion, I think her Majesties Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
unto Queen Mother, would do a great deal more good, who by the Duke
of Florence his means, may bring it the more easily to pass, especially this Pope
being his Creature. And so leaving to trouble your Lordship any further, I

                  <head>Instructions given to the Earl of Lincoln, Lord Admiral of England, and one of

to be assisted for the execution of the matter underwritten, with Sir

resident for her Majesty with the French King;
at St. Iames, May 25. 1572.</head>
                  <p>THe said L. Admiral shal have with him both Commission under the great Seal
of England, authorizing him and S. <hi>Th. Smith,</hi> and <hi>Fr. Walsingham,</hi> and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
also to require the French K. to confirm the last treaty concluded at Blois
by his oath, whereupon he shall proceed first after his access to the K. obtaining
by the Ambass. resident for the demand of the said oath, as is meet for the honor
of the League of amity now concluded between their Maj. using therein all good
speeches to assure him, that according to such express words as are contained in
the same Treaty, for a mutual love and amity to be hereafter used and maintained
between them, her Maj. is fully bent in her heart to maintain the same on her part,
the rather because she doth assuredly hope that the K. wil do the like: whereof his
Maj. by his Ambass. that he hath sent in the time of the late Treaty and negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same, shewed many manifest arguments of his own special favourable
directions of matters at sundry times resting in doubt between her Commissioners
and his Maj. to more reasonable ends, as appeared, then otherwise would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
ordered by his Ministers. And so the L. Admiral having in this manner assured
the K. of her Maj. ful and resolute determination to imbrace and hold fast this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
amity; he shal say that his coming thither is to visit the K. on her Maj. behalf,
and to attend upon his leasure and best oportunity to be present, and to receive
the K. oath to be made for ratifying of the said Treaty, according to a clause in the
said Treaty for that purpose. And when the K. shal have accorded thereunto, the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54478:113"/>
said L. Admiral shal before hand, percase by som privat conference had with some
of the Secretaries of the State, how, and in what sort the ceremonies therof shallbe
observed, so as the proceeding may be at the time at the solemnity thereof without
any alteration. And for the better proceeding herein, the Lord Admiral shall have
with him both Articles of the Treaties requiring the said oath, and the manner &amp;
form of like oath given by the said K. heretofore in like cases. And the instrument
also to be demanded in writing, for testimony of the said oath, with such other
things as are thereto requisite, so as the like manner may be used as near as may be
agreeable to former usages; and that there be with him present to assist him, S. <hi>Th.
Smith,</hi> and the Ambass. resident, if they may be there to help. And as for the place
where the said oath should be given, the said L. Admiral shal not refuse any that
the K. shal appoint, foreseeing only that he be not by reason thereof compelled to
be present at any Mass to be said for the purpose; but if it be in Church or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
he shal not refuse to require to take it in the same. Furthermore, although
there is no other cause special of the sending of the L. Admiral at this time to the
said K but to require his oath; yet for that there may be many occasions offered
of speeches in the matters, where it shal be looked for that the said L. Admiral
should answer the said K. to his satisfaction. Therfore he wil in these things follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
accommodate himself as hereafter is mentioned; wherein the said L. Admiral
shal as occasion shall serve, take the help of Sir <hi>Th. Smith,</hi> who is also herein well
acquainted. In the matter of Scotland, although the said L. Admiral be privy
in what sort her Maj. hath hitherto proceeded, so as he may by consideration
thereof, conjecture what is likely further to be her Maj. meaning: yet to make her
case the more plain, he may wel hold opinion tht her Maj. meaneth not any thing
more then that the Realm of Scotland may be brought to quietness, and remain
free from any invasion of any stranger, wherby the liberty of that Crown and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be impaired. And he may wel remember of his own knowledge, how
often times since the Scotch Q. coming into our Realm, we have bin wel disposed
to have obtained an accord betwixt her and her Subjects; but always when we
were most earnest to have done her pleasure therein, she was most ready to practice
against us, as it seemeth, not satisfied with the recovery of her own Country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the practice, also she might have ours, as by most manifest proofs the said L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Admiral and Sir <hi>Th. Smith</hi> also can avow to be ready to be shewed, whereupon
her Maj. hath been forced for her safety and weal of her Realm, to take another
course. And therfore as for the government of that Crown and Nation, her Maj.
finding it certain that the 3 Estates of the same did in ful Parlament accept the Q.
of Scots division of her Crown to her son, and that thereby he was Crowned and
invested according to the ancient Laws of that Realm, and that he is so acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the said Estates and the whole people (a very few persons for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
quarrels excepted) her Maj. finding in her such dangerous ingratitude, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in her self not to direct any other orders in the said Realm, then she findeth
by her own Law, having also so good and just occasion to detain the said Q. as she
doth. Upon these considerations she hath indeed concluded, and meaneth hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to continue her favour towards that K (the nearest kinsman she hath, and in
profession correspondent) to all such as have acknowledged his authority, and so
shal therein continue; wherupon the said L Admiral who is wel acquainted with
this cause, shal also say to the K. that if it please him to do the like for the K. he
shal best thereby recover a common peace to that Land, and the attempt of such
as seek to withdraw that Nation from the ancient amity that hath been, and yet
continueth betwixt the Realm and the said K. Crown, shal thereby be made fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and as occasion shal serve to this purpose, the L. Admiral may truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the King, how the Q. of Scots of late time, both by sundry her own Letters
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54478:114"/>
to the D of <hi>Alva,</hi> and by her Ministers to the K. of Spain, laboured to intice the
said K. of Spain to attempt the same, with plain assurance that she will not in any
wise depend upon the French K. but hath wholly given her self, her son and Realm
so far forth as she can, to the said K. of Spain; and to that end, hath done her utmost
to move the said K. to send forces into <hi>England,</hi> to joyn with such as she promiseth
shall be ayding thereunto surprize her son, and to carry him into Spain by sea;
according thereunto the D. of <hi>Alva</hi> hath sent several men to peruse the ports in
Scotland for that interprize. Of these and such like things the said L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Admiral can
and shal of his own knowledg, inform the said K. and thereby move him not to be
abused by any her other offers to him to the contrary thereof; and shall plainly let
him to understand, except he shall take this plain way to restore that Realm to a
common peace, the said Q. will do her utmost to make it a prey to others.</p>
                  <p>As for the person of the said Q. of Scots, he may declare, how well she is treated
for her diet and other things meet for her health, howsoever the contrary may be
reported; so she may at her pleasure take the air on horseback, so she doth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of the E. of <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> &amp; for her diet, it is such, as her own Ministers do and
will prepare, without respect of charge; only it is prohibited, that no strangers shall
have liberty to come to her, to practise with them, as she hath long time used; and
yet it is found daily, that she doth not cease by letters and messages to solicite
all manner for things for her purpose, as by the interception now and then by
her letters and messages is to be seen, amongst which are found these her continual
labours to procure her son to be stollen &amp; taken away into <hi>Spain,</hi> besides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of her former dangerous practises attempted against the Q. Maj. and her
Realm. And howsoever the Q. Maj. hath used a notable clemency and remisness
towards her, in not using such revenge hereof as she well might, and she thinketh
no other Prince would in like case forbear; yet the said L. Admiral shal shew to the
K. with great earnestness her Estates now assembled in Parliament, have and do so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite
her Maj. both in respect of her Maj. and the whole Realm, to proceed against
the Scotish Q. by order of justice, for her attempts against her Maj. person, &amp; the
state of the Realm, wherein her Maj. is so perplexed with the incessant clamor and
request of her people in this behalf, as indeed she is marvelously therewith trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
for as of her own nature her Maj. hath bin always found even in her own most
private causes, and where her person hath been in danger, not given to shew any
vehemency, or to pursue avenge, so to refuse the universal motion, the general ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
&amp; exhortation of her States, she thinketh it no smal hazard of their love which
they bear towards her; &amp; what may happen hereof, the L. Adm. may say, is doubtful.</p>
                  <p>And to the intent the L. Admiral may in this cause of the Q. of Scots, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
shew how contrary to all deserts of gratitude and favor meant towards the
said Q. by the Q. Maj. she hath been by her not onely ungratefully, but also most
dangerously dealt withal; and thereby, as it were by extremity of her malice intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the Q. Maj. she hath been forced to change her course, and regard her
own safety. The said L. Admiral may cal both to his remembrance and conference
Sir <hi>Tho: Smith</hi> of these things and their circumstances; that is, first of her secret
seeking of the marriage with the D. of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> without her Maj. knowledg, at that
time that her Maj. was travelling to compound her causes with her subjects; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that her Maj. had imprisoned the said D. for that attempt &amp; that her practises in
the same were discovered, and therewith not unknown to her Maj. what comfort
she had given to her Maj. subjects to enter into rebellion as they did; &amp; being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
and forced to fly, were openly maintained in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the Scotish Q.
means. It is yet notorious, how her Majestie by sundry solicitations, partly of
her self, and partly of the French King and his Ministers, was content, as it were,
to bury the former notable injuries, and did newly e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter most earnestly to
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54478:114"/>
treat with her subjects for restitution, &amp; left no good means unassayed, neither by
request nor threatnings to move them to accept her Maj. earnestness; then which
the Nobilitie of <hi>Scotland</hi> professing obedience to the King her Son, that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
plainly charged them, that if they would not condescend to her moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for her, she would utterly abandon them, and rather be a party against
them: Whereupon they were entred into such hard terms, as they answered,
that they would so persist in their obedience to their King, as they would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
their lives in the quarrel. And yet finally, by some perswasions, they
were induced to accord with her Majestie, that a Parliament should be holden
with such speed as it might be, and there these her Majesties motions were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
and certain persons should have authority to treat hereof with her
Majesties Councellours: Whereupon her Majestie did look for some good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
and before it could be granted thereunto to proceed, her Majestie disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
daily most dangerous attempts of Treason, both against her Person and
Realm, wholly and onely set forth by the said Queen of Scots. And her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
found these new Treasons intended, and almost brought to their mischievous
perfection, by not onely renewing of the former marriage with the Duke of
<hi>Norfolk,</hi> and by giving order for a Rebellion and Invasion of this Realm. All
which was by her devised, set forth and delivered to be executed even in the very
same time that her Majestie did deal so earnestly for her with her Subjects, and
was in hope to have obtained some reasonable end for her: So also did she now
discover the truth of her former practises in stirring of the first Rebellion, onely
to have by force obtained the marriage, and with the same force sought the
Crown. All the which attempts the said Lord Admiral and Sir <hi>Tho: Smith</hi> can
orderly declare, and so they shall do. And they may well say, That her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
cannot think any person to mean well towards her safetie, that would after
these things thus notified, move her Majestie to hold her former course in favour
of the said Scotish Queen: And this hath been the cause why her Majestie hath
not (since this last discovery of these dangers) in such sort answered both to the
King and his Ministers upon their motions made in her favour. And the Lord
Admiral shall conclude, that seeing the case is thus, that to shew such favour to
the Scotish Queen as is desired, is most dangerous to her Majesties Crown, and
her Majestie cannot like of any motion to hazard her own Estate: And besides,
the things intended by the Scotish Queen against her Majestie, it is apparent she
doth wholly give her self to the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> which
as it is many waies fully to be proved, so may the Lord Admiral say, That he can
make it manifest by her own hand writing; for which end he shall shew to the King
a Letter of hers in Cypher to the Duke of <hi>Alva:</hi> All which the Lord Admiral
shall shew to the King, to this end, that both he may see the just causes her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
hath to hold the course she doth, and that he also wil not molest her Maj. with
any motions tending for favour of the Scotish Q. so greatly to her Maj. danger.</p>
                  <p>And to the matter of <hi>le Crocques</hi> stay here for a time, before his departure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Scotland,</hi> if any mention be thereof made by the King, the said L. Admiral can
tel the occasion thereof to have grown of the letters which <hi>le Crocque</hi> brought from
the King to her Majestie in favour of the Scotish Queen, for her liberty and return
into <hi>France,</hi> notwithstanding the king had been duly informed by her Majesties
Ambassador, that her Majestie could not with her surety suffer the same. And
threfore at that time she could not think that <hi>le Crocques</hi> negotiation coming
with such letters, could tend to pacifie the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> for her Majesties
surety, when before his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nlay he was found to have charge from the Q. of Scots.</p>
                  <p>If any motion be made to the L. Admiral of a matter lately devised to offer to
her Maj. Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Alanson,</hi> the L. Admiral may well say, that he
hath no charge to speak thereof at this time; but he may say, that he is willed, if
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54478:115"/>
occasion be so given to him to report what he heard her Majestie say, that he was
not so well used in the Treaty for the other brother the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> as was
meet, in the time of motion made for Amity, both by that marriage and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
for that Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> being in <hi>England,</hi> and dealing therein, her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
did proceed honourably and plainly with him, and with the French Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador,
that she would not assent to marry with him, or with any other, that would
not consent with her in Religion, contrary to the order of the Realm; or at the
least, that would use any other Religion in any sort, then might stand with the
Church of God; whereupon her Majestie was by them pressed but to consent to
a sufferance of some secret usage of his Religion without offence of the Realm,
until he might be otherwise induced and perswaded in conscience.</p>
                  <p>It may be remembred, that when her Majesties Ambassador made a report at
<hi>de Foix</hi> return of her Majesties answer, the King seemed not willing to receive
that answer, but that he desired that some might be sent to commune thereof
with him, who should find that the matter should be made clearer of these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties;
whereunto when her Majestie did not fully consent, it was afterward by
the Ambassador Resident oftentimes pressed, that her Majestie would send some
special person of trust for her self to the French King, promising her Majestie, that
this matter should be facillitated, and made easie to her contentation. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereunto, her Majestie, upon many solicitations, specially by the said Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
in the King his Masters name, did send Sir <hi>Tho: Smith,</hi> to understand the
Kings meaning herein, who can best tell, how at the first entry he was answered
with a direct contrary course to her Majesties expectation, and otherwise then
was mentioned by any Ambassador that ever treated therein with her Majestie,
or that ever Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> did ever speak or require; which was, that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Anjou</hi> would in any wise have the exercise of his Religion here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in like sort as he had in <hi>France:</hi> A matter strange to be heard at that time,
when her Majestie was provoked to send one, with hope that in the case of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
she should receive such an answer as should content her Majestie. Of this
matter the L. Admiral shall inform himself more largely of Sir <hi>Tho: Smith,</hi> to
the end that if the same be communed of, he may both with the King and the
Queen Mother so deal, as it may be seen to them that her Majestie had cause to
think very strangely thereof: And were it not that she is entred into a streight
Amity with the King, she might justly challenge lack of friendship herein, but so
as the King be not ignorant, but that her Majestie hath cause to think her self
not well dealt withal, she is content to pass it over, without keeping the same in
memory to nourish any unkindness. And so the L. Admiral shall use his speech,
that the King may not think his speech to move any new offence. Furthermore,
the said L. Admiral shall in all his speech with the King, and also with the Queen
Mother, let it appear how much her Majestie esteemeth sundry offers made to
her by the Kings Letters to his Ambassador here, of daily increase of this Amity
now newly established between them. And though her Majestie doth not percase
so often answer these his kindnesses in words or writing, yet he shall be assured,
that whensoever occasion shall be given to shew the like affection in deeds, she
will not be behind him. Besides the letters to the King and Q. Mother, he shall
have also her Majesties letters to the Q. of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whom he shall visit, and
most heartily salute in her Majesties name; and let her understand, how glad he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Majestie is, and doth thank God for the benefit of the Peace, which he hath given
to her, and to all others, that now of a long time have for defence of their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
suffered great calamities with her, wherein surely her sincerity and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
hath won to her no small honour in the world; but most of all, the blessing
of God to indure with her and her posterity. And next to this, her Majestie doth
rejoyce that she hath so wisely and honourably considered of the marriage of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54478:115"/>
Prince her Son with the daughter of <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ance,</hi> whereby both the good love of the
French King to her Estate shall probably have continuance, and her self shall live
by Gods grace, to see the good success of her son in her own time, to her comfort.</p>
                  <p>The said Lord Admiral shall also give the Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> and others of
the Nobility joyned with him, to understand how glad her Majestie is of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the Pacification of their troubles, and doth hope, that they will let
their sincerity and their good meaning appear so to the King, as he may comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
continue his favours towards them, and that their adversaries, who have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
slandered their actions, as though they had not been founded upon consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
may be ashamed to have abused themselves; and so shall the honour of God
indeed, by their manifest and good conversations increase, to the confusion of
them, that by untruths have maliciously sought to keep the same under, and to
oppress it. And for the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> the L. Admiral shall not forbear to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
them of his own part, according to their degrees, if he shall see that they give
countenance to him as to accept it. And if any of them shall motion matters to
him, as of the Q. of Scots, he may say, if she had been counselled by her friends
to have been grateful to her Majestie, or to have forborn the seeking to offend
her Majestie, she might thereby have done her self good, and been the cause of
quietness to the Countrey; but she hath so manifestly taken other courses, as sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
either her friends that evil counselled her, or her self, must be accounted the
principal cause of her trouble. And so he shall use his speech of her.</p>
                  <p>These instructions the L. Admiral shall communicate with Sir <hi>Tho: Smith</hi> and
the Resident Ambassador, and upon the sight of them Sir <hi>Tho: Smith</hi> shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it to be her Majesties pleasure, that he shall accompany and be assistant
to the L. Admiral in the time of the Kings giving of his Oath. And when the L.
Admiral shall have done his Commission, and delivered the rest of his charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in these Instructions, the said Sir <hi>Tho: Smith</hi> shall no longer abide in
<hi>France,</hi> but shall return at his most commodity.</p>

any speech be used by the K. notwithstanding the former Instruction in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
above expressed, how to answer to the K. upon some consideration thereof.
The L. Admiral shal at the first say, that although he hath no chargeto treat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
yet he is willed by her Majestie to give them thanks for the desire it seemeth
he hath to have alliance with her Majestie by marriage, as not onely shewing her
own disposition towards her Majestie, at which time his youth seemed to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment;
and now secondly for his brother Monsieur <hi>d' Anjou,</hi> wherein also
the inequality of years did at the first stay her Majestie, wherein also she did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
her judgement by perswasion, and rested in the end upon the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which of all other things, is the greatest stay that can be; and now the
motion of the yongest brother cannot in her opinion, by reason of the inequality
of years, but make a full stay in her Majestie, as she thinketh the same ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to work the like in the judgement of the King, and of the Queen his Mother.
And having said this, then may the said L. Admiral proceed to say somewhat,
as is above prescribed, of her Majesties misliking for the dealing in the cause of
Monsieur <hi>de Anjou,</hi> using the same nevertheless, as it breed no offence in the
King.</p>

                  <head>To my very Friend Francis Walsingham <abbr>Esq</abbr> Ambassador for the
Queens Majestie in France.</head>
                  <p>SIr, I heartily thank you for your Letters of the nine and twentieth of the last,
and specially for that which you write to her Majestie. As to the matters of
the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Low-Countreys, we have great cause to bear a jealous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
thereto; for as being in the Spaniards hands, we lacked Traffique with
surety; so if the Maritine part come to those where you are, not onely the
Traffique into those parts, for our Merchants will be regulated by them, but our
soveraignty upon the narrow Seas will be abridged with danger and dishonour.
And notwithstanding this, I see lack of disposition to provide the remedy where
it should chiefly be, and I trust with importunity, we that see into the perils, shall
obtain somewhat; if not, our consciences shall be quiet, though our minds shall
not. As to your Letters to her Majestie, forasmuch as the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> had
suffered upon Munday, and your Letters came on Tuesday, I thought it not
amiss to tell the Queens Majestie that I had Letters from you to her, which I
thought were onely to shew her the opinion of wisemen, and her Majesties well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wishers
in <hi>France,</hi> both for the Queen of Scots and the Duke of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
she bad me open the letters, and so I did in her presence; and she being
somewhat sad for the Duke of <hi>Norfolks</hi> death, I took occasion to cut off the
reading thereof, and so entred into speech of the Queen of Scots, which she
did not mislike, and commended your care and diligence. As for the party
your dear friend, I did not speak with him, nor he never accompanied me,
nor once ever spake one word to me of the matter, as he was wont to do
in other matters, I disallow not his private affection to the party, but his
judgement I do dissallow in preferring private to publike. I do return to you
the Commission amended in your name, which was the errour of the writer; you
may proceed thereto as you see time.</p>
                  <p>The French Ambassador hath no Commission to require the like, looking
for it, as he saith, when <hi>Montmorency</hi> shall come, whose delay proves an
unreasonable charge to great numbers to the Queens Majestie, having her offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Houshold at Dover, and her provisions thereby lost. The Earl of
<hi>Pembroke,</hi> Lord <hi>Windsor,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Buckhurst</hi> be at <hi>Dover</hi> with great
and mighty trains: Besides, hither are come such leavies of Ladies to attend,
as husbands curse the delay. The Queens Majestie is in health. The Scotish
Queen shall be touched with an Act of Parliament, but it will not draw her
to any more fear to offend then words will do.</p>

I have thought good to commend him by these my Letters friendly unto
you, as unto one I am well assured will have a special care of him during his
abode there. He is young and raw, and no doubt shall find those Countreys and
the demeanors of the people somewhat strange unto him; and therefore your
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54478:116"/>
good advice and counsel shall greatly behove him for his better direction, which
I do most heartily pray you to vouchsafe him with any friendly assistance you
shall think needful for him. His father and I do intend his further travel if the
world be quiet, and you shall think it convenient for him, otherwise we pray
you we may be advertised thereof, to the end the same his travels may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
directed accordingly. As for the boy <hi>Clark,</hi> since I cannot obtain him as
I desire, I must content me. I wish I had one of my Lord Cardinals Monks,
to see how devoutly he should be kept here. But I pray you let it appear that
it is great unkindness for one Nobleman to use unto another. The boy hath
sought sundry ways to return unto me, as well by Letters to his Friends, as by
supplications to my self, but I mind not to have him so. The cause that I did so
earnestly seek him, was to punish him in example of others, which if it will not
be, I will leave it for a time, and hope to give you knowledge where he is short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

                  <p>SIr, I cannot let any your servants pass hence without some word. I have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for some knowledge of my L. Admirals arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> and thereupon
stayed to send away this bearer until now that I hear by the French Ambassadors
Letters, hovv my Lord and you have been feasted and entertained, which they
here do give out with large speeches, but how indeed the same is warranted I
know not; sure I am, that they have been so feasted and entreated, as none in
my memory hath been greater. The Queens Majestie before she gave her oath,
made a protestation, that she was not in mind to break any jot of the Treaty, and
though the Castle of <hi>Hume,</hi> and <hi>Fast</hi> Castle were not delivered, yet the fault
was not in her; for she had propounded to the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> and to the Regent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
her disposition to deliver it; but the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> required that her Majestie
vvould keep it still, rather then deliver it, so as it bred not an increase of their
hateful dissention. And hereupon her Majestie hath propounded to the Regent
to be content that the Lord <hi>Hume</hi> may have it, if he will be content to acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the King; vvhich the Lord <hi>Hume</hi> offereth in vvords, but the Regent saith
that the Lord <hi>Hume</hi> hath promised to offer his obedience to the King, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his houses, and then he will ayd them of the Castle, and this is indeed
discovered to be true.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, <hi>Fast</hi> Castle was in my Lord <hi>Humes</hi> hands but as a Tutor to an
infant, who is come to full age, and followeth the Kings part.</p>
                  <p>Truly you may thus report to the King, and assure him, that her Majestie
meaneth not to keep the one, or the other, although she might pretend matters
against the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> for the damage that he did to <hi>England,</hi> in keeping the
Rebels in those Houses, and invading the Realm.</p>

                  <p>This case was not pursuant upon the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>The Scotish Queen had more favour then she deserved, or then did well stand
with the surety of the Queens Majestie. Her evil parts against the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie

<hi>de Foix</hi> in <hi>France</hi> by our Ambassador. The Nobility also and People now as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
in this Parliament, had considered that the Queens Majesties surety
could not be preserved, without some severe proceeding against the Queen of
Scots, whereunto her Majestie had not yielded in such extremity. And so the
Scotish Queen had more favour indeed then either she deserved, or then was
thought meet by the whole Realm.</p>

they were on both sides in arms, and therefore the procuring of persons to come

her oath. For the not delivery of <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Fast</hi> Castle in <hi>Scotland,</hi> according

offered of the cause thereof. The Ambassador of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the Lord
<hi>Graunges</hi> brother, since the Earl of <hi>Lincolns</hi> departure, hath been often at the
Court, and are very importunate to have somewhat done for their Mistris:
As also, in perswading their Majesties here, to consent to the establishment of
their Government of their said Mistris; what their importunacy hath won, I
know not as yet, but surely I fear, as long as the woman liveth, there will never
grow good accord in <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor continuance of repose in <hi>England,</hi> nor perfect

from <hi>Flushing,</hi> of the discords there for want of good Governor,
they have made choice of Monsieur <hi>Iunius,</hi> to go thither out of hand, with
Commission to establish some policy there, until the arrival of the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> his brother. He shall also have Commission for the sale of such goods
as were lately taken. For his better assistance in this behalf, desireth your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
letter unto Captain <hi>Morgan,</hi> there to assist him what lieth in him, in the
execution of the said Commission; and that further, it would please your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to admonish him to retain his Souldiers in such order, as may answer to the
defence of a good cause. For that he desireth very much to confer with Mr. <hi>Kille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grew,</hi>
to make him fully acquainted with the state of their cause, he meaneth to
repair to <hi>Dover,</hi> and there to imbarque, where he hopeth to meet with him.
I perceive by him, that if there be no assistance given underhand by her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
they shall be driven to yield to such inconveniences as shall be laid upon
them by this Nation. And further, that they shall be forced to consent to have
<hi>Strozi</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> unless they may have some supplies elsewhere: For this
cause chiefly the Gentleman, who wisely respecteth the liberty of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and foreseeth the mischief that may follow, if the necessity be not relieved,
disereth much to confer with Mr. <hi>Killegrew,</hi> a thing most necessary, and would
himself repair to <hi>London,</hi> but the discords raigning presently in <hi>Flushing,</hi> cannot
abide a long delay of redress. And thus having nothing else whereof to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise

                  <head>To my very Friend Francis Walsingham <abbr>Esq</abbr> Ambassador for the
Queens Majestie in France.</head>
                  <p>SIr, now that D. <hi>Montmorency</hi> is gone, I thought good briefly to write some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to you by this bearer the French Ambassadors servant, because none
of yours are here that I can learn of, nor any other so ready as this bearer is.
The Duke with all his train, to the number of forty, have been entertained
here for their meat and drink each in their degrees, as it is to be affirmed, that
the like hath not been seen in any mans memory. The honour also done to
him hath been such, as surely her Majestie could do no more; I mean, in her
courteous usage of him, in appointing sundry sorts of the Nobility of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sort to attend on him, onely the difference from my Lord Admirals inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
was, that no other Lord but my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> did feast him, as
in <hi>France</hi> was done; saving I did upon <hi>Midsummer</hi> even feast him and all his
Gentlemen with a Collation of all things that I could procure, being not flesh,
to observe their manner.</p>
                  <p>As for his reward, though it be not so great as I wish it had been, yet this
it was, the D. had a Cupbord of Plate gilt, of — a great Cup of
gold, of a hundred and eleven onces, and Monsieur <hi>de Foix</hi> had a Cupbord
of Plate of — This for their rewards.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, afore there going hence, they had done what they could in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the D. <hi>D'alanson,</hi> whereunto they had neither yea nor nay, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
onely for one moneth, which they interpreted diversly. They mentioned
certain things, which I do send you here in a Paper inclosed, with that which
was answered. I also send you in another writing other things at their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whereunto as we gave them answers, so shall you also receive note
thereof.</p>
                  <p>I am willed to require you, to use all good means possibly to understand what
you can of the Duke <hi>D' Alanson</hi> of his age in certainty, of his stature, of his
conditions, his inclination to Religion, his devotion this way, the devotion of
his followers and servitors, hereof her Majestie seeketh speedily to be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised,
that she may resolve before the moneth. And surely I cannot see in her
any lack towards this, but in opinion for his age, which defect, if it might be
supplyed with some recompences it were meet to be thought of. I could
wish we might have <hi>Callis</hi> to the issue of their bodies, and he to be Governor
thereof during his life, so as we might have security for our Staple there. I wish
also, that secretly the Queens Majestie might be assured, that (although there be
no contract, therefore) that he would here no Mass after his marriage.</p>

                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:54478:119"/>
If somewhat be not advised to recompence the opinion that her Majestie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth,
as that she should be misliked to make choice of so young a Prince, I
doubt the end.</p>
                  <p>Now for our Parliament, I cannot write patiently; all that we laboured for,
and had with full consent brought to fashion, I mean, a Law to make the Scotish
Queen unable and unworthy of succession of the Crown, was by her Majeste
neither assented to nor rejected, but deferred until the Feast of all Saints; but
what all other wise and good men may think thereof, you may gess. Some here
have, as it seemeth, abused their favour about her Majestie, to make her self
her most enemy. God amend them. I will not write to you who are suspected.
I am sorry for them, and so would you also, if you thought the suspicion to be
true.</p>

                  <p>YOur Lordships of the second and fifth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> sent by the Ambassadors ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
I received the tenth of this moneth, by the which I was glad to hear the
particularities of the royal entertainment of the Marshal <hi>Montmorency,</hi> who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
the self same day I received your Lordships Letters. He omitted no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to set out the great honor he received at her Maj. hands, and withal so good, as
never able to yield the like. The like speech passes from the rest of his train, who
all returned very well satisfied, and cannot speak too much good of her Majeste.
The day following after his arrival, Queen Mother sent for me, and shewed me
how the King her son, who was gone to S. <hi>Germains,</hi> desired her to send for me,
and to request me on his behalf, to render unto her Maj. most hearty thanks for the
great honor and good entertainment given unto the Marshal, which he could not
but interpret as a manifest argument of her Majesties unfained affection and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54478:120"/>
good will she beareth him, the which he desireth to will me to assure her Majestie
that she should find him ready to serve and honour her during his life. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
she willed me to shew her Majestie, both on his behalf, and hers also, that
they pray God to direct her heart to yield to that resolution in the marriage late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
propounded, as might be to the increase and establishment of perfect Amity
between the Crowns, which thing they saw so necessary for both, as they could
not but wish and desire most earnestly. And yet notwithstanding they protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that if they did not think the issue thereof would fall out to her good satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and contentment, they would in no case wish nor desire the same. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the particularities that her Majestie desired to understand, of the age, stature,
conditions, religion, affection towards her Majestie, and devotion of his followers
and servants; your Lordship shall understand, that first touching his age, as I
was informed, he was born the five and twentieth of <hi>April,</hi> 1555. his stature and
proportion of body, the Lord Admiral, Sir <hi>Tho: Smith,</hi> Mr. <hi>Killegrew,</hi> and other
of the Gentlemen that are here, can better express by word of mouth, then I
can set down by paper. Touching his conditions, since the matter hath been in
motion, I have used what care and curiosity I might, to be informed of them;
I find generally this opinion conceived of him, that he is of as good and tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a disposition as any other, either Prince or Gentleman in <hi>France;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
is both wise and stout, and subject to the French lightness, insomuch as they
do apply to him the French Proverb, <hi>Qu'il a de plume en son cervean,</hi> besides, the
general opinion I find the same confirmed by the Admiral, Count <hi>Rochfoucouls,
Tilligny, Bacquenaunt,</hi> and divers others of the best judgement of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with such earnest protestations, as for mine own part, I cannot but credit
the same, knowing what testimonies they have given to the world of ther zeal
and Religion. And as for the Admiral debating with him in this matter, he hath
protested sundry times to me, calling God to witness, that if he did not think the
match proceeding would prove both honourable, profitable and comfortable, and
for her safety, in respect of the doubtful terms he standeth in, he would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
her unto it for any worldly respect. And as for his Religion, they have great
hope, grounded upon good conjectures, that he is easie to be reduced to the
knowledge of the truth; and for mine own part, I have many great reasons to
induce me to think, that if there be no other impediment then the use of his mass,
that he will be easily induced to the same. Touching the affection towards her
Majestie. I am credibly informed, that where it hath been objected unto him,
that he would be glad to have the title of a King; he protested, that if he were
not moved with the great and honourable report of her Maj. rare vertues, more
then at any desire he had to a Kingdom, he would never have desired the King
nor the Queen his Mother to have made any motion thereof. Many ways am I
given credibly to understand, that his affection is unfained and great. Touching
the devotion of his followers and servants to the propunded match. I am also
credibly informed, that they do also earnestly desire the same, especially those
whose advice he chiefly useth; who though they be not of the Religion, yet are
they not enemies to the same, and rather incline that way then otherwise, of the
which a dozen of them were discharged of his brothers service in respect thereof.
This is that in sum which truly and sincerely I can learn in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>Touching <hi>Callis,</hi> the Admiral made some overture at my request, as a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that proceeded from my self. He findeth in their Majesties no disposition to
yield thereunto. I used some speech thereof also with <hi>de Foix,</hi> and shewed him,
how that nothing would yield so much furtherance as the same. We did at
large debate that matter <hi>Pro &amp;. contra;</hi> in the end, he protested most earnestly,
that he thought he knew it impossible to be brought to pass; notwithstanding,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54478:120"/>
he could be content to devise any other thing that might breed satisfaction to her
Majesties opinion conceived of some misliking that would grow by her choice of
so young a Prince. In this behalf, saith he, I have said lately so much to her
Majestie, grounded upon good reason, that I see no cause but she should rest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
satisfied.</p>
                  <p>In debate of this matter, he asked me, whether her Majestie would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
(as I thought) having already foot in <hi>Flushing,</hi> and the match proceeding,
to have the King pass in the Contract and Article, to bind him and his Successors
to assist her, aswel for the conquering of the rest of the Island, which would be
more profitable to your Countrey then ten <hi>Calis's.</hi> Of this thing (saith he) I
have no Commission to make any overture, as that thing that hath not yet fallen
into consideration, but onely I propounded it by way of communication, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of desire I have to devise some remedy for the recompence of her Majesties
opinion. Notwithstanding, saith he, I have some reasons to lead me to think her
Majesties yielding content to her match, that the King will be easily induced
thereto. I shewed him, that as I had no Commission to make any overture, so had
I no Commission to answer the same, as a thing propounded unlooked for, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
I agreed with him in opinion, that Flushing would be more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to us then <hi>Calis.</hi> To come to your Letter of the fifth of this moneth, I
find the conjectures touching the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

and vain, whereof I am assured of the contrary many ways, and do much marvel
what reason should move them that so bear her Majestie in hand, and so to think,
having no other ground thereof but such vain conjectures. Thus having made
answer to such things, as by you were propounded on her Majesties behalf, I
most humble take my leave.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honourable, and my very good Lord, the Lord of
Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>YOur Lordship by this inclosed Letter sent from <hi>Ennius</hi> the Count <hi>Palatines</hi>
chief Counsellour, unto Dr. <hi>Innius,</hi> which I had Commission to open; as
also another sent unto him from the Count himself, may perceive how the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> proceedeth in his doings; as also, that the Forces of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi>
so much talked of, are not in so much readiness as was spoken of.</p>
                  <p>I do much marvel that the Duke of <hi>Holst,</hi> being her Majesties Pensioner,
and knowing in what doubtful terms her Majestie stood with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
will in any way yield to serve the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi> I hope your Lordship will
deal earnestly with her Majestie for redress thereof, the rather, for that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that the said Duke will have some occasion to deny the same.</p>
                  <p>The sight of the said inclosed Letter which I send unto your Lordship to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with her Majestie, hath given them here no small incouragement to
proceed in yielding assistance as they made underhand. The stay of their linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that behalf proceeded, for that they wished Don <hi>Iohnd' Austria</hi> on his
way towards <hi>Morsa,</hi> before they made any great demonstration to be any deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the said enterprize: For the help and better disguising of this matter, there
was proclamation made, for revoking such of the Kings Subjects as were already
at <hi>Montz;</hi> as also, inhibition for any other to repair thither, upon forfeiture of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54478:121"/>
life, lands and goods; and another Edict also was published, to prohibite the
Kings subjects not to buy such goods as lately were taken by them of Flushing.
The King is so far forward in this matter, that no disguising will serve, neither
her Majestie in policy, considering underhand those that are gone to Flushing
may suffer the cause to be abandoned, especially for that her Majestie lately, to
the grief of as many as love her both at home and abroad, hath forborn the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
use of the remedy offered to bridle the Queen of Scots practises, which
received there from <hi>Spain</hi> 
                     <abbr>13</abbr> in talk with me about this matter, shewed me,
that he hath declared his opinion since his return, that it behoveth both his
Honour and the Queen my Mistris, to consult joyntly in the maintenance of the
Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> enterprize; for that otherwise he saw many reasons to induce
him to think, that it would be dangerous to them both, specially for her
Mejestie, considering the practises that raign in her Countrey. And so ceasing
to trouble your Lordship any further at this present, I most humbly take my
leave.</p>

                  <p>There arrived of late here a Gentleman that is come from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from

money, if he will break with <hi>Spain;</hi> that he is content that the King shall be a
mean to accord the difference betwixt him and the Venetians. Other particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
he brings, but these be those of most importance. The Venetians, as I
hear, do find themselves agrieved with the King of <hi>Spains</hi> dealing towards
them, therefore it is thought, that they will grow to accord with the Turk, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to understand, that the eighth of this moneth the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> passed the River of <hi>Rhine,</hi> at a place beneath <hi>Cullen,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Asburgh,</hi> and that about the fifteenth or sixteenth he determined to pass
the River of <hi>Mose,</hi> at a place called <hi>Ruremond,</hi> which Town, with another cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Venlo.</hi> scituate upon the said River, is at his devotion. This news is brought
to this Court by a Gentleman sent hither by the Prince himself: His Army
consisteth of seven thousand horse, and fifty Ensigns of footmen. It is thought
they will march towards <hi>Holland,</hi> with intention to plant Garisons in such Towns
as are revolted to him; as also to receive money there towards the payment of
his Army. It is thought here for certain, that <hi>Ianlis</hi> hath either fought, or is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in safety at <hi>Montz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon advertisement come lately out of <hi>Italy,</hi> that Don <hi>Iohn d' Austria</hi> is
not yet departed, they make fair weather with the Ambassador of <hi>Spain,</hi> who
in outward shew doth bear them in hand he believeth all they say. There is great
suspicion that Florence <abbr>4</abbr> is underhand enemy to these wars, but dare not
shew for fear of A. who doth very much affect it, otherwise all had quail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long sithence. Rome <abbr>3</abbr> is not free from suspicion. There is lately arrived
a Gentleman sent hither from the King Ambassador at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who
giveth to his very friends these particularities: First, that the <hi>Turk</hi> maketh
great preparations by Sea for the next year, greater then any of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
ever made.</p>
                  <p>That he offereth the King here great sums of money to break with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he remitteth unto the Kings hands the according of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Other particularities he giveth out, but these are
of greatest weight. As I learn, the Venetians are so weary of <hi>Spains</hi> promises,
as they will not be loth to agree upon any hard conditions. From <hi>Antwerp</hi> they
write, that <hi>Chiapini Vitelli</hi> in viewing <hi>Montz,</hi> hath received an Harquebush
shot, and is in danger of his life. The Ambassador of <hi>Florence</hi> doth what he
can to excuse the loan of W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> unto the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi> It is thought for the
help of this matter, that his Majestie can be content to lend asmuch to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
party. And so for forreign news referring your Honour to the Italian Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents,
I most humbly take my leave.</p>

such incertainties as I have set down in the inclosed occurents. Such of
the Religion as before slept in security, begin now to awake and to see their
danger, and do therefore conclude, that unless this enterprise in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
have good success, their cause groweth desperate. They have therefore of
late sent to the King who is absent from home, to shew him, than if the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> quail, it shal not lie in him to maintain him in his protection by vertue of
his Edict: they desire him therefore out of hand to resolve upon something that
may be of his assistance, offering themselves to imploy therein their lives, lands
and goods. They see by the assistance given on the other side, as by the <hi>Pope,
Florence, Triers, Baviers</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lleyn,</hi> who are not otherwise interessed in the
<hi>Low Countrey,</hi> or in this Cause, but in respect of Religion, who proceed roundly
and resolutely in the matter, that unlesse her Majesty and the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi>
in like sort joyn with this Crown, there is great doubt what shall be the even of
this enterprise: They have therefore requested me to desire your Lordship, as
you tender Gods glory and her Majesties safety, to see if you can induce her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
overture first to be made by the King in this behalf, to joyn with him in yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
assistance. They think to make the—so that they might be in some assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that her Majesty would give ear thereto. They have also dispatched one of
late to such Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> as favour the Cause, to provoke them to proceed
more resolutely and roundly in this matter, laying before them the evident dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that otherwise will ensue. By one lately come from thence they understand
that the said Princes begin to see the danger, and are well bent to do any thing
that may tend to remedy. The parties above written desire to know with some
speed how her Majesty will incline to the said overture, for that thereafter they
are to direct their affairs. As I was writing I received the copie of a letter sent
from <hi>Mounts,</hi> which I send to your Lordship here inclosed, by the which you

                  <p>YOur Lordship by these inclosed occurrents may perceive that <hi>Ianlys</hi> is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,

first entry into the Country, a mean to discourage him and to encourage the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
How much his well doing or evill doing importeth us, I need not say any
thing to your Lordship, the thing being so apparant: how dangerous it were to
suffer him to quail, it is no less evident, how little hope there is he shall receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
from us, especially from the news of this overthrow, it grieves me not a little
to think of it, considering what dependeth thereon, and I hope God will make
my fear vain.</p>
                  <p>To suffer him to miscarry, knowing our own danger, were to lack both policy
and magnanimity. We cannot deny, but upon that that lately hath been
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54478:123"/>
discovered, that if God had not raised up the Prince of Orange to have entertain'd
Spain, a dangerous fire ere this time had bin kindled in our own home. To assist
him therefore, is to assist our selves, for that we are to run one fortune with him, the
difference is, that by miscarrying, the mischief shal first touch him, and then conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
as many of us as profess one Religion with him, for the supply that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

                     </gap>eal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiwise,
we do things underhand, and thereby do discover both lack of zeal and
courage. No Councellors enterprise accompanied with fear had ever good success,
for there can be no greater enemy to sound councel then fear. The Gentlemen of
the Religion here, since the late overthrow of <hi>Ianlis,</hi> weighing what dependeth
upon the Pr: of Orange overthrow, have made demonstration to the King, that
his enterprise lacking good success, it shal not then he in his power to maintain
his Edict. They therefore desire him to weigh whether it were better to have
forein war with advantage, or inward war to the ruine of himself and his Estate:
The King being not here, his answer is not yet received. They hope to receive
some such resolution as the danger of the cause requireth; in the mean time the
M. desired me to move your Lordship to deal with her Majesty to know whether
she upon overture to be made to the King, cannot be content to joyn with him
in assistance of this poor Prince, seeing that as well in Estate as Religion, it doth
so neerly touch her. Surely though it import the King very much to look to it,
yet it importeth more her Majestie, who is to look for nothing else (Spain over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
this brunt) then the extremity of such mischiefs as he can work her. (My
good Lord, therefore as you never lack'd to further such causes as concern Gods
glory and her Majesties safety; so I do not doubt but that you will with that care
and courage which this weighty cause requireth, yield what aid and assistance you
possibly may. And so leaving further to trouble your Honor at this present, I
most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>TRusty and well-beloved, we greet you well. Where at the being here with
us of the D. of Montmorency, he &amp; <hi>du Foix,</hi> after their other ordinary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ratification of the Treaty passed over, did many times very earnestly deal
with us, and in like manner with sundry of our Councel, to move us to incline to
an offer of marriage; which the French K. and Q. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>other willed them to make to
us for the D. of <hi>Alanzon,</hi> and that we found the matter somewhat strange, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
some things past not in good order, as you know in the matter of like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for Mr. <hi>de Anjon,</hi> wherein the said <hi>Mont.</hi> and his Colleague laboured much
to satisfie us, but especially considering the youngness of the years of the Duke of
Alanson being compared to ours; so for those respects, although we could give
them no answer of comfort to content them, yet such was their importunacy
in reciting of many reasons and arguments to move us not to mislike thereof,
in respect as well of the strength of the friendship which this amity should
give to the continuance of this last League and Confederation, as also of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54478:123"/>
of the said D. of Alanzon for his excellent vertues and good conditions
which they alleadge to be in him, with sundry other arguments tending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the difficulties, and to gain our contentation and liking of the said Duke.
And in them, after their many conferences had both with us and with our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
when we perceived them very much perplexed to see our strangeness from
assenting to their desires, and how loath they were to have any flat denial; we were
advised to forbear from making of a plain refusal, and to expect the return of the
Lord Admiral, by whom, and by others of his company, we might understand
what might be further conceived of the personage and conditions of the said
Duke. And so our answer to them at their departure was this, That we found
such difficulties in this matter, specially for the difference of his age, as presently
we could not digest the same; but such was the importunacy of our own subjects
of all estates to have us to marry, as we would forbear to give any such resolute
answer as might miscontent the said Ambassador; and as we knew would much
grieve our people at this time, and so we would take some further time to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
of the matter. And after one months space we would make a direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the French King, which also we would first communicate to the said D. of
Montmorency, to be by him, if he so would, delivered over to the said King. And
so with this answer they departed; whereupon after the return of our Admiral,
we have considered with him, and with some others that were there, by whom
we find that indeed the conditions and the qualities of the said D. as farr forth as
they could by their observation gather, or by report of others understand, were
nothing inferior to M. <hi>de Anjou,</hi> but rather better to be liked; but as to his visage
and favour, every body doth declare the same to be far inferior, and that specially
for the blemishes that the small pox hath wrought therein, so as his young years
considered, the doubtfulness of the liking of his favour joyned therewith, wherin
no body that hath seen him can otherwise report, although otherwise to all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
he is commended before his brother; we cannot indeed bring our mind to
like of this offer, specially finding no other great commodity offered to us with
him, whereby the absurdity that in the general opinion of the world might grow,
to commend this our choice after so many refusal of others of great worthiness,
might be counterprised, or in some manner recompenced. Wherefore according
to our answer made to the said Ambassador, we have determined that you shall
in our answer made to the said Ambassador, we have determined that you shall
in our name say as followeth to Montmorency. Or if he shall desire that you
your self (considering the answer is not plausible) shall make it to the King, then
you shal so do, requiring him to be present, and to move the King and his mother
to interpret the same to the best, as indeed we mean it plainly and friendly; and
then you shal say that we have considered of the matter of the Kings offer unto
us of M. <hi>de Alanzon</hi> in marriage. And for the same we do most earnestly thank
the King and the Q. Mother, knowing manifestly that the same proceedeth of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
manifest good will, knowing perfect continuance of the amity lately contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
between us by this last Treaty. And considering we have great desire to
have the same amity continued and strengthned, we are very sorry to find so great
difficulties in this matter that should be a principal band thereof, as we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
the inconveniences of the same, by reason of the difference of our ages to
assent thereunto, praying the K. and his Mother to assure themselves that there
is no lack of desire in us to continue, yea if it might be to increase this amity that
maketh us think of the difficulties of this offer, otherwise then we think all
others do consider thereof, and most conceive, which proceedeth almost
onely of the difference of the age of Monsieur <hi>de Alanzon,</hi> and ours a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that cannot be remedied, either by the King his brother that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
the match, or by us, so as the lack of not perfecting this band of amity
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54478:124"/>
after this manner, cannot be imputed to either of us, nor to the party himself,
of whose conditions and vertues, truely you may say we hear so well, as we
cannot but esteem him very much, and think him very well worthy to have as
good fortune by marriage as he, or any other might have by us. And you may
say, if you so see cause, that although we might have known thus much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his age when the Ambassadors were here, and therefore might at that
time have given them that answer, and not thus to have deferred it untill this
time, yet to satisfie the King therein, you shall say, True it is, that although
we our selves were of this mind from the beginning, to think the match incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for his age; yet at the being here of the Ambassador, we were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
laboured by our Councel, and also by our Estates then assembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,
in laying open before us the necessity of our marriage, both for our
own comfort, and also for the weal of the Realm; and some of them alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto us that there would be no such difficulty in this matter of his years,
but the evil opinion that might be conceived thereof in the world to our lack,
might percase be recompenced with some other matter of advantage to us in
our Realm, in the sight also of the world, as being overcome with the importuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of their reasons, we did yield to take some further consideration of the matter;
and to prove whether in som time we could work our mind to som other purpose,
or whether any such further matter might be offered with this match, as might
counterpoise in the judgement of the world, the inconvenience of the difference
of the age: But so it is, that in all this time, we neither can find our mind
altered, nor yet hear of any other thing that might countervail the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but so for observing of our promise, and especially because we mean to
deal plainly with our good Brother and the Queen his Mother, we do make
them this Answer, That surely we cannot find our self void of doubt and
misliking to accept this offer, which is principally for the difference of his years,
allowing nevertheless of his worthiness for his vertuous and honourable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as much as we can require in any Prince to be our husband. And so we
pray the King and his Mother, that the Duke himself may understand our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be of his worthiness. And for the great good will we understand that
he hath born to us, we do assure him that we shall for the same, esteem him at
all times hereafter, as well as any other Prince of his Estate, reserving only the
band of love that ought to accompany marriage.</p>

                     </gap> with us also of the

doth alter our said Answer; but in respect of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the desire we
see to be in the King and the Queen Mother, and specially in the Duke of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanson</hi>
himself, not only by their Letters to our selves, but by the Dukes Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the French Ambassador, we have thought convenient to inlarge our
answer in some part to lay open before the King our conceit in the matter,
which you shall say we do of very sincerity of good will to be answerable with
their earnest dealing with us to be nevertheless considered and ordered by them
as they shall think best.</p>
                  <p>After you have used this kind of speech to them, you shall say, That when
we think of this matter, we find no other principal impediment, but in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of the ages, and the case of Religion. And as to this which is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
about Religion, we do not think that such, but the form and substance
of our Religion being well made known to the Duke, there is no such cause to
doubt, but by Gods goodness the same may be removed to the satisfaction of
us both. But as to the other which concerneth the person of the Duke, of his
age, and otherwise, for as much as the difficulties thereof may seem to consist rather
in opinion then in matter, indeed we do thereto thus yield to think that in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
when the persons are to think one of the other, nothing doth so much
rule both parties, as to have their own opinions satisfied; and seeing that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
thereof nothing can make so full a satisfaction to us for our opinion, nor
percase in him of us, in respect of the opinion he may conceive of the excess
of our years above his, as that either of us might by some convenient means
with our own eyes, satisfie our own conceits: A matter we know somewhat
difficult, but yet such as in like cases hath been yielded to us, though by other
impediments not perfected. And nevertheless, how this may be granted or
allowed by the King and the Queen Mother to be done without offence, we do
leave it to them in whom we perceive by our Ambassadors speech their stay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
when the Duke himself both by his Letters to the Ambassador, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
hath shewed himself thereto disposed, that is, to come hither in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for the which we cannot but greatly esteem his love and affection that he
beareth to us.</p>
                  <p>This you may say, is as much as we can conceive of the matter; and if it were
not for the desire we have to deal plainly in this matter, being so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by the great good will we find in them there, we would not in that sort
propound such a matter, neither do we otherwise propound it, but that it may
be friendly interpreted; and not to conceive that thereby we mean any abuse
to the disgrace of the Duke, whom we have great cause to love and esteem,
but that surely in this sort our opinion by sight may be satisfied, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we perceive cannot be by report of any others, for that none of our own
dare adventure to deliver their advice for our own liking of him as the case is,
we plainly affirm, that so as the difficulty of the matter of Religion be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for, and that all other points concerning the marriage, may be performed
as was communed upon in the person of <hi>Monsieur de Anjou,</hi> we find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o cause
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54478:125"/>
of doubt, but that the King and Queen Mother shall obtain their desire. And
after you have declared thus much; and because it is likely that they will object,
that either this purpose of his coming over to us cannot be granted, in respect
of the honour of the King, for that heretofore no like usage hath been in the
Marriages of the children of France with any strange Prince, or that they
shall doubt that this is by us in such sort propounded, as thereby to increase our
own reputation without any intent to marry him, though his person might not
mislike us. To such objections you may answer thus.</p>
                  <p>To the first you may say as of your self, that you are not so acquainted with
their own stories, and with the marriage of the children of France; yet you
dare affirm that you know there can be no example shewed of the like of this;
that is, that either elder Son of France, or any younger was at any time to be
matched in Marriage with such a Prince, having such Kingdoms as we have, by
whom such an advancement might have grown as may by Marriage with us,
both to the Duke himself, and to the King and Crown of France; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this special cause can have no former example answerable to rule this; but
this ought to be followed with all manner of means, and all respects set
aside.</p>
                  <p>And as to the second part that may be objected, you shall affirm certainly in
our name, that we have no meaning hereby to gain any particular estimation to
our self, but do plainly and simply seek hereby to procure the satisfaction of
our own mind in this difficulty, as touching his person, wherein no other of
our own dare deal with us, nor we can otherwise be satisfied. And for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Dukes estimation and honour, we shall be as carefull as his own
brother the King shall be. And therefore you shall conclude, that howsoever
we have thus propounded our own conception in the matter, we desire not that
the King or the Queen Mother should do or consent to any thing that might any
wise seem for them dishonourable to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>Finally, if you shall perceive that they shall stick only upon the reputation
of his honour, that is, to come, and not be allowed for his person, you may, as
of your self, propound it as you see cause, that the matter of Religion may
be outwardly so left in dispence, as the breaking off, if any so should follow,
either on his part, or on ours, may to the world be thereto imputed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that his coming may be secretly and privatly, without any outward pomp
or shew, whereof we leave the consideration to themselves.</p>

                  <p>IT may please you to advertise her Majestie, that according to the direction
of her Letters of the 23 of July, I imparted unto M. <hi>Montmorency,</hi> her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he said he was sorry that the resolution fell out to be such, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how necessary it was, the state of the time considered, to have some
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54478:126"/>
sound amity, and perfect intelligence between the two Crowns, which could no
way have so well come to pass, as by the acceptation of the alliance offered; and
as, saith he, I am generally sorry for it, so particularly in respect of the good will
I bear towards her Majestie, whom I see in great peril without this help.</p>
                  <p>To the second he said, That though <hi>Monsieur le Duc</hi> was well inclined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
yet in respect of the danger that commonly ensueth by enterviews, he
could in no respect give his consent and advice, unless he were assured that there
might grow a liking.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon I desired him that he would so deal with the King and his Mother;
and that this her Majesties resolution might be by their Majesties accepted in
good part; wherein he promised to do his endeavour.</p>
                  <p>After conference had with him, I procured audience the next day, thinking
it expedient to let him have a daies respit to deal with their Majesties to frame
their minds to the well interpreting of her Majesties resolution.</p>
                  <p>The next day repairing to the Court, and finding the King occupied at the
appointed hour of my access; I began with the Queen Mother, and first shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her according to the Contents of the first Letter, what was her Majesties
resolution concerning the offer propounded by the <hi>M. Mount</hi> and the <hi>du de
Foix</hi> on their behalf. To the which she answered, That she could not but be
sorry for the same, for that she saw it the only means to establish a perfect ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between the two Crowns. Notwithstanding (saith she) that the same will
not take place, the King my Son is determined in any case to continue good
amity with the Queen your Mistress.</p>
                  <p>Then I proceeded to the Contents of the second Letter, and shewed her that
her Majestie upon the receit of certain Letters from the King, her self, and
<hi>Duc de Anjou:</hi> Seeing their great and earnest desire of the proceeding of this
match, had enlarged her answer, moved thereto by an earnest and sincere
good will to shew her self answerable to their earnest dealing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
willed me to tell their Majesties, that in her opinion the principal impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
consisted in the difference of their ages, and the cause of Religion; for
the latter her Majestie hoped that the same might be so accorded, as might
be to the satisfaction of both parties.</p>
                  <p>For the first: For as much as the difficulty might seem rather to consist in
opinion, then substance; her Majestie desireth them to consider in Marriages,
a satisfaction of the opinions of the parties that were to match, was most
necessary and requisite; and that therefore seeing that there could grow no
satisfaction that way, but by an enterview, her Majestie could yield thereto,
if they should so like of it.</p>
                  <p>To this she answered, That if she were assured that upon the enterview
there might grow a liking, she would most willingly give her consent;
but for as much as experience taught, that of the meeting of Princes there
followeth rather miscontentment then good liking, she should not in respect
of the danger therof, yield her consent, for that she would be loath, and the
King her Sonne; and she desiring nothing more then good amity with her, that
there should fall out any occasion of miscontentment.</p>
                  <p>In the end, after long speech had of great desire she had of this match,
and of the great good will and love the Duke beareth to her Majestie, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth,
that she hoped in time, considering how necessary it was for her
to marry, as well for her own safety, as for the benefit of her Subjects, that
God would so dispose her heart, as she should prefer publique before private
Affairs.</p>
                  <p>This in effect is the sum of that which passed from her at that time: and so
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54478:126"/>
departing from her to the King, I used the like speech unto him, as before
unto her: at whose hands I received like answer; which I suppose proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon conference with the M. before hand, and therefore they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in speech, I forbare to make double repetition.</p>
                  <p>Touching their proceedings herein Flanders matters, it may please you
to advertise her Majestie, That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pon advertisement from thence, that her
Majestie meant to revoke such of her Subjects as presently are in Flanders. The
King here, through the perswasion of his Mother, advised thereto by such
as incline to Spain, is disswaded from overt dealing in that cause, who before
was very resolute in the matter. But now for as much as it is here conceived,
that without her Majesties assistance he shall not be able to bear the brunt of so
puissant an enemy. The matter remaineth in suspence as yet, what will be
done: Commonly it is given out the King will not meddle.</p>
                  <p>Such as do wish well unto her Majesty, and are of the best judgment, to see
how much it importeth her repose, the good or ill successe of that poor Prince,
do hope that the advertisement of the revocation is false, her Majesty having
so lately discovered the King of Spains malice towards her, and therefore do
think her inclined in policie rather to assist then discourage. They say that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can more hinder the poor Princes enterprise, then the said Revocation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his first entry into the Country, for that the people who were otherwise
well inclined towards him, and are fearfull of nature, will thereby grow more
fearfull, and so forbear to do that that may further the enterprise: because I
know not her Majesties intention in this case, I forbear to affirm or deny any
thing in this behalf. For my own private opinion having been acquainted with
the malice of the Spaniards, I cannot, as duty bindeth me, but wish him further
removed in neighbourhood from her Majesty. I pray God therefore to direct
her Majesties heart, that may be for her Majesties safety. And so leaving to
trouble your Honor any further at this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>SIR, in this my private Letter I thought good to tell you, that how coldly
soever you are affected towards marriage, we mean not here to give you
over, but do think that time may work somewhat to the satisfying of our desire.
They think in the end, necessity must make you yield thereto in respect of your
safety, which is the best ground of the hope they have, they know well enough
the coldness of your affection, and therefore they hope that force will bring that
to pass which love cannot. This Sir, for marriage matter, I have earnestly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
both to the Lord Treasurer, and the Earl of Leicester, to procure a stay of
the revocation of those that are imployed in Flanders, without the which the
whole enterprise is in hazard, in respect of the discouragement that will grow
thereby. And surely if the same take not good success, it is evident what will
be our danger to as many as will list to see; I need not use towards you any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
to put to your helping hand, which is forward enough in this case, as
one that foreseeth the mischief that otherwise will follow.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you write now that the Scots began somwhat to incline to an absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence;
it seemeth very strange, considering the issue of our Parliament, and the
late inlargement of the Queen of Scots liberty, unless the Scots mean there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
to establish the Government in their Queen: if her Majesty had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
the provision of her safety by her subjects in Parliament, and not so soon
have yielded to any enlargement, those Scotch matters had been ere this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded;
but we use to build with one hand, and overthrow with another: I can
rather lament it then hope after any remedy. And therefore to God I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it. And so leaving further to trouble your Honour at this present, I most
humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>I Refer your Honour to Sir <hi>Th. Smiths</hi> Letters touching that which hath past

the offer propounded by the M. <hi>Montmorency</hi> and M. <hi>de Foix.</hi> They ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
could be induced to hazard an enterview, if they thought there were any
earnest intention in her Majesty to marry; but the doubt thereof maketh them
stay to condiscend in that behalf; notwithstanding they mean not to give over
the matter utterly, but do hope that necessity in time may induce her Majesty
in respect of her safety, and the gratifying of her subjects to yield her consent,
seeing that the difficulty consisteth in opinion chiefly; I do what I can to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
this opinion in them, considering the broken state of Europe, and how
tickle her Majesty standeth: if by an enterview there might grow any good,
I think I could easily bring it to pass; but the experience I have had how
this case of marriage is subject to many things, maketh me to proceed warily,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54478:127"/>
according as I shall receive direction at your Lordships hands, who shall guide
my doings in this behalf.</p>
                  <p>Touching Flanders matters, the King had proceeded to an open dealing,
had he not received advertisement out of England, that her Majestie meant
to revoke such of her subjects as are presently in Flanders; whereupon such of
his Councel here as incline to Spain, have put the Queen Mother in such a fear,
that the enterprise cannot but miscarry without the assistance of England, as
she with tears had disswaded the King for the time, who otherwise was very
resolute.</p>
                  <p>Thus your Lordship seeth how the bruit of your fear there, hath bred
fear here; whereof I fear there will follow fearfull effects, unless God put to
his helping hand.</p>
                  <p>The Admiral in this brunt, whose mind is invincible, and foreseeth
what is like to insue, doth not now give over, but layeth before the King his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril
if the Prince of Orange quail, or at the least if the matter by composition
may not be induced to that good pass, as the Spaniards may be removed further
off, and the Country restored to its liberty, and yet remain under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Spain. And though he cannot obtain what were requisite and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the advancement of the Cause, yet doth he obtain somewhat in confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with him: He desired me to tell your Lordship, that there is nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of himself, that he desireth more after long troubles, unless he saw the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
great and evident to as many as profess the Gospel, as also particularly to the
King his Master, and to the Q. Majestie my Mistress, whom he is bound to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and serve during his life; and if these Low-Country matters be not reduced
to some good issue, he would not now expose himself to new perils. But the case
now standing as it doth, and foreseeing the mischief that will follow, he saith he
should be a Traitor to God and to his Country, and unthankful to her Maj. if
he should forbear to do what lieth in him to prevent the same; and for that he
knoweth your Lordship doth concur with him in the like desire, he doth most
earnestly desire you to be a mean to stay her Maj. revocation of those that be in
Flanders, which thing will breed no less incouragement to the enemies, then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to those that seek to further this cause, the welldoing whereof (saith
he) if I do not mistake, doth as much import her Maj. as any one thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto her since her coming to the Crown, and therefore requireth rather
assistance then hinderance. Other particularities he willed me to impart unto your
Lordship, which for that I would be loath to trouble your Lordship with Cypher,
I have desired Mr. <hi>Killegrew,</hi> to make you understand the same. And so leaving
to impart to your Honour any thing further at this time, I most humbly take my

                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to understand, that upon advertisement com from
the parties, that her Maj. meant to revoke such as are imployed in the Low-Countries
of her subjects, the King here through the perswasions of such as are
inclined to Spain, is grown cold, who before was very forward, in so much as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
were granted ready to have been sealed, for the leavying of men in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Provinces; but herein nothing prevailed so much as the tears of his mother,
who without the Army of England cannot consent to grow to any open dealing.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54478:128"/>
And because they are, as I suppose, assured by their Ambassadors that her Majesty
will not intermeddle, they cannot be induced to make any overture. Thus your
L. sees that fear &amp; mistrust, unles God sets to his helping hand, is like to overthrow
all. To think that Spain will suffer us to overcome this brunt, to live long in peace,
hath no reason for ground. To seek now reconcilement with him in this his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y,
there is likelihood he will yield thereto, for no man can speak fairer then
a Spaniard when he is underfoot: but to think when the necessity is gone, that
he will forget what is past, surely he knows not the Spanish nature that is of that
opinion. For the greatness of France, I see no such ambition here why we should
have cause much to fear it; Pleasure and youth will not suffer us to take profit
of advantages, and those who rule under us are fearfull and irresolute. How per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
the Admiral is, who foreseeth the mischief that is like to follow, if assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
come not from above, your Lordship may easily guess. And surely to say
truth, he never shewed greater magnanimity, nor never was better followed nor
more honoured of those of the Religion then now he is, which doth not a little
appale the enemies. In this storm he doth not give over the helm; he layeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King and his Councel the peril and danger of his estate, and though he
cannot obtain what he would, yet doth he obtain somewhat from him. I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
to desire your Lordship to hold him excused in that he writeth not, for
that at this time he is overwhelmed with affairs. Furthermore he desired me
from him, that if her Majesty proceeded in revocation of those her subjects in
Flanders, it will breed such discouragement in those of the Country that are well
affected to the cause, as it will to all likelihood hazard the whole enterprise. He
therefore desireth your Lordship, as you wish well to the cause and to the safety
of her Majesty, whose repose (whatsoever is said to the contrary) dependeth
upon the good success of this enterprise, to procure a stay to be made of the said
revocation. Touching <hi>Flushing,</hi> he tels me that the matter shall be ended as
there shall grow no just cause of jealousie, which shall shortly appear by some
offer that shall be made unto her Majesty of the same by those that are now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors
of it. Other particularities he willed me to impart unto your Lordship,
which I requested Mr. <hi>Killigrew</hi> to make your Lordship acquainted withall, for
the avoiding of the tediousness of Cypher.</p>
                  <p>Touching the acceptation here of the answer unto the offer propounded by

so misreported them, as we cannot think you did, or else the King mistook your
words; and that where you were by us commanded to say, that the cause was
very difficile (which we think you did) for so do our letters plainly direct you,
it is likely that the King understood it, as was thought you had said, impossible.
And so the Ambassador resident will not have us in any wise think but that the
King or Q. mother mistook it. Upon their further dealing in these matters at
sundry times, who never omitted any opportunity to advance the same, it was at
length by them propounded to us, that we should be content to accord that the
Duke might come hither, and that all other Articles which were treated upon of
the Duke d'Anjou might remain good for the Duke d'Alanson, saving that the
difficulty in Religion might rest in suspence, and be determined upon his coming
hither as we two should agree; whereby they seemed to provide, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
which might ensue of the enterview, if the principal matter took no
place, might be rejected to the article of Religion; and so the honour of the
Duke, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto we were loth to make any direct answer, but remember it unto them
what words both the D. of Montmorencie and the Q. mother used to you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the great misliking of an enterview, as it seemed by their discourse of the
inconvenience what hath followed of those enterviews: but what those be, and
whether they know of any like, our persons and other circumstances considered,
we cannot tell; and therefore we seem very loth that there should any motion
come from us of any enterview, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t the principal matter should not take place,
and therefore we can make no certainty. There might indeed such inconvenience
follow as hath been by them remembred; and yet being still pressed by the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

content to affirm for necessity of our Realm, though not for any particular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     </gap> of our Councel, so well to shew them truly that we did continue in the

and Q. mother to be so ordered, as whatsoever might hereof succeed, no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience

should ensue; and so with some large speech to that end, we did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that we durst not desire the enterview for the same reason. After which
answer made, and as it seemed by them very well allowed, they required some
brief note of the points of the matters might be given them in writing, which
we did cause to be conceived and delivered agreeable to the Copy that herewith
we send you. And howsoever they shall make report of our answer, we would
that you should not omit to persist directly in this; but loth we would be that
the Duke her son should come hither, if the matter should not take place, lest
more offence might thereof follow then we thought meet concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the amity that is between us. And yet our meaning is not hereby, that
they should think that we are not so disposed to marry, or that we are determined
to mislike of the matter aforehand, or not disposed at all to allow of him; but that
only we are fearful, that if there should happen at his coming some cause of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
or forbearing to accept him, which surely to us is uncertain, and without
sight cannot be made certain, then some great unkindness should follow by their
misconceiving of our dealing, where now there is no cause of kindness and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
whereof we do not earnestly desire to have continuance, without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in that behalf. As you shall find this matter likely to proceed, so we would
have you not only to advertise us, but to have good regard that if you find any
scruple thereof, that great unkindness shall arise of his coming if the matter shall
not take place, that before any preparation be there made of his coming, you
do advertise us with speed, for otherwise the unkindness may happen to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in respect of the charges.</p>

We may say that the Lover will do little, if he will not take the pains once to
see his Love, but she must first say yea before he see her, or she him. Twenty
ways might be devised why he might come over and be welcome, and possibly
do more in an hour then he may in two years. <hi>Cupido ille qui vincit omnia, in

is, that certain more that would have gone over from hence were stayed, for
fear of too much disorder for lack of some good head, and wise and expert Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
but they that be there be neither yet revoked nor discouraged, although
the Duke of Alva by letters this last week required that they should be revoked,
but he is gently answered with a dilatory and doubtful answer. If you there do

And I pray you who hath removed from thence with any authority a society or

for that matter.</p>
                  <p>How far the Scots have gone, you may perceive by this inclosed; both the
parties have subscribed and sealed to it, and both the parties have written letters
of thanks to her Majesty for the pains taken by the Marshal of Barwick, and have
promised to stand to that order, which is very honorable both to the King there,
and to our Queen here; and not dishonorable to the Scotish King, that in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie
such a noble personage should accord to make quietness in his Realm.
Thus I bid you most heartily farewell.</p>

you I see no cause to doubt, for in that matter consisteth the only apparent stay.

                  <p>IT may please your Honor to advertise her Majesty that yesterday I sent my
Secretary unto Q. Mother, willing her in my name, first to render unto her
and to the Kings Majesty most humble thanks for the great care it pleased them
to have of my safety, and the preservation of the <hi>English</hi> Nation in this last tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
whereof I assured them I would not fail to make honorable report unto
the Queens Majesty my Mistres. And furthermore, forasmuch as there were
divers reports made of the late execution here, and that I would be very loath to
credit reports, that it would please their Majesties to send me the very truth
thereof, to the end I might accordingly advertise the Queens Majesty my
Mistress. To the first she said, that the King her son and she gave especiall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
that good regard were had of me and all <hi>English</hi> men, as that
thing which tended to the preservation of the good amity between the King her
Sonne, and the Queens Majesty my Mistress. And that if I could devise
any better means for the better safeguard, that I would but give them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
thereof.</p>
                  <p>To the second she said, that she doubted not but that <hi>Monsieur la Mott</hi>
had long since advertised the Queens Majestie of the late accident here. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
to gratifie me, that she would cause Secretary <hi>Pinnart</hi> to send me
an abstract of that, which before the King her son had sent to his Ambassador
there resident, the which also I send you here inclosed.</p>
                  <p>This being in effect that which passed between her and my Secretary. And

                  <p>MAy it please your Honour to advertise her Maj. that the first of this month
I was sent for by the King; and to the end I might pass with the more safety,

                        </gap>es,</hi> accompanied with a dozen
other Gentlemen. At my access unto his Maj. he shewed me, that he sent for me
to make me understand, that whereas men might judge diversly of the late execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who were not advertised of the ground of his proceedings in that behalf; he
had therefore for the satisfying of the world, caused the process to be made of the
Admiral, and the rest of his Conspirators, which so soon as the same should be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
he would not fail to send unto her Maj. his good sister, whom he did assure
himself, would interpret in good part his doings, he being constrained, to his great
grief, to do that which he did for his safety sake; which if he had not done, both
he himself, his Mother and Brethren had been in danger of their lives. Furthermore
he shewed me, that he desired nothing more then to continue, or rather to increase
amity with her Majestie, and therefore hoped that she would not take occasion
upon this late proceeding, to suspect the contrary; for (saith he) on my honour,
and in the word of a Prince, I have no other meaning. To this I answered, that
her Majestie could not but accept in very good part the sending of the process, as
one that would be glad to understand the ground of the matter: And if by the said
process it should appear that they were guilty, none should be more glad of the
punishment of them then her Maj. who preferred his safety before any particular
subject of what estate or Religion soever they were. For the other part I shewed
him, that I hoped his Maj. who had made a straiter league with England then any
of his Progenitors, would not now be drawn easily to make light account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
considering the profit that might grow to both the Crowns by the same.</p>
                  <p>Then I made him understand, that three of our Nation were slain, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
were spoiled; for the which he shewed himself to be very sorry, and said, that
if the parties offendors could be produced, there should exemplary justice be used.
I shewed his Majestie it would be hard to produce them, the disorder being so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
the sword being committed to the common people. In the end, after thanks
given for the care he had of my safety, I departed from him, and was conducted
to Q. Mother, who used like speech, saving that she shewed me that the K. meaning
was, the heads of the Conspirators being now taken away, to continue his Edicts,
and that every man should live in repose and liberty of his Conscience. For that
it was suspected that <hi>le Mote</hi> was staied in <hi>England,</hi> I shewed their Maj. that it was
the 20 of the last before he departed, and that I hoped upon his return, they should
rest very well satisfied with such answer as he receiveth at her Majesties hands.
And so leaving further to trouble you at this present, I most humbly take leave.</p>

incourage me thereunto. And as for the marriage, I had some cause to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the matter was truly meant or no, for divers reasons. To that he answered,
that it were good the same scruples were taken away; and therefore asked me,
if I would be content to let the Queen Mother understand the reasons that made
me so to think. To the which I answered, I could be very well content, if it shall
please her Majestie to send for me, that I might communicate them unto her.
Thereupon she sent for me, and at my access she told me, that she understood
by <hi>Mannesiere,</hi> that there rested in me some scruple touching the Kings and her
sincere meaning concerning the late marriage propounded, for the which she was
sorry; for that in respect of the place I held, I might yield no small hinderance to
the same: She therefore desired me, to know the reasons that moved me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
to which she doubted not but to yield such answer as should breed satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in me. Thereupon I shewed her, that true it was, that as it becometh a good
servant, the jealousie of my Mistris's honour and surety, made me to use some such
speech towards her, whereof when she should understand the reasons, I hoped she
would interpret the same in good part: Then I shewed her, that this late strange
accident had bred in men dangerous discourses, opinions and mistrusts amongst
the which I was not free from my doubts and suspicions. And as touching this
scruple of the Kings and her sincere meaning touching this marriage, I had three
reasons that moved me thereto: The first, the violating of the late Edict, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
severity used against those of the Religion.</p>
                  <p>The second, the strange dealing in the first match propounded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:54478:131"/>
The third, certain Discourses given out of the Conquest of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the first, I shewed her, that the chiefest causes that moved the Queen
my Mistris to make account of the Amity of this Crown, was, that the King
suffered certain of his Subjects to enjoy, by the vertue of this Edict, exercise of
the same Religion her Majestie professed, which was the chiefest ground of the
League, which being taken away, the Amity could not but grow doubtful. And
this matter of an enterview, suspected to be but to serve for an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Touching the second, I shewed her, that this late accident giveth vehement
suspicion, that the first match propounded, was also but a kind of entertainment
to abuse those of the Religion.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Discourses, though they did proceed from mean personages, and
that I hoped their Maj. were free from any such intentions, yet the strangeness
of the late accident could not altogether rest free from suspicion. To this she
generally replyed, That she hoped, that the late League was made, not with
the Admiral, and those of the Religion, but with the King; and therefore she
trusted, that though her son for his surety sake, had justly executed the heads
of the Religion, yet the said league should continue in his perfect strength, for
performation whereof, there should never be found lack in the King. You
know (saith she) that there was good amity between King <hi>Francis</hi> and King
<hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and yet they favoured not the Pope alike. You know also
(saith she) that notwithstanding the difference of Religion between my late
husband and King Edward, yet the same did not impeach the conclusion of a
marriage between the same King and my daughter. And as for the Edict (saith
she) the King my sons meaning is not otherwise, but that the same shall stand
in force.</p>
                  <p>To this I replyed, that true it was, that the League was made with the King,
and not with the Admiral. Notwithstanding that the liberty of conscience was
not particularly granted unto him, but generally to those of the Religion, as to
the Amity between the said Princes, notwithstanding they were of contrary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
I told her, that the time was now altered, for that then there was no
general league made at <hi>Trent,</hi> or at <hi>Bayonne</hi> generally against those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and surely Madam (said I) I fear, that this late severity executed here,
will make all Princes of the Religion, to repute the same a general denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of War against them, which I fear will prove as bloody as ever war that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
whereof the benefit would chiefly grow to the Turk. Thereupon she
took occasion to inveigh vehemently against the Admiral, saying, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Bayonne</hi> was a device of his to provoke such Princes as were allies and
friends to this Crown, to become enemies to the same. For (saith she) the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of <hi>Bayonne</hi> tended to other end but to make good chear; and to the
end you may see how little your Mistris was beholding to him; you may see
(saith she) a discourse found, with his testament, made at such time as he was
sick at <hi>Rochel,</hi> wherein, amongst other advices that he gave to the King my son,
this is one that he willed him in any case, to keep the Queen your Mistris and
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as low as he could, as a thing that tended much to the safety
and maintenance of this Crown. To that I answered, that in this point, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he was affected towards the Queen my Mistris, he shewed himself a most
true and faithful Subject to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and the Queens Majestie my
Mistris made the more account of him, for that she knew him faithfully affected
to the same: The said discourse was all written with his own hand. To the
other two reasons she answered nothing, but desired me that I would not be
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54478:132"/>
carried away with reports of some seditious instruments, that desired nothing
else but to set Princes at discord. In the end, after long debating to and fro of
the matter, she desired me to protest unto the Queen my Mistris, that she and
her son desired nothing more then good amity; and because the same might
grow to more perfection, they desired the finishing of this marriage propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whereof she hoped there would grow safety and quiet to both Realms. I
then desired her to satisfie me in two points: The one, of the difficulty of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
considering their late severity may be compounded, if the enterview should
go forward. The other, in what sort they mean to continue in observation of
the said Edict.</p>
                  <p>To the first she told me, that for the difficulty in Religion, if there be no other
let (saith she) I doubt not but it shall be so compounded, as that it shall be to the
contentment of your Mistris.</p>
                  <p>As for the second, the Kings meaning is, that they shall enjoy the liberty of
their conscience. What Madam (said I) and the exercise of their Religion to?
No (said she) my son will have exercise but of one Religion in his Realm. Then
(said I) how can it agree, that the observation of the Edict, whereof you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me to advertise the Queen my Mistris that the same should continue in his
former strength? To that she said, that they had discovered certain matters of
late, that they saw it necessary to abolish all exercise of the same. Why Madam
(said I) will you have them live without exercise of Religion. Even (saith she)
as your Mistris suffereth the Catholiques of <hi>England.</hi> My Mistris did never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
them any thing by Edict, if she had, she would not fail to have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it. To that she said, that the Queen my Mistris was to direct the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her own Countrey, and the King his. To that I answered, that I did
not move those questions of any curiosity, but to render account to the
Queen my Mistris of the proceedings, who I knew desired that all things might
pass in such sort as might be to their honour.</p>
                  <p>A third doubt I propounded, how considering their late severity, they could
perform their promise with the Queen my Mistris, if she should be assailed for
the cause of Religion, in yielding assistance. To this she answered, that if any;
yea (saith she) if the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> I will not stick to move him, shall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
any thing against her for the cause of Religion, she shall not lack for any
assistance that this Crown can give her. Our desire is onely to reduce this Crown
to a quiet state.</p>
                  <p>This speech I thought good to impart unto her Majestie, referring unto her
the consideration of the same.</p>
                  <p>Of late, though I received ill usage of the people, yet at their Majesties
hands I find more favour then accustomed, whereof I promised to advertise
her Majestie. <hi>La Roche,</hi> who two years past was imployed in the enterprize
at <hi>Ireland,</hi> was lately here at the Court, and from hence dispatched to <hi>Rochel,</hi>
which maketh men to suspect some enterprize that way. And so leaving fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to trouble your Honour at this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <head>To the right Honorable Sir Thomas Smith, her Majesties
principal Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIr, it may please you to advertise her Majestie, that the tenth of this moneth
the King and Queen Mother sent for me to the Louvre; where first I spake
to Queen Mother, who shewed me, that <hi>la Mot</hi> hath received such honour and
good entertainment at her Majesties hands, as that she, and her Son the King,
could do no less then send for me, and desire me to render unto her Majestie
most hearty thanks for the same; and further, to shew unto her Majestie, that
forasmuch as they desire nothing more then some straiter amity with her, which
they think can by no means come to pass so well as by marriage; and therefore
the Kings meaning was, that she and her son Duke <hi>d' Alanson</hi> should repair to
<hi>Bulloin</hi> or <hi>Callis,</hi> so that her Majestie will be content to repair to <hi>Dover,</hi> to
the end the enterview that hath been propounded, might take some effect, by
some good advice that may be found out for the surety of both their Majesties,
which thing shall be best considered of, how the same may come to pass. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
she willed me to tell her Majestie, that besides the great hope she had
that the same enterview will breed a hope of straiter amity between the two
Crowns, she desired the same no less, for the great good particular affection she
had to see her Majestie, whereof she would receive as great content, as of any
one thing that hath hapned unto her in her days. To this I answered, that I
would not fail to advertise her Majestie thereof. And thereupon, according to
the contents of her Majesties Letters of the two and twentieth of August, I
took occasion to protest unto her, in her Majesties behalf, that forasmuch as I
had before advertised of her and the Kings misliking of an enterview, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the inconveniences that hath followed thereof, her Majestie could not
desire the same, but rather refer it to the Kings and her consideration, lest if the
principal should not take place, there might follow that inconvenience that by
them was feared. To this she answered, that she would take the burthen and
blame upon her; and that whether the matter took effect or not, the Kings
meaning was to continue good amity with her Majestie. I replyed, that to see
one in marriage, is a thing in it self considered honest and allowable, and that
if the parties desire who sought the same took no place, there could grow to him
no reproach thereof, but in opinion, which had no reason of ground, for that
marriages have their beginning from above. Upon that I concluded, that for
the Duke <hi>d' Alanson</hi> to see a Princess of her Majesties quality and calling, was
a thing honourable; and that therefore whatsoever success the matter took, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that marriages came from heaven, there could in truth and reason grow to
him no dishonour; and that therefore unless he could put on that opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the issue to be doubtful, it were better not to proceed any further,
lest it might be an occasion of unkindness, which might be unprofitable to both
the Crowns. To this she answered, that she knew it to be ttue, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they would refer the issue to God, with intention to continue good friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
whatsoever grew of the matter. So having ended with her, I repaired to
the King, who onely willed me to give her Majestie thanks for the good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
given to <hi>la Motte;</hi> as also to assure her, that his intention and desire
was no other, but to continue, or rather to increase amity with her: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to shew her, that he would shortly send the Admirals process unto his
Ambassador, to shew unto her Majestie. Duke <hi>d' Alanson,</hi> who was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
desired me to present unto her Majestie his most humble and affectionate
commendations, and to shew her, that so great was the honour that she did
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54478:133"/>
unto his servant <hi>la Mote,</hi> as he desired nothing more then to have occasion to
shew himself thankful by doing her service; and that therefore it would please
her to make account of him as of one that is wholly hers. In this time of
trouble; he hath often sent unto me, and offered me some of his guard for my
surety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>La Motte</hi> shewed himself most thankful for the honour he hath received,
and every man maketh most honourable report of her Majestie; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she may think the good usage of him very well imployed on
him.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Levingston,</hi> and divers other Scotish Gentlemen, who see here
no way to enjoy the liberty of their conscience, do desire passport, wherein
I mean to use less difficulty then heretofore I have done; for that they seem
upon the last accident, to desire most perfect Amity between the two Crowns
of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> in respect of the common cause of Religion. I
suppose, passing by that way, and receiving good entertainment at her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
hands, they will rather do good then harm at home, by making them in
the Countrey understand what had passed here, and the danger that is like
to follow, without perfect union between the said Crowns.</p>
                  <p>Some of the wisest sort of them here, that before were enemies, and now
are become friends, do wish that her Majestie sought to make some recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
between the Earl <hi>Morton</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lidington,</hi> and that her
Majestie by some pension did make both him and others assured to her.
They think that her Majestie by so doing, in disbursing of two or three
thousand pounds a year, may save the disbursing of many thousands, besides
the avoiding of many dangerous practises that are like to grow that way.
This device might seem to savour of the particular benefit, were not the
circumstances of the present time reasonable for the same.</p>
                  <p>The Ambassador of <hi>Scotland</hi> telleth such of his Nation as are here, that
the Kings meaning is to make as great account of them as ever he did.
That those of the guard, for their better entertainment, shall have a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of their own Nation; and further, that the Kings meaning is to erect
again certain men of Arms, under the conduct of some Nobleman of that
Nation. I leave to her Majestie to consider what this courtesie to that
Nation meaneth. Sir, I beseech you to move her Majestie, that for the
time that I shall remain here, which I hope shall not be long, I may
hear often from her, whereby I may the better know how to direct my
course.</p>
                  <p>This inclosed Letter of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> was sent me from Secretary <hi>Pynart,</hi>
whereby it may appear, that he was procured to write to their Majesties. And
so leaving further to trouble your Honour at this Present, I most humbly
take my leave.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honourable Sir Thomas Smith, her Majesties principal
Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIr, it may please you to advertise her Majestie, That of late the King here
was advertised from his Ambassador Resident in <hi>Flanders,</hi> how that the
ninth of this moneth the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> approaching near unto <hi>Montz,</hi> and
being fully resolved to fight with his enemy, commanded forth of his Army
four hundred footmeen, and five hundred light horsemen, the Prince himself
and the rest of his Army following them somewhat afar off, in very good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
On the righr hand of his Battaile there stood a mill, where he planted six
pieces of Artillery, as well to defend himself, as to offend his enemy with more
advantage. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> likewise sent out against the Prince five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Spaniards Harquebushiers, and six hundred light horsemen, with Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebushiers
a Crock, on the right hand of them he set two thousand Rutters,
and on the left wing as many. In this sort they came at length to hand strokes,
the fight dured a long time, to wit, from twelve of the clock at noon, to six of
the clock at night; but in the end, by means of the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
the Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi> horsemen were put in so great disorder, as they were
constrained to retire themselves into their Tents, not without great loss. The
number of them that were slain is not yet certainly known, although it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that the Duke hath lost above three thousand men. This victory is
thought to proceed of 250 horsemen, who issued forth of <hi>Montz</hi> during the
Conflict, and set upon the tail of the Duke <hi>Alva's</hi> Army, who also afterwards
joyned with the Prince of <hi>Orang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> Thus much I thought good to write, to the
end her Majestie may understand how things pass in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the state of this Countrey, there is nothing meant but extremity
towards those of the Religion. On Sunday last, which was the fourteenth of
this moneth, the young Princess of <hi>Conde</hi> was constrained to go to Mass, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
threatned otherwise to go to prison, and so consequently to be made away.
The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> hath also yielded to hear Mass upon Sunday next, being
otherwise threatned to go to the Bastile, where he is not like long to serve.
The Friday before Queen Mother told me, that no bodies conscience—for
(saith she) here is the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and divers others
in this Court, that live with liberty of conscience, and so shall continue; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
(saith she) that the King could be content, and could wish that
they were all converted and become Catholiques. And I do perceive that  <gap reason="symbol" extent="45 letters">
                        <desc>〈45 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap> and therefore I hope her
Majestie will stand upon her guard, and strengthen her self with the Amity of
the Protestant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who (as I hear) are awake, and marvellously
stomach this late cruelty, and do think that the danger thereof will reach to
themselves, if they do not seek to prevent it. I hope also her Majestie will
establish things in such <gap reason="symbol" extent="47 letters">
                        <desc>〈47 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap> and wil not
suffer her to be abused with her fair speech, having had so late experience of her
faithless dealing, when the King is once possessed of <hi>Rochel,</hi> which he hopeth
to have shortly. <hi>Strozzees</hi> voyage is then directly to <hi>Scotland.</hi> All the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonote
lands, which will amount to many millions, shall be sold and imployed
in the Conquest of Countreys, which I hope in God will prove an account
without the host, if God do not blinde the eyes of the Princes of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
who joyning together, shall be able to make their parts good against any
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54478:134"/>
of those that shall have will to do them harm. One <hi>Roulart</hi> a Catholique and
Canon of <hi>Nostre Dame,</hi> and also a Counsellour in the Parliament, uttering cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
speeches in misliking this lawless kind of proceeding without justice, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
and committed to prison, and in prison murthered as disorderly as
any of the rest, wherewith divers of the Catholiques themselves were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
This manner of proceeding breedeth general mistrust in them of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and every man feareth Gods vengeance. And so leaving to trouble your
Honour any further at this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <head>To our very loving Friend Francis Walsingham <abbr>Esq</abbr> her Majestes Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
Resident in France.</head>
                  <p>YOu shall understand, that after the receit of your Letters mentioning the
hurt of the Admiral, which was the two and twentieth of the last, her
Majestie was greatly perplexed therewith, and within a very short time after,
by means of certain that fled hither from <hi>Diepe,</hi> that the said Admiral, with a
great multitude of the Religion, were suddenly murthered the four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
at <hi>Paris,</hi> in a most cruel sort, there was no small cause of the increase of
her Majesties grief, and that so much the more, as she could hear no manner
certainly thereof from you, of whose person also, in such a horrible time, her
Majestie was very careful; and notwithstanding that the French Ambassador did
at <hi>London,</hi> to some of your friends affirm, that you were in safety; yet until
your own servant came, who stayed long at <hi>Bulloin</hi> for lack of good wind,
with your letters, and some knowledge of the fact, her Majestie was not quiet
in mind for your self: And likewise her Majestie understood, that they would
have to be conceived by a writing, which was by the Queen Mothers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
sent you, expressing the summaty of this fact, which seemeth to be
described in a disguised manner, to cover the execrable manner thereof: So
that the Kings Ambassador here, yesterday imparted first to her Majestie, and
afterwards to her Councel, the process of this murther, according to the same
writing, with some enlargement of the circumstances, is so foul a fact as could
suffer to make the King to appear void of all intention of evil: And yet not
being able to make the fact allowable in any order, he held this course here, that
though he could not in any wise approve the manner of the cruelty in such a
general execution as there was; yet to excuse the King, he set forth the Kings
great grief conceived, first, of the hurt of the Admiral, with his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to have done justice upon the Authors thereof, with other arguments of
his resort to visit and comfort the Admiral, being hurt. In which mind the
King continued until Saterday late in the night; at which time he saith, that
advertisement was given to him that the Admirall and his Friends were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
not to expect the order of the King for the punishment of the Fact, but
would avenge themselves, and that they would certainly seize the person of the
King, Q. Mother, and his Brethren; and so his person and theirs should be in
danger, and a new War should thereby be begun: and to confirm this to be true,
in the Kings sight it was also informed, that some such as were of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
with the Admiral, had for conscience sake disclosed the same; and
that it was made the more probable to the King by reason of certain bold
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54478:134"/>
speeches used by <hi>Tilligney</hi> to the King, as in the writing is contained. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
(as the Ambassador saith) the King was so daunted with the present fear
of his own person, and his Mother and his Brethren, and with the imminent
danger of the now civil war, as being thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> with this extreamity, and
having no time long to deliberate thereupon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>carce the space of an hour, he
was in this manner forced to yield to another extremity; which was to suffer the
parties that were enemies to the <hi>Admiral,</hi> to proceed to the execution of him;
although as the Ambassador saith, not with such a general fury as was used, for
that he cannot deny, but he thinketh a great number of innocents to be slain.
And after he had thus imparted the matter, he requested her Majestie to shew
her compassion of the King, rather then condemn him, making great assurance
of the Kings innocency herein, for intention of his own part, but onely for his
defence and safety against the perils that were propounded to him by the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationer,
with like assurance of his resolute determinations to continue perfect
amity with her Majestie, and not to suffer the Edict of the Pacification to be
broken; and therefore he most earnestly besought her Majestie, that by her
answer to be made, the King might find comfort of her in condoling with
him for this so miserable and lamentable an accident; and thereby the King
his Master might be the rather encouraged to search the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whether he was herein abused by untrue reports, and so consequently both
to punish the malefa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tors and deceivours of him, and to continue the observation
of the Edict, and of the good amity with her Majestie, which surely if her
Majestie should not in some ways comfort the King by her answer, might give
occasion to make him to lean more to the counsels of the persons that were
Authors and Executioners of this Murther, then were expedient for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or for her Majestie here. In this sort, at great length, the Ambassador
proceeded, shewing also outwardly, a marvellous inward grief of mind for this
shameful fact, professing himself ashamed to be counted a Frenchman. But
here much of this may be counted suddenly uttered by him, time must try that
hereafter; for this present time cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uffer any thing uttered by him or any
of them, that were known enemies to the <hi>Admirals</hi> Religion, to be free from
suspicion of abuse or of danger. Nevertheless, her Majestie did very wisely
and Princely answer him in such sort, as he made thereof to her Councel very
good report, and most earnestly desired that the King his Master might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by her Majesties own Letters, or by her Ambassador. The sum of her
Majesties answer was, That although upon the first report of the general murther,
so many being all under his protection in his principal City, was very hard to
conceive well of the King, yet it had been her Majesties former opinion of his
singular integrity of his actions, and namely of his many outward favours that
he had since the time of the Admirals coming to his presence, shewed towards
him and his friends, that howsoever this fact of it self, with the circumstances
of so many and horrible murthers, did outwardly charge the King with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of dishonor that might touch a Prince, yet her Majestie, partly for reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of his Princely estate, for her love she did bear him, and finally, for that
she had not yet received due information from him, did determine with her self,
not to pronounce any evil judgement of the King, nor yet to conceive that
which the most part of all others did of him; but now she hath heard by the
Ambassador, in what sort the King hath willed him to declare the process there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
she doth much desire the consideration of the Kings honour, the continuance
of the Amity with him, she most heartily wisheth, that he might so use the matter
in time, as the world might find him excusable in one of these two sorts; that is,
that either it might be made manifest to indifferent persons, that is, to such as are
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54478:135"/>
not known to have born deadly malice to the Admiral and his party now mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.
That if the confirmations that were given to the King, of the Admirals
evil intention and conspiracy against him were grounded upon truth, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
malice or pretext; and if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> informations might bee verified, then might
the King be excused in some part both towards God and the world, in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Admirals enemies by force to prevent his enterprizes, although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the same informations had been true, yet the manner of the cruelty used
cannot be allowed in any Kingdom or Government; and least, in that place where
the King might by order of justice have done due execution both to the Admiral
and all others that should have proved offenders: for it cannot be denyed, that the
same forces that murthered so many, might have more easily attached them all,
or the principals, and brought them to answer to justice when the King would;
and of all others the Admiral, being on his bed lamed, both on the right hand
and left arm, lying in danger under the cure of Chyrurgions, being also guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about his private house, with a number of the Kings guard, might have been
by a word of the Kings mouth brought to any place to have answered, when
and how the King should have thought meet. But the fault thereof, as to the
disorder in proceeding, howsoever the information had been true, her Majestie
forbeareth to impute to the King, and leaveth the same to the burthen of others
about him, whose age and knowledge ought in such a case to have foreseen how
offenders ought to be justified with the sword of the Prince, and not with the
bloody swords of murtherers, being also the mortal enemies of the party mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.
The information whereof, for the recovery of the Kings honour, which
is by the facts of others herein greatly touched, her Majestie leaveth to the
King to be considered, and wisheth him commodity to do what shall be to Gods
honour and to his praise.</p>
                  <p>But on the other side, if such informations were so suddenly given to the King
against the Admiral, shall not be duly and manifestly, without subornation,
proved true, as therein surely the manner of the circumstances do lead all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
persons to think the same not onely falsly forged of the private deadly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
to the Admiral and his parties, but also perillously devised to weaken the
K. Estate, and to deprive him of the great honor and surety that daily was grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto him, by counsels or services of the Admiral and his friends now mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
that her Majestie findeth the case of so great importance to be pitied,
wishing him grace to have power, by faithful Counsellours and Servants, to
make an example to the world of the same manner of punishment of such detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
trayterous attempts, whereby not onely his honour, which is now much
blemished, may be saved, but principally himself, and his person and surety,
being in good time provided for; and if it shall please him herein to require
the use of her Majesties advice, and of her assistance, she shall not fail, but
to shew her self in this time a perfect friend to him by all goods means that is in
her power. And after many good speeches used to the Ambassador; she conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
That as the Ambassador required of her, she could rather condole with the
King this miserable accident, then to condemn him, until she should see more caus
by the manner of his proceeding, which he should use hereafter for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his honour. And as to the Admiral she confesseth, That she was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sorry for his death, as for one whom she thought a good Minister to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
amity betwixt their two Majesties, and she had cause to bewail the rest
of the Noblemen for the like cause; but otherwise the Ambassador could well
tell, that in former times she did never allow the taking of arms, contrary to the
Kings Commandment; but now perceiving upon the Kings receiving them to
grace, and taking them to his protection, and that it was by consequence of things

but to defend themselves in the profession of their Religion, according to the

is to be left to your discretion, using then but such part thereof as may declare her

                  <p>SIr, I see the Devil is suffered by the Almighty God for our sins, to be strong
in following the persecution of Christs members; and therefore we are not
onely vigilant of our own defence against such trayterous attempts as lately have
been put in ure there in <hi>France,</hi> but also to call our selves to repentance. Of the
Queens Majesties answer to this Ambassador, I have at good length comprized
the same in writing, which cometh now unto you signed by the Councel, which
you are to use, according as the time shall teach you. For although the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
hath seemed to gain so much credit with her Majestie, as she thinketh that
the King is not guilty of the murthers otherwise then he reporteth. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that although the Ambassador saith, that the King willed him to assure her
Majestie, that the Navy prepared by <hi>Strozzi,</hi> should not any ways endamage
her Majestie, we have great cause in these times, to doubt all fair speeches; and
therefore we do presently put all the Sea-coasts in defence, and mean to send
the Queens Majesties Navy to the Seas with speed, and so to continue, until
we see further whereunto to trust. I pray you do your best to discover the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

                  <p>THe lamentable Tragedy that hath been there used of late, doth make all
Christians look for a just revenge again at Gods hands, as it hath pleased him
to fear us, and so pinch us in the mean time with the scourge of correction, by the
sufferance of his people thus to be murthered, but our sins deserve this and more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but I trnst he will hold his holy hand over us, not to reward us altogether as we
deserve, but somewhat in his correction comfort us, that we may see as well the
fall of his and our enemies, as the blood of his Saints to be so innocently spilt, even
for his mercies, let him turn it ten fold upon their heads, that they triumph not
over much, to the utter hearts grief of his poor flock. If that King be Author
and doer of this Act, shame and confusion light upon him, be he never so strong
in the sight of men, the Lord hath not his power for nought; if he be not the
Author, but upon the sudden fear and practise brought suddenly to us, as his
Ambassador would have us think, although the yielding unto it be horrible,
yet if frailty and fear hath constrained it, and that his heart with due repentance
seek the right satisfaction first of God, and then of the world, by prosecuting
the enemies of God and his Realm that so entised them to it, then may I hope
that it was not his own consent or liking. Otherwaies, if he continue in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
the fact, and allowing the persons that did it, then must he be a Prince
detested of all honest men, what Religion soever they have; for as his fact was
ugly, so was it inhumane, for whom should a man trust, if not his Princes word;
and these men whom he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

writing, and not publique, but private, with open Proclamations, and all
other manner of Declarations that could be devised for the safety, which now

hath inwardly dealt of late with me, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>

as he will make revenge of it. God grant it be so, but you may easily understand
it; and surely you shall do well inwardly, as her Majestie hath written unto you
(but warily) to discover it, even with himself; and if it may appear he stands in
any fear of his person, or doubts his force to assist him, I know her Majestie will
venter twenty thousand of her best subjects for him and with him in so good a
quarrel: For it is almost incredible, that one so young, and hitherto so plain, so sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
and of so good disposition, as you your self could not say too much of him,
could thus be transformed so suddenly, so dishonourable, from so good to ill.
Well, you may shortly see it, and I pray you let us hear from you as often as
you may. And so praying God to send you your health and safety, I bid you fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,

                  <p>SIr, this accident in <hi>France</hi> seemeth to us so strange, and beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we cannot tell what to say to it, and the excuse <hi>tam</hi> that we wot
not what to think of it. The matter appeareth all manner of ways so lamentable,
the King so suddenly and in one day to have dispoiled himself and his Realm of so
many notable Captains, so many brave Souldiers, so wise and so valiant men, as if
they were unguilty of that which is laid unto them, it is most pitiful; if they were
guilty, <hi>Cur mandati causa damnati sunt ac casi,</hi> in such sudden and extreme deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<hi>Cito sed sera penitentia solet sequi.</hi> If it were sudden, and not of long time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated
before; and if so, the worse and more infamous. Thus you see what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
any man may think of the fact; I am glad yet, that in those tumults and
bloody proscriptions you did escape, and the yong Gentlemen that be there with
you, and that the K. had so great care and pity of our Nation so lately with strait
amity confederate with him; yet we hear say, that he that was sent by my Lord
Chamberlain to be Schoolmaster to yong <hi>Wharton,</hi> being come the day before,
was then slain. Alas, he was acquainted with no body, nor could be partaker of any
evil dealing. How fearful and careful the mothers and parents be here of such yong
Gentlemen as be there, you may easily guess by my Lady <hi>Lane,</hi> who prayeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
earnestly that her son may be sent home with asmuch speed as may be. And if
my Lady your wife, with you daughter, and the rest, with such as may be spared,
were sent away home, until this rage and tempest were somewhat appeased, you
shall be the quieter, and disburthened of much of your care. You would not think

                  <head>To the Right Honourable his very good Lords, the Lords of her Majesties most
honourable privy Councel.</head>
                  <p>IT may please your Honours to understand, that your letters of the ninth of
this moneth, I received the seventeenth of the same; and having well perused
and considered of the contents thereof, and seeing a choice left unto you of me
touching the speech that from her Majestie was to be used both towards the King
and his Mother, as might express her Maj. grief for the inconvenience hapned;
as also, to assure him of her Majesties disposition to continue the amity upon such
certain informations as I could gather here of the manner of the Kings proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in this late accident, and finding him to avow aswel by speech as by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of most extreme severity towards those of the Religion, that the said ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
proceeded of himself, though her Majestie is otherwise informed by the
Ambassador; I thought therefore good both towards him and his mother, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the direction of your Honours letters, to use such speeches as the time of
my repair to the Court, which was the one and twentieth of this moneth would
permit; I was first brought unto Q. Mother, to whom I shewed that her Maj. wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
me to say, That she was not a little stonished and perplexed upon the hearing
of the late miserable and most lamentable accident in such sort as she knew
neither what to say or judge of the matter, seeing those murthered without pity
and compassion, without regard had either of age or sex, without ordinary
form of justice, who upon the assurance of the Kings word, laying all suspicion
aside, did misdoubt nothing less then that which hapned unto them, who
thought their lives then in most safety, when by proof it appeared they
were in most danger. How these things may pass, and the King receive
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54478:138"/>
no touch and blemish in honour, is a thing which the Queen my Mistris saith
she chiefly feareth; besides, she hath willed me to say unto you, That she doth
not a little marvel, that you being a Prince of that judgement you are, and
so well experimented in matters of Government, knowing the passions and
factions that reign in your State, could be induced so easily to yield to an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
not to be allowed in all mens judgement in any sort or Commonwealth,
as the parties to be executed before due examination had of such informations,
as in reason it appeareth were given against them; for as easily might the said
persons hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> been arrested as slain: And so being arrested, afterwards have
been produced before the ordin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry justice, to have received (being found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
punishment according to their demerits; otherwise, being found inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
to have been restored both to honour and liberty; which kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
might have saved the blood of many an innocent, which now through
the fury and rage of the people was shed, and the King had remained justified
in honour. She desireth your Majestie to interpret this her plain speech in
good part, as proceeding from one that wisheth well both to the King and
you, and cannot therefore but condole and bewail this accide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, whereon
dependeth both your honour, and the repose of your Estate; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
she hopeth that the King will yield justification of this fact, as he shall
remain justified of God and the world. To this she answered, That she no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
marvelled, that the Queen my Mistris was astonished with the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
for that the execution was performed with a great deal more cruelty
then was intended by the King; who (saith she) is no Tyrant, nor was easie
to be induced to do that which he did, had he not been provoked thereto by
the apparent danger which he saw growing both to himself, and to me his
Mother, and his Brethren, if present execution had not been done; which
shall well appear by the process which my son meaneth to send unto the
Queen your Mistris. And whereas the Queen your Mistris doth seem to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
that I should be easily induced to yield to any execution, a kind of speech
that somewhat toucheth me, to be done before due examination had of the
informations, I being (as she saith) so well acquainted with factions reigning in
this State: You may tell her, that present mischief cannot abide delayed reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
for (saith she) we were informed, by persons not to be suspected as drawn
by passion or faction, being rather tied to the Admiral both by Religion and
Amity, yet moved in conscience to prefer their Prince before any private person,
for that those of the Religion, had they not been prevented at the time that they
were, had seized within two hours after one of the gates of our Pallace of the
<hi>Louvre,</hi> and so consequently our persons; which enterprize to have been
executed, was agreed the same afternoon that the Admiral was hurt: And that
they had some such meaning, it may be gathered, for that the Count of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi>
the same morning that this enterprize should have been executed, with a
Troop of Horse stayed a good while at <hi>Pre de Clerces,</hi> to attend what the other
should do within. Hereupon I took occasion to say unto her, That although I
had no Commission to reply, yet I hoped her Majestie would give me leave to say
somewhat in the justifying of the said Count of <hi>Mongomery,</hi> for that heretofore it
pleased her to bear with the liberty of my speech. And so I shewed her, that Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
at night, after the Admiral was hurt, between nine and ten of the clock,
the said Count came unto my lodging, and amongst other communication he
said, That as he and those of the Religion had just occasion to be right sorry
for the Admirals hurt, so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had they no less cause to rejoyce to see the King
so careful, as well for the curing of the Admiral, as also for the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the party that hurt him. No small argument (saith he) of the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54478:138"/>
Kings sincerity, which kind of speech seemed to be void of all conspiracy and
miscontentment.</p>
                  <p>And touching his being <hi>au Pre de Clerces,</hi> I told her that an English Gentleman
who was lodged not far from the said <hi>Count,</hi> went unto him that morning that the
execution was done, in my name, desiring him to send me word what stirr there
was in the Town. His answer was, That true it was, some stirr was in the Town,
and the King had taken so good order therein, as all was appeased, and that he
had placed such guards about the Admirals house, as he was in safety. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
Madam (said I) shewed, that his intention in staying <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> pre de Clerces,</hi>
was void of any evil meaning. And as for his Troop, as I learn, it was under
forty horse, of the which all was unarmed, and of them, four only had Pistols,
which sheweth plainly that he was very slenderly appointed for the execution of
any Enterprise.</p>
                  <p>To this her only answer was, That she thought not the Count so guilty as
the rest: And further, she shewed me, that sithence his departure he had written
to the King her son, as well Letters for his justification, as also of submission.
In the end she willed me to desire her Majestie to content her self with such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
as should be made with their Ambassador there, touching their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
here, as the King her son and she did rest satisfied with such relations as
were made of her proceedings in like cases there, by her Ministers here.
And so making great protestation of the Kings and her earnest desire for to
continue, or rather to increase the amity, she ended.</p>
                  <p>From her I was conducted to the King; at my access I shewed unto him, that
I was willed from her Majestie to say unto him, That though she was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
at the first report made of the great slaughter and horrible murder,
without regard either had to sex or age of those of the Religion, who laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
all distrust, and reposing themselves upon his words, did most confidently
throw themselves into the arms of his protection; notwithstanding, such was
the opinion she had of his sincerity, such the reverence she bare towards his
Princely state, and such the particular affection she bare towards his person, as
she resolved not to pronounce any thing in prejudice of his honour, untill she
might be fully informed of the manner of the proceeding in that behalf. I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shewed him, that after by his Ambassador, her Majestie was informed of
the progress and success of the matter: She then, as one that wished the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of his honour, and of the continuance of the good amity between
them, could not but wish also, that with all expedition he would make it man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
to the world, that the information which was given unto him of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
evil intention and conspiracy were grounded upon truth, and not upon mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
or pretext; and if the information might be so verified, then should his
Majestie in some part be excused, both towards God and the world, in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Admirals enemies by force to prevent his enterprises.</p>
                  <p>Upon this he brake off my speech, and shewed me, that he had cause many
waies to think himself most bound unto her Majestie his good sister; but at
this present, chiefly for that she staid from condemning him before she was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the manner of his proceedings; also for the good advice she giveth
him to seek to justifie himself towards the world, which councel (saith he) I mean
to follow, as shall appear unto her by the process I mean to send unto her, and
also to the other Princes, that I had most cause to do as I did. And as for the cruelty (saith he) exercised both here in my Town of Paris, and elsewhere, it is
a thing that hath hapned against my will to my great grief. Of late (saith he)
the like disorder hath been committed at Roan, for the which I am very sorry;
and therefore for the redress thereof, I have all this morning been devising
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54478:139"/>
with my Councel for exemplary Justice to be done upon those which shall be
found to be offenders. Besides (saith he) my meaning is to dispatch my Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
into their several charges, to see such Ordinances observed as to me shall
seem fit to be set forth. He forbare to mention the Edict already made, and now
wholly violated, tending to the repose and tranquillity of the Realm. I shewed
him that I had more to say unto him from her Majesty; and so I proceeded and
declared unto him, that her Majesty as one that wisheth well unto him, could
have wished that although the said information had been found true, that he
had proceeded otherways, for that the manner of the cruelty used cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
in any kingdom or government, and least of all in that place where his
Majesty might by order of justice have done due execution both of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and others that should be proved offenders; for it cannot be (said I) denied,
but that the same forces that murthered so many might more easily have attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them all, or the principals, and brought them to answer to Justice, where his
Majesty would. And of all other the Admiral being in his bed, lamed both on
the right hand and left arm, and lying in danger under the cure of Surgeons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also guarded about his private house with a number of his Majesties guard,
might have been by a word of his Majesties mouth brought to any place to have
answered when and how his Majesty should have thought meet: but the fault
hereof as to the disorder in proceeding, howsoever the information had been
true, her Majesty forbeareth to impute to his Majesty, and leaveth the same to
the burthen of others about him, whose age and knowledg ought in such a case
to have foreseen how offenders ought to have been chastifed with the sword of
the Prince, and not with the bloody sword of murtherers, being also the mortal
sworn enemies of the parties murthered. The information whereof for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his Majesties honour, which is by the faults of others herein greatly
touched, her Majesty leaveth to his Majesty to be considered, and wisheth him
commodity to do that which might be to Gods honour and his praise. To that
he answered me (seeming with that kind of speech to be somwhat moved) That
the loss of life and kingdom goeth neer to a Prince. Thereupon I considered
the manner of the proceedings here, being fully resolved to use all manner of
rigor and extremity, and that therefore the advice that her Majesty gave were
bootless and can do no good, I shortning my speech concluded with him, That
her Majesty willed me to say to him, that she thought it her part presently rather
to condole with him this miserable accident, then to condemn him, till s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e should
see more cause by the manner of his proceedings which he should hereafter use
for the recovery of his honour. To this he answered, that he thanked her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty;
and so protested that he had no other meaning but to continue good
amity with her; and that though he sought to reform his own Realm touching
Religion, yet he hoped that the said amity lately concluded should continue firm
between them without alteration; for that the King his father, and K. <hi>Edward</hi>
my good sisters brother did not leave to be good friends, notwithstanding the
contrariety of religion. To that I said, that I was well assured that her Majesty
had no other meaning. I then moved him for some order to be given both to
the Governor of the Town of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> as also to <hi>Strozzi</hi> and the Conductors
of his Army, that our Merchants that repair to the Vintage might pass to and
fro safely without any way being outraged, and that also during the time of his
abode at <hi>Burdeaux</hi> they might not be molested for religion. To this his answer
was, that there might be such order taken as they should not at any way be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested
by any of his subjects; and besides, that if there could be a place of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
agreed upon, they should enjoy the exercise of their religion according to
the late Treaty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:54478:139"/>
Then I shewed him that I was to move his Majestie in a thing that particularly
touched my self, and so declared unto him, that about three months past, I wrote
very earnestly to divers of my friends to move her Majestie either for my revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
or else to repair home for a time; which thing as her Majestie did not then
fully deny, so did she not yield thereto; but now the matter being renewed unto
her Maj. they laying before her besides my private affairs, the great danger I
live in here, through the disquietness of this State, and the great hatred borne to
our Nation, her Maj. hath so far yielded thereto, as she hath for that purpose writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
this Letter which I am now to present unto your Maj. So he took the Letter
and read it; and after he had read it, he shewed me, that if he should consent to my
departure, according to his good sisters request, he must then also revoke his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador;
which thing (saith he) cannot but make it appear to the world, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
amity lately concluded betwixt us were broken, or at the least not very sound,
when we do leave the use of necessary Ministers that may communicate between
us such things as may increase and continue amity. I shewed, that her Majesties
meaning to call me home for a time, had no other respect but to my particular
safety, without any intention to diminish amity, and that the example was not
strange, for that Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> had done the like. To that he reply'd,
that touching danger, he should come in his own person to relieve me, rather then
I should sustain any harm: and as for the example, he said, that at that time there
was not that perfect amity that is now. In conclusion he desired me to press him
no further in the matter, untill such time as he might hear from his Ambassador,
for that he did mean to answer her Majesties Letter written in that behalf. And
so for that time I took my leave.</p>
                  <p>After my departure from him, Duke <hi>de Alanzon</hi> sent for me into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to come and speak with him: At my access he shewed me that he was very
sorry that both I and our Nation had in these troubles been so outraged as he
understood we were. I know (saith he) you are wise, and can consider of the
time. If hereafter either you your self, or any of your Nation shall stand in
need of my friendship or assistance, you shall do me wrong to use the help of
any other but of me, for the honour your Mistress did unto <hi>la Mott,</hi> doth
bind me to be her servant during my life, and an advocate for your Nation.
And so he licensed me to depart, desiring me to present unto her Majestie his
most humble and affectionate commendations.</p>
                  <p>Your Honour by the King and his Mothers answers, may see great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
of amity.</p>
                  <p>I am sorry that I cannot yield that assurance thereof that heretofore I have
done, wherein I may seem to have dealt over-confidently; but I know that your
Honours do consider that my error in that behalf was common with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wiser then my self, and therefore I hope you do hold me excused.</p>
                  <p>Seeing now there is here neither regard had to either word, writing, or Edict,
be it never so solemnly published, nor to any protestation made heretofore to
forein Princes for the performance of the same.</p>
                  <p>Seeing the King persecuteth that Religion with all extremity that her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
professeth, and now is like to be an instrument to execute any thing by this
people, offered unto him to the prejudice of her Majesty.</p>
                  <p>Seeing that they that now possess his ear, are sworne enemies unto her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
and nourishers of the late amity, are separated from him: seeing that the
Kings own conscience, so common a companion is fear with Tyranny,
maketh him to repute all those of the Religion, as well at home as abroad,
his enemies, and so consequently not to wish one of them alive,</p>
                  <p>I leave to your Honours now to judge, what account you may make
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54478:140"/>
of the amity with this Crown. If I may without presumption or offence say
my opinion, considering how things presently stand, I think less peril to live
with them as enemies, then as friends.</p>
                  <p>The King, Queen Mother, and Monsieur, have their Councel apart; but
first, before things are communicated with the King, they are debated between
Queen Mother and Monsieur, the Duke of Nevers, and <hi>Tavannes.</hi> The
Duke of Nevers hath well nigh daily conference with the Prince, Nuncio, the
Ambassador of Spain, and the extraordinary Ambassador of Venice, <hi>Iohn Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,</hi>
and what they treat is kept most secret; and for mine own part, I am
now divided from all means to discover any thing; so that I now stand her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
in no further stead here, but to present unto her ordinary Palace news.
There daily remain great number of both horsemen and footmen towards S. Q.
as it is said, to the relief of the D. of Almain.</p>
                  <p>The Marshal <hi>de Cosse</hi> hath Commission sent him, as I am informed, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
as many of the Religon within his charge, as have been known in these late
Wars to have served the Princes, and born charges; if the Marshal <hi>Montmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi>
had been in this Town at the day of execution, both he, with all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the Duke <hi>de Bulloign,</hi> and Marshal had been slain, as I am credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>It is said that both Spain and Portugal make great preparation by Sea.</p>
                  <p>It is thought that so long as Rochel holdeth out, <hi>Strozzi</hi> shall be entertained
from executing any other enterprise; and yet there is no word come that <hi>Byron</hi>
shall be received. It is thought that the late murder at Roan, will make them
of Rochel more resolute.</p>
                  <p>And so leaving to trouble your Honour any further at this present, I most
humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>TRusty and well-beloved, we greet you well. <hi>De la Mott</hi> the French Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador,
on Munday the 22 of this Month, having asked Audience, came to
our Court at Reading, and there had long communication with us, the which
seemed to us at that time the more strange, being we had heard before of the
daily murdering of those of the Religion there in France, not only at Paris and
Orleans, but also at Lyons and Roan, and divers other places and Cities of that
Realm, all the which was done by the Kings appointment and commandment;
whereupon when we had heard what he could say unto us, he heard us so reply
at that time, as we do think he found himself unable to satisfie us: And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
we told him, that we would be further advised for our answer, which
he should have within three or four daies; whereupon communicating his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
with our Councel upon their French tongue, An answer was made,
as appeareth by this here inclosed, which is the copy of that we delivered to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casius</hi>
to interpret in French to the said <hi>de la Mott,</hi> as our ful answer &amp; resolution
at that time; with the which, as <hi>Nicasius</hi> reporteth, <hi>de la Mott</hi> seemed very well
content and satisfied. In the which yet you may perceive that divers things are
left to be ascertained to us by you, wherefore you shall do well with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
speed to demand audience of the King, and there to declare both to him
and to the Queen mother, what hath passed betwixt his Ambassador and us,
and upon the points we did at that time stand; and you may say, as touching any
worthy punishment executed upon his own Subjects, we have not to deal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
but if they have worthily suffered, we are sorry for their evil doings. But
yet the King to destroy and utterly root out of his Realm all those of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that we profess, and to desire us in marriage for his brother, must needs
seem unto us at the first, a thing very repugnant in it self, especially having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
confirmed that liberty to them of the Religion by an Edict of his, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and irrevocable. Of the which to whom that liberty was granted, if any
were partakers of any evil conspiracies against him, specially women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who we do understand are not yet spared. And therefore if that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it self be so odious unto him, that he thinks he must root out all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessers
of it, how should we think his brother a fit husband for us? or how
should we think that the love may grow, continue and increase betwixt his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and us, which ought to be betwixt the husband and the wife.</p>
                  <p>You had in our former Letters unto you, things that we required you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypher
by all means that you could, especially whether the King himself be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
and bent to all these cruelties, and the rooting out of true Religion, or
whether he be but overruled; to the which Article hitherto you have not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
and yet these things might give great light unto us how to direct our
actions in the conferences and talks with his Ambassador; and we would have
you to be earnest with him in that matter of <hi>Strozzi,</hi> praying him frankly and
roundly, what he meaneth with that great Army of Ships and men of War,
which hath been kept a long time close and undiscovered, to what intent, or to
what place it should be bent: You may say we have the more desire to know
his meaning and dealing herein, because that of lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they of <hi>Strozzies</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there, have spoiled divers of our Merchants, some of their Artillery and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54478:141"/>
Victuals, other of their goods and Merchandizes, as was accustomed betwixt
the two Realms in times past, the which kind of dealing is very much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the amity, and to such things as by his Ambassador is propounded unto
us; wherefore as we do go roundly and plainly to work with him, to shew flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that which we do think or doubt hereupon, so we pray him with the same flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and roundness to deal with us, for that is the way to make continuance of
amity, and also increase, and may induce us the sooner to come to a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of such things as be required of us. The Vidam of Chartres, of whom
we have great compassion, is come into this Realm, at whose humble and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
suit we have been content to write this Letter to my brother the
French King in his favour, which you shall deliver with as good words as you
may to the French King, and require his answer.</p>
                  <p>If this our Letter do chance to come to you in Paris, or in the way coming
from Paris towards England, after you have obtained licence of the King to
come away by favour of our Letters which we wrote unto him; yet if you be
not too far on the way, or very near the sea-coast, we would you should return
in Poste, or otherwise, to the Court, to have a direct answer of these Letters,
except that great and unfeigned danger of your self, do move you to keep on
your journey. In which case you shall commit the doing of this message, and
receiving of answer, to your Secretary, whom you shall leave behind, so that he
be a man able to do this charge.</p>

                  <p>THat the King was of necessity for safeguard of his own life forced to cause
such execution to be done upon the Admiral and his complices, as was
done; for that he and they had conspired the death of the King, of which
matter the King was very well able to make a verification, and that her Majesty
should shortly see by the process of the Admiral now in making, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was meant by the King against the cause of Religion.</p>
                  <p>That the King was most earnestly disposed to keep the League.</p>
                  <p>That he desired to have the marriage of his brother of Alanzon to proceed;
and to that end the Queen mother was content to come into the Realm with her
son, at such place, and with such numbers as her Majesty here should allow.</p>

                  <head>Answers.</head>
                  <p>To the first, That although the killing of the Admiral and the rest might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
move her Majestie to think ill thereof, and to be right sorry that the King
should suffer such an act to be done without order of justice; yet her Majestie
being advertised from the King that he was forced thereunto for safety of his
own life, and that thereof her Majestie should see good proof, by such a process
thereof to be sent to her Majestie, as should verifie the same; her Majestie is
content to suspend her judgement against the King, untill by the process she may
see the truth, and by the Kings further proceedings hereafter for continuance
of his Edict for tolleration of Religion, she may perceive what to judge of his
intention for the cause of Religion.</p>

                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:54478:141"/>
To the second, her Majestie thanketh the King for his so earnest an offer to
continue the amity according to the late League made; and doth again assure
the King of her mind to keep it for her part; so as howsoever the King shall
by his deeds shew his affection therein, her Majestie will do the like to her
power.</p>
                  <p>To the third, her Majestie would that the King should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> accident of the Admirals death,
plainly proceed with the Ambassador, and with <hi>la Mot,</hi> so she must plainly deal
with the King, That this ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ident of murthering the Admiral, and of so general
a slaughter of them of the Religion there, hath made such alteration in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
and hath moved such doubts in her minde how to interpret of the offers of
this marriage, and of this enterview, by coming of the Queen Mother with her
son, as her Majestie cannot but suspend her resolution therein, until she may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
some further answer to things which the Ambassador had in charge to
deal with the King particularly, to understand his mind; of which her Majestie
as yet had received no answer from her Ambassador, nor any signification that
he hath as yet had speech with the King thereof. And besides that, as to his last
offer, of the Queen Mother to come into any part of the Realm with Monsieur
<hi>d'Alanson,</hi> her Majestie cannot but interpret the offer very thankfully, though
she had not received from her Ambassador the Queen Mothers meaning to be
such; for her words to him were not further, but that she would be content to
com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with her son to <hi>Bulloign,</hi> or to <hi>Callis,</hi> and that she desired that the Queens
Majestie would come to <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ver;</hi> and so then there might be an enterview and
communication upon the Sea, betwixt <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calais,</hi> or <hi>Bulloign,</hi> a matter
that seemed surely very strange to her Majestie; and seeing that her Ambassador
had no such offer made for her coming aland within the Realm, as the French
Ambassador offereth, her Majestie meaneth therein to be better advertised by
her own Ambassador, who shall have charge therein to understand her mind and
the Kings. And upon knowledge thereof, her Majestie will grow to a further
resolution, to the which it will be a great furtherance, if the proof were verified
as is said, of the just causes given by the Admiral and his Complices, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of them. And that his further proceedings with the observation of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
for the cause of religion, might more clearly appear to her Highness, wherby
her Majestie, shall have good cause to see what is meet for her to do in the further
proceeding, both for the enterview, and for the marriage: In both which her
Majestie shall be very glad to understand that she may have the same likelihood
of the good to follow to her self and Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was propounded unto her, when it was last renewed at <hi>la Mots,</hi> before the death
of the Admiral. And her Majestie assureth the King, that on her part she mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to observe the Amity by all good means as shall be to her possible, and shall
be very glad to find the like answe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

require the King to give her to understand, what his meaning may be in the

                  <p>SIr, although I suppose you are now on your way hitherwards, for by <hi>Walter

of that which I can shew you. I know by self how Ambassadors be to
know what is done in their own Countrey. The cruel murthers at <hi>Roan</hi> is now
long ago written unto us when we thought all had been done; and by the same
letters was written unto us, that <hi>Diepe</hi> was kept close, and the same execution
of the true Christians looked for there, but as then not executed; howbeit,
<hi>Sigoigne</hi> did warrant all our Englishmen to be out of danger, and not to be
afraid: But what warrant can the French make, now Seals and Words of Princes
being traps to catch innocents, and bring them to the Butchery. If the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
and all those murthered on that bloody <hi>Bartholomew</hi> day were guilty,
why were they not apprehended, imprisoned, interrogated and judged, but so
much made of as might be, with-in two hours of the assumation; is that the
manner to handle men either culpable or suspected? so is the Journeyer slain by
the Robber, so is the Hen of the Fox, so the Hinde of the Lyon, so <hi>Abel</hi> of
<hi>Cain,</hi> so the innocent of the wicked, so <hi>Abner</hi> of <hi>Ioab:</hi> but grant they were
guilty, they dreamt treason that night in their sleep, what did the innocent men,
women and children at <hi>Lyons?</hi> what did the sucking children and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
at <hi>Roan</hi> deserve? at <hi>Cane?</hi> at <hi>Rochel?</hi> what is done yet we have not heard,
but I think shortly we shall hear: Will God, think you, still sleep? Will not their
blood ask vengeance, shall not the earth be accursed that hath sucked up the
innocent blood poured out like water upon it: I am most sorry for the King,
whom I love, whom I esteem the most worthy, the most faithful Prince of
the world, the most sincere Monarch now living. I am glad you shall come
home, and would wish you were at home out of that Countrey, so contaminate
with innocent blood, that the Sun cannot look upon it, but to prognosticate
the wrath and vengeance of God. The ruine and desolation of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> could
not come till all the Christians were either killed there, or expelled from thence;
but whether do I run, driven with just passions and heats? The Scots, both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in words shew themselves desirous of accord, willing to come to reason, but
indeed they seem not so, as both Monsieur <hi>de Crocque</hi> and Mr. <hi>Killegrew</hi> do
fear, the old Enemies be so hard to compound, and the new possessions so
hard to part from; but as yet we cannot despair, till they both have met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and heard joyntly what both the parties can say; which so soon as it can
be done, Mr. <hi>Killegrew</hi> hath promised to write to me what is done, and what
he thinketh may be done. What <hi>Strozzies</hi> hovering cloud, which hath so long
gone in a mist, will brew at the last; and what design so long cloaked, will break
out upon, is no marvel, though they and we, and all the world doubt; and if
it be to besiege <hi>Rochel,</hi> and to execute more slaughter upon men, women and
children Christians, as is now suspected and certified; that thereabout it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as some say, is Master of <hi>Rochel</hi> when that is done, what it will do,
and whether it will go further or no; and if it do, to what place, I tell you truly
many do doubt. Divers of our Merchants resorting that way, have found small
courtesie at their hands, no more then if they had been men with Pyrats.
This maketh our Merchants that they dare not yet adventure for <hi>Burdeaux,</hi>
and to doubt whether they may go thither this year or no. And I would

                  <p>SIr, the last Letters of yours by me received, were those which yong Mr.
<hi>Hopton</hi> brought hither, since which time, we have understood by report from
<hi>Roan,</hi> that on <hi>Thursday</hi> was sevennight there was a general slaughter made at
<hi>Roan</hi> of all that could be imagined Protestants, so as the very channels of the
street did run blood; we have heard diversly of <hi>Rochel,</hi> by some, that it is sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Strozzi,</hi> by some, that it holdeth out, and that it is like so to do a long
time. As to the Ambassadors negociation here with us, to seek to perswade
us, that the King was forced for safety of his own life, to cause the execution
to be done as it was, and that thereof we shall see the proofs by the Admirals
process, you may imagine how hard a thing it is for us to be so perswaded against
all our naturall senses, and how they will accord these two jars we know not.
The Kings Letter first written after the Admirals death, doth declare it to be
done by manner of sedition, and privately by the house of <hi>Guise,</hi> who feared
the Admiral and his would pursue against them the avenge for his hurt, and
the Kings own guard about the Admiral was forced, and the King himself
driven to hold his guards about him in the <hi>Louvre</hi> for his own defence; and
now yet it must needs be notified, that the King did for his own surety cause
the execution to be done. By the dispatch that you shall receive from Master
Secretary, you shall understand what answer is made to the French Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and upon what sort her Majestie hath forborn to resolve upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview,
whereof her Majestie hath no misliking, if it may appear that the
King will forbear from persecuting the cause of Religion ACHE Rome
A B Glasis, nevertheless, it will be very hard to perswade 3lca to like there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
I have imparted to her Majestie two things, whereof your wife had in
charge to make me privy of.</p>

                  <p>IT may please you to advertise her Majestie, that at the time of the receit of
her Letters of the seven and twentieth of September, being through my
late sickness in that state of strength, as I could not without danger go out of
my lodging, I desired Monsieur <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>esir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> who at that instant was sent by
Queen Mother to visit me, that I had by Letters lately received somewhat to
communicate to her Majestie, which thing I could not do in person, without
some peril; and therefore desired him to know of the King and Queen Mother,
whether it were their pleasures that I should communicate it unto them by
my Secretary; or whether it would please them otherwise to send some hither
to my lodging, to receive that I had to say unto them; whereof when Monsieur
<hi>Mannesire</hi> had made relation unto their Majesties, which was the fourth of this
present, the next day they sent <hi>Brulart,</hi> one of the Secretaries of the Estate,
and the said <hi>Mannesire,</hi> to receive that which I had to propound unto their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
here from her Majestie: So a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> their access, I communicated unto them,
what was propounded by their Ambassador to her Majestie, and what was
her Majesties answer unto the same. I also shewed them, how hard it was
for her Majestie to think, considering the great severity intended towards
those who professed one Religion with her, that the King should think his
brother a fit husband for her, or that there could grow, continue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
that love that ought to be between the husband and the wife. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
shewed them, that she desired to understand roundly and frankly what
the King meant by the great Army of Ships, and Men of War, which
have been so long time betwixt <hi>Rochel</hi> and <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Strozzie;</hi> which she desired to know the rather, for that divers
of her Merchants have been spoiled, some of their Goods and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes,
others of their Artillery, and some also slain; for that the same
kind of dealing is very much contrary to the Amity professed lately.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I did recommend the Vidams case, according to such instructions as
I received from him, delivering her Majesties Letters unto <hi>Brulart,</hi> to prese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
unto the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:54478:144"/>
The seventh of the same, <hi>Brulart</hi> onely came unto me with the King and
Queen Mothers answer: After some speech had that the King and Queen Mother
were sorry for my sickness, he shewed me, that Monsieur <hi>la Mot</hi> and I did agree
touching the relation of that which passed betwixt her Majestie and him. And as
touching the first point, the King and Queen Mothers answer w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, the process of
the Admiral was still in hand, which so soon as it shall be finished, shall be sent to
her according to his promise; notwithstanding, he had well hoped that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
without any further suspence, would have given credit to his word, as he
would have done in like case.</p>
                  <p>Touching the second, his answer was, that he was glad, as well by <hi>la Mot</hi> as by
me, to understand that her Majestie did accept in so good part his assurance touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his intention to continue good amity with her, and so she doth concur with
him in like affection.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the third, that as he desired the continuance of Amity, so did
he desire the marriage propounded for the encrease of the same; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wisheth, that the enterview might proceed, as a mean to accomplish
the same; and that whereas <hi>la Mot</hi> declared, that the Queen Mothers inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was to come over, that they misliked the same; for that her meaning was
rightly conceived by me in this sort, that if her Majestie would be content to
come to <hi>Dover,</hi> she would then repair to <hi>Callis</hi> or <hi>Bulloign,</hi> and conclude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them some certain mean for the enterview.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning that point, whereas her Majestie doth desire to understand
the Kings intention touching <hi>Strozzies</hi> Army; his answer is, that he hath
lately given order for the disposition of the same, whereof two thousand of them
are drawn to other parts to furnish the Frontiers in <hi>Picardie,</hi> in respect of the
two great Armies that are in the Low-Countreys; and that the King had never
intention to imploy them any way to the disturbance of her Majestie, whose
amity he meaneth earnestly to imbrace. And further, his answer was, That
whereas violence had been used towards her Merchants, aswel in body as in goods,
that he was most sorry for the same; and therefore he had expresly written to the
<hi>Baron de la Guarde,</hi> as also to the Governors of the rest of the Ports, to see her
Majesties Subjects well and friendly used, as appertained to good amity; and
that the King of late had caused a ship of <hi>Acerbo Velutellis,</hi> one abiding in <hi>England</hi>
to be released.</p>
                  <p>Touching her Majesties request for the <hi>Vidam,</hi> his answer was, That as he
would be glad any way to gratifie her Majestie, so could he not grant this her
request, without touch of his honour, to suffer any of his Subjects to live in a
Forreign Countrey, with a kind of defiance of his sincerity, and therefore he
hoped that her Majestie would not desire the Vidams benefit with his prejudice;
notwithstanding, for the gratefying of her Majestie, he can be content, that the
Vidam shall return home, and enjoy his livings here with such surety, as he

I can imploy any man in <hi>Brittain</hi> towards the sea-side, as well for the

not what. I think it were good to imploy some Western Barque that way,

The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> of late, hath often conference with certain of the Scotish
Guard, though sithence the late murther, he sheweth outwardly some miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.
He was never in greater jollity then presently he is, especially since
the news of the Prince of <hi>Orange'</hi> s retiring.</p>
                  <p>They begin now to discourse here, that it would be a deed of charity for
the Princes, Catholiques, not onely to set the Queen of Scots at liberty,
but also to restore her to her right: Her Majestie is not ignorant what I have
written touching the opinion of wise men, what is to be done in that behalf for
her safety: If that sore be not saved, I fear we shall have a Bartholomew
Breakfast, or a Florence Banq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

here.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Grandmont</hi> hath Commission from the King, to suppress all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Countrey of <hi>Berry,</hi> and to plant there the Catholique Religion, which is
a verification of the Kings intention touching the observation of his Edict irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
for the tolleration of Religion.</p>
                  <p>For that I hear that all Scotish men are stayed at the Ports that come hence, I
will make some stay to give them passports: if the stay proceeded in respect of
carrying over of secret <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

thereof that way, for that the Scotish Ambassadors Letters do pass in the
Kings Pacquets: methinks the return of the Scots might rather do good then
harm, for that the most part of them detest their proceedings here; the report
whereof will do no harm to the furtherance of the accord. I would be glad
to understand her Majesties pleasure, especially for the Lord <hi>Levingston.</hi> I and
mine, and divers of our Nation, never received the like pleasure at their hands,
as lately we have done.</p>
                  <p>I have stayed for her Majesties service here, Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> by whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
good assistance; I would therefore he might receive some good words
from her Majestie to encourage him in the same, for he is one that hath very
very good parts in him, and may hereafter grow a good and profitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                  <p>Touching my return home, I hope her Majestie will have just considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of me, who do now remain here without her benefit, for a colour of their
Ministers there, to practise that thing there which is to her danger. And so
leaving further to trouble your honour at this present, I most humbly take

there vvith you, vvhich giveth me no small light to direct my course here; and yet
vvhat direction can I receive, that may vvell guide me, vvhere I find neither faith
nor constancy to build on; it should but minister unto you grief, for me to ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this matter, and no great contentment to my self: It is our part novv rather to
think on some remedies for the mischiefs that are like to come, then to rest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
vvith the passed miseries. I am sorry to hear that the accord in <hi>Scotland</hi>
is not made; and yet so long as <hi>la Crocque</hi> remaineth in <hi>Scotland,</hi> vvhat
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54478:145"/>
cause have we to hope after it, seeing that upon this alteration, the end of his stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is rather to impeach then to further the same, if we think otherwise,
we do but dream our selves. I am sorry to see the Ambassadors fair speech take
such place as it doth; methinks the late &amp; fresh experience we have had of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity,
should teach us to take profit of others harms. Surely considering how
things do proceed here, and weighing the great presumption there is, how that
the tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Monarchies of <hi>Europe</hi> are bent, not onely to disquiet, but also to displace
her Majestie, and to substitute some other, it were no more then necessary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
to cut them off from so convenient a footing place as Scotland is, which
thing might easily be brought to pass, if her Majestie would proceed roundly,
weighing that the Scots are not a little alienated from this Nation, upon this late
accident: If her Majestie would joyn pensio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s with perswasions, the thing in my
opinion might easily be brought to pass, not only to unite them under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the King, but also divide them from such League and Allyance as
they have with this Crown.</p>
                  <p>There is, Sir, as you know, another remedie, which as it hath been long sithence
needful to put in execution, so was it never more needful then presently. If her
Majestie stick now to spend or put in execution all those things that tend to her
safety, she must not long look to live in repose, nay, she must not long look to
keep the Crown upon her head. The cause of her former quietness, proceeded
of her neighbours unquietness; which being removed, she must now make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account. The Admiral is now dead, and the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> liveth; the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is retired out of Flanders, but the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> remaineth
there still: I need not to conclude, for that to mans judgement it is apparent what
will follow. Is it time now, think you, Sir, to stir, or is it not time to omit any
remedy that may tend to her Majesties safety? As far as I can learn, there is
none yet sent to deal with the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and yet there is here almost
daily conference between the Popes Nuncio, the Ambassador of Spain, and
them here, they omit nothing that may tend to our peril. I would we were as
careful not to omit any thing that may tend to our safety. It may be said,
that I fear too much. Surely, considering the state we stand in, I think it less
danger to fear too much then to little. It may be said also, that the jealousie that
Spain hath of the greatness of France, will not suffer him to indure to let France
have any footing in England, and that like affection reigning in France, if <hi>Spain</hi>
should attempt any thing. I confess it to be true, and yet I see no reason, but that
they both may consent to advance a third person, who pretendeth right to the
Crown, especially being provoked thereto by the Pope, which is my chief fear.</p>
                  <p>It may also be alledged, that the offer of the marriage sheweth that they have
no evil meaning towards her Majestie. First, it may be doubted, whether consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how now adays their speech and meaning disagreeth, they offer as they mean.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whether their intention of offering the said Match, tend to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
or no. I was not heretofore so forward in believing all friendly offers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
of sincerity, as I am now ready to think the same to proceed of abuse, only
to lull us asleep in security; for any thing that I can perceive, the best way not
to be deceived by them, is not to trust them. The Gentleman himself who is
offered, I think honourably of him; and if I could think so well of the rest, I
would then believe that their outward speech did consent to their inward mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but the case standing as it doth, I know not what to think. I cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this doubtful case, but make her Majestie and my Lords of the Councel
acquainted with these proceedings, and leave to them to gather what may be their
meaning here, Methinks Queen Mothers calling back of her word touching her
coming into England, doth shew that they but dally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:54478:145"/>
It is not likely that the Ambassador, without Commission, would otherwise
have made the offer, besides the cold answer made to her Majesties request for
the <hi>Vidame,</hi> doth shew how they are affected.</p>
                  <p>To gratifie the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> those 800 that came from <hi>Montz,</hi> were put
to the sword. Methinks if there were that good will that they profess, they
should not have sticked with her Majestie, in granting her request for the <hi>Vidam,</hi>
a thing both hononourable and profitable; all circumstances considered, I see
rather mischief to be looked for, then friendship from hence, and therefore I
cannot tell with what safety her Majestie may repair to <hi>Burd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the contrary I would be loth, having no other ground but suspicion. I
think the danger will be the less, so long as <hi>Rochel</hi> holdeth out. And so leaving

Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>YOur Lorpships of <hi>September</hi> 25 I have received, beseeching you to pardon
me, in that I presently in answering of the same, am driven to use the help
and hand of another, being not yet, after my sickness, restored to that strength as I
can indure well to write. I perceive that your Lordship, by the contrary here, is
void of the Ambassadors speech, doth well enough discern, that the late cruelty
here executed, is void of all manner of just defence; and therefore in Gods just
judgement is like to receive just punishment; and if the same doth not happen so
soon as we desire, our sins is the let. They here are so far imbrued in blood, as
there is no end of their cruelty; for no Town escapeth, where any of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is found, without general murthering and sacking of them, and yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
all this to be done against their will, though it be evidently known that it is
done by their Commandment. This manner of proceeding seemeth to all men
so strange, as no man can tell what to judge of it, openly no man dare but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it, privately few are found that do not utterly detest it.</p>
                  <p>I have not heretofore been so ready to commend their sincerity, as I am now
forced to set down their infidelity; surely I cannot see that all their fair speeches
and friendly offers tend to any other end but to abuse, which would well appear,
if they were seized of <hi>Rochel.</hi> In the mean while, I do not think the contrary,
but that they will provoke the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> now, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
retireth into <hi>Germany,</hi> who of himself is enough bent, as your Lordship know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
to execute somewhat long time practised in <hi>England,</hi> to the danger and
disturbance of her Majestie. It is the opinion here of all men of judgem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt, that
her Majestie is to look for any mischief that either <hi>Spain</hi> or this Crown can yield.
And therefore if she shall not now seek to quiet her self, they do not see any
reason for her long to hope to keep the Crown upon her head. The
matter of it self is so apparent, as he is of mean discourse that doth not
so think.</p>
                  <p>The House of <hi>Guise,</hi> who since the late murther seem to have some miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
was never to the outward shew in greater favor, nor in greater jollity.
He hath often conference with such Scotishmen as are here of the Kings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Scotland,</hi> though her Maj. pay dear for it, as mony may do much with that nation.
I would both the union were made amongst them, and they reduced under the
Kings Government, and divided from such allyance as they have with this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If these great Monarchies may have <hi>Scotland</hi> for their footing, I fear the
event will be over dangerous.</p>
                  <p>The Popes Legate, who is at <hi>Avinion,</hi> hath sent hither in post his Secretary,
to know the Kings pleasure, what his resolution is touching his access; as I hear,
the King will not yield thereto; for the same will make it apparent to the
world, what the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his intention is. They think they may deal
more covertly, bringing the matters better to pass, then by such open kind of
dealing.</p>
                  <p>I cannot decypher any thing, whether they proceed sincerely touching the
pretended match; for my opinion, I think of it, as of the rest of their friendly
offers, that these tend to nothing but to abuse.</p>
                  <p>Of late, since the news of the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> retiring out of <hi>Flanders,</hi>
they seem not to be desirous thereof as before. I judge, if they were once seized
of <hi>Rochel,</hi> they will begin to renew their suit for the Queen of Scots, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
attempt somewhat for her delivery. Their silence they use, maketh me
to suspect the more, seeing the Queen of Scots friends bear such sway in the
Court.</p>

know your Lordship is careful of your self for the same. And so leaving fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>IMmediately upon the receit of your Lordships Letters of the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
of September, I requested Captain <hi>Lassetty,</hi> whom your Lordship
knoweth, and is most willing to do your Lordship any service, as one whom
he most honoureth, and thinketh himself most bound unto, to make enquiry
whether there were any of his Nation excellent in riding unplaced, and had
any desire to go into <hi>England.</hi> After search made by him, he found some
unplaced, and in that profession very excellent; but the entertainment they
require is so unreasonable, and so far exceedeth your Lordships offer, as I dare
not deal with them. They ask 300 Crowns a year, besides meat and drink,
and the finding of their horse, and the least they can be reduced unto is 200
Crowns. True it is, that such of the Noblemen as entertain them, do give
them no less wages: He useth towards them what perswasions he may, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to think that 150 Crowns in <hi>England</hi> will go further then 300
here; but as yet, no perswasions will serve to make them so to think: I say
therefore, to conclude any thing with them I mind not, until I hear further
from your Lordship.</p>
                  <p>Of late, doubting that there is no good meant towards you from hence, and
having some cause to suspect some Irish practises, and knowing that Capt. <hi>Lassetty</hi>
doth understand the state and weakness of that Countrey. I have entertained him
with some hope to be entertained of her Majestie; his imperfections I know
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54478:146"/>
well enough, notwithstanding his service may be profitable; and if it be to no
other end, yet were the entertainment of him necessary in respect of the harm
he may do. At all times when any danger did seem to grow towards her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
he hath requested me to present to her his service: though that Nation be
very much inclined to treason, yet surely I think him in that point to stand much
upon his honor Because I would be loath long in vain to entertain him with that
hope, I beseech your Lordship that I may by the next hear what your opinion is
in this behalf. Captain <hi>Massino del Beni,</hi> whom your Lordship knoweth, who
is now retired into <hi>Germany,</hi> requested me to desire your Lordship to offer his
service unto her Majesty, who in respect of Religion, and the zeal and honor he
beareth towards her Majesty, would be glad to sacrifice his life in her defence. If
your Lordship think the same might be received, then would he repair thither:
if otherwise, he would be glad to know it, because he meaneth to take some
other course to direct himself. I am the willinger at this point to offer the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of Souldiers, for that I fear her Maiesty shall have iust cause to use them,
considering how slenderly we are furnished at home, for now that the Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> is retired, her Majesty may not long look to live in repose; I am sorry
that the union of <hi>Scotland</hi> is not already made, which I fear will be cause of both
their and our ruine. If that footing-place were taken away from our foraign
enemies, our danger would be the lesse. Money will do any thing with that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as your Lordship knoweth, which if her Majesty stick to disburse, she shall
find neither profit nor surety in it. The tempest that hangeth over our head is
to mans judgment apparent so great, as if she overslip any remedy that may be
used, she must not long look to keep the State that she now enjoyeth. If the
great strength and power of her enemies be weighed with her weakness, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
cannot but seem the greater, if any thing be omitted to be done, that may

                     </gap>end to her safety. If <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> be united, and such unsound mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
cut off as have been the cause of inward corruption, both her enemies shall
have less will to attempt any thing against her safety, and she remain in less pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill
of such mischiefs as otherwise are like to fall upon her. Violent diseases must
have violent remedies: if her Majesty do not not now think her State to stand
in extremity things at home well considered, both she and the same are in more
danger. I beseech your Lordship to pardon my passion in this behalf; the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I have of the evill meaning here towards her Majesty, maketh me to be thus
carried away as I am. And so leaving further to trouble your Lordship at this

to the destruction of all sorts of her Majesties Religion, which also is not ceased
to her Majesties understanding, cannot but argue this manner of motion very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
and besides ingender in the subjects of this Realm such conceits as it were
a dangerous thing for Councellors to be so careless of their Prince, as to give ear
to such motions; and it is the stranger now to make this motion by letters of the
23 of September, when the French Ambassador the same 23 of September did
say at <hi>Reading</hi> to the Queens Majesty, that the Queen Mother was content to
come into any place of this Realm, which is now strangely changed, that the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ueens Majesty should come to her over the Sea to the coast of <hi>France,</hi> being
more then three days sailing, except she might have wind at her commandment.
And in this matter also the Queens Majesty can give no answer untill she hear
answer from her Ambassador to her letters sent after the Kings letters were dated.
As to the offer of continuance of Amity, &amp; renewing the League by a new Oath,
the Queens Majesty meaneth nothing more then to continue the Amity. And
for renewing of any Oath, she knoweth no cause of her part to be required a new
Oath, for that she hath not violated the same, nor meaneth to do, and trusteth as
much in the Kings part that he will keep it without any new Oath. As for the
proceeding for the establishing of a commerce in certain Towns in <hi>France,</hi> it is
over-evident by the late murther in <hi>Roan</hi> (which the King saith was by the mean
people) how unmeet it were at this time to motion such a matter unto her Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
who be now marvellously intimerated, and before these murthers did
hear not most willingly thereof, because of divers evill treatments that they
have suffered at <hi>Roan</hi> and divers other places; and therefore this matter is to be
suspended untill the Merchants may understand that the King shall have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
the late murthers at <hi>Roan,</hi> that they shall not attempt the like another
time upon them, and that they may perceive that the King is so willing to do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
upon the Catholiques, which may have the murtherers, that they may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
them, that under his protection they may go safe, and not fear the rage of
the furious people.</p>
                  <p>As to the sending of the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> or Lord Treasurer after the
Queens avouchment, her Majesty indeed is very sorry that there is such an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of occasion of doing such an office; for as her Majesty before had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to have sent either one of them, or such other, as should be as agreeable to
the King, so now there is to all the world one great cause that her Majesty may
not with honor, nor with law of nature send any whom she loveth to be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as it seemeth they may be, though the King have never so good a meaning:
For by the death of so many whom the King doth not avow, nor yet punish the
murtherers, what surety can strangers have, especially when the King pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
as by his own letters appeareth, that it is the fury of the Catholiques against
those of the Religion.</p>
                  <p>As to the difficulties found by her Ambassadors return, and to leave a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
there in respect of the danger wherein he is at this time, her Majesty think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that the King might otherwise think thereof; for when he saith, he will
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54478:147"/>
revoke also his Ambassador from hence, if hers should come for a time: It is
well known with what liberty and surety his Ambassador may and doth travell
in this Realm, who may go when he will without danger, and without fear of
mind do his negotiation: where contrariwise her Ambassador dare not go out
of his doors without a guard, being to his great charge and disquieting. And
so the Queens request is to have her Ambassador from thence but for such a
time as the tempest may cease in <hi>France,</hi> and the murtherers be in awe of the
King by Justice.</p>

                  <p>SIR, I shewed to the Queens Majesty and my Lords of the Councell, both
your letters to me written the 8 of this instant; the one contained your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,
the other was a discourse both wisely written, and very well liked. On
Thursday last, Monsieur <hi>du Crocque</hi> was here, and had audience given him by
my Lord Treasurer, my Lord Chamberlain, and my Lord of Leicester, because
the Queens Majesty was not at time perfectly whole of the small Pox, as the
Physicians did say, although her Majesty and a great sort more, will not have it
so, now it makes no matter what it was, thanks be to God she is perfectly whole,
and no sign thereof left in her face. On Sunday he had his answer given unto
the Steward of his house, the sum and substance whereof I send you here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed,
whereby you may know his negotiation which was long in words to make
us believe better of that King then yet we can; and replied, as I understand, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
enough, although in that Prince and Countrey who have so openly
and injuriously done against Christ, who is Truth, Sincerity, Faith, Pitie, Mercy,
Love, and Charity, nothing can be too sharply and severely answered; Yet
Princes you know are acquainted with nothing but <hi>Doulceur,</hi> so must be handled
with <hi>Doulceur,</hi> especially amongst and between Princes. And therefore to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
as you may perceive not that they may think the Queens Majesty and
her Councell such fools, that we know not what is to be done, and yet that we
should not appear so rude and barbarous, as to provoke where no profit is to any
man I think, I for my part do not doubt but you will use this answer as you
were wont, gravely and wisely, for the King there will look to have it, as well at
your hands as at his Ambassadors.</p>
                  <p>You are carefull (as wisdom doth lead you) of the wel-doing here in England,
which needs must be well esteemed of her Majesty and all her Councell; and I
tell you, we are not so remiss and negligent as peradventure another that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, would think. In time things be done unlooked for as well for mischief,
as that was in France, as to good and remedy, where God giveth grace and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection.
Truth it is, that God disposeth all whatsoever a man doth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as Divines do say: and it is his gift, if wise men do provide for mischief to
to come; and yet whatsoever they do devise, the event doth come of him
onely, who is the God of hope and fear beyond hope and expectation; because
you shall understand, that even the Scots our neighbours be awakened by your
Beacons in France, I have sent you a Scotish proclamation herewith, <hi>Du
Crocque</hi> and <hi>Viracque</hi> have already taken their leave of Scotland, and be come
to Barwick. The 20 of this moneth they appointed to be here at Court. By
that we can see the Lords in Scotland draw neerer and neerer to an accord, that
rather it is in hope then in despair. These cruelties in France have helped not a
little, and now continuing much more will: You gave good advice that all
Scotish men should not be stayed, no more they be not; some of the late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
have given the rest in Scotland a good—to make them awake,
yet there may also be false brethren come amongst them; which as reason is,
shall be stayed and sent back if they may be known. Yet it is true, <hi>That much
water goeth by the Mill that the Miller knoweth not of;</hi> but mans wisdom must
provide as much as may be, as it would, always it cannot. The answer of the
Ambassador may justly seem to you to debar your coming home, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
it longer then you would: yet I assure you, your friends do not cease by all
means possible to provoke her Majesty so much as may be for your Revocation,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54478:148"/>
and her Majesty is as carefull for you as any Prince may be for such a subject as
you are, of whom assure you her Highness maketh no small account, and so it
is reason.</p>
                  <p>You know that things go here slowly with much respect of irresolution; but
for my part I hope to see you here shortly, there shall no occasion be left which
I will not take to further it. Although your friends here be as forward as may
be, yet your wife ceaseth not continually to cry on them.</p>

principall Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIR, it may please you to advertise her Majesty, that of late the King and
Queen mother have had sundry conferences with the Scotish Ambassador,
to whom there is repaired out of <hi>Flanders</hi> one English Gentleman called
<hi>Tempest,</hi> and another called <hi>Musgrave,</hi> servant unto the Earl of <hi>Westmerland,</hi>
they both have also access unto the Duke <hi>de Aumale,</hi> and to his Nephew the
the Duke of <hi>Guyse. Davy Chambers</hi> since his return out of England, hath had
also conference both with the King and the House of <hi>Guyse,</hi> who hath let fall
these words, how that the death and execution of the Earl of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
hath increased the number of the Queen of Scots friends; and that she is
now grown to have such a party in England, as that five or six thousand shot, with
some good Leaders, will make her strong enough to encounter any forces her
Majesty can make.</p>
                  <p>It is also secretly whispered in Court, that there is some new practice in hand
for the Queen of Scots delivery, the particularities I can by no means decipher;
but the circumstances of these conferences well weighed, the conjecture is great,
that there's somwhat a hatching.</p>
                  <p>Little <hi>Douglas</hi> who conveyed the Queen of Scots out of <hi>Loughtean</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
out of hand into Scotland; who besides other conference with the King,
hath had long conference with the Queen mother, the Ambassador being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>And so for other matters, referring your Honor to this Bearers report touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divers particularities, I most humbly take my leave.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I most humbly desire your Honor to further a most reasonable suit, that this
Bearer my Secretary is to prefer unto her Majesty, as wel in respect of his great
travell already taken under me in her Majesties service, as also for that thereby
he may receive encou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the experience of his service, and the good parts that are in him, may hereafter
grow able to serve her Majesty in a better calling. For my own part, I have no
means to recompence him, as you, Sir, well know; and if therefore the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
grow not by her Majesty, neither he nor any other shall have courage to
serve in aservice both so dangerous and painfull as this is wherein he serveth.
And so not doubting of any furtherance you may yeid him, I leave to trouble
your Honor any further, taking my leave.</p>

                  <p>SIR, I am glad by your Letters to receive some hope that there is good
care taken to prevent such mischiefs as may happen; notwithstanding untill
such time as the root of the evill be removed, it is rather to dream of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
then to apply such as the disease requireth.</p>
                  <p>I am glad to hear that there is some hope that they will grow to an accord in
Scotland: if that postern gate were shut up, and other inward medicines applied,
and her Majesty strengthened with the outward Amity of the Almain Princes,
she should be the more esteemed and feared of those that mean her not great
good. And though the remedies may seem chargeable, yet considering the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the same; and that they may avoid both great charges and no small dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
I hope her Majesty will prefer safety before cost, especially when the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Surely Sir, the more I observe their doings here, the more I increase my jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of their evill meaning. They never spake more fair to the Admirall, then a
few dayes before he died; nothing was demanded by him that was not granted,
insomuch that <hi>Tilligni</hi> said to a Gentleman, a friend of his a few days before the
execution, that their liberall granting of requests without any difficulty, did
make him to suspect some unsound and hollow meaning, and thereupon alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Italian Proverb,—They never used fairer speech then presently they
do, nor greater protestations of Amity; and because it is more then was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed,
and is now at such time as we have cause to suspect the contrary, I
cannot but be jealous of her Majesties safety, so long as any thing is left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
that tendeth to her Majesties preservation. And so leaving further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
your honour with my jealousies and fears, I most humbly take my leave,

                  <p>SIR, although I had no express commandement from her Majesty to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
unto the King and Queen Mother such an answer as was yeilded
unto those things that were propounded by their Ambassador here, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
I thought it convenient to impart the same unto Queen Mother, as she
that hath the Helm in hand, to see in what sort the said answer would be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
at my access unto her; I shewed her at large, that the Ambassador had
propounded four things unto certain Deputies by her Majesty of her Councell,
she being through sickness in that time, in state not to give audience.</p>
                  <p>To the first touching the Enterview</p>
                  <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> touching the confirmation of the league, with renewing of the Oath.</p>
                  <p>The third touching the establishing of Traffique.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:54478:149"/>
The fourth the Kings requests to have the Lord Treasurer, or the Earle of
Leicester come over after the Queens delivery.</p>
                  <p>To these four Requests I made her acquainted with such answers as were
made unto the same.</p>
                  <p>To the first touching the time, she said, that she wrote unto the Ambassador,
that in respect of the young Queens delivery, (which she thought would have
been ere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>his time) the meeting could not be before the twentieth of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
and that therefore he should move it against that time, not meaning that
it should be so precisely set down, but it should be referred chiefly to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
choice.</p>
                  <p>To the second, touching the place, she shewed me, that forasmuch as she had
never intention to come over, the same being mistaken by the Ambassador, and
that the interview by Sea was thought inconvenient, hearing that the Isles of
<hi>Iersey</hi> did belong unto her Majesty, she thought that that was a convenient
place for the said Enterview, and therfore she caused the Ambassador to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it, protesting that the same was void of any evill meaning or intention,
and that there were Letters written to the Ambassador for that purpose before
the late execution here.</p>
                  <p>To the second, touching the renewing of the Oath, she said that the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
of advertisements from the Ambassador, that her Majesty should say, that
she could not tell what accompt or assurance to make of the late League con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
whereupon the King willed him to make offer unto her, that what she
could devise for the assurance and faithful keeping of the same, he would most
willingly put in execution; and thereupon willed him to offer, that if her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
should think it requisite, the same should be confirmed by a new oath; and
as for my self (saith she) considering the same had not been violated of either
party, I concur with your Mistres in opinion, thinking the same needless.</p>
                  <p>To the third, touching the establishing of Traffique, she said she saw some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to think her Majesties answer reasonable; That the time seemeth now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper;
considering the late disorder at <hi>Roan;</hi> notwithstanding the Kings mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was to take such order as well for the punishing of offenders, as for the well
using of Merchants, as that they should have no just cause to fear, to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the King had written both to <hi>Caranges</hi> the Governour, as also to the chief
President there.</p>
                  <p>Touching the fourth, concerning the Kings request for the coming over either of
the Lord Treasurer, or the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> she said that the same also proceeded
of advertisement from the Ambassador, that he thought that if their Majesties
would require the coming over of either of them, after the Queens delivery, that
the same would be yielded to; whereupon the King gave him Commission to
move her Majesty in that behalf, he desiring nothing more then one of them,
to whom he knew he might communicate matters of weight as frankly as unto
her Majesty; and as touching any peril that might happen unto them, she said
that the King would take such order for safety, as they should be in no less surety
here then at home in her own realm.</p>
                  <p>To that I replied, that it would be very hard for her Majesty or any other to
be so perswaded in that behalf, for that it was not possible any disorder in a State
could be reduced to order without punishment, and that therefore neither
stranger nor their own subjects can make accompt to be in safety within their
government, so long as the malefactors should remain unpunished. To this she
said, that the injuries done by those of the Religion against the Catholiques were
so great, as it was hard to bridle the peoples fury, especially upon the discovery
of this new Treason; notwithstanding such order was taken, that no publique
person or Ambassador should be touched.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:54478:150"/>
This was the sum of her reply unto such answers as were made by her
Majesty to the Ambassador there. I made her also acquainted with her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
answer to the Ambassador touching my Revocation. To the which she
said, That the world would judge some alteration to be between the two Crowns
if any such thing should be done, without sending some other to supply my place.
I then delivered her a copie of the three Requests given to the Ambassador,
there to be exhibited unto their Majesties here in the behalf of the Merchants,
wherein she promised that there should be such order taken, as should be to the
contentment of her Majesty, and the safety of her subjects, and that already the
matter had been considered of.</p>
                  <p>Being given to understand, that the Baron <hi>de la Garde</hi> was arrived here, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
her Majesty, that if it would please her to deal earnestly with him, as
well for the release of those English ships that were stayed already, as also to give
order that those that are now presently to repair to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> may pass to &amp; fro
in safety without any molestation, either with the Gallies or of the other ships
there. Whereupon she sent unto me the next day the said Baron <hi>de la Garde,</hi>
who after long circumstances used of the great good will he bare unto her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Father, and to her Majesty her selfe, and to our Nation, assured me, that the
ships that were staied were delivered: That he had taken order before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from <hi>Brouage,</hi> that our Merchants should pass freely without any molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or trouble; and that there were already some passed, whom onely he did
forbid that they should not touch at the Road before <hi>Rochel:</hi> he shewed me
that he had received such strait commandement at her Majesties hands, for the
well usage of our Merchants, as I might assure my selfe they should have no
just cause to complain. She requested me in the conclusion of our talk, to write
unto her Majesty, that she was given to understand, that one <hi>Sorez</hi> their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
lately retired hither, did seek some shipping there within her Majesties Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
she therefore desired her that she would take order for some restraint
to be made in that behalf, for that he is so ill an Instrument, as he would be
glad to do somthing to breed unkindness between the two Crowns, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
she said she hoped her Majesty would avoid. Moreover she shewed me,
that divers of her subjects did complain of injuries done unto them by certain
ships that lye about the Downs and the Isle of Wight, and therefore desired
me to write unto her Majesty, that there might be some redress given in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
And so leaving to trouble your Honor any fnrther at this present, I most
humbly take my leave.</p>

               <body>
                  <head>To the right honorable Sir Thomas Smith, her Majesties principall
Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIR, it may please you to advertise her Majesty, that the young Queen was
brought to bed of a daughter the 22 of October, whose Nativity was conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
with the blood of <hi>Briquemont</hi> and <hi>Cavannes,</hi> who the same day between
the hours of 5 and 6 in the evening, were hanged by Torch-light, the King,
Queen mother, and the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> with the Kings brethren, and
Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being lookers on. As <hi>Briquemont</hi> was going up the ladder the
Under-Provost of the Town said, that the King had sent him to know whether
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54478:150"/>
he could say any thing touching the late Conjuration, which if he would
confess, he would save his life. Whereunto he answered, that the King had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a more faithful nor a more truer subject then he was; but this I know pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not of himself, but of evil Counsellours about him; and so lifting up his
eyes to heaven, he said, O my God, upon whose Tribunal Seat I stand, and
whose face I hope shortly to see, thou knowest well that I know nothing, nor
did not so much as once think of any Conjuration against the King, nor against
his Estate; though contrariwise they have untruly put the same in my process;
but I beseech my God, that he will pardon the King, and all those that have
been the cause of this my unjust death, even as I desire pardon at thy hands for
my sins and offences committed against thy Divine Majestie. Being then drawn
up another step on the ladder, he uttered onely these words, I have somewhat
to utter unto the King, which I would be glad to communicate unto him; but
(said he) I see that I may not; and so shrunk up his shoulders, to forbear to use
any further speech. As his constancy generally was much commended, so was
his death much bewailed of many Catholiques that were beholders of the
same. <hi>Cavannes</hi> used no speech, but shewed himself void of all magnanimity,
who before his death, in hope of life, made some shew to relent in Religion.
Two things were generally much misliked at this execution; the one, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the King, as a thing unworthy the Head of justice, to be at the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of justice; the other, that <hi>Briquemont,</hi> being a Gentleman, was
hanged, a thing very rare in France, especially he being reputed of his
enemies to be innocent of that thing which lately had been laid to his
charge.</p>
                  <p>About an hour after the execution, the cruel and bloody people of this
Town, not content with their death, took them down from the Gallows,
and drew them about the streets, thrusting them through their bodies with dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and shooting of dags at them, cutting off their ears, and omitting no
other kind of villanous and barbarous cruelty. It was thought also, that there
should have been another general day of execution, of as many as have been
known at any time to have been of the Religion; the stay whereof, I am
credibly informed, was procured by the Queen Mother, who with no small
difficulty and intercession, obtained the same at the Kings hands, who protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the same was but deferred for a time. The King is grown now so bloody
minded, as they that advised him thereto do repent the same; and do fear that
the old saying will prove true, <hi>Malum consilium consultori pessimum.</hi> At the
time of my Congratulation of the birth of the child, I used these speeches
following to the King:</p>
                  <p>Sir, knowing the mutual good will that is between my Mistris the Queen and
your Majestie, as between whom good and evil, pleasures and displeasures are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
I could do no less, being her Minister here, but congratulate as well the
prosperous delivery of the Queen your Majesties wife, as also the Nativity of
the yong Princess your daughter, who is, as it were, a pledge of some issue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
to follow, that may hereafter supply the Royal Seat that you presently
enjoy; which when it cometh to pass, no Prince, Neighbor, Ally or Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
will be more glad thereof then the Queens Majestie my Mistris. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the King answered, after private thanks given unto me for the office of
Congratulation, that I did use such speech as appertained to the good amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; which was, That pleasures and displeasures should be common to
either of them; which as I look for no less a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> my good sisters hands your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris,
so she may assure her self, saith he, at my hands; and I wish that my Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
might have occasion to use like office of Congratulation towards h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54478:151"/>
as you do here towards me. I thanked his Majestie for wishing that wish, for
that it was a general desire to as many as truly loved her Majestie. As I was
taking my leave, he told me, that they of <hi>Rochel,</hi> against whom he did
mean presently to send his Forces, did give out, that her Majestie promiseth
to send them succours; which thing (saith he) I do not believe, considering
the good intelligence that is between us. To this I replyed, that if his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
should give credit to any such thing, he should do her Majestie great wrong,
considering the late protestation I made unto him on her Majesties behalf, that
her meaning was not to do any thing that may tend to the violating of the late
League concluded between them. As for the Brutes given out by them of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi>
who are now in desperation; I shewed him, that men in that state are
glad to give out any thing that may draw others to joyn with them in assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
He answered, that he believed it was so. And so I took my leave of
him. I was then brought unto Queen Mother, unto whom I used like speech
of Congratulation. After which speech, I shewed her, that the King had made
me acquainted with certain brutes given out by them of <hi>Rochel,</hi> of some ayd
promised by her Majestie, which thing very honourably (said I) he protesteth
he would not believe. Whereupon she shewed me, how it was true, that certain
Letters were lately intercepted, sent by them of <hi>Rochel,</hi> in the which there
was mention made that her Majestie underhand had promised to assist them,
that the Count <hi>Montgomery</hi> would repair unto them with the said assistance,
but for my part, saith she, I know the Queen your Mistris to be too honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and too wise to intermeddle in any such matter, who I know will give the
King my son leave to deal with his subjects, as shall seem best unto himself. I
shewed her, that in so judging of her Majestie, she judged rightly; and that I
hoped she would give more credit to her Majesties late protestation touching the
inviolable observing of the late League, then to any brutes that should be given
out by desperate men. This was the effect of that which passed between us for
that present. About the seven and twentieth of the last there arrived here a
Currier out of <hi>Spain,</hi> sent from the Ambassador Resident there, who hath
brought unto them very grateful news, especially Monsieur, as I hear, seemeth
to be most contented with the same. He hath lately had great conference
with the Ambassador of <hi>Spain,</hi> who beginneth now to shew great magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and hath lately clad fourteen of his servants with Cloaks of Scarlet,
garded with Velvet, and given them other apparel suitable thereto. Before
the arrival of the said Currier, there was some unkindness grown betwixt
<hi>Spain</hi> and this Crown, upon a complaint made by the Captain of <hi>Callis,</hi> of
a Barque cast up this Summer by the sluce, which is like, upon the next glut of
water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to drown the whole Gountrey of <hi>Oye;</hi> but now there is a promise made
that all shall be addressed; so that it is thought, that there was never so great
amity between <hi>Spain</hi> and this Crown, as presently is like to be. The Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
discourse, that the King must leave no means unattempted to procure the
having of the young King of Scots for a match for his daughter; which thing
they think, with disbursing of an hundred thousand Crowns amongst the needy
Scotish Nobility, will easily be brought to pass. The Scotish Ambassador
the eight and twentieth and nine and twentieth of the last, had often confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi> and the Duke <hi>Aumale;</hi> his abode in
Court was more then ordinary for an Ambassador, for he continued there two
whole days, which maketh men to judge that the matter was of importance, and
therefore required present expedition. It is looked for here that her Majestie
should send some body to congratulate the nativity of this young Princes, for
all other Princess do the like.</p>

                  <p>TOuching the present estate of things here, I refer your Lordship to
these enclosed Occurences, and to my Letters directed unto Master Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary.
As they have been alwayes constant here in their doings, so were
they never so inconstant as at this present. Not two days before the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Briquemont,</hi> they were resolved not to have executed him, and seemed
very much to lament that which already hath been done, as a thing which hath
much weakned the Realm, and made them odious to other Nations. The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
now of this humor, for themselves most honourable and profitable,
is thought to proceed of advertisements lately out of <hi>Spain,</hi> who promiseth
great things; so that it is now thought their cruelty will rather increase then
asswage, which all men do foresee will prove more profitable for <hi>Spain,</hi>
then for themselves. The wisest sort are now least acquainted with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of great moment; such as are parties and passionate, are they that
bear greatest sway in the greatest matters, who in respect of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
passion and revenge, care not what becomes of the Prince and the
Realm.</p>
                  <p>The long Gowns, who are men of the greatest experience, are onely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the expedition of ordinary causes. All men do look for some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
issue of their kind of Government. There lacketh but the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of <hi>Lorrains</hi> presence to hasten the same to his full ripeness. If the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
might only reach to themselves, the harm were the less; but it is feared
that their neighbours shall participate some part of the smart of their folly;
amongst other, none is more threatned then poor <hi>England.</hi> I pray God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her Majestie take profit of your Lordships good care and counsel, and then
shall I fear the less.</p>
                  <p>The Emperours death, which was made so assured, groweth now to be
doubtful, for that Letters of the seventh of the last from <hi>Auspurg,</hi> make no
mention thereof. And so leaving to trouble your Honour at this present, I most
humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Briquemants</hi> death, through his constancy and earnest protestation made of
his innocency, hath bred in all men a general compassion of him, as also, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
misliking of the kind of his death; for that men of his quality and service,
whatsoever their offence hath been, have not accustomably been hanged.</p>
                  <p>Generally all men do cry out and say, that the liberty of <hi>France</hi> is lost, yea,
and of some the most vehement Catholiques, do wish both themselves and that
they have out of this Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Some here do perswade the King, to stand upon the greatness of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
not to suffer men to have that free access into his Chamber as accustomably they
are wont to have here. Surely if he continue his severity, it will not be much
for his safety to suffer men so freely to come near him.</p>
                  <p>What will be the issue of these Tragical doings here, God onely knoweth,
but generally every man feareth that all will go to ruine. In the mean time,
considering the late greatness of Spain with this Crown, I fear they cannot be
content to do that thing that may tend to their own ruine, but also they will seek
the ruine of their neighbours. I am therefore glad to hear that your Lordship, with
the rest of my Lords of the Councel, do so carefully take order to withstand
the malice of those that envy your present quietness and repose. And so leaving
further to trouble your Honour, at this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

went from thence, they grow nearer to accord then they did before; yet what
they will do in the end, it is hard to say. Mr. <hi>Killegrew</hi> hopeth for the best;
wisdom would teach them, for all considerations, to agree within themselves, and
amongst themselves, and by themselves, and that they may do (as far as they can
see) now no more lets them. Here at home we stand looking somewhat to our
security against sudden attempts, and expecting what new occurrents time will
bring. The Parliament is prolonged until the twelfth of January, which should
have begun the first of November. When we hear again from you, you are
like to have another dispatch, and not before, as far as I can see. I and your
friends do not cease to call for a successor for you, but as yet her Majestie cannot
resolve on the person; and that once known, and he commanded and provided,
you may assuredly then hope upon your return. I am acquainted with these
matters, before that time arm your self with patience, and that time we will

                  <p>MY Lord, I do thank you for the speedy answer to my former letters which
I wrote touching a Rider, and I perceive you used so much care as you have
already hearkned out one that is recommended very sufficient; but his demands
you think are very great, and so they be indeed: But as I am desirous to have
such a man, so am I loth to pay too dearly for him. I would gladly hear how
<hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ret</hi> doth imploy him now, or whether you think him not a meet man for that
purpose. If he be of his wonted mind, he is very desirous to return again hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to serve very reasonable; and I am given to understand, that he hath
profited very well in his profession since his being there. If he be to be had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,
and that you hear of his ability therewith of men of judgement to be
confirmed, I had rather have him then any other. If he be not, then this I say
for the other, whom I thank you again for, I will give him 150 Crowns a year
wages and his meat, and drink, and lodging in my house for him and his man,
and allowance in my stable for two horses; and if he prove a man to my liking,
I think, you do believe, I can find in my heart to be better worth to him one way
or another then 50 Crowns besides his wages. If you can thus agree with
him, the sooner he come to me the better; not doubting but that you will in
the mean time make good inquiry of his trade and life, and what his conditions
be. And if ever he have been honest, I trust to keep him so; and if his nature
be not too bad, I hope he shall be contented here with his usage, as I mean he
shall be treated. And so, Sir, I most humbly desire you to let me have
some description of the man by your next, and what you think he will
do. Now, Sir,</p>
                  <p>Touching our estate here: First, thanks be to God our Mistris is in very
good health, and I trust in God ere it be long will shew some care over
us all.</p>
                  <p>The matters in <hi>Scotland</hi> stand but in tickle terms between the parties, I mean
between the King and the Queens side; and so have they Agents—for that
the King left them, who be now returned with better hope (I think) then in the
end they shall have cause to bring their practises to pass. Other particular news
of weight here is none at this present worth the writing, but that we are all here
yet quiet, and by Gods good assistance, I trust, shortly more certain hope we
shall have of the continuance of it. We your poor friends here are continually
labourers for your coming home; and surely, I trust, you shall return ere it be
long. For my own part, I will not cease till it be granted; and in hope of that,
I will forbear to write somewhat now, which when you come home (if you will
affirm) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ose things which I am very desirous
else to say somewhat to you of; but not doubting but his Lordship will signifie
the whole, I will now forbear, and descend to smaller matters. And to answer
you for the two Captains you wrote to me to move her Majestie for; she is now
pleased to entertain the one, him that hath most means am I lothest to name,
lest he might be suspected. In this mysterie you know whom I mean, and shall
also by your servant: she is content with 50 l. yearly, whether it will like him
or no, I know not; if it do not, we will do what we can to increase it; also,
the other her Majestie yet is not minded to use his service. We perceive the
party Saint 4 is very coy in his dealing; but surely he is not to be blamed, the
world being there with you as it is. You shall hear of another manner of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I am sure, by my Lord Treasurer, which is lately offered me here, but we
greatly suspect it to be some practise, or else the choice is not well made of the
party in my opinion. And you shall do well to understand it with all expedition,
as I am sure my said Lord doth advise you throughly therein; for it is of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
and it behoveth us withal speed to know whether it be right or wrong;
if it be wrong, by my consent there shall be right example made of the like, &amp;c.
The Regent of <hi>Scotland</hi> is dead, as we are advertised this day. I suppose it
to be very true: I trust her Majestie will not lose the opportunity offered
there.</p>
                  <p>If the Emperor be dead also, it will make a great change. I hope better for
Christendom, I mean, for good Christians. I have sent you a letter two days
ago by a Scotchman, one <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uglas;</hi> wherein I have sent you my mind touching
the Rider, whom I desire greatly to have, if I may reasonably have him. You
shal perceive by this Letter at large, that if I may have him for 150 Crowns a year
for himself, and to give him meat and drink, and his man, with a couple of
horse found in my stable: I think I shall be worth to him otherwise, half as much
more, if he like me well, as I mean he shall try me and I him for a year: And
if so he be content, the sooner he come, the better. God send him to be an
honest man, and I warrant you he shall be very well entreated. For his sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
I leave it to your good enquiry.</p>
                  <p>I trust shortly you shall be at home. I have not ceased daily, since your wives
arrival, to call upon her Majestie for it, and she is fully agreed thereto, and hath
named some for your successor. I think <hi>Francis Carew</hi> shall be the man, as it is
yet resolved, or <hi>Henry Cobham;</hi> but one of them, I care not who, shall be

he is my dear friend, and the best Italian I know in <hi>England.</hi> Her Majestie
hath written for him. Let his brother know, that I have written to you, I pray
you, if the Rider conclude, I am sure <hi>Spinola'</hi> s brother, if he be there, will
answer his brother here again. So good <hi>Francis</hi> fare you well. Your good wife

and returning by post, being accompanied by <hi>Liggens</hi> at his return, maketh the
Sotchmen that wish continuance of quiet in their Countrey, to fear that there
is some dangerous practise in hand. The said Ambassador doth now daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to the Court, and hath often conference with the Queen Mother at an
extraordinary time in the morning, when as commonly no Ambassador hath
access but in the afternoon. Not long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ince, in talk apart with his friends, he
said, that if the troubles of Scotland had not been, his Mistris had been at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
and perhaps enjoyed a better Crown then Scotland is. He said further,
that if his Mistris had as many good friends in Scotland, as she hath in England,
she had not long remained in prison as she doth. Thus you see how dangerous
a ghest her Majestie harboureth. The Spanish Marquis, who is come hither
to congratulate the Queens delivery, under the colour of the same, as I learned
secretly, he hath commission to treat secretly of three points. The one, to cause
the King to enter into the League.</p>
                  <p>The other, to the marriage between Monsieur and his Masters daughter.</p>
                  <p>The third, to propound some way for the Scotish Queens delivery.</p>
                  <p>Being procured thereto by the house of <hi>Guise,</hi> in recompence of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
done upon them of the Religion, whereby the King of Spain acknowledgeth
to have saved the Low-Countreys.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal of Lorrain by his Letters, procured the King to write earnestly
to his Ambassador in Turky, to cause him to travel, by all means, to compound
the differences between him and the Princes of the League.</p>
                  <p>The Almains do fear much the election of the Emperors second son in Polonia,
as that thing which will make the house of <hi>Austria</hi> too great. And so for other
matters referring your Lordship to these enclosed Occurrents, I most humbly

used therein, as you shall further understand from others. Your good wife was
here yesterday with me, who prevented me, meaning to have gone my self to
her house to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap> meet for her to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
about. Such was her earnestness of your coming away, as she was come to
me, before I thought any body had known of my being in <hi>London;</hi> and coming
from <hi>Windsore,</hi> my Lord Treasurer and I met with your messenger young <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casius.</hi>
We find still new tragical parts playing in that Countrey; among others,
none more strange, and more unnatural then his last, going in person to see one
of his Subjects and eldest Souldiers executed; an example used by no Christian,
but the most mighty God will not suffer long such Princes to dwell over his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
As for his good intention to our Mistris and this Realm, when he sheweth
himself friendly to his own, then we will hope he may be friendly to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.
Since the death of the Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> we have not heard any thing
what is done there: You shall hear, assoon as we are advertised of any thing
worthy.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Rider I wrote of, I have referred to this bearer to declare my
mind unto you, to have a good one; I will be content to strain my self far. We
have no news here, onely her Majestie is in good health; and though you may
hear of brutes of the contrary, I assure you it is not as hath been reported. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
her Majestie hath been troubled with a spice or shew of the Mother, but
indeed not so: The fits that she hath had hath not been above a quarter of an
hour, but yet this little in her hath bred strange brutes here at home. God send
her, I beseech him a long life. So I bid you heartily farewell,</p>

                  <head>To the right Honorable Sir Thomas Smith, her Majesties
principal Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIr, it may please you to advertise her Majestie, that the King dispatched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these ten days <hi>Viracque,</hi> with a good sum of money, to entertain a party
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> until such time as he hath propounded the matter here in France.
One <hi>William Seers,</hi> servant to the Earl of Westmerland, arrived here the four
and twentieth of this moneth, sent hither by the said Earl. Immediately upon
his arrival, <hi>Viracque</hi> went with him to the Court, which is at this present at
<hi>Monceaux.</hi> He reporeth, that in the North Countrey, from <hi>York,</hi> to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
all the whole Countrey is at the Earls devotion; so that a few men imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there by the King, may assure him, that her Majestie shall be kept so occupied,
as she shall have no leisure to send any supply to Rochel. I learn further, that
one <hi>Stephen Wilson</hi> a Scotish man, taketh upon him to draw the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi>
to be wholly at the Kings devotion, so that the said Earl may receive that estate
and honour that his Father had at the King his Predecessors hands. The Bishop
of <hi>Glasco</hi> hath had long and several conferences with the Legate since his last ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival.
If her Majestie do not compound the matter of Scotland before <hi>Viracque</hi>
his coming, she shall find more difficulty in the matter. It is evident, how
much money may do with that Nation; therefore it were well before his coming,
her Majestie took the benefit of the Market, for that many Chapmen maketh
deerer wares.</p>
                  <p>Such Noblemen of Scotland as are here, were never so much made of. I am
well assured that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> not long sithence, did write unto the King
here, in recommendation of the practice that tended to the disquiet of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie;
but what it was, or what answer was made, I cannot learn. At this
present there is not that entertainment used towards the Legate, that appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to his calling, and as heretofore hath been used, which maketh all men of
judgement to suspect, that the same is done for the nonce, to blind the eyes of
<pb facs="tcp:54478:156"/>
all the Princes Protestants. And that those speeches that were given out, that
the Marquis of Egremont departed without good satisfaction, for that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
nothing of those things he propounded; and that the Legate is like to
obtain nothing of those things he is to propound, are but to abuse the
world.</p>
                  <p>Things do not pass here as they were wont to do, through many hands; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> not many Counsellours that are made privy to the
affairs of most secrecy. As I learn secretly their Ambassador there findeth himself
agrieved, for that he receiveth not that good countenance and entertainment
that he was wont to do. Though I have most just cause to think that there is but
little good meant towards her Majestie, whatsoever outward shew is made,
yet in my poor opinion it were not amiss for her Majestie to use all outward
shew and entertainment that may seem to appertain to good amity, and yet
not to omit any thing that tendeth to her safety. And so for other matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
your honour to these enclosed Occurrents, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                     </gap> protested,
that he should never be quiet so long as the exercise of Religion continued in any

                  <p>IT may please your honour to advertise her Majestie, that the King here is
given to understand from the Count <hi>de Lude,</hi> who lieth at <hi>Morte,</hi> how that
they of <hi>Rochel</hi> have of late taken the Isle of <hi>Rez,</hi> which hath bred great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
here; for it is a place of great importance, by the having whereof they are
Masters of the Haven, and may thereby receive any succor by sea. They have
also taken in the same divers ships. He doth further advertise, that they have
taken eight or ten Brittains laden with corn. Touching the Kings intention for
the besieging of <hi>Rochel,</hi> this bearer shall inform you at the full, who hath talked
with one who knoweth what is resolved in that behalf. There is daily here look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Master of the Emperors horse, being sent hither to congratulate the
Queens delivery, as also to bring word, that the Emperor hath chosen Monsieur
and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> Knights of the Order of <hi>Toison.</hi> By letters out of
Germany they write, that it was determined upon the news of the execution
of those of the Religion here, to have slain as many Catholiques of the French
as were found there; which afterwards, upon better consideration, was stayed,
for that they thought the same would prove but a poor revenge; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
this Nation groweth so hateful there, as for avoiding of danger, such of them
as travel in those parts, are driven to take upon them the names of <hi>Burgundians.</hi>
They write also, that there is hope that the Elector <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> shall be
chosen King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> which news doth nothing content those here. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they do advertise, that the Princes of Germany are in great jealousie of
the Legats repair hither; and that thereupon they do put themselves in order of
defence, for that they think his repair hither cannot be but to continue some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
practise.</p>
                  <p>A day or two after the Legat had made his entry, the Court of Parliament
sent unto him, according to the ancient custom, to see his faculties. To whom
he answered, that the intention of his coming was not to execute the office of a
Legat, but only to visit the King, and to treat with him certain private and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
matters. Touching the manner of his receiving and entertainment since
his access to the King, this bearer shall enform you. They do all what they
can to make the world believe, that his coming is not grateful unto them. The
Ambassador of Spain doth give out, that the five and twentieth of the last
moneth, <hi>Zutphen</hi> was taken by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and that eight or ten of the
Princes ships have been also lately distressed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pynart</hi> of late willed my Secretary to tell me, that whereas hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Monsieur <hi>de la Mot</hi> had usually certain imposts of wine granted to him,
he is afraid that he shall be debarred of the same, or at the least some part of
the quantity cut off; which thing he wisheth not to be done at this time, for that
it may give the King occasion to think, that his Ministers are not so grateful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her Majestie as heretofore they have been. Seeing that the Gentleman
is not to make any long abode there, being in hope of revocation, me thinks it
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54478:157"/>
should be well done if he were used as he may return with good satisfaction. And
so having nothing further to impart unto your Honour at this time, I most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
take my leave.</p>

that is recommended unto you from <hi>Berwick,</hi> telleth me that <hi>Iames Kirkaldy</hi>
departeth hence out of hand with such money as <hi>Viracque</hi> should have carried
into <hi>Scotland;</hi> for that he hath gotten license to stay here for a moneth, for
that the King mindeth to imploy him there as an Ambassador Resident. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he telleth me, that <hi>de la Mot</hi> hath advertised the King, how that the Lord
<hi>Athol</hi> is won to be of the Queens party, which now sithence the death of the
Regent is grown far the stronger: And to the end that <hi>Liddington</hi> may travel
more earnestly in strengthening the faction, there is some offer made unto him
of some great pension; he saith m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eover, that the Bishop of <hi>Glasco</hi> giveth him
to understand, that with some assistance of money, the Lord <hi>Athol,</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Argile</hi> being revolted from the Kings side as they are, they shall be more
able to make their party good against any force her Majestie shall send, until such
time as he hath setled his things here. Touching <hi>Seers,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Westmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
man, I can by no means learn what answer he received at the Kings hands.
He telleth me only, that he stayed here four days. These his advertisements I
have confirmed otherwise, and therefore I do the rather credit them. They
have written to the Ambassador, to use all the means that may be possible, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it cost, to have the Queen of Scots spoken withal, willing him in any case
to beware to use in that behalf any <hi>Hugonot.</hi> The B. of <hi>Glasco</hi> hath lately divers
times conference for the devising of some good means for that purpose; one

Leicester.</head>
                  <p>RIght Honourable, the King here is advertised, that they of <hi>Rochel</hi> have
of late taken the Isle of Rez, and divers ships in the same, a thing that
imported the Rochellois much, for that thereby they have the Haven free, and
at their commandment, and may receive such succours as may come unto them
by sea. This Court is much agrieved with all, aswell in this, as in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that things frame so untowardly and go backwards. The wisest sort do not
stick to say, that the greatest troubles are now but a beginning. If it shall prove
true that they write out of <hi>Germany,</hi> which is, that the Marquis of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
is like to be chosen King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> they may perhaps have just cause
to repent their late doings; but howsoever that fall out, we shall see that God
will work somewhat, whereby it may appear the blood of his Saints to be dear
unto him: Perhaps we did build too much before upon the courage and wisdom
of them that be dead: He can raise up stones to set forth his glory, so that we
need not doubt to see the revenge, unless our sins be the let. What is meant
by the King, touching the besieging of <hi>Rochel,</hi> this bearer shall impart unto
your Lordship, as also, the manner of the entertainment of the Legat, and how
they seek to make the world believe, that they are not content with his coming,
nor he with his entertainment. They say here, that the Kings side in <hi>Scotland</hi>
is much weakned, and the other side far the stronger; they have therefore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
of late from hence, some to keep the Queens party in courage, until
they have setled things at home. I find therefore her Majestie shall have great
difficulty to settle things here in such sort, as may prevent such mischiefs as
hereafter may grow unto her that way. Her Majestie can of her self well enough
judge of the peril, besides, I know she lacketh not good advice; and if sparing
be not the let, I hope all will do well. And so for other matters, referring your
Honour to the Lord Treasurers Letters and this bearer, I most humbly take
my leave.</p>

passeth daily to and fro between them; he is one in whom the Pope layeth the
chiefest weight of his legation, in respect of his wisdom and experience. The
Duke of Savoys repair hither in person, maketh men to think that the unity
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54478:158"/>
between this Crown and Spain is like to grow great, for that he is termed here
<hi>Lame du Rey du esquire,</hi> and that therefore the matters of treaty between
them are of great weight. I know that sithence my coming to the Countrey,
the King hath openly used some speeches of misliking of the said Duke, but
this late change, changeth all things upside down. The doubt of the Turks
great preparation for the next year, is a great bridle of their intentions. For the
removing of this impediment, the last of this moneth they dispatched hence
their Ambassador, to make great offers both in Spains and the Venetians behalf,
to draw him to an accord. The Venetians, as I am credibly informed, have been
these three years past at the charge of 800 000 the moneth, and therefore
would be glad to be rid of so weighty a burthen. And so having nothing else
to impart unto your Honour at this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>BEcause this bearer promised to see my letters safely delivered unto your
Lordship, I thought I would not let him go without them. The Legate
stayeth here until there come resolution touching that they have lately treated
here, which they have dispatched both toward <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> by two sundry
Curriors. The King is of late advertised, that the number of those of the
Religion in <hi>Lanquedoc</hi> is encreased very much, and that there are joyned with
them 600 horsemen, and 1500 footmen, that are departed out of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of <hi>Bern,</hi> who by the way have distressed the most part of Count <hi>Ioyeux</hi>
Company.</p>
                  <p>They have taken also upon the edge of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> a certain place called
<hi>Sanins,</hi> where their Gun-powder is made: this encrease of their number maketh
the King irresolute what to do. Before these advertisements, he was determined
to have besieged Sancerre, but now he is advised to march toward them in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc.
The new accidents that happen, make them to change their purposes.
Of late there is one arrived here from the Duke of Baviers, whose coming is
thought to proceed through the Cardinal of Lorrains perswasions, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to make great offers to the King, from the Duke, to the end en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

two Companies of Souldiers placed there by the Rochellois. Further, he is
given to understand, that <hi>de la Noue</hi> is entred into <hi>Rochel,</hi> being sent thither by
the King, having beforehand given oath, that he would faithfully travel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to yield, who by perswasion hath much wrought with them, as they
are content to grow to some capitulation, which proceedeth chiefly through a
disagreement that is between the Rochellois and such strangers as are repaired
thither. Also it is said, that the Baron <hi>de le guard</hi> hath taken three ships laden
with corn by them of <hi>Rochel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These sundry newes hath put them of this Court in great jollity, for that they
hope shortly to reduce the Realm to inward quietness.</p>
                  <p>There are marched out of <hi>Burgundy</hi> a Captain footmen, and certain
horsemen, levied by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Aumale,</hi> whether they
shall be imployed at <hi>Sancerre,</hi> or whether they shall march directly to <hi>Languedoc,</hi>
it is not as yet concluded.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> arrived here the twelfth of this moneth, who is
marvellously well accompanided. The Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> his Uncle, is daily
looked for here, as also the Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi> his Cousin.</p>
                  <p>By Letters of the fifth of this moneth out of <hi>Flanders</hi> they write, that the D. of
<hi>Alva</hi> doth distribute his Army into Garrisons, and that the Roysters do remain
at the Forrest of <hi>Arden,</hi> and in the Land of <hi>Luxenburg,</hi> where they commit
great spoils and outrages, being not yet payed; for that the D. of <hi>Alva</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
not to have wherewithal to discharge them. They write further, that the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> remaineth at <hi>Dortrecht,</hi> where he maketh collection of money
for the levying of forces for the next Spring. From <hi>Cullen</hi> they write, that there
are certain Commissioners repaired thither, sent by the Emperor (as it is said) to
treat some accord between the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the D. of <hi>Alva;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
they do give out other causes of their coming. By Letters from <hi>Vienna</hi>
they advertise, that the Emperor is repaired into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to procure the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Son; which being done, he meaneth to repair to <hi>Germany,</hi> and there
to keep a Diet for the election of the King of Romans. Further they advertise,
that the great Turk of late hath sent unto him a present, commending him very
much for the keeping of his promise, and the observation of the accord between
them, requesting him to continue the same. Touching the election of the
King of <hi>Polonia</hi> they write, that the Elector <hi>Brandenburg</hi> is most like to
be chosen, notwithstanding they have great hope of Monsieurs election, which
men of great judgement do think to be void of any good ground. By letters
out of <hi>Italy</hi> they write, that the Turk will have in a readiness against the next
Spring 400 Gallies, whereof they are very much afraid, the rather, for that their
own Forces by sea do decay; the greatest part of their slaves for the furniture,
being decayed by sickness this last voyage. And so leaving further to trouble
your Honour at this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

is the end of Monsieur <hi>de la Noue's</hi> travel. If there be no mystery in the
matter, then are others doing not so well grounded as they make men believe. So
soon as I shall be able to decypher any further of the matter, I will not fail to
advertise your Lordship. It is here said, that Monsieur <hi>de la Mot</hi> hath advertised,
how that her Majesties meaning is to execute the Queen of Scots: Whereupon
such as favour her do discourse, that it were good to stay the Noblemen that
shall be sent hither by her Majestie for the Christening, as a pledge for the said
Queens safety; that their Majesties here should have such intention, I know
not.</p>
                  <p>The Legate, as I am most credibly informed, hath, amongst other Articles of
his Instructions, commandment earnestly to commend the Queen of Scots
cause to the King here, and to devise with him, some mean for her delivery,
whereby <hi>England</hi> may be reduced to the Catholique faith.</p>
                  <p>The Scotish Ambassador hath more often recourse unto him, then any other
Ambassador here, which maketh me the rather to doubt some practise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hamilton,</hi> brother to him that killed the Regent, hath sent this message unto

<hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and to maintain his party until <hi>Whitsundy</hi> next, assuring him, that
by that time they shall have assistance, both from the Pope, <hi>Spain</hi> and this Crown.
The party himself that is to do the message, made me acquainted with all, which is

yet when a man considereth what is past, a man would think there could grow

the Amity. That we should be God-mother to the Infant; and to pursue still
the request of marriage with the Duke of <hi>Alanson.</hi> To whom we answered:
First, that as for amity, having it of late by league so straitly made betwixt us,
on our behalf we never attempted nor minded to attempt any thing that should
impair it, but rather do study and wish to encrease the same, if we could; and
therefore you may say, it is that, and the good will appertaining to that Amity,
that made us by you before, and now by <hi>de Mannesire,</hi> to declare what we have
heard of our good brothe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, which we are sorry to hear: First, the great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
made in <hi>France</hi> of Noblemen and Gentlemen, unconvicted, and untryed.
So suddenly (as it is said at his commandment) did seem so much to touch the
honour of our good brother, as we could not but with lamentation, and with
tears of our heart, hear it of a Prince so near allied unto us, and in a chain of
undissoluble love knit unto us by league and oath: That being after excused by
a conspiracy and treason wrought against our good Brothers own person, which
whether it were true or false, being in another Princes Kingdom and Jurisdiction,
where we have nothing to do, we mind not to be curious; yet that they were
not brought to answer to Law and Judgement, before they were executed, those
who were found guilty. We do hear it marvellously ill taken, as a thing of a
terrible and dangerous example; and are sorry, that our good brother was so
ready to condescend to any such Councel, whose nature we took to be more
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54478:160"/>
humane and noble; but when more was added unto it, that women, children,
maids, young infants and sucking babes, were at the same time murthered, and
cast into the river, and that liberty of execution was given to the vilest and
basest sort of the popular, without punishment or revenge of such cruelty done
afterwards by Law, upon those cruel murtherers of such innocents; this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
our grief and sorrow in our good brothers behalf, that he should suffer
himself to be led by such inhumane Councellours: And now sithence it doth
appear by all doings, both by the Edicts, and otherwise that the rigor is used
onely against them of the Religion reformed, whether they were of any conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
or no, and that contrary to the Edict of Pacification so oftentimes repeated,
they of the reformed Religion, are either driven to fly, to dye, or to recant, or
lose their offices; whereby it doth appear, by all actions now used by our good
brother, that his scope and intent doth tend only to subvert that Religion that
we do profess, and to root it out of his Realm; at the least, all the strangers of
all Nations and Religions so doth interpret it, as may appear by the triumphs
and rejoycings set out, aswel in the Realm of France as others, which maketh
that it must needs seem very strange, both to us, and to all other, that our good
brother should require us to be Godmother to his dear childe, we being of that
Religion which he doth now persecute, and cannot abide within his Realm: And
if we should believe the perswasion of others, and the opinion of all strangers
our friends, who be not our Subjects, we should in no case condescend to any
association in that or any other matter: But as we have always hitherto had
special love to our good brother in his younger age and a desire to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his good estate and quietness, which we have in deeds manifestly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
never seeking any advantage of time against him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as peradventure other
Princes would have done; but ever sought to preserve his Estate and his
Subjects, of what estate or condition in Religion whatsoever they were, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
them to unity and concord, and with loyal hearts to live together in
quiet under our good brother, without offering injury the one to the other,
glad of their agreement, and sorry of their division and discord; so the late
league of straiter amity made betwixt our good brother and us, to the which
he did so frankly and lovingly condescend, or rather procure it at our hands, is
so fresh in our memory, that we cannot suffer that in any jot it should be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished,
but rather encreased daily, so long as our good brother doth shew the
like unto us; and that maketh us to interpret all things in better part then
otherwise by any means they can appear, such is our love to our good brother,
and so can we be content to perswade our selves for the love that we do bear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; and for the hope of his continuance in our begun amity, without faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or dissimulation: And this for the matter of Amity. For continuance of
declaration of which amity, we said to <hi>Mannesire,</hi> we would not be slack in any
good office doing, at the request of our good brother. And so notwithstanding
the doubts and impediments beforementioned, we intend to send a worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage,
a noble man of our Realm, to repair to his Court, and to visit the King
our good brother and the Queen Mother, and the rest who have written in our
behalfs, and to do that office which is required as appertaineth, wishing that
these spiritual alliances may be to us our comfort and conservation of the
amity begun betwixt us. To the motion of the marriage with the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Alanson,</hi> wherein <hi>de Mannesire</hi> seemed somewhat earnest; after declaration of
inconveniences that might come in that marriage, by the diversity of age and
Religion, which we termed in our talk extream and true impediments, we made
this final resolution and answer, That forasmuch as we had given to our Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor

have a special answer to them, we cannot well resolve; the which once being
done, we shall the better understand what to answer for any other proceeding in
that request.</p>

her Majestie in France.</head>
                  <p>SIr, I heartily thank you for your often advertisements; and also, that you
are so careful for our estate, the which, so far as I can learn, dependeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the providence of God, as it hath done always, but is easily sustained by
the policy of men, and yet hath sped better then any man would think, and so I
pray God it may do still. <hi>De Mannesire</hi> hath been honourably received, and
friendly; and yet to say the truth, sith those late and execrable murthers of the
true servants of God there, the minds of the most number are much alienated
from that Nation, even of the very Papists, much more of the Protestants
here; and if in countenance and entertainment some coldness might appear, it
must be ascribed to our English nature, which as yet cannot dissemble so deeply
as the French can and hath done; but I am sure <hi>De Mannesire</hi> hath no cause to
complain.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the death of the Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> the late Regent, about the
four and twentieth of <hi>November</hi> they chose the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> Regent, with a

doth very carefully and wisely endeavor himself to reconcile, as much as may be,
the Lords one with another, and to appease both the factions, which I fear will
not be but with some charge to the Queens Majestie, and some grief to the
French Ministers and Procurers, who can least abide quietness in that Realm.

                  <p>Our men be all come from <hi>Flushing,</hi> either before, or at, or sith their return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

                  <p>Sir <hi>Humphrey Gilberts</hi> sickness is turned into a Quartain, some of them that
came with him be buried at <hi>London.</hi> I thank you for the <hi>Matthiolus</hi> you sent
unto me: I like it well, but yet if I could recover mine own I noted through with
mine own hands, I would like it far better, but he that stole it from me, doth
think that I shall have it again of that price. I pray you buy me a case of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
such as be to be sold in the Palace; I mean, containing two compasses or
three a square, a pen of metal, and other things. I have two of them already, one
of the least, and the other of Copper or Latyn, and the manner of Iron: Now I
desire to have of the biggest volume, which is with the case a foot long, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
and if more, it were not the worse; whether the instruments be of Iron
or Latyn I care not. I have shewed your man mine, to the intent he might know
what I mean. I have sent you by him five French Crowns of the Sun to pay
for my book of <hi>Matthiolus,</hi> and the case of Tools, and if it come to more, I
will pay whatsoever it be, with most hearty thanks. I am sure you have heard
of, and I think you have seen the new fair Star or Comet, but without beard or
tail, which hath appeared here these three weeks, on the backside of the Chair
of <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> and on the edge of <hi>Lactea via.</hi> The bigness is betwixt the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

to observe it, and because of this cold weather also, dare not observe the
precise order of the fixed stars; such a one I never have observed, nor read of, I
pray you let me know what your wise men of <hi>Paris</hi> do judge upon it. I know
they will not think it is the Admirals soul, as the Romans did of the Comet
next appearing, after the murther of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that it was his soul.</p>
                  <p>It may be <hi>Astraea</hi> now peaking out afar off in the North, to see what revenge
shall be done upon so much innocent blood-shed in <hi>France</hi> at a marriage banquet
and reer suppers after it. It would be to me good yet to understand what your
Astronomers and Heaven-gazers there do judge of it. If I were not so much
occupied as I am, I would turn over all my old books, but I would say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of it my self, and gess by chance, even as wisely as they, though I would
not publish it but to my friends; for folly, the more it is kept in, the
better.</p>

I should tell you any thing thereof, <hi>de die &amp; tempore,</hi> I should but guess as
Astronomers do; but this I can tell you, all your friends have not onely been
diligent, but more then importunate to bring you home; and your wife with
tears and lamentations: And the Queens Majestie seemeth to incline and grant
our requests; but when a pin is set fast in a hole, till we have another to thrust
that out, and tarry there it self, it is hard to get it out. Your successor cannot

looks now to have some word from your Majestie of his return, it would
comfort him very much. Why, faith she, he shall come. Yea (quoth I) when
the poor Gentleman is almost dismaid; your Majestie hath heard enough with
what grief he doth tarry there. Well, saith she, you may write unto him, that
he shall come home shortly, we think with my Lord of <hi>Worcester.</hi> I said, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
my Lords train should be the more honourable, if he had one Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
to go with him, and another to return with him. Yea, saith her Majestie,
there be some make excuses that they would not go, but their excuses shall not
serve them. I thanked her Majestie, and came my ways; for she made haste to
go a walking with the Ladies, because it was a frost.</p>

principal Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIr, her Majesties of the eleventh of this moneth I have received, but have
not yet communicated to their Majesties here such answers as were made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the things propounded unto her by Monsieur <hi>de Mannesire;</hi> both for that he
is not yet returned, as also, for that the Queen Mother, at this present, is not
in the best health, whereby Ambassadors can have no access to her as yet. Her
sickness is onely a Catarrh, so that I think by his return she will be in state able
to give access: seeing the Government resteth wholly in her hands, without
committing the matter unto her, as well as unto the King, it will be to no great
purpose, for that he receiveth his light from thence. The eighteenth of this
moneth, the King by mischance of another mans sword, received a little
hurt in his left arm, which is not great, but that every small hurt is great in a
Prince.</p>
                  <p>The hope of the Rochellois is yielding is now worn away, they having lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
advertisements from them that Monsieur <hi>de la Noue</hi> can do no good, and
that they imprison as many as do perswade them to yield, as those whom they
hold suspected; so that now being out of all hope to obtain the same by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
they here consult of the means to obtain the same by force; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is said, that Monsieur, and Monsieur <hi>le Duc</hi> shall march thitherwards about
the latter end of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> Yesterday, as I am credibly informed, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
news that did not best content them out of <hi>Switzerland;</hi> which is, that
the last Diet holden there, they have concluded, not to suffer the King to have
any succors f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

is to extend to themselves.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiers here do conclude, that without either Switzers or Almains
the King can besiege neither <hi>Rochel</hi> nor any other Town; for the Frenchmen
are not fir for the keeping of Artillery, nor to make the body of the battel of
footmen.</p>
                  <p>The King doth send into <hi>Germany,</hi> to see if he can appease the Almains, as
also to procure succours if he shall need them. He hath received at their hands
<pb facs="tcp:54478:162"/>
many a churlish answer; and notwithstanding, without respect had of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their degrees, he for beareth not to woo them.</p>
                  <p>The nineteenth of this moneth, there arrived here the Bishop of Valences
Secretary out of Polonia, who giveth them great hope of the Election of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur;
and yet some part of his tale giveth men cause to judge, that there is
no great reason so to think; for that he saith, by the reason of the plague that
there reigneth, the Nobility to whom the election appertaineth, have not yet
assembled: so that all this hope seemeth to be grounded upon some particular
conference that the Bishop hath had with some of the said Electors, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
when the matter shall come to through debating, will change their opinion.
Men of judgement here, that know that Countrey, do think, that if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Valence had had a million of gold, accompanied with his eloquence, to
be stow amongst them, he might then be able to do somewhat; but otherwise
they think, that eloquence without treasure will gain no Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Venetians of late have taken four French ships, and have put some of
them to torture, to make them confess the colouring of certain Turkish goods:
as which news the King was very much offended, and therefore hath given them
leave of Marseilles to use all means of revenge.</p>
                  <p>From Antwerp they write, that the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> by the benefit of the last

therefore to continue your assistance in that behalf. Touching the hope of
having <hi>Rochel</hi> by composition, the wind is come about, they being now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
that there is no way to have it but by force; whatsoever her Majestie
saith to the contrary, they cannot here but believe that they of <hi>Rochel</hi> receive
encouragement from her Majestie to hold out. The Switzers, as I am given to
understand, have concluded at a late Diet, held by them, to give no succour
this way, which falleth out contrary to their way. Those people are not so gross,
but that they foresee the end, that the late accident here tendeth to. I would
others, whom it toucheth as nearly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would so think, The late election of the
Regent in <hi>Scotland,</hi> doth altogether miscontent them here; and some threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are given out that it shall not so long stand for good, for that the same passed
not with the content of both parties, but onely by the choice of one faction.

                     <hi>STeward</hi> being made acquainted with the contents of your Lordships Letters,

alter his opinion, he may take the benefit thereof, if necessity shall force him
thereto. He willeth me further to advertise your Honour, that 9 meaneth to
send a Gentleman expresly with full mind unto <hi>Davison,</hi> with order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the same from him to 3 to whom he desireth that there may be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
given. I perceive by them, that they cannot tell well what to resolve, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
there be conference had with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> if they mean not to take profit of the ship.
I have taken order with them to send one to the Port, to cause him to depart.
Because your Lordship is sometimes absent from the Court, I thought good to
send your Lordship the Copy of the Letter I write to Master Secretary; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the contents whereof, I learn, that Monsieur <hi>D'Aux</hi> is stoln away from
Constantinople, and is presently retired to Ragusa, where he remaineth; the
cause of his departure from thence is unknown unto the King, who is very much
offended withal. He hath expresly sent a messenger unto him, to will him upon
his allegiance, to return unto Constantinople, and to continue his charge there.
Some do g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ess that the cause of his departure from thence was, for that he
feared, that the King would take some order for the murthering of him there, as
suspected of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal of Lorrain hath took upon him before his departure from
Rome, to promise the Pope, that the King here should enter into the League,
which thing is thought not fit at this time, until the King hath appeased his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
at home.</p>
                  <p>It is thought that one chief cause of the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> coming, tendeth to
make some complot against Geneva; as also, to conclude some straiter amity then
heretofore hath been between this Crown and Spain; the means whereof is
thought to be the marriage of Monsieur and the King of Spains daughter. They
seem here to be no less sorry for the E. of Derby, then for <hi>D. Chasteirault;</hi> what
moveth them so to be, I know not. Though there hath grown some alteration
in her Majesties resolution touching my return, by the choice of Mr. <hi>Carew,</hi> yet
I hear there lacketh no care in your Lordship to find out some other to supply
the room; for the which I have most just cause to render unto your Lordship
most humble thanks. And thus having nothing else to impart unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

                  <p>SIr, the day after Monsieur <hi>Mannesires</hi> arrival, which was the 23 of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<hi>I</hi> had access unto the King, at what time <hi>I</hi> made him acquainted with
the contents of her Majesties Letters. To the which he answered, that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the amity, he received no small contentment, as well by the assurance given
unto him by <hi>Mannesire,</hi> as also by me, that her meaning is to continue the
same without doing any thing that should be disagreeable thereto; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he took great occasion to make great protestations of the greatest account
that he made of her Majesties amity, saying, that he esteemed the same above
any wordly thing. In this point he was very long, wherein I make the shorter
recital, because I kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> how his outward speech and his inward meaning
do agree. Then I proceeded to shew him, what her Majestie conceived, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the good will she beareth him, touching the slaughter of the Admiral,
and the rest of the Nobility of the Religion here, without any form of justice,
a thing disallowed of all men, though it were true that a conspiracy were made.
I further shewed him the redoubling of her Majesties grief, as well to see such
as by no means could be privy to any conspiracy, given up even to the vile and
base people, whose execution was without respect of age or sex, in a most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
sort, as also to see those that are alive forced by Edicts lately set forth,
either to abjure their Religion, to fly, or else to be murthered; a kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
which sheweth, that his meaning is to root out all the professors of the
Gospel within his Realm; and therefore could not but make her Majestie to
marvel, that he should move her to be Gossip, he persecuting with such severity
those that profess one Religion with her. To these he answered, that touching
the slaughter of the Admiral, and the rest of the Nobility, he had well hoped
that her Maj. had been throughly satisfied by such demonstratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s as had been
made unto her there by his Ambassador, of the cause of the same. Touching
those that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ere killed by the fury of the people, he said, it was a thing that he
was sorry for, but could by no means remedy it. For the third, it was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of the Edict of the liberty of Religion. He said, that his policy forced
him so to do, seeing the in convenience that otherwise would follow by the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of two sundry Religions. To this I replyed, that curiosity did not move her
Majestie to use that kind of speech, but the good will and affection that depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon the amity lately concluded, who was sorry to hear hard judgements of
others touching such kind of proceedings; whose opinions and advice, if she of
her self should follow, she should then not onely refuse to be his Gossip, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
forbear all other kind of intelligence with him: and that those that do so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
her, are not onely her own Subjects, but also her Neighbours abroad. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
I shewed him, that her Majestie, as one that hath from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
been affected towards him, who never took advantage of time to do any
thing that might prejudice him, as one in whom the late league hath taken so
deep impression of amity; as she cannot but interpret in good part any friendly
request tending to amity; and therefore, for continuance and declaration of the
same, all doubts and impediments laid aside, she intendeth to send a Nobleman,
as well to supply the office required, as also to visit him. To this the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that he could not but think himself most bound to her Majestie, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
in good part this office of his, which proceedeth onely of amity and good
will, to that end (as her Majestie saith) that this spiritual allyance may be to both
their comforts. And for further confirmation of the amity lately begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. And as for the Nobleman (saith he) he shall be very welcome,
and receive such honour as appertaineth to one sent from a Princess, whom I
esteem so much.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:54478:163"/>
Touching the third point, concerning Monsieur <hi>D'Alanson,</hi> he said not
much, but only this, That the marriage betwixt her Majestie and him, is a thing
that he much desireth, as that thing that would make a perfect uniting of their
two Crowns. After this speech, upon complaint made by me of the small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
that our Merchants have at <hi>Roan,</hi> at such Commissioners as lately by
him were deputed for the remedy of such injuries as they had received in the time
of the hurly burly. He shewing me, that <hi>Sorex</hi> and other Flemings were a
rigging out, to the number of fourteen sail, in certain Creeks and Ports belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her Majestie, for to repair with the same to <hi>Rochel,</hi> wherein he desired
her Majestie to take such order as may be agreeable to the good amity and league
lately concluded between them.</p>
                  <p>This was in effect as much as passed between us at this present. To the
Queen Mother I could have no access, for that she is not yet rid of her Cathera.
Monsieur <hi>Pynart</hi> sent me word by my Secretary, that the Baron <hi>de la Guarde</hi>
hath advertised, that fifty English sail were about to have entred the Haven of
<hi>Rochel,</hi> had not he stayed them. And whereat <hi>Pynart</hi> saith, he doth much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
considering the protestation that lately hath been made touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the amity. In answer hereof, I sent him word, that if they had
been minded to have entred the Haven, his forces could not have stayed them;
and that if her Majestie had intention to imploy any of her ships that way, a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that number would serve. But this (said I) is but a cunning of his to cause
the King to be cold in yielding redress to certain injuries that he had lately
done to our Merchants, who for spoils sake could have been contented to have
his Master and the Queen my Mistris at variance. And therefore is glad to send
such vain advertisements.</p>
                  <p>Monsieur <hi>Mannesire,</hi> who reporeth very honourably of her Majestie every
way, desired me, in their Majesties name, to hasten as much as I could the coming
of that Nobleman whom her Majestie meaneth to send, for that the Emperors
Ambassador, who is already arrived, attendeth onely his coming. Further,
of himself, he desireth me to advise him not to bring any great train, for that
otherwise, he shall be very much troubled to have horses provided for them;
for that, saith he, he cometh in post a dozen Gentlemen, and half a score others,
shall be as honourable, as though he came with two hundred. The experience,
Sir, that your self have had in this behalf, cannot but make you to think Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Mannesires</hi> opinion to be good; as also, give the like advice. And if he
did transport some Geldings of his own, I would take it to be the best way;
for that otherways, as you have some experience he shall be hardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
                  <p>The Emperors Ambassador, who is Master of the horse, hath not above
twenty in his train.</p>
                  <p>I make full account, according to her Majesties promise, by her last letters,
to see my successor in company with the Nobleman that repaireth hither. And
so leaving further to trouble your Honour at this present, I most humbly take my
leave.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honourable, and his very good Lord, the Lord
Burleigh.</head>
                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to understand, that since the writing of my last
Letter I have spoken with <hi>Steward,</hi> who knoweth not by whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement
he was set on, that discharged the Dagg against <hi>La Motte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but
doth ghess, the party named in my last Letters should be the Authour
thereof.</p>
                  <p>For other matters, he saith, all goeth well; as you shall further understand
by one sent for the purpose, who imbarqueth at B. his name is <hi>R.</hi> he is of good
quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and one that accompanied 8 I am warily dealt withal in the matter. And
for my self, I dare not desire to know more then they are willing to make me
acquainted withal. <hi>Steward</hi> telleth me for certain, that there are of late 800
at least of <hi>Strozzies</hi> company cut in piece; which thing is kept very close, for
by others I can learn no such thing. There arrived lately here a Gentleman
out of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> sent from Monsieur <hi>D'Aumale,</hi> who reporteth, that
they of the Religion do hold, at least, in Town and Castle, to the number
of chosen Souldiers; which Town can no way be taken, but by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
for that they cannot possibly make any trenches about it, the soil and
seat being rocky. Both the Admiral and <hi>De la Aumile,</hi> do send the King
word to send them both men and money, or else there being there is to no
purpose. Upon these advertisements lately come from thence, it is now thought
that Monsieur shal go to <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and that Monsieur <hi>Le Duc</hi> shall be imployed
at <hi>Rochel:</hi> Howsoever they shall be imployed, it is held for certain that they
depart from this Town about five or six days hence, as well the two brethren, as
also the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I send unto your Lordship a lewd Letter written by <hi>Carpenter,</hi> in defence
of the late doings here; the original written in Latin, and afterwards translated
into French. Divers of those in Latin have been sent into <hi>Germany;</hi> but the
Authors lewdness is so well known, as it will but little help their case. They
have also sent of them into <hi>Polonia,</hi> for that the Bishop of <hi>Valence</hi> writeth, that
the late accident here will be one of the greatest lets of that they seek there.
It is reported also by Letters lately received out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that the Duke
of <hi>Alva</hi> is so dangerously sick at | <hi>Nunege,</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Quere</note> as men do doubt of his recovery.
Furthermore, they give out, that there hath been of late a Conflict in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
between the said Duke and the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in the which there
were slain of the Dukes side 500 Spaniards; and, as they say, a double number
of the other: but as yet the certainty is unknown. And so beseeching your
Honour to impart these Letters to the Earl of Leicester; for that through the
hasty departure of this messenger, I had no leisure to write particularly unto
him. I leave, &amp;c.</p>

                     </gap>ire that it may please her Majestie
to give order for the restraint thereof, as to good amity appertaineth. To this

I said, it would be very hard to restrain them, forasmuch as at this
present there are a number of marriners and ships unset a work, in respect of
the unkindness between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which kind of people will hardly
be restrained. I willed him also to desire their Majesties to consider, how the

notwithstanding an express inhibition of things, did serve this last summer under
those of the League, some be conducted by the Marquis <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Turk doth interpret in good part, for that he knoweth that the same is done
without the Kings consent; the like consideration must their Majesties have
also of her Majestie, who is not able so to bridle her Subjects, but that some
of them will hazard themselves, without having any regard to her Majesties

                  </p>
                  <p>They have often sent unto me to know, whether I heard anything of his coming,
wherein I have answered, that since the twelfth of the last I heard nothing out
of <hi>England,</hi> which seemeth strange unto them, considering that their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
hath advertised, that my Lord of <hi>Worcester</hi> should be forward the second of
this Moneth. Touching Monsieurs speedy departure from hence towards <hi>Rochel,</hi>
men of judgement do think it rather to fear the Rochellois, to make them to
condescend to an accord, then indeed to have an intention to besiege them as
yet, considering that this time of the year is very unapt to besiege a Town sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
in a marsh.</p>
                  <p>Of late there hath been some purpose held with me, whether I did not think
that her Majestie by some perswasion used by me, might be induced to be a
Mediator unto the K. Whereunto I answered, that I my self could hardly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to be a dealer in that behalf, having that regard that a servant and a subject
ought to have to the honour of his Prince and Mistris, considering what evil success
such Compositions heretofore have had, as have passed between them King and
his Subjects, especially seeing those to enjoy the Kings ear, who have both
abused his ear and his honour, having had more regard to their own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
passions, then to that reverence and duty, that becometh good Subjects
to bear towards their Prince. When I shall see (said I) such removed, then I
can tell what to answer in this behalf. Our Merchants at the beginning
here, sith the last troubles, received good expectation, so far forth as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the obtaining of the Kings Letters: but now that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>meth to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54478:165"/>
they find it but expedition in words; so that I perceive, it were better
for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>ACcording to your Honours order by letters of the six and twentieth of
October, I recommended unto the King here this bearers brothers cause:
whereupon he directed his Letters to certain Presidents at Roan, appointed by
Commission to see such of our Merchants as sustained loss in the last troubles
restored to their goods. At whose hands, neither by virtue of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
directed to them, nor by the Kings particular recommendation, he could
receive any other answer, then that they had advertised the King touching such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
as they had received of the injury he pretended to be done unto his
brother; whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>by it may well appear, that there is nothing less meant, then to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54478:165"/>
make restitution of the spoils as were made in the time of the disorders: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
this bearer, notwithstanding he had the Kings safe-guard, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
him, was sundry times like to have been assaulted (as he informeth me) by
such as outraged his brother; and his host also where he lay was threatned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he received him. He making complaint thereof there, could have no
redress; and I making complaint of it here unto the King and his Councel,
found as little. Ere he could receive answer what information was sent hither,
he was driven to attend a moneth. In the end he was answered, that one of the
Presidents deputed their Commissioner, was repaired hither, and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
them, how that this bearers brother was a lewd young man, and
riotously consumed his substance, and therefore used this as a mean to defraud
his Creditors, and that he onely payed twenty Crowns for ransome, to such
as had imprisoned him; and that the cause of imprisonment proceeded upon
certain quarrels about a wife he had married at <hi>Roan,</hi> contrary to the will of
her friends. Whereupon I sent word to Secretary <hi>Pynart,</hi> who gave this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that he might be well able to discern, by this kind of proceeding, what
will they have to do justice, in that the answer was not made at <hi>Roa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> where
he might have procured justification of his brothers behavi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur; and that
therefore in apparence there is no other reason why the party should be
driven to attend answer here, but that they think onely by such kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
to make him weary of prosecuting the matter. To this <hi>Pynart</hi> answered,
that forasmuch as the President was a publique person, and of such integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and uprightness, as he could not be charged with any untruth or wrong
done to any person; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the other side, <hi>Stallenge</hi> one that was touched in
his life and behaviour, he could do nothing in his behalf. Nevertheless, he
said, that to gratifie me, he would write again to the President, if I thought
his Letter would prevail any thing to the furtherance of the poor mans
cause.</p>
                  <p>Your Honours may perceive by these answers, what good will they bear
to do justice, considering that they had authority granted unto them to have
determined the cause there: But this answer they used for a delay, to make him
weary of prosecuting the matter. I find them of late very slow to yield any
expidition, not onely in this bearers cause, but also to such other of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
as lately I have preferred; and therefore considering how chargeable it
would be for him to continue his suit here any longer, and little hope there is of
redress in the end. I have advised him to repair to <hi>Roan,</hi> to procure a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial,
as wel of his brothers behaviour and conversation, as also of the
evil usage he received during his abode there; to the end, that having inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
your Honours thereof accordingly. Your Honours may take order, as to
the same shall seem fit. And so leaving to trouble your Honors any further

                  <p>SIr, I am sorry that I wot not what to write unto you, things do fall out so
here. Dr. <hi>Dale</hi> was warned to dispatch, and your revocation ready; When
it came to signing, no such thing meant. Dr. <hi>Dale</hi> wrote unto me, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
half a score horse in his stable, men to go with them, and their own horses,
their liveries already bought, and he altogether ready at my Lord Treasurers
warning and mine; and now understanding, that he should not go, the effect
of this Letter, I shewed this day unto her Majestie. She beshrewed them it
was long of, Dr. <hi>Dale</hi> could not go before <hi>Midlent</hi> or <hi>Easter,</hi> there was other
matters which she would trust to no new men, but to you, and to none other.
Well, Madam, quoth I, the poor man hath been already at these charges, and
chargeable it will be yet to him, to put them away is loss, to keep them, charge;
besides my Lord Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi> your Majestie knoweth in what state
he is, and the poor Gentlewoman his wife. Yea (saith she) that pity of her
is that maketh all this haste; and I am sorry for her, but there is no remedy,
he cannot now go before <hi>Midlent</hi> or <hi>Easter.</hi> Well Madam (quoth I) seeing it be
so, may it please you, may he be sure to go at <hi>Easter,</hi> and may I write so to my
Lord Ambassador. Yea, saith her Majestie, now you have my Commission;
and so much I can say, judge of it as you shall please, but I assure you my Lord
of <hi>Leicester,</hi> my Lord Treasurer, my Lord Admiral and I, and some other of
your friends, have done what they can for your return; but whether it be
<hi>Fatis,</hi> or what else hath letted, I know not, nor can guess, but I perceive what
is the issue at this time. You are a wise man, and can comfort your self with
wisdom and patience; and the rather, if the promise do hold, that by <hi>Easter</hi> you
may return. My Lord of <hi>Worcester</hi> bringeth full instructions for that he hath
to do, or may fall out in communication, the which he must and will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
unto you, and use therein your advice. I send you some Occurrents out of
<hi>Scotland.</hi> If you would know what we do here, we play at tables, dance and

be to God, be in good health. My Lord <hi>Privy-Seal,</hi> what with age and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

                  <head>To my very loving friend Mr. Francis Walsingham, the Queens
Majesties Ambassador in France.</head>
                  <p>THe cause of her Majesties longer stay of your abode there, and not to send
presently D. <hi>Dale,</hi> is onely in respect of some persons you have there to
deal withall, which you may easily conceive whom I mean, though I name them
not; the cause I write it not plain, is lack of a cypher, having worn mine to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
this progress time in carriage, and pray you to bear the more with this dark
writing: but it concerneth such as you wrote a little of to my Lord Treasurer.
Her Majesty doubteth greatly the state of that person, and hath in expectation
that some great matter will proceed from them: and neither doth she think <hi>Dale</hi>
to be a fit man to be imployed, neither that the other will deal frankly with him
as with you. For my part I am perswaded that great matters will fall that way,
and surely you shall do well to enter the more speedily and deeply with them for
the knowing of their whole intent. I must but tell you mine own conceit, I fear
it be but a practice to dandle us; for so many are acquainted here with the cause,
I mean of that Nation: but it is impossible but that the Ambassador here must
know it. Besides, I see that the hope of the marriage is still entertained here,
and our Mistres made to think it is ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>incerely meant; which if it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and the other matters true of the parties disposition, what could with-hold
to put that in execution which were most like for him to get it, for his own va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
must sue more for him then his friends commendation, or else his party here
will be little, as I think. But this manner of dealing, I see serveth to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
but winneth them time, and loseth us all good opportunities,
and hindreth your retur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, where your friends wish you, both for your self, and
chiefly for her Majesties better service. You shall do well therefore for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
for I cannot imagine what good this great suspence will do her, to seek by
all means you can at their hands to know their full mind, and the scope of their
intent; for by these the dealing of the Ministers here with her Majesty, hath no
cause to find any way direct or substantiall, she takes great hinderance otherwise,
and no good shall come to them neither, in this sort of proceedings. And as none
here are privy to the matter but my Lord Treasurer and I, so is it too great a
burthen so long to conceal her Majesties so great hindrance of her greater cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
as the time wants for lack of certainty &amp; through understanding the intent and
bottom of this Cause, which surely hitherto giveth more cause of suspition of
practise then of good meaning. And yet if it were minded as they pretend, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they proceed otherwise then I perceive yet they do, they shall rather hurt
themselves and us both, then further any good purpose that may bring hope of
that good success we would wish. Thus as well as I can utter my poor conceit
both for your self and us, and do wish you to deal accordingly with all speed, and
<pb facs="tcp:54478:167"/>
to return your answer thereof with all diligence you can; and thereupon we wil
take occasion again to procure your return, which if staying might yield service to
her Majesty and good to the Countrey, I would no way hinder if you were
my brother: Otherwise finding no more cause then I do, you have no friend
here will further sooner the other. My Lord of Worcester hath desired me to
write to you, that you would deal friendly and frankly with him, he disableth
himself and trusteth to your advice in all such sort as belongeth to his place. I
heartily require it for him, onely it may suffice you to know he is a Papist, and
a favourer of all such, especially a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the Christning. Shew him, I pray, all the courtesie you can, as I doubt not
of it. My Lord <hi>Privy Seal</hi> is dead this morning. Her Majesty in good health.
So God be with you.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honourable, and my very good Lord, the Lord Treasurer.</head>
                  <p>YOur Lordships of the 14 of this moneth I have received, by the which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
two sundry Letters which I sent you by the <hi>Vidams</hi> man, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
books, are not come to your hands, which maketh me to mistrust some
some wrong measure, for that he departed the second of this moneth. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of most importance contained in the same, was touching a Gentleman of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> departed hence to 2) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 6.) 4 with intention to imbarque there if
the Barque were not departed. <hi>Steward,</hi> who is gone to <hi>Rochel,</hi> as I sent your
Lordship word by my servant <hi>William Williams,</hi> promised before his departure
to have come and seen me, and to have had some conference with me, which he
did not, but sent onely his man unto me with a fond Cypher requesting me to
hear often from me. To whom I answered, That the Cypher he sent me, was not
for the purpose; and as for writing often, I told him I could not tell what to
answer untill I might speak with his Master, and that therefore I desired most
earnestly to confer with him before his departure, as well of that as of other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
notwithstanding his own promise and my request, he is now departed; so
that considering his loose kind of dealing, I cannot tell what to judge of the
matter. If the party that cometh over do not deal more orderly and roundly
there then I am dealt with here, I think it were well if it were at some end, for
that I fear the issue will prove such as the parties are that deal in it, who are over
young and lack experience, that were fit to guide a matter of so great weight. I
serve in the same but for a distributer of Letters, and yet as it should seem, the
chief cause of Religion groweth thereby. If I thought there were good faith
meant therein, or that by good guiding there might grow good effect to the
benefit of her Majesty, I should then with the less grief continue my abode
here. Such Letters as I received lately from <hi>Davison,</hi> I know not what to do
with, having no sure means how to convey them; for one of mine own cannot
with safety travell that way. And as for any of this Nation, I find none
whom I may trust in that behalf: and therefore untill such time as I hear further
from your Lordship what liking you have of the overture that shall be made by
them that I sent over, who as I am informed by <hi>Steward,</hi> is to grow to some
through resolution, I mean not to deal any further with them unless I see they
proceed more orderly. Of this loose kind of dealing I thought good to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
to the end you may rather grow to some through conclusion with the said
party there.</p>

the Cypher, you shall more plainly know my meaning.</p>
                  <p>If my stay here imported her Majesties service, I could not so importunately

my cause by sending over my successor.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Cardinall of <hi>Lorain</hi> is arrived here, who beareth the whole
sway in the affairs, they conclude somwhat touching Scotish matters. In the
mean time there is one lately dispatched hence with great offers to entertain the
Queens party, as your Lordship may perceive by the inclosed. And so leaving
further to trouble your Honor at this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to understand, that B. who hath great conference
with B. G. in matters of greatest importance, did discover to a friend of
his, who imparted the same unto me, that he learned at his hands, that the 19 of
this moneth, Queen Mother held a secret Councel, at which was present one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Cardinall of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and two others: In the which it was debated, what
course was to be taken for the appeasing of their troubles here. And after long
deliberation it was concluded, That untill such time as <hi>England</hi> might be kept
occupied, there could grow no through redress here, without hazarding of the
whole estate, and that therefore it was requisite now to yeild to them of <hi>Rochel</hi>
any reasonable kind of surety they would require, as also to other Towns in
<hi>France</hi> that would not yeild. And rather then fail, to yeild to them so far, as to
let them have the liberty of their Religion, to suffer the Nobility of the Country
that inhabit near the Towns, to live in the same, to keep such Garrisons in the
same as they may think fit for their surety, with condition that the said Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
shall deliver some of their children to be Hostages with the King for his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that the said Towns shall be kept to his use. And amongst others it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
that the offers should be made to Count <hi>Mango</hi> to retire himself
to <hi>Rochel,</hi> with condition to yeild his son to be a Pledge. These offers they
think to be so large, as they make full account they will be accepted. This thing
being done, it is then concluded to send under the conduct of the Marquis <hi>de
Maine</hi> 1000 shot, which thing shall be done as proceeding from him himself, in
respect that he is the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> kinsman, and disavowed by the King, who
shall land at a place called <hi>Aier,</hi> &amp; shall after they have joyned with the Qu. party,
repair to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where <hi>Liddington</hi> and <hi>Grange Kirkaldie</hi> have promised to
deliver up the Castle unto such as the King shall appoint, upon recompence to
receive some living here in <hi>France,</hi> there leaving a sufficient Garrison, they shall

&amp; at <hi>Haymouth:</hi> And that this being done, the Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> and <hi>Chevalies</hi> shal
come over with other forces to procure the delivery of the Queen of <hi>Scots:</hi>
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:54478:168"/>
such of the Queens friends as are in <hi>England,</hi> wil incontinently take Arms, who
do give out to them here, that her party and forces are so great there, that having
good Leaders &amp; munition, they shal be able to make their party good enough, &amp;
to deliver the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> in despite of her Majesty. In the mean time till
the King hath compounded with those Towns that now hold out, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that the D. of <hi>Chastelr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

composition that the Regent will have them, onely to keep out that her Majesty
shall send thither no forces in assisting of the Regent; which thing they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements
from their Ambassador that she hath meaning to do. And for the
communicating of those matters unto the Queens party there, it is determined
that <hi>Viraque</hi> shall depart thither forthwith, he shall also have commission to
bear the Regent in hand, that the King here doth not mislike of the present go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
there, nor that he is chosent Regent, and to use all such like speeches
as may entertain him for a time, untill such things here be setled. He shall also
have charge to offer him the entertainment of men of Arms to all such young
Gentlemen as are serviceable, as well to them of one part, as to those of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Other particularities he said he learned of him, which he might not utter,
and were of great consequence. The Gentleman to whom this was discovered
being a Scot, is one whom I do very well credit, and for that he is thought to
incline towards the Queen of Scots, the party above named did deal the more
frankly with him; and because I thought it necessary for her Majesty to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
so much, I thought good to send this Messenger of purpose withall,
and have promised for his recompence to have 6 pounds 13 shillings 4 pence. For
that mine own men are not returned, I am driven to use him. If her Majesty
desire to hear often from hence, then must there be order taken for the sending
back of those I send thither. And so leaving, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I thank you for your notes which you sent me of the Comet, or new Starre;
but in the placing of it your Astronomers and ours differ exceedingly. Yours
do place it in the 29 of <hi>Piscis,</hi> and ours in the 7 degree of <hi>Taurus,</hi> so they vary
one whole sign and 8 degrees. Your printed Book goeth upon it <hi>

but it is one thing to rise with the degree of the Zodiack, and to stand in a place
after Sexion of the Zodiack: and our men do find him far above the Moon, and

and how prosecuted here by Monsieur and <hi>du Foix.</hi> And since that
time this Ambassadour there could find the Queen Mother: It ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
with what absurd Offers it hath been handled: To have an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview
it was required that the Queens Majesty would repair to <hi>Dover,</hi> and
the Queen Mother and the Duke should come to <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> and the advice
that they should meet upon the Sea in October<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All which was taken off, and

that the Queen would meet with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as argued either a gross ignorance in them that named <hi>Iersey,</hi> as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how farre it was by Sea from <hi>England,</hi> or else a flat mock, in offering a
thing so unreasonable, and to say the truth, impossible. And surely, it could

come into the Isle of <hi>Scotland</hi> to have spoken with the Queens Majesty the next
year, if she would make her progress to <hi>Berwick.</hi> Since these follies passed, they
have by the Ambassadour generally pressed the Queens Majesty to the Duke,
but no special dealing hath been for any enterview, or for answer how he will

Majesties Ambassadour with the French King.</head>
                  <p>SIR<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this day I received your Letters with two French Books; the one, of
<hi>Carpenter</hi> the Apostate; the other, by an unknown malicious French
Writer, taught by a rebellious crafty Papist of <hi>England,</hi> wherein though
he meant maliciously to the State, yet he rometh his choler and despite
chiefly against me and my Lord Keeper by Nick-names. God amend his
spirit and confound his malice. And for my part, if I have any such malicious
or malignant spirit, God presently so confound my body to ashes, and my soul to
perpetuall torment in hell. I know not whether you shall be able to understand
the Author; but if by the Printer it might be found out, I would gladly bestow
any reward upon the discovery; if it cannot be found, then I wish that some
means were used as of your self to Queen Mother, that the print may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
For otherwise we shall think our selves, considering the places we
do hold in this estate, not well considered by that estate.</p>
                  <p>I have not imparted any thing to my Lord of <hi>Worcester,</hi> but leave the order
of the whole to your direction. This licentiousness to inveigh against men by
name in printed bookes, that use not by books to provoke any, is in all good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
intolerable. God send this Estate no worse meaning servants in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
then we two have been, who indeed spared not labour nor care to serve
our Queen and Countrey; and if we had not, we may truly avow, neither our
Queen nor Countrey had enjoyed that common repose that it hath done.</p>
                  <p>I am required to recommend my Lord of Worcester unto you which I need
not, because you know his Office and cause of coming; and besides, you shall
find him a Nobleman of great gentleness and thankfulness. And therefore you
shall find cause to shew him all good Offices and favours. And if my hearty
commendations of his Lordship may do any thing in his gratification, I pray you

                     <p>Sir, when I consider of this lewd Book, I think it will be replied unto you,
That it is reason that answer be made to such books as are published for
the condemning of the Queen of Scots: And so for my part I yield that
Writers answer matters. But to have the Duke of Norfolks cause
brought in question, and Us that are Councellors to the Queen, to be so
maliciously and falsly calumnied, may not wel stand with the term of the
Amity professed. But yet I leave all to your consideration and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

                  <p>FIrst, you shall make our Ambassador there resident Mr. <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi>
privy of the office, which at this time you have to do, and the Letters which
you have to deliver, and confer with him of the manner of the Court, and
the use at this present; and as he shall be able to inform you, and you of your
wisdom and discretion do understand, with all convenient Honour, Amity and
Love you shall deliver our Letters, and do such offices as to our Ambassage
doth appertain. And if the Emperors Ambassador hold the child himself, you
may also do it; but if that you shall perceive that any device or other sinister
means shall be given about to bring you to their mass, or any other superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ceremonies, which the order of our Realm doth not allow, you shall not
consent nor assist it, but rather absent your self, and understanding that before,
with honourable excuse require the Queen Mother, that the Queen of Navarre,
to whom we have in this case written our special Letters, to be our deputy for
you; or in the absence or let of her, any other Princess or Noblewoman, whom
it shall please the Queen Mother to appoint and address to it, according as we
have also written to the said Queen Mother. And you shall not need to break
neither with the King nor Q. Mother, nor any other, or any matter, but of such
courtesies and other Court-like entertainment as shall be ministred unto you.
But if it shall happen the King or Queen Mother, or any such person, to go
further with you, and to feel you with words in any of the points hereafter
mentioned, we think it honourable for you not to shew your self ignorant of
our mind therein, nor how things have proceeded heretofore in those matters,
and how they stand at this present. And therefore we have thought good to
inform you, in those points whereupon it is most likely they will make some
mentioning and questioning with you, to know our further resolution and
mind therein, that as in all other matters likely to be moved unto you, you
shall do well first to confer with our Ambassador there, by whom you shall
understand how things have gone hitherto. And for this time you may say,
besides all other things, whereof they be already fully advertised of our mind,
we think it now reason that the matter of Religion be first esclared; for because
that there in his Realm there hath been made great alteration in that point, since
the late communication thereof; and therefore it is now reason that we should
the more carefully provide, that the difference therein should breed no distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
disquietness or doubt in ours. And as the said King hath held a stiff
hand to maintain onely one Religion in his Realm, although he with open
Edicts did profess the protection of two, and the defence of them both indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently;
so it behoveth us rather, who did maintain but one onely in our Realm,
and never yielded to the other by any Edict, or Protection, or favour, now at
this time not to change our course, but to profess all one thing, which we
have done sith we came to our Crown, and to suffer no permission or winking
at of any other Religion then that which we and our Realm hath always held
and maintained, and by Gods grace intend always to do; and so much the
rather we have cause to require it at this present time, because that in the
dealing with Mon. <hi>D'Anjo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> in the treatie with Mon. <hi>De Foix,</hi> matters were
made more easie and temperate, to the which we did the rather incline; when
it should come to the knitting up, that Sir <hi>Tho: Smith</hi> now our Secretary was
sent, then such things were required as never before were expected, as open
Mass, a Church, a Chappel proper, and all such solemnity of other ceremonies
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:54478:170"/>
and abuses which our Realm and policie cannot suffer, whereupon necessitie
was for us clearly and plainlie to break off; and least the same inconvenience
should follow, or that protracting of time should be thought but a dissembled
entertainment of other cause then we have in mine, you may say, that we
pray the King and Queen Mother, to cause first this point of Religion to be
clearlie esclared and opened, that upon that we may more clearly judge what
is to be done of us to the proceeding any further of that matter of marriage.
And you may say more, that it is that point that we have thus long attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that our Ambassador there Resident should have certified us from their
Majesties so, that before we have answer from them of these points, by
reason we cannot proceed to go any further in this matter, in which
heretofore we have not been answered, and the answer thereof lieth in their
hands.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the demands, that such as of late were fled hither sithence
these late troubles, that we should rather admonish them, or command them
to avoid the Realm, as Rebels to the French King our brother: You may say,
that we do understand of no Rebellion that ever they were privy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nto, and can
perceive nothing, but that they are well affectionated to their Prince; but when
such common murthering and slaughter was made generally throughout <hi>France,</hi>
of those who professed the same Religion, that it was natural for every man to
fly for his own defence, and for the safetie of his life; and it is the priviledge
of all Realms, to receive such woful and miserable persons as do fly to it onely
for defence of their lives. And for their return, the chiefest of them have been
spoken unto; and they make their answer, that the same rage of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which made them first to fly hither, doth still continue the cause of their
tarrying here; for as they then did kill with fury, and as it may appear the
greatest number of those that were killed without the commandment or avow
of the King; so it is most like they would execute still their malice, if the
persons were there against whom it was then, and is yet inflamed; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any letters declaratory, or other prohibition by the King, as it is
manifest and notorious that very many have been publiquely, and are almost
daily slain and murthered in <hi>France,</hi> that be of their Religion, sith these
contrary Edicts were published, and cryed by sound of trumpet. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
until they may see that the quiet of the Realm be better established, the
fury of the people and the bloody murtherers appeased, they will live here,
and obey the Kings Edicts. They think themselves unsure there, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us of our mercy to have compassion of their miserie. And if so be the
King (you may say) would suffer them to enjoy their revenues, whether they
remained here, or went into any other Countrey, you may say, that we
suppose they would be as faithful subjects to him as any other in his Realm,
for other we espie none in them. And if we can perceive at any time, that
they were otherwise minded, or should attempt any thing for the disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his person or Realm; you may say, we will not suffer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
within our Realm. And as for the Commerce and Traffique of our
Merchants, there was, nor is in us any difficultie, why not thereby, as by
all other waies, the Amitie and League should not in all points be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
But such things have sith that time happened in that Realm, that even
to this day our Merchants be in horrour and fear to meddle therein; especially
to go much within the Land, sith such libertie is given or suffered into the
hands of the popular, to kill or murther whom they could, without punition
therefore or justice; nevertheless, we are in hope, that in time the King
will peovide, that he shall be better obeyed, and that his sword of justice
<pb facs="tcp:54478:171"/>
shall rule, and not the unbounded lust of the populer, to the which no wise
man or careful of his life, will hazard himself, we could not but as a good
Princess and mother of the Commonwealth, bear with our Subjects in this
fear so probable. Nevertheless, we shall give order that our Secretarie
and others, who do favour the cause, shall be joyned in Commission to treat
with his Ambassador here, and as shortlie as time will serve, and as our
Merchants do by little and little get more boldness to traffique there, and
no part of that which was begun for the more streighter Amitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and our Realmes be left unperfect and unaccomplished on our
behalf.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Scotland,</hi> you may say, that Monsieur <hi>de Crocque'</hi> s going away so soon,
wherefore we were very sorry, because he tarried not until the peace was
concluded, we suffered our servant <hi>Henry Killegrew</hi> to sollicite the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of peace. And although there appeared great likelihood from time to
time to follow of an universal peace, and very reasonable conditions offered;
yet they of the Castle, as appeareth, not minding to have any peace, would
not agree to them; wherefore, as it appeareth, they are like again to have
civil Wars, a thing most displeasant to us, being their next Neighbours; and
for our part, we think they have misused both him our good brother and
us; the King to imploy Monsieur <hi>de Crocque;</hi> and us, the Marshal of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k</hi>
first, and now <hi>Henry Killegrew,</hi> whereas it appeareth they meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
less then agreement, especially two or three of them in the Castle, who
have offered unto them all humanitie, their lands, livings and offices, and
whatsoever could be reasaonably desired, yet will not condescend for common
quiet to acknowledge their King, and to deliver him that hold, having as
good offered them for their own suerty, which in common peace should
seem needless; so that for ought that can appear unto us, we think it not fit
that we or our good brother should suffer such outrage at their hands, or our
two travels being Princes, to be had in so little reguard; besides that, we
have kept in our hands the Castle of <hi>Hume</hi> at our charge, being to us no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
or commoditie, but that we desire to bridle both the parties, to come to
an accord: For being by the League bounden to deliver it, but any of the
Scotish if we should have delivered it to any of the adverse party, though the
peace had followed, we know not how to compel them to render the same
to the natural Lord thereof, to whom we most desired to render the same,
although he had smally deserved that kindness at our hands; if we had delivered
it to him before, we doubted there should have bin occasion to make him hold
out more obstinately from the Agreement and Peace, who as it appeareth, is
too much obstinate without it. And as we have divers times by our Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
there, and writing, declared to them, that assoon as they were come to
a full Agreement and Peace within themselves, we would most willingly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the same Castle, and the Territory thereof to the said Lord <hi>Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>:</hi>
So you may say, that our good brother shall well perceive, that if yet they
will grow to common peace within themselves, the Castle of <hi>Hume</hi> shall be
streight restored to the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> as it hath been often declared both
to him and them before. And if he and the rest will not come to Peace and
Accord, peradventure we shall deliver it (as we may well do) unto them of that
Nation, out of whose hands the Lord <hi>Hume</hi> shall have enough to do to get it,
which is nothing in our default, which desires them most earnestly to have them
at quiet and peace within themselves, and to be ruled by justice, so should our
Subjects near adjoyning to them be in more rest, and have better justice upon
the Out-laws and Thieves who do offer daily injury to our Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:54478:171"/>
redress, because of the civil troubles. And if any mention be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you of the Scotish Queen, either for her life, or for her deliverance, that
you should be a mean to us for her, You shall answer, that her attempts be
known to have been such, both towards us and our Realm, as you cannot
gladly hear her spoken of; and that you could not think your self a good
Subject, if once you should open your lips for her; and therefore you shall
require, that they will no more speak to you of her, nor of any such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> I have received your Letters sent by <hi>Williams,</hi> I perceive
it is hard to recover a Rider, but to pay too dearly for him, I will stay
therefore till better occasion shall serve, and do heartily thank you for your good
remembrance and travel therein.</p>
                  <p>I wrote of late to you, which Letter I hope be come safely to your hands;
the rather, for that I write somewhat openly for want of a ready cypher, for
these causes, I have since considered more of the person and the matter:
and surely I can no way perswade my self, that the cause you should stay for,
is any way sincerely meant there, but rather a meer practise to entertain us
here, and to discover of the other side, what may be under the hope, that by
that means many may be drawn unto, for no other way but this have they
left to beguil the world, especially us; and those they seek to destroy, seek
narrowly and deeply into it; and in the mean time consider how slightly
the great post haste matter was slipt off, that our ship tarried so long for; what
was it else but a plain work to hold us with such a sudden amazed chance, the
same in their opinion, we should believe their case to be as dangerous as they
would make it. Weigh also, the pretty escape of the disguised attempt of
the party, that seemed to be in so great peril, who can believe other, then
that it was a made matter, to continue a belief, whom they think they
have inchaunted at their wills. Let us examine also, the instruments what
they be, those of the most arrantest sort of Papists, those here never count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
setled, or informed in Religion. Besides, the process of the doings over
both sides, doth shew no good end towards, but even a stratagem it will
prove in my opinion; and therefore I am the more careful that we may so espy
it, and so use it, as it may return upon their own necks. For my own part, I
promise you I did suspect it, the first time of his opening of the matter, for truth
will seek no angles. Truly he was fain to seek all his brains, to make any
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:54478:172"/>
matter worthy of credit, for these suspicions were found even at the first, he
was divers in his tales, his Letters delivered assuredlie were counterfeit, and so was
driven in the end to confess in a manner, albeit in a sort they were after confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there from you to his better credit: for first, he avowed, they were all the
parties own hands; Next he said, after the Letters were compared with
others of the parties, the Letters were of his own writing, that escaped a
late, but the superscription the others; Lastly, he could not tell it for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
for that it was sent to him. But the message was surely delivered
by the person himself, which we after perceiving the party there to avow,
did alter the minds of some, albeit for my part it would not enter into me;
Since how great suspicion again is given, I refer to your self. The matter
known to many of his Countrey men, as well as to you, and yet a shew
to be kept secret from the King, who will believe it? again, his often
sending his own servants, and never none met withal who can think it
likely?</p>
                  <p>Also, the parties chief instruments there to be imployed, being so great a
Papist, and not to take such a matter as was lately offered him in worse part then
he doth, who will believe there can be plain dealing in this case. O it were a
happy turn to make some small trial what we were there, and that we might
have occasion to trounse his companion here for his pains; and yet to pay them
with their own rod, and seem to crave thanks for discovering to the King
there such a dangerous practise, which we may easily and well do. And I
dare venture my arm to be cut of, that it will fall out a plain practise, and
in the end the King may take his advantage against her Majestie when he
list, and say justly, that she was willing to offer him such an injury, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
such practise. I am bold to discover thus much of mine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
to you; you may use it to as you see cause. But truly, I for my duties
sake do not spare to inform her Majestie what I think of it; albeit she is yet
somewhat loath to discredit the party there, she is born in hand his love is
great. Now also a little further, as your friend, I will be bold with you,
I pray you consider accordingly of it: We find certainly, that oft-times
your advertisements be made more common even of the greatest, then is
thought convenient. You know what opinion is here of you, and to what
place all men would have you unto, even for her Majesties sake; besides that,
the place you alreadie hold is a Counsellours place, and more then a Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
for a time; for oft-times Counsellours are not made partakers of such
matters as you are acquainted withal, and do advertise hither, so much the less
are others to be acquainted with your secrets: And the more boldlie this, for
that it hath been friendlie told me, and in this sort, That you have written
sometimes more largelie to some private friends, then almost to her Majesties
self; if it be so, then I pray you accept this friendly; if not, yet I will tell
the parties and their names. And even upon this your last advertisement,
which you committed to your messenger, to deliver to my Lord Treasurer
and me, the same was also communicated to others, being no Councellors,
and by your Letters referred to receive the understanding at the Messengers
hands; and I will tell you what followed, and this we speak upon knowledge,
before we had either imparted your Letters to her Majestie, or scarce read
them all, I assure you the Count <hi>Montgomery</hi> was advertised (being this day here
in the Court) of the matter, which if it should grow further, may happilie
turn to that Gentlemans destruction; besides, the like secret matter which
you committed to be delivered to my Lord Treasurer and me upon the slaughter
when you durst not write, was likewise communicated unto others, which came
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54478:172"/>
also to our knowledge, for it was in open talk within ten hours after we had
it; yet upon our honour we had not delivered it to any Councellour living,
one or other; wherefore you may see it is not good to trust messengers nor to
impart any of your weighty causes, how near or dear soever they be to you: for
I assure you they go from friend to friend, and my self have had them brought
to see; and yet I must say, I saw no matter of so great weight, albeit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I saw that
such were fitter to receive almost no letters, then to send them abroad. This
I assure you, Mr. <hi>Walsingham,</hi> I do upon meer good will and honest friendship
towards you, and so I pray you take it. And I desire you to commit this letter to
<hi>Vulcan.</hi> And being weary, I commit you to God.</p>

of the good fortune of the Rochellers, God send it to be true; as also, that the
King is of no better credit with the Almains and Switzers. I wrote of late to

these ten daies. I pray you send me word whether it hath been opened or no.
If I thought you should tarry longer there, I would send you a Cypher, but I

should not minister occasion of talk on them, and possibly they will say nothing,
and yet with you they will be busie, which if it come to pass, there is no doubt
but you can and will answer to the effect of those Instructions, and further, as
occasion shall be ministred.</p>
                  <p>But in one point, that is, for the breach of the abstinence in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which
then was not certain, and now is certain, hard it is if they be not questioning
with you; for I am sure <hi>de la M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t</hi> will not be without his intelligence from
<hi>Scotland,</hi> nor negligent in advertising to <hi>France:</hi> And upon occasion of time,
whether you be demanded or not, it is thought meet that you take occasion to
shew the King, that to the grief of the Queens Majestie, the Scots have not
agreed, but be broken again into hostilitie within themselves; which although
tou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heth joyntly the Fr. K. and her Majestie, because they two being Princes of
so great authority, and so conjoyned in love and amity, and both by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
by their Ambassadors, labouring to bring them to unity, peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
within themselves, should be so illuded and scorned of a few petty compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
that having all things offered unto them that they could desire reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and more; yet they would still maintain war in their own Countrey, and
in the tender age of their young King, whom to set up and Crown they were
the first doers.</p>
                  <p>This injury you may say, touched the King, as well as the Queens Majestie,
because joyntly they both like Princes in most amitie agreed in their Leagues
together to pacifie and unite <hi>Scotland</hi> in it self, which now by discord intestine
being disunited, is brought almost to extreme poverty and misery. The
other cause toucheth more her Majestie, because they being her Neighbours
next adjoyning, and bordering upon her Subjects, while the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi>
was united, and peace within it self, if any of their Thieves and Out-laws had
injury by theft or murther, any of her Majesties Subjects, upon complaint, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
was had, the Malefactors punished, and he who had the injurie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored,
and so was it on both sides reciprocally. Now in this Civil dissention, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
robberies, stealth and murthers be committed daily, and then the one part
or the other beareth them out; so that it were almost as good to have a border
war betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the poor men that do dwell thereabouts,
as civil wars betwixt the Scots themselves; and therefore this breach betwixt
the two parties must needs grieve her Majesties Subjects more then the French
King, being so far distant; and so consequently her Honor, who indeed doth
take it and not without cause, heavily, for that they have not esteemed better her
Majesties good will, and desire, that she had all their strifes and debates among
themselves compounded and accorded, and that they have set so light by the
authoritie of the French King their brothers and heirs. The young King is her
Majesties near Kinsman, and her Highness desireth not onely to have him
preserved, but also his Realm; if it could be in quiet, peace, and good o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>der,
and aboundance, which without inward peace, cannot be had; and must
needs think evil of these few petty companions, being gotten into the
Castle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> which for their wilful obstination and private bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
shall keep that Realm still in that dissention and trouble, in contempt
of such Princes as the French King and her Majestie is, whose design
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54478:173"/>
tended to nothing but to make unitie and concord among them there. And
therefore if <hi>Hume</hi> Castle and <hi>Fast</hi> Castle, which her Highness hath detained
hitherto in that hope, upon accord to have rendred them to the Lord and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
thereof, from whom they were before by just war taken. Now her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
seeth no longer cause to detain, but to render them according as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
in the Treatie, not to them who have so evil deserved of her Majestie,
their own King and Countrey, by their perverse obstinacy; and of the French
King also, but one of the same Nation, who acknowledgeth their King, and
is desirous of unitie, peace, concord and good government in that Realm, and
of this her design her Majestie thought meet to make her good brother the
French King first privy unto, for the love that she doth bear unto him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Amity and Intelligence betwixt the two Realms. I am glad to
have this occasion to send this bearer <hi>Iohn Farry</hi> your man unto you; for I
assure you I do pitty your case, that so many of your men be here together;
peradventure occasion may serve shortly to send you another, yet methinks

                  <head>To the Earl of Leicester.</head>
                  <p>AFter the inclosing up of my other letters, I received at one instant
two sundry Letters of your Lordships; the one, of the eighth and
the other of the nine and twentieth. Touching the first, your Honour doth
concur with me in opinion, as I conceive by the same, that the matter which is
the chiefest cause of my stay, is but a meer entertainment, the matter through
misguiding, is never like to come to issue. If they mean otherwise, which
is most likely, why should her Majestie endure to be any longer abused?
As your Lordship findeth the partie that dealeth there halting, and divers in
his tales, even like unconstancie and doubleness do I find in him here, that
dealeth with me. To disguise the matter, they borrow certain names out of
<hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> wherein they deal most aptly, to adde to a fained thing,
fained names. They judge us to be very gross, and do think that every
fair and coloured speech is able to abuse us: I cannot be otherwise perswaded,
but some here that rule all, are acquainted with the matter; for otherwise,
the partie that last came over would never have medled in the same. God
send it a better end then I look for. For your Lordships good advice in the
latter end of your letter, I most humbly thank you, and do think my self much
bound to you for the same, as for any other favour I have received at your
Lordships hands since I entred into this service, The best recompence I can
make unto your Lordship, as I know, is to take profit thereof. True it is,
that sometimes in requital unto some of my Friends, who have given
me large entertainments of the state of things, whereof otherwise I
<pb facs="tcp:54478:174"/>
have been ignorant, I have also largelie made them partakers how things
passed here, and somewhat more largelie then I have communicated the
things unto her Majestie, because it passed the bounds of my function here,
which is onelie to advertise. Notwithstanding, seeing the same is not used with
that secresie as is fit, I will avoid hereafter to offend. Touching the Counts
being acquainted with the matter of secrecie, your Lordship shall understand,
that the partie that made me acquainted, withal, delivered me certain Letters
sent from the place you wot of, which I caused my men to deliver unto him,
by the which he came to the knowledge of the matter. Now to come to
your Lordships latter letter, I see great cause to confer the likelihood of my
letters of the four and twentieth of the last; for that there is great hope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
here, that by large offers they have lately made to such Towns as hold
out, they will grow to a composition, which in the end will be neither good
for themselves nor for us, howsoever the Ambassador there speaketh by the
absence of some from hence. I cannot be able to discover any more touching
the Scotish affairs, then alreadie I have done. And now that the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth,
I am cut off from all means to have any great intelligence, either
for that matter or others, especially for that I shall be constrained for lack
of abilitie, to remain here still, being unfurnished of all means to follow the
Court: And then seeing my remaining here shall be unprofitable unto her
Majestie, and to my undoing, I hope her Majestie will no longer defer my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
which I doubt not your Lordship will further as much as you may.
And so leaving, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>SIr; after the closing up of my other Letters, I received yours of the nine
and twentieth of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> Touching the contents of the same, I will not
fail upon the next convenient occasion to deal with her Majestie here concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scotish matters, though I be not provoked by them, because I am
directed so to do.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, in my poor opinion, as I mean here to say nothing, but to
do somewhat that may tend to the continuance of the troubles there, until such
time as ther own things being settled at home, they proceed in prosecuting
their other practises; so were it not amiss for her Majestie to use like silence, and
to provide to withstand their malice; but herein I am to do as I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                  <p>The Scotish Ambassador is advertised by the ship late arrived out of <hi>Scotland</hi>
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> how that <hi>Iames Cancald</hi> is arrived at a place, if I do not mistake
it, called <hi>Aberdeny</hi> in the Earl of <hi>Huntleys</hi> Countrey, to which place <hi>Viracque</hi>
who latelie departed from hence, is appointed to repair.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Levingston</hi> desireth most earnestly to have a passport to pass
through <hi>England,</hi> for that he is wearie of this Countrey, and would fain be
at home. He promiseth to communicate to her Majestie, at his arrival at the
Court, such things as she shall not repent the granting of the same. And if

for mine own opinion, I think it not amiss to grant it him, for that I learn
by some of credit that he communicateth his secrets to, that he misliketh
their doings here, and the pretended enterprize towards our Island, as
one that tendeth to the overthrow of Religion, and the ruine both of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> I have promised by the next to give him a
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54478:174"/>
resolute answer: and therefore I beseech you to put her Majesty in mind of the
same. Now to come to mine own particular, I had well hoped my stay here
should not have been so long protracted, and that my miserable case should have
been otherwise weighed; especially seeing my state here should breed but a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to my self, and no benefit to her Majesty: For now the Court removeth
from hence, I shall be driven to remain here, and not to follow the same for lack
of ability, having neither furniture, money, nor credit. I beseech you, Sir, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to lay my case before her Majesty; who, I hope, will so graciously consider
the same, as I shall be presently relieved, and others receive no discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to accept like service. And so leaving further to trouble your Honor at
this present, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

                  <p>SIR, I have received your Letters of the 20 of this moneth, with the tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
after your accustomed manner concerning <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> and was on Friday last
with the party on whom you made mention to be from <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> he spake with
<hi>Glasco.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <hi>Davison</hi> with him. I see there was a great mistaking of our
doings; for by <hi>Davisons</hi> writing of a ship sent to <gap reason="symbol" extent="7 letters">
                        <desc>〈7 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap> imagining
that <hi>Hall</hi> 3. had a meaning to provoke <hi>Glasco</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>9 to come hither; whereupon
this last Gentleman came to enquire of <hi>Hall</hi> 
                     <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap>. some assurance if <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap>. should so
do, to enquire<gap reason="symbol" extent="10 letters">
                        <desc>〈10 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This you must think must
needs appear very strange. Whereupon before <hi>Davison</hi> I did declare that
all that was done came of him with earnest and lamentable requests to
have <hi>Glasco</hi> 
                     <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> preserved; because he said that <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> had gotten such knowledge
of the same, as the same would tend to the ruine of <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> and so the party that
now was sent is departed well certified of the truth, but not satisfied of his
request.</p>
                  <p>It is good to deal warily herein, for some cause to mistrust that <hi>Davison</hi> and
all his partners do nothing herein without knowledge of <gap reason="symbol" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>〈☐〉</desc>
                     </gap> and therefore it is
in such sort herein ordered, as there can be no advantage taken, I trust: And so
also you may look to your doings, as I see you are disposed, by the occasion
of the fond handling, that you see I am much perplexed with the dishonor done
to my Lord of Worcester, her Majesties Ambassador on the seas before <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loign.</hi>
Wherefore by his own report I know you shall know the truth better
then I yet do know. I could wish my self a meet person for the service upon
the seas to avenge it. I have received your French lying book, which might
trouble me, if my life had merited such vile and spitefull poisoned speech:
but I trust God will suffer the good to think of me as I have deserved. I have
imparted to the French Ambassador my misliking of this lewd Book, in that
it hath been translated by—a man of note in that Court: and he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himself to procure the suppression of it. What he will or can do herein, <hi>I</hi>
know not.</p>
                  <p>After the writing of the former part hereof, your later Letters of the 24
were brought to me; by which you advertise of the like likely Councell there
intended for the appeasing of those inward troubles in that Realm, and of the
pretended favours to be shewed to them of the religion in <hi>odium t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54478:175"/>
to which devises hath already been begun here by this Ambassador with the
French King here; and such is his vehemency of speech, and fair offers, as he
hath brought the most of them to hearken to his pipe. I have let her Majesty see
and consider of your letters, saving some concerning our occurrents here. I will
move her Majesty to be more earnest then yet she hath been. There lacketh no
no
sollicitation for your revocation; and untill my Lord of <hi>Worcesters</hi> return, it shall
be hard to obtain any resolute answer.</p>
                  <p>If the French King shall follow towards <hi>Rochel,</hi> I would wish you to procure
means to tarry in some convenient place near <hi>Paris,</hi> and to send a Secretary to
follow the Court, with some pretence of lack of your health. But hereof you
shall best counsell your self. And so I end. From <hi>Westminster</hi> the 29 of January

                  <p>SIR, According to your direction of your Letters the 29 of the last, I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King of the great grief that her Majestie had conceived, that the travel
both of his and her Ministers took no better effect touching the appeasing of
the matters in Scotland, as a thing dishonourable for them both, to be deluded
and scorned by such petty companions as those are that are in the Castle, to
whom was offered as much as they themselves could desire reasonable, and
more; yet so are they carried away with their particular passions, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
nothing more then to maintain still Warr in their Countrie, not having
such a respect to the tender age of their young King as they ought, especially
seeing that they were the first and chief doers in deposing of the Queen, and
setting up of him. I shewed him also, That though the Kings civil Warr and
hostility, touched both their Majesties generally, as they that desired the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of that Realm, yet it touched the Queens Majestie more particularly, for
that during the time of these civil troubles amongst them, her Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that are borderers, are marvelously charged by outlaws and thieves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
no redress can be had by reason of their inward troubles amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>I declared unto him also, that her Majestie in regard of the kindred betwixt
the young King and her, could not but wish his Realm to be in quiet and peace
in this his minority; which thing would not be brought to pass so long as these
petty companions in the Castle, through their own wilfulness, obstinacy, and
private respects, shall keep that Realm still in dissention and trouble, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of both him and her Majestie, whose designe tended to no other end
but to make unity and concord amongst them. And therefore the King to
this answered, that he was sorry that their intentions in according of them,
took no better effect. And as for Hume Castle, he said, that though by the
League it was not expresly mentioned to be delivered to the L. <hi>Hume,</hi> yet the
meaning of it was so: Whereunto I reply'd, that the meaning of the clause in
the League touching the rendring of Hume Castle, had not respect to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
person, but generally to set that Country free from all forein forces, and
that therefore her Majestie might render the same to whom she would of that
Nation. To that the King replyed, that he had rather it should remain in the
Queens Majesties hands, who (saith he) is a Prince honourable and sincere, then
to be delivered into the hands of any of the other party. But herein (saith he)
I will advise my self with my Councel, and within a day or two make you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with mine answer. I told him according to my Lord of Worcesters
Instructions, that her Majestie delivering the same would capitulate with those
to whom it should be delivered, to restore the same to the L. <hi>Hume</hi> when
he shall recognize the Kings authority, as heretofore he hath done. The King
took occasion upon these Scottish matters to recommend unto the Earl of
Worcester, the Queen of Scots case: To whom my Lord answered, that such
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54478:176"/>
was their dangerous and unkind dealing towards her Majestie, as he should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the duty of a good Subject, if he should once open his lips for her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desired his Majestie to pardon him, in that he refused to be a dealer in that
behalf. To this the King answered, That he did not desire any favour to be
shewed unto her, otherwise then might be with the Queens Majesties safety. At
our access unto Queen Mother, she desired my Lord, that whereas there
hath been long in Treaty a marriage between her Majestie and her Son <hi>M. Le
Duc, de Alanzon,</hi> that he would therefore move her at his return, that the same
may grow to some conclusion, as that thing which she hoped would prove pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
unto her Majestie, and beneficial unto her Realm and Subjects. To this
my Lord answered, That the cause why the same grew not to some conclusion,
either off or on, proceeds, for that they have not made answer to certain things
propounded by the Ambassador here Resident, unto them; whereunto she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That she did not remember any thing whereunto they were so give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
whereupon I took occasion to shew her, that there were two points to
be answered, The one concerning Religion, the other concerning the interview:
For the point of Religion, I shewed her, that her Majestie in respect of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
that hath lately hapned in this Realm, and that which passed in the
Treaty of the Marriage between her and Monsieur <hi>de Anjou,</hi> had cause to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
that point first, as that thing which touched generally the quietness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of her Realm. Touching the interview, I told her, that for as much as
her Majestie could have no other way satisfaction then by the same, the point of
Religion once accorded, some convenient means for the accomplishing of her
said interview, was to be devised. To this she answered, that her Son was of the
same living that the other was, and of the same Religion, and therefore hoped
should have no less favour then the other should have had touching the point of
Religion, for that it is a thing dishonourable and unchristian for a Prince to
change his Religion upon the sudden. To this I replyed, that for mine own
part, I did not remember, that while I had the dealing in the matter, any liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in that was accorded to Monsieur <hi>de Anjou:</hi> And if it were, Madam, said I,
we see that a thing is tolerable—in the other. In conclusion my Lord request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in that she desired to grow to an end in this matter, that she would roundly
set down in her Letters, what the King and she required touching that part of
Religion. To this she answered, after some denial made thereof, saying, that
their Ambassador should signifie in that behalf, that she would be content so to
do. And touching the interview when matters of Religion should be once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
she doubted not but there would be means found for the bringing of the
same to pass, as should be to her Majesties satisfaction. I made her acquainted
with the matters of Scotland touching Hume Castle, whereunto I received like
answer at her hands, as at the Kings, which was, that after conference had with
their Councel, I should understand what was their mind and resolution in that
behalf; whereupon these Scottish matters she took occasion to recommend to
my Lord the Queen of Scots, to whom he gave like answer as before. In the
end, as my Lord was ready to depart, she shewed him that she was given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that there were certain ships a preparing in England, by certain Rebels
there, whereof she desired her Majestie to give redress, as appertained to good
amity. Whereunto my Lord answered, that she might be assured that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
had never any intention to tollerate any thing that might tend to the
breach of the same; so that if there were any preparation of ships in hand, as
he knew not of any, he was well assured her Majestie was nothing privy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
as also that her Majesties Subjects were no dealers in the same, who
hath forbidden them expresly not to intermeddle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:54478:176"/>
Why then, said she, if they be strangers, she ought to banish them, and
not to permit them to attempt any thing to the prejudice of this Countrey, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that she is as well bound to yield up ayd, requiring the same at her hands;
as we to grant the like unto her upon like occasion; and therefore she desired
him to put her Majestie in mind, that some order might be taken for the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the same, which he assured her he would at his return.</p>
                  <p>This was as much as passed at the time of my Lords taking of his leave. The
morning my Lord departed, Queen Mother sent for me, and shewed me, that
by Letters sent from Monsieur <hi>De la Mot,</hi> they were given to understand, that
her Majestie let fall some speech, that she could not think, that the continuance
of the Treaty of Marriage with Monsieur <hi>le Duc</hi> should be sincerely meant, he
being now retired from hence, and imployed by the King at <hi>Rochel:</hi> she there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for the satisfaction of her Majestie, requested me to desire the Earl of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>
to signifie unto her, that there is nothing that the King and she desireth
more then the accomplishment of the said marriage, and that to the end that the
Earl should see the Duke, the King stayed him here until Twelf-tide. About
which time they attended my Lords coming, whereas otherwise he had departed
together with Monsieur his brother before Christmass; and, said she, if we
had known the certainty of the Earls coming, he should have come hither in
post, to the end he might have seen him. I took occasion hereupon to tell her my
private opinion, if it would have pleased the King not to have imployed him in
these wars against those of the Religion, he should be in better opinion with
her Majestie, and more grateful to her Subjects. To this she said, that a young
Prince that hath courage and desire to do his Prince service, could not with his
honour remain behind, seeing his other brother imployed. I have made my
Lord acquainted with such Occurrents as are here, to the end he should impart
them to her Majestie by mouth. And so leaving, &amp;c.</p>

                     </hi> there repaired
hither of late divers Curriers, who use great silence, which make men to doubt
that things fall not out to their liking. I learn notwithstanding, that there is in
the Kings camp great scarcity of victuals, and a great number of Soldiers, through
cold, and want of other necessaries are dead, and do die daily. That the Duke
of <hi>Nevers</hi> hath taken upon him, with the help of certain Italian Engineers, to
make certain Fortresses in the midst of the Haven, to impeach all such as by sea
would bring to the Rochellois any succour. For the two Fortresses lately made
at the Entry of the said Haven, six ships notwithstanding passed by, laden with
corn and other munition, as it is reported. The common opinion is, that it will
be impossible by any device to make the said Fortresses that the Duke pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to make. There is secret whispering here, of some intelligence given by
<hi>Pacues,</hi> of an intended enterprize by <hi>Montgomery</hi> in <hi>Picardie;</hi> and that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King hath given order for the impeachment thereof. The Cardinal of
<hi>Lorrain</hi> hath within these two days taken up the enchange of certain Treasures
of the Town, 300000 franks, to what end I know not: He is now retired from
hence to <hi>Rome;</hi> the cause of his departure, as it is thought, is to remove the
suspicion from the Protestants, that they suspect nothing of the great conferences
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54478:177"/>
had at sundry times between Queen Mother and him. Here, since the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

of the good offices that the Lord <hi>Levingston</hi> will do in <hi>Scotland</hi> at his return,
I have taken upon me to give to him a passport, with condition, that if her
Majestie shall not like thereof, then he to return hither back again, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth

any favour she shall shew him. The Gentleman feareth, that if he should not
depart hence before Easter, he should be constrained to yield to their superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or to hazard his life in refusing the same, which is the cause why I grant him
the same pasport without hearing from her Majestie.</p>

                  <p>SIR, you may think it strange that I have writ no oftner to you then I have
done, and that I have no sooner dispatched your successor unto you; but I
think you know well enough the stile and order of the Court. Yesterday was
the first day that I could get your dispatch signed, and the same night I sent word
to your wife, and sent word to Dr. <hi>Dale</hi> who hath been with me in the morning,
and prepareth to take his journey straight after the holidays towards you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I thought good to give you warning by your servant; for before her Majesty
had signed, I durst never adventure to affirm any thing for fear of contrary winds,
the which is no news in this Court. Well, now I trust you be pleased, if with
nothing else, yet at the least, with your return. <hi>Montgomery</hi> is gone from hence,
whether he hath taken shipping or no, I know not, but I suppose he hath.
With his tarrying so long here, the Queens Majestie was fain to send to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Pirats of all nations thereabouts, who under the colour of the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> and the Count <hi>Montgomery,</hi> robed all manner of Englishmen and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
some of them are like to pay for it, and the rest be gone, or will be glad to
go; for it was time for justice to awake. Of <hi>Casteauneufs</hi> coming hither, on D'<hi>la
Motts</hi> errand, I think my Lord Treasurer hath written unto you, who is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vater
of it then I am, and the answer. The pretence was to bring recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and excuse from the Duke of <hi>Alanson</hi> of his absence at my Lo. of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
being there; the cause not pretended, what preparation was here to help <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel.</hi>
And he might easily see there was none by common consent and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
avow. What <hi>Montgomery</hi> for commiseration, or love of private men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
strangers, can get, is hard, and I fear by the event will not appear so much
as is thought and spoken of, and were expedient at this time, if any great thing
should be done. Scotland is very well come forward to an universall agrement,

(The King and the Lord Regent not being able for fair means to get them
to the unity of the whole Realm, offering unto them all reasonable conditions
that they can demand, so that they will leave the Castle, and to keep no longer

<hi>Du Viraque</hi> who is thought to be sent to keep them still in dissention, by good

                  <head>To my very loving friend, Francis Walsingham <abbr>Esq</abbr> Ambassador
for her Majesty with the French King.</head>
                  <p>SIR, your letters brought to me were of the 11 of March dated at St.
<hi>Cloud,</hi> and the next former were of the 25 of February, for which I thank
you, that you do so carefully advertise me of the state of things as I find you
have done, when I have been more answerable then now I can be. The reason of
my frequent absence, is the intervall of times, when here I am no less mindfull of
your causes, both such as belong to her Majesty, and such as belong to your self,
then any other to my power is or can be, and even now on Wednesday last her
Majesty hath signed all things meet to revoke you, and to send another in your
place; wherein I know you haue found cause to think the time long, and so have
your friends been lately grieved with it; but I trust now to see you shortly to
your contentation. You shall understand that the French Ambassador hath of
late time been very earnest with her Majestie in certain causes; as first, in offering
by all good speeches the continuance of the Amitie, and with complaining as
grievously that the Q. Majesties offering of <hi>Montgomery</hi> to be aided as he is, with
mony, &amp;c. must needs move the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing to think his Amity contemned. And with
some sweet minatories, he intrated that he might be staied, &amp;c. He also reneweth
the marriage matter, and thereto requireth a resolute answer, as a thing necessary
to be ended the one way or the other, for honor of all parties. He also hath see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
greatly offended with the stay of <hi>Viraque</hi> at Scarborough.</p>
                  <p>He hath made suit, that for the Queen of Scots, some ther in France, meaning
two or three, might come hither to bring the said Queen money, and account of
her Estate. In the end came hither an Agent named <hi>Chasteau Neuf</hi> from the
Camp afore <hi>Rochel:</hi> his coming was, as we perceive, to disswade <hi>Montgomery</hi> from
going to <hi>Rochel,</hi> but he brought loving letters to her Majesty from M. <hi>le Duc.</hi>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:54478:178"/>
To these things briefly you shall know the Answers. His offers of Amity have
been thankfully accepted, and it hath been told him that his Majesty is more
bound to the Queens Majesty for her perseverance then any other upon like
cause. For though it be manifestly seen, and fully discovered by such as are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in <hi>Scotland</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> having been dealers with the King in <hi>France,</hi>
and others there, how the King is disposed against the Queens Majesty, and this
Realm to offend it, when his own troubled causes shall be setled; and how he
persecuteth the Protestants, being of the Queens Religion; yet her Majesty
hath resolved to persevere in her League, meaning first to see the breach come
indeed first from the French King, then she doubteth not by Gods Grace to
preserve her, and her Realm, whereunto she also findeth all her people so willing
to withstand all forces force, as she hath much ado to detain them from adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
in great numbers to pass to <hi>Rochel</hi> of their own charges, and those are not
of the popular, but Noblemen and Gentlemen of Ancient and great liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods;
who surely have offered of their own charges to finde an Army of
20000 footmen, and 2000 horsemen for six months in <hi>Gascoyn;</hi> and so earnest
they have been, that it is already known to themselves, both where the men are
to be had, and the money; onely they desire but a permission, and truely her
Majesty hearing hereof, hath shewed her self much offended herewith, and with
great charge for fear of her indignation of the same, the Ambassador confessed
he had understanding, whereupon he was constrained to confess how much his
Master was bound unto her Majestie. All this you may notifie unto the King
and amplifie it; for it is true and meet to be uttered. As for the stay of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery,</hi>
it was said that he desired to depart the Realm, considering her Majesty
refused to aid him, and therefore her Majesty thought it a cruel part to stay him,
whom she was not disposed to aid. And for his manner of departure, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
could tell how much he was grieved with that her Majesty had caused
all such as were on the Sea for him and <hi>Rochel,</hi> to be apprehended, and all that
which they had taken from other the French Kings subjects to be restored as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the like general speedy restitution hath not been made in my time; so as
therewith also the King hath cause to commend her Majesties observation of the
League.</p>
                  <p>For the Marriage her Majesty caused me privately to confer with the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador,
and her Majesty hath willed me to let him know, that you shall make the
Answer, and yet he shall be acquainted with it, and so this it is, her Majesty would
have you to let the King and his Mother understand that she cannot accord to
take any person to her husband whom she shall not first see. Secondly, she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
assent that any person which shall be her husband, shall with her Authority
and assent use any manner of Religion in outward exercise that is in her Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
contrary and repugnant to the direct word of Almighty God, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
prohibited by the Laws of the Realm, whereupon these two Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
do necessarily follow, that in this case of Marriage with Monsieur <hi>de Duc</hi>
if he will obtain her his wife without sight of him, her Majesty cannot be had,
and yet therein h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r Majesty is very loath that he sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld think that she desireth
his coming, but as himself shall finde it meet by the advise of the King his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Queen mother, to whom she remitteth the consideration hereof,
with this assurance, that she meaneth in good faith to marry with him, if upon
his sight the one may like of the other, and that for the cause of Religion, as he
and she may so accord as that which he shall demand be assented unto without
offence of her Conscience, or without trouble of her Estate, and that that point
of Religion is thought meetest to be left at large to be communed upon betwixt
themselves, so as if it should mishap that one of them might not fully like of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:54478:179"/>
the other as to a conclusion of marriage, that the refusal or breaking up might
be imputed the cause of Religion, and so either party might honorably be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
to the world, and no occasion grow thereby of unkindness betwixt
them. This is the substance of her Majesties resolution, whereof to make the
Ambassador here privy, she seemeth not to mislike thereof, and in the end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with me that she took this course to be agreeable to the same resolution,
which was delivered at <hi>Killingworth</hi> the last of <hi>August</hi> to him and <hi>La Mott.</hi> And
so I think it in substance the same, whereof I do herewith send to you the
last two Articles of that Answer in French, as then it was given; to which news
you may refer this new Answer.</p>
                  <p>And now to add of mine own, you shall understand, that I see the imminent
perils to this State; and namely, how long soever she shall by course of nature
live and Reign, the success of this Crown so manifestly uncertain, or rather so
manifestly prejudicious for the State of Religion, that I cannot but still persist in
seeking for marriage for her Majestie, and finding no way that is liking to her,
but this with the Duke, I do force my self to pursue it with desire, and do flatter
my fancie with imaginations that if he should come hither, her Majesty would
not refuse him; and for his Religion, methinks if he may be otherwise liked,
he would not lose a Queen with a Kingdom, for a Priests blessing of a Chalice.
I cannot imagine that his Religion is rooted, that it may not be transported.
Now if I am deceived, yet for the time it easeth me to imagine that such a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
may follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but you have cause better to guess hereat then I; for I guess
at nothing but at the Queens Majesties disposition, which I take firmly to be bent
to marriage; but you on the other part may guess, whether he may be liked,
whether he may be induced to be qualified in his Religion; yea, whether his
marriage be meant seriously and sincerely on that part; and upon these conceits
you have cause to imagine more certainly what ought to be looked for or desired
then I can. But now turning my paper I will leave and end this matter, praying
you heartily to impart unto me your conceit herein, if thereby you see cause to
stay my course, you see how long I have tarried in this matter; for the rest of
the point (for <hi>Viracques)</hi> sending for me to come to the Scottish Queen, and for
the matters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I doubt not but Mr. Secretary hath enlarged his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
therein to you. And for more surety, because at the writing hereof he is
gone into <hi>Essex,</hi> I will upon the closing up of my Letter impart by speech some
part thereof to this bearer <hi>Walter Williams,</hi> to excuse me of longer writing. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<hi>Gordens</hi> denyal, to be privy to the Book lewdly augmented with a
blasphemous Prologue, I understand out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he is therewith well
acquainted, wherefore I pray you search it better out, and let me understand
what is now become thereof. And thus I end</p>

                  <head>A Copie of the Lord Treasurers Letter to the French
Ambassador.</head>
                  <p>MOnsieur I Ambassador, according to your motion, I conferred with her
Majestie upon the alteration or qualification of some points in the writing
which you sent me, as concerning the matter of Religion to be tolerated for
Monsieur <hi>le Duc,</hi> and after some long speeches passed herein, her Majestie col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in a few words, that she would it should by me be imparted unto you,
meaning to abridge the length of the form. First, That the King hath known
her disposition to marriage, and upon what cause since the first motion for Mr.
d' <hi>Anjou,</hi> and therein how she alway resolved not to marry without mutual sight
and liking, nor yet to have the matter of Religion to be a cause of trouble to her
state, and of the same minde she hath been, and yet is for Monsieur d'<hi>Alanson.</hi>
Now what is to be done further by Monsieur <hi>le Duc,</hi> she leaves that to the King
and him; with this, that if he should thus think beforehand, if he should come
percase liking should not ensue, that then he should conceive such offence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as his good will should turn into hatred, her Majestie thinketh it not meet
that in such case he should come at all, but if onely the matter of Religion
should breed such difficulty betwixt them, as howsoever the one should like of
the other, yet in respect of the satisfaction in that behalf the marriage should
not take place, it were honorable enough for both or either of them, though
upon the enterview the marriage did not succeed. And therefore no offence
ought to follow, or an alteration of good will, which is, that her Majestie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
to be conserved, whatsoever happen of the matter of marriage. Thus
after much long speech passed between her Majestie and me, praying you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the knowledge, that she is assured you have of her sincere meaning by
conference with her Majestie you will also deliver it to the King.</p>

of your Lordships Letters of <hi>March</hi> 20, I communicated to Q. mother, her
<pb facs="tcp:54478:181"/>
Majesties Answer touching the marriage matter, which I thought to begin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and concerning the other three points to say nothing but as occasion shall be
ministred by her.</p>
                  <p>For the marriage I shewed her that her Majestie could not speak more cleerly
in the matter then heretofore she hath done, which was that she could not accord
to take any for her husband whom she should not first see.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, That she cannot assent that any man that shall become her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
shall with her Authority and assent use any manner of Religion in outward
exercise, that is in her Conscience contrary to the direct Word of God, and so
consequently prohibited by the Laws of her Realm.</p>
                  <p>To the first of these two points she answered, that the King and she could not
consent to his coming over without surety that the marriage should proceed.</p>
                  <p>To the second, She said that it was neither honorable for him to abandon his
Religion upon the sudden, neither could her Majestie require to have a husband
to live without exercise of his Religion, and as for those words, whereas she saith
that he cannot consent that he shall have any manner of Religion, methinks said
she the words be very dark, and therefore I would be glad to know of you
what they mean.</p>
                  <p>To that I answered, that I had not Commission to interpret them, but in my
private opinion, her Majesties meaning was to debar him of the exercise of any
Religion repugnant to the Laws of the Realm. Upon these two points there
passed between us long debating. I shewed her how necessary the contentation
of the eye was in marriage, and that her Majestie by none that heretofore had
seen him, could receive any such satisfaction as were requisite. Further, I used
divers Arguments to prove unto her, that if the matter did not succeed, yet
could there not grow any dishonour unto him otherwise then in opinion.</p>
                  <p>For the second, I shewed her that as her Majestie had at all times cause to stick
upon this point of Religion, so never more then at this present, considering what
lately had passed here, which had generally bred in her Majesties subjects great
jealousie of this Crown seeing them so earnestly bent to oppress those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the same Religion that they do.</p>
                  <p>In the end she desired me in this behalf to shew unto her Majestie touching
the interview, that the King and she could not consent that the Duke should
come over unless he might be assured to speed, for that otherwise he returning
without speeding, should receive great dishonor, which might hinder some honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
offer lately made unto him. And after other Covenants that depend upon
the conclusion of the said marriage, which heretofore in the other Treatie were
reduced to a reasonable accord, shall be so secretly debated here, by some choice
persons elected for the purpose; with her Majesties Ambassador here resident
at the same time, as shall not be made common to the world, and then the same
being agreed upon, and assurance being given unto the King and her, by some
Letter of her own hand writing, that her intention is to proceed to the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the marriage, he should not fail to come over; and yet should he give
outto the world, that he adventureth to come over upon no other assurance then
upon good hope. I shewed her, that in this point the Queen my Mistriss as I
took it, was fully resolved not to receive any to her husband before she shall see
him. Notwithstanding Madam (quoth I) I will make her acquainted with your
requests in this behalf.</p>
                  <p>And as for Religion (saith she) we onely require that he may have some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
exercise for himself, and some few of his that he shall bring over with him,
with this Caution, that her Majestie should depute some whom she should think
fit for the purpose, to see that none of her subjects should resort to the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:54478:181"/>
I shewed her that I would make her Majestie privy to these her requests
though (said I) as far as I can perceive, I see her Majestie resolved to accept nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them. So proceeding in further talk, she shewed me, that she hoped
howsoever the marriage took place, the Amity notwithstanding lately concluded
would continue. I shewed her, that if there grow any violating thereof,
the cause should rather proceed from them then from his Majestie, though Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
I know that there are bruits given out here to the contrary: but I hope
Madam the King and you rest satisfied, if your Ambassador hath made you
truly acquainted with her Majesties proceedings. To that she answered, that
the King and she was to think themselves beholding to her Majesty, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that they would have wished that <hi>Montgomery</hi> had not received at her
Majesties subjects hands that he doth, though we know that Inhibition is made
by her Majesty to the contrary. I then shewed her, that to the end she might
understand how much she was beholding to my Mistris, I would (with her leave)
make her privy to such reasons as might have moved any other Prince but my
Mistris, who is consequently bent to make good Amity with them, to yield to <hi>C.
Montgomory</hi> all assistance. First I shewed her, that divers of her subjects of great
quality, courage, and likelihood, had laid before her Majestie sundry reasons to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
her to think that the fire lately kindled in <hi>France</hi> to the ruine of those of the
Religion there, if through Gods goodness it be not quenched, is also so meant that
it shall extend towards her; saying, that if she forbear to support them, and suffer
them to quaile, she would be the cause of her own ruine and of her Realm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides;
laying before her danger, they have laid before her also honor and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and have shewed her that now is the time for her to recover such Provinces
in this Countrey as appertain to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> And for the better
incouragement have offered her to finde her an Army of 20000 footmen, and
2000 horsemen for the space of six months.</p>
                  <p>Further I shewed her, that late it hath been discovered by such as are in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
arrived out of <hi>France,</hi> having been dealers with her Majestie and others
here, how they are disposed when their own troubled causes shall be setled, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
somewhat against her Majestie.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, I shewed her, how her Majestie hath been put in minde how little
account is had of the recommendations heretofore made by her and the Princes
of <hi>Germanie</hi> of those of the Religion here, seeing them persecuted with such
extremity, contrary to the assurance given by their Majesties unto such their
Ministers as did recommend them, which may give just cause to think her Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is little esteemed. All these courses notwithstanding which would move a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Prince, such is her affection towards this Crown, as she is fully resolved
to persevere in her League, meaning first indeed to see the breach come from the
King, and then she doubteth not in Gods goodness, but that she shall preserve
her self and her Realm against him or any other Prince that shall attempt any
thing against her, finding all her subjects most willing to withstand all forraign
forces, whatsoever is given out by certain Rebels.</p>
                  <p>To this she answered, that she knew by advertisement come from the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
that there was great sollicitation made by her subjects, as also great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
and that therefore they acknowledged themselves much beholding to her
Majestie for her intention to persevere in good Amity.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas you say, there hath been discovered by certain apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> some intention of ours to disquiet her Majestie, I protest saith
she, that both the King and I know of no such matter, and that the parties that
so do say, do belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this Realm I know not; but if it may be proved that they have received any,
<pb facs="tcp:54478:182"/>
they that have given them Commission shall receive such punishment as the Q.
your Mistris can desire. Our intention, saith she, touching the matters of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
was never other then to perswade them to accord; and to acknowledge
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To this I replyed, in so doing they break the League, for that it was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

considering that it vvas agreed that the matters in Scotland should be treated in

privy thereof, vvhich gave her Majesty a great occasion to suspect that vvhich
vvas discovered by certain taken in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be true; seeing such dealing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

to be his Minister.</p>
                  <p>To this she answered, That the Queen my Mistris had been made acquainted

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y. And as for his stay, Madam (quoth I)
though he avows himself to be the Kings Ambassador, yet her Majesty hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
order through<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

unless they be notoriously known to be Merchants, or have pasports or safe-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
shall not onely be staied, but also sent up to the Court, and therefore this
stay being generally upon good consideration considering the present state of
<hi>Europe,</hi> neither he nor any other that either hath been or shall be stayed can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of any violating of any privi edge, &amp;c. that appertaineth to any Ambassador;
She seemed to be very much intangled with this matter, and had not therefore
much to say for the staying of him. Afterwards falling into <hi>Montgomeries</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I declared to her Majesty also at large, how much he was aggrieved with
that her Majesty had caused all such as were on the Seas for him and <hi>Rochel</hi> to be
apprehended, and all that which they had taken from others, the French Kings
subjects, to be restored, and that with such speed, as the like speedy and general
restitution hath not been in my time heretofore. Whereby, said I, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
hath just occasion to commend her Majesties observation of the League;
which thing she acknowledged to be true, and therefore as they had cause, did
think themselves beholding to her Maiestie. This in sum was the effect which
passed between her Majestie and me. And so leaving, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>FOr satisfying of your Lordships request, touching my private opinion of the
marriage. The great impediment that I find in the same, is the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the eye. The Gentleman sure is void of any good favour, besides,
the blemish of the small pocks. Now when I weigh the same, with the delicacie
of her Majesties eye, and considering also that there are some about her in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
who in respect of their particular interesses, having neither regard unto
her Majestie, nor to the preservation of our Countrey from ruine, will rather
increase the misliking by defacing of him, then by dutifully laying before her
the necessity of her marriage; and that in true choice the satisfaction of the
ear importeth more then that of the eye; specially, that seeing to one of her
quality, there is not allotted that choice that is to other common personages, I
hardly think that there will ever grow any liking; for the Gentleman himself,
(his favour excepted) he hath many of those good parts that <hi>I</hi> would desire to
be in one whom I would wish to be her Majesties husband, if the other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
were removed. And as for his Religion, I do not doubt, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
had with some, but that he would be reduced to any conformity, so
that the sticking in that matter proceedeth rather from others then from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and yet they not moved thereto of conscience. But for other respects,
whether this marriage be sincerely meant or no, is a hard point to judge, where
dissimulation taketh so deep root. In my opinion, I think rather no then yea,
not for that they desire it not onely as a thing both honourable and profitable,
but also necessary, in respect to have a vent for the separation of the brethren:
But because they are altogether perswaded that her Majestie hath no intention
to marry, a thing partly proceeding from her own disposition, and partly through
the disswasion of others, who are not unknown to them, and therefore partly
do use the same but for an entertainment, in respect of their troubled state at
home. Such presumptions as I have to lead me so to think, I hope shortly to
impart unto your Lordship, &amp;c.</p>

this moneth there arrived one here, sent to the King from the Marshal
<hi>D'Anville;</hi> who reporeth, that the said Marshal hath lost at sundry assaults at
<hi>Sancerre</hi> in <hi>Berie</hi> fifteen hundred footmen, besides fifty Gentlemen, of whom
there is very good account made. Amongst the rest, there is very great moan
made for the loss of Monsieur <hi>D'Candales,</hi> a Gentleman of a very ancient
house, and one who married with <hi>Montmorencies</hi> sister. He reporteth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that there is in <hi>D'Anville's</hi> camp great scarcity of victuals, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
for lack of payment; so that if in time the King take not some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for the redress thereof, the said Marshal shall be constrained to break up
his camp.</p>
                  <p>Upon this discouragement of <hi>D'Anvile,</hi> the strength and number of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
increaseth daily, they having at this present, as it is reported, of Castles
and Holds almost a hundred, and of good fighting men eighteen thousand, yet
dispersed in the said Holds, but like to assemble when the season of the year shall
serve for the purpose.</p>

The 21 of this moneth word was brought to the Court, how those of the
Kings Camp that lay before Sansarra, as they gave assault to the Town the day
before, sustained a great repulse, and lost six score of their best Soldiers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they are driven to raise the siege.</p>
                  <p>By Letters sent from Rochel, of the 21 of this present, the King is advertised

any danger, and yet the pellet cannot be gotten.</p>
                  <p>By Letters also of the 26, sent from Rochel to certain private friends, they
are advertised, that there was no battery laid there before the 24, although it hath
been bruted, that it is long sithence that Monsieur had beaten down a certain
Bastion, called <hi>L'Evangile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though it is reported of <hi>La Noue,</hi> that he should bring with him to Monsieurs
Camp thirty Gentlemen, yet the Queen Mother her self at my last access, told
me, that there arrived with him but twelve, amongst the which she named none
of name unto me, but onely <hi>Rochnart.</hi> By others I learn, that <hi>La Noue</hi> escaped
very hardly out of the Town with the safety of his life. It is said, that the
King shall have 6000 Switzers, notwithstanding that it was otherwise concluded
by the Cantons in the last Diet; and therefore being contrary to their conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
it is thought there will grow some trouble among themselves. When
they come, the Kings determination is, to make a Camp volant to go from
place to place, with intent to detain all such of the Religion as are thought to
be men of Conduct.</p>
                  <p>Upon the news of <hi>Montgomeries</hi> preparations, there is order taken along the
Sea-coasts of Britain, Normandy and Picardie, to withstand his landing. They
make full account that it is not possible for him to enter the Haven of Rochel, in
respect of the passage that is quite stopped with stones and timber; howbeit,
others of judgement say, that if he bring forces enough with him to withstand
the Kings Galleys, the spring-tide will favour him all this moneth, as that the
stopping of the Haven cannot be any impeachment unto him; and that if he
once enter, Monsieur shall be driven to leavie his siege; for that I am credibly
informed, he hath not in his whole Camp above 7000 Souldiers. By the
letters of Italy, as also out of Germany, it is said, that the Duke Elector
of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> is arrived secretly at the Emperors Court; what should be the
cause of his repair thither, men do rather ghess at then know; all men conclude,
that it is for matter of great weight and importance. The Marshal <hi>Montmorency</hi>
is departed lately from the Court, some men say, neither with his own satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor yet with the Kings; others affirm the contrary. By letters sent from
Antwerp, of the twentieth of March, it is reported, that there was a sore conflict
at sea betwixt the Prince of <hi>Oranges</hi> men and the Duke of <hi>Alva's,</hi> in the which,
those for the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had the worst, and were constrained to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
within the River, to a certain place called Berge, where they are besieged
by the Prince of <hi>Orange's</hi> ships, so as it is thought they can hardly escape. In
this conflict, besides divers others, a Spaniard being General, was slain.</p>
                  <p>I am secretly given to understand, that the King here is offered by the Princes
of the League support of money, upon condition that the next year he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the League, if by his mediation the peace of the Turk and them of
the League shall not follow. And so for Italian news, referring your Honour
to these inclosed occurrents, I most humbly take my leave.</p>

the Marshal hath had in Provence, how he hath prospered at the siege
of Sansarra, and what is lately done at Rochel, who as yet continue still resolute
never to yield: Notwithstanding <hi>le Noues</hi> abandoning of them. I am very
sorry to condemn that Gentleman, though he be generally condemned by
others, until I hear what he can say for himself. If he be not well able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
this his doing in this behalf, I will learn thereby the less to build upon
any man, who I perceive when God withdraweth his staying hand are more weak
then weakness itself. This Example therefore and others, are to teach us to build
upon God, and to weigh man as he is. They are much perplexed here with the
Count <hi>Montgomeries</hi> preparation; they have therefore given order all along the
sea-coasts, to withstand his Landing, fearing that if he once land, he will draw

him to enter the Haven of Rochel, through certain ships sunk in the channel.

Majestie in France.</head>
                  <p>SIr, the best news I can send you is, that Mr. <hi>Dale</hi> your successor taketh his
journey hence on Wednesday next. I dare say you will wish him a speedy
passage. Since I wrote to you by <hi>Walter Williams,</hi> this French Ambassador
hath had new conference with her Majestie, to have procured some alteration
for his advantage, of such speeches as I delivered to him in conference of the
matters of the Duke of <hi>Alanson,</hi> whereof I wrote to you: And because he
would obtain the same, he offered his dispatch, which I thought he would have
made before me; and now you may see how late it is, for on Friday last he
was here with her Majestie, and in the end her Majestie yielded she would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
with me what might be altered upon the former answer, which he had
put in good length in writing, whereof I send you the Copy, the same being
drawn by the Ambassadour, as you may ghess, to his advantage, yet agreeable
with the substance of my speeches. Hereupon the Queens Majestie consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the writing, and finding it of some length, willed me to return it to the
Ambassadour, and to write to him, as I did, the Copy, as I first conceived it
in English; so I did send it him, and now ye may see what is passed in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
wherewith the Ambassador doth send this his servant. He did also on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
sollicite <hi>Viracques</hi> dispatch, whereunto her Majestie assented: but since that
yesterday her Majestie had Letters from Berwick, by which she understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that his coming into Scotland is so much misliked, both of the <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
Huntley,</hi> and the rest. The Regent will not license him to come in, so
as his journey shall be lost, and to tarry at Berwick were not convenient, so
I think this is not to depart so soon. The Ambassador saith, that the Duke his
Master writeth vehemently to move the Queens Majestie about ayding of the
Count <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> wherein her Majestie hath throughly answered him,
that he is departed without any her ayd, directly and indirectly; and truly
he departed with great mislking, in that all his French ships were taken as
Pyrats, the men to the number of <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">

kowledge, it is by some bargain made by Merchants of France, with the English
Merchants, for money to be given for salt, &amp;c. Hereof the Ambassador desireth

that you will inform the King, that his report may accord with the same. We

                  <p>SIr, now cometh your Successor so long desired: I doubt not, but both for
his own comfort, that he may willingly enter into that charge, which for
the Queens Majesties service, you will sufficiently instruct him how he shall
best serve, and therein so deal with him: And if in conference you find any
rawness and imperfection, you do not forbear, but like a Tutor, teach him to
inform; for so I know he shall be greatly bound to you; and so it is necessary.
Let him also understand, whom he may trust, and so to use them, that it good
will and conscience be, they take no harm; wherein I have straitly charged
him to be religious. Procure the Queen Mother to think well of him. I am
very fearful that he shall do well for many causes, but for none more then to
avoid the Queens Majesties displeasure, which I am assured of, for that I did
chuse him to relieve you. If he should not content her Majestie in this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he hath required me, that you would give leave, and perswade, that your
Secretary might continue with him a while. Now I end, because he is going.</p>

passed concerning the marriage desired by Mr. and do know the
causes of the prolongation of the conclusion thereof, not to
have proceeded of us without just grounds, there shall be less

a memorial for you of the matter in your own presence conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for answer to such things as of late hath been delivered by the French King,
to <hi>Sommers</hi> for which purpose we have made special choice of you for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <body>
                  <head>The matters propounded by the French King be these.</head>
                  <p>1 A request (upon a supposition made by the French King, that the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
was accorded) that we would assign a day within which the marriage should
be consummate; and in some speech he also named a day.</p>
                  <p>2 An offer that the marriage being promised and the day assigned, that
the King would upon knowlenge thereof, enter with us into a League offensive
and defensive, and ratifie the same; and cause it to be delivered at the instant
of the consummation of the marriage.</p>
                  <p>3 A motion that a secret agreement might be made apart betwixt the King
and us for the matters of Low-Countries.</p>
                  <p>To these three you shall shew the Duke what we have resolved for answer to
the King, whereof we have willed you to make him acquainted, and you shall
move him by such Reasons as are both true and known to your self, how loath
we are to deliver any thing to his misliking, if the necessity of the time and the
matter did not force us thereto.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to the first request of the French King, grounded upon the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
that the marriage is accorded, you shall shew him how that it is otherwise
to be understood, for that the whole Treaty indeed is suspended by an act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Commissioners, whereof you can make him a particular declaration,
and for the purpose you shall shew him the cause of our long prolongation of
the time therein limited, which also we do give you authority by word in our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Commission further to enlarge as you shall see cause.</p>
                  <p>And to the request for assignation of a day for the marriage, you shall declare,
that for divers considerations, we cannot finde it good either for Monsieur or
for our selves to assent to the marriage with him as the case standeth, whereby he
being already entred into an open war against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> should by marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
bring us &amp; our Realm also into a war, which in no respect our Realm and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:54478:187"/>
can accept with the marriage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. but the same would prove very ingrateful to
our people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ingender a misliking of us both, as you may well enlarge that
point the rather considering it is seen how hardly many have been brought to
allow of the marriage without any war.</p>
                  <p>And therefore upon this point we nevertheless thus concluded, that though
the marriage cannot be allowable with a war for those respects, yet considering
how necessary it is for the Crown of France, as well as for ours, yea, for all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,
that the King of Spains greatness should be impeached, and this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Monsieurs should be prosecuted in the Low-Countries, we shall be
content (though we do not marry) to joyn with the French King to ayd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
with a reasonable portion, so as it may not be so overtly, as thereby to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
a war upon us and our Realm, and herewith you shall set forth the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the continuance of Monsieurs actions now in hand, as if he will answer,
that he will lean to our marriage, you shall answer that there cannot be so much
profit either to himself, or to the French King and his Realm, or to us and our
Realm by the marriage, as by the continuance of this action to the abating of
the Spanish Kings greatness, which if it be not interrupted speedily, will so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
both France and England, as neither the marriage, nor any conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the forces of France and England can hereafter stay or remedy.</p>
                  <p>And if it shall be objected by Monsieur, that the offer to ayd him secretly
will serve him to no purpose, For that he knoweth that the King his brother
will either not ayd him at all, or will not ayd him otherwise then secretly, as will
not serve him to purpose, so as he must be forced to leave his enterprise, you shall
still maintain our offer to be reasonable. But if you shall finde Monsieur so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to mislike thereof, as you shall perceive him resolute to leave off the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
except we will joyn with the King in such manner of ayd as his brother
will be content, then you may after some pawsing say, that if upon conference
with the French, it shall appear that he cannot be content with our secret ayd We
would be content rather then the Dukes actions should utterly quaile to yield to
joyn with the French King by League and Contract both to ayd him, as shall be
thought reasonable betwixt the King and us. And also some other ways to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
the King of Spains greatness, but if the Duke could be contented with
our secret ayd, we think it should be no hinderance to him, and yet a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation
to us, for so we might avoid the offence of our people, and so you shall
earnestly entreat the Duke to be content therewith.</p>
                  <p>As to the other two points for making of a League offensive and defensive,
and for a secret agreement for the matters of the Low-Countries, we shall be
ready to make with the King his Brother, a League offensive and defensive,
and for the matters of the Low-Countries, we will therein do as before is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
if the secret aiding may in no sort be accepted by the French
King.</p>
                  <p>And thus leaving to your discretion how to perswade Monsieur, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s not
assenting to the marriage, proceedeth not of lack of Love or Good-will
towards him, but of meer necessity to avoid the just offence of our people, you
shall use all good perswasions to temper his misliking thereof, with the assurance
of the continuance of our love towards him in all his fortunes hereafter to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>And now when you shall return from Monsieur to the French King, you are
for answering the first point, to shew our minde thereto with the like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Reasons, as before is contained, in that you shall have said to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur,
which need not here to be repeated in writing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:54478:188"/>
And if the French King shall not allow of our foremost offer for our secret
aiding of Monsieur in his actions, but will refuse the same peremptorily, and so
procure Monsieur to leave his enterprize for lack of our further yielding, then
you shall yield to the second afore remembred, that we will rather then the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
should fail, and thereby the King of <hi>Spains</hi> greatness encrease, joyn
with the King as is remembred. But except Monsieur shall object against the
manner of our ayd in secret sort, as is before remembred, you shall not need to
yield ours to offer to Monsieur that second degree, nor make any mention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
for after that being opened, and the French King being therewith acqnainted
before your access unto him, it shall be in vain to stand with the French King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the offer of the first degree for a secret ayd; so as if you shall be urged by
Monsieurs answers to fall to the second, to yield to an open ayd, then you may
onely repeat the first to the King, and therewith to add, that if that manner of
ayd shall neither content the French King nor Monsieur, then we will assent to
joyn with the French King in such manner as shall be found reasonable for us
both, and for the cause. And so our meaning is, that you shall if you can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in this sort put of the marriage with yielding to this latter open sort of aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if the secret ayd shall not be allowed, and therewith you shall declare by this
our Answer, the other two points for a League offensive and defensive, and for
a secret accord for the Low Countries, to be in a sort answered.</p>
                  <p>But for more particular instructions of you, how to proceed in these two latter
matters, you shall have for them, both a Commission general for your self, and
our Ambassador, and <hi>Sommers</hi> to treat therupon, and with the said Commission
you shall have some other particular instructions, such as the short time may yield,
And whensoever you shall enter to treat thereon, after knowledge had from you
there shall be more particular matters called to remembrance and sent unto you.</p>
                  <p>But now if you shall after all good Reasons used to perswade the staying of
the marriage, with the offers to joyn with the French King, and both with aiding
of his Brother, and if it be moved to you, or otherwise thought reasonable to
be by you mentioned to joyn also in the ayding of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n Anthonio</hi> pretending to
be the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that notwithstanding this your proceeding, that the
King will yield to none of these but with the marriage, as hitherto by his former
Answers have appeared, he would not you should persist in setting forth the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> both presently and for time to come, as also
you shall confess the like for <hi>England,</hi> to begin timely to abate the King of <hi>Sp.</hi>
greatness, and that though there had been never marriage spoken of; yea, that
wheresoever Monsieur may marry in an other place, yet it shall prove a great
error both in the Frinch King and us, to leave the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to encrease to
such greatness, as hereafter neither the force of <hi>France,</hi> nor <hi>England,</hi> no nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that may be confederate with them, shall be able to withstand any thing that
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> shall attempt.</p>
                  <p>And if these Reasons cannot prevail, you shall leave off, declaring your great
grief that the forbearing of the marriage, grounded upon the evident mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking
of our subjects, should be the cause of the forbearing to do so great a
good to Christendom, as the conjunction of the King and us might bring,
though the matter took not place, and so you shall end and speedily advertise us
of your proceedings.</p>

                  <head>To the Rght Honourable, and my very good Lord, the Lord Treasurer.</head>
                  <p>MY very good Lord, I arrived here this Thursday morning somewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered
in body, as well for want of two nights sleep, as by reason of
our posting to Dover, this violent travail, agreeing not very well with me who
have now been used to long rest of body; and therefore I have been driven to
stay here all this day to refresh my self, whereby I might be the better able to go
forward with speed, meaning God willing, to be at Clermont, a place four Posts
distance from Paris upon Saterday, where I have appointed Sir <hi>Henry Cobham,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Sommers</hi> to meet, and to the end I may before my going to Monsieur,
receive some light and particular information from them of the present state of
things here, for the better furtherance of this service, I am driven to make more
haste in my journey, for that the term of the prolongation of the Reservation
endeth upon Thursday next. Since my coming hither, I understand that the
Ministers here were forbidden about six weeks past, the exercise of Religion, by
<hi>Crevecoeur</hi> the Gunner Master, whereupon they have dispatched one to the King
to be an humble suiter unto him in their name that they may be permitted to use
their freedom and liberty in that behalf accordingly as by his Edicts and Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
it is granted unto them, which is all the news that I can as yet write unto
your Lordship out of these parts.</p>
                  <p>After I had finished these Letters I received the inclosed from Sir <hi>Henry
Cobham</hi> by the which your Lordship may perceive that my coming putteth them
in more hope then will be answered with effects according to their expectation,
if the contents of the said Letters be true, a little egging one with a resolution
to assent to an open assistance (though it were performed with a less sum)
would set the two great ones a work, and keep them from uniting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54478:189"/>
against our Soveraign, a matter greatly or rather assuredly to be feared;
and therefore in respect of a little charges not to be stuck at; the Instructions
signed by her Majestie, do give me Authoritie (in case the King shall perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
insist upon assistance, in such sort as without the same he will refuse to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the intended action against <hi>Spain)</hi> to yield hereunto: but her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
own speech since the signing of the Instructions hath restrained me in that
behalf. I would therefore be glad to know her Majesties pleasure therein, lest
that if upon my denyal of yielding to an open assistance, there should ensue a
breach of the Treaty, the blame hereafter might be laid on me, having warrant
from her Majestie to yield therein, and so for the present having no other matter
to impart to your Lordship, I humbly take my leave,</p>

                  <p>SIR, The sending of this away by Mr. <hi>Mills</hi> to you, moveth me to accompany
him with a few lines. We here have nothing to write unto you about
the Negotiation, but doe now from this day forward look to hear from
you; whereupon I think her Majestie will have some matter to be occupied
withall. VVe hear nothing of Monsieurs proceedings; but the Spanish
Ambassador warneth that the Prince of Parma is so strong, and so bent to fight
with Monsieur, as he pretendeth that at the least Monsieur will forbear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
his own person. He did yesterday by her Majesties appointment, speak
at Leicester House with my Lord of Ley and me, to expostulate for her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
refusal to speak with him, requiring to know the cause; and being answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That we doubted not but that he oftentimes had been made privy, that it
was for that her Majestie had not received any Letters from the King Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
for her satisfaction in the case of Invasion in Holland, &amp;c. He saith, that
he never promised to procure Letters from the King, neither was he ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of her Majesties behalf; but the Speeches were alwaies delivered to him,
that her Majestie would not speak with him untill she might be satisfied of those
things in the case of Holland; but saith it was not required that he should send
to the King for any such satisfaction, and yet he did for his own part write to
the King; and upon answer from the King, he did let her Majestie understand
that the Collection of the Souldiers, the Arming and Victualing of the Ships,
and men, were wholly by the directions of the Pope, whom he could not deny;
and he had also cause to think that her Majestie meant not that he should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Letters from the King, for that Mr. <hi>Wilks</hi> said that her Majestie would
send a Gentleman to the King, or else write to him by the way of trade: And
for confirmation hereof, he said that he heard that a kinsman of the Earl of Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
and Master of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> whom we took to be <hi>Tilney,</hi> was named to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Spain. By the way he saith that you told him in presence of the Councel
at Nonsuch, that her Majestie had no League with the King of Spain, but the
States of the Low Countries; I told him I was assured he mistook you; for
you might say that the League, which was the greatest, was with the Emperor
<hi>Charls,</hi> and so with the King of Spain, in respect of the Dutchy of Burgundy
and the Low-Countries; but he flung away after his hot manner.</p>
                  <p>Now to end these matters, for the discovery of a multitude of Popish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
I think Mr. <hi>Beal</hi> writeth to you of a number of choice persons, who
being at least but fined upon that <hi>que Dam noble</hi> wil yield a great sum of money.
My Lord <hi>Grey</hi> and <hi>Tyrwick</hi> were about a Peace the 29 of July, finding my
Lord Deputies forces ready to enter one way, and Sir <hi>Nicholas Malt,</hi> by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, offering to my Lord Deputy to abide his Order for the matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Odonell</hi> and the whole Countrie he hath wasted, pretending to set upon
<hi>Odonels</hi> son, begotten of <hi>Tirleghes</hi> wives daughter, which he had by <hi>Mac Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi>
by <hi>Ashton</hi> that came from Ireland, we secretly understand that the new
Earl Arrig, with a great number, are determined to keep <hi>Darbique</hi> from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
against the Religion, and the King doth secretly assent thereto; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ashton</hi> be deceived, time will prove. The King hath sent to <hi>Seffade</hi> 200
souldiers, to enable him to compel his people to answer to Justice upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of England, and great promises are made in the Kings behalf to keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with her Majestie. And thus, almost wearied, I end, expecting shortly to

regress, or a recess. Her Majestie is in very good health, thanked be God.</p>

                  <p>IT may please your most excellent Majestie, I have imparted in my Letters
directed to my Lord Treasurer, the substance of that which passed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
both with the Duke, and certain Commissioners appointed by him
to conferr with me touching the said matters, which by your Highness order<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
I was directed to communicate unto him. The day following, at such time
as I took my leave of him, I had long conference with him, the principal
points whereof I thought meet to impart to your Majesties self. At
my access unto him, he took me aside into a place between the wall and his
bed, and caused me to sit down by him, telling me that he was not now to
confer with me as a brother of France, but as a servant to the Queen my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
with a confident servant of hers, and therefore would deal frankly
and plainly with me. And so at the first he declared unto me that he was very
sorry to understand, as well by my speeches, as by the report of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
appointed to conferr with me, that your Highness had taken so hard
a resolution in a cause he had so long pursued, and whereof he hoped present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have received the fruits of his travel; that his affection was not so light
or so loosly setled, as that he could resolve with himself to give over the matter,
so neither could he believe but that I had brought some matter of more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
unto him: Whereunto I replyed, that it was hard to give Law to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and therefore did leave it to his own best judgement, to take such
course therein as he thought meet. But as touching the having of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to deliver unto him any other matter then that I had already impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him; I did protest unto him I had not. Then he declared unto me,
that seeing I had no other Commission, he would forbear any further dealing
with me in that case; and so proceeded to let me understand how resolute I
should find the King not to assent to League without Marriage; besides, he said
he feared that this resolution of your Majesties, might make the King grow
cold in the action he had taken upon him. I thereupon shewed him, that I
hoped when the King should duely consider such reasons as I was directed to
lay before him for the necessity of the League, being, as he was, a Prince of
judgement, and assisted with no ill Councel, he would not reject so honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and profitable an offer, unless it were to gratifie him, thinking that
by standing upon the point of the marriage to be accompanied with the
League, and otherwise not to take place, he should the rather draw
your Majestie to marry, upon doubt of such perils as otherwise might
fall upon your Estate. Whereupon he protested unto me, that he had
dealt very effectually with the King sundry waies by his Ministers and
friends, to induce him to proceed to the conclusion of the League, and
could never draw him to yield thereunto; I then told him I feared I should hold
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54478:191"/>
him a very cold advocate in that cause; notwithstanding I prayed him as one
that professed to be so greatly devoted to your Majestie, to let me understand
what were the principal causes that might move the King to forbear to proceed
in the League, for that by knowledge of them aforehand, I should be
the better able to Treat with the King, he then shewed me, that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the factions of the Court, and the practises of such as were corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Spain, who did propound sundry impediments.)</p>
                  <p>There were two principal matters that were put into the Kings head, that
wrought a stay in him in that behalf: The one, the doubt he had of your
Majesties perseverance in the performing and due observation of the said
League, fearing lest when he should be imbarqued, your Majestie would
slip the Collar. The second, That some perswasions have been used
towards him, that England and the Low-Counntreys making profession
of one Religion, after that Spain and the Crown of France should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
in a Warre, would become lookers on.</p>
                  <p>To the first doubt I shewed him, that I heard his Highnesse would be
respondent for your Majestie, that you would not take so dishonorable a course,
as to abandon your associate without some special cause given. The other
I said was very weak, for that no man of discourse or judgement, could
think that England and the Low-Countreys, would minister unto France
so just an occasion of offence, whereby France and Spain growing to
some composition, might upon so just ground, take some dangerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
                  <p>He then did declare unto me, that the Court was divided into factions,
and that such as were inclined unto Spain, did seek by all means to make the
King jealous of your Majesties friendship: For removing whereof, he
said he had traveled with his friends to the uttermost of his power, but
that the nature of the King his brother was such, that what he had once
conceived, he would not easily be removed from it, and therefore was to
be left to be wrought in time, whereof he had some good experience,
touching this his enterprise upon the Low-Countries; wherein though at
some times he had found him favourable and forward enough to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
him in the action; yet soon after, through the perswasion of such
as had affected Spain, he found him altered, in so much, that what could
be drawn from him, was rather by force, then any good affection
he seemed to bear to this enterprise, which difficulties notwithstanding,
upon Declaration made by me, how evil it would come to passe for
the affairs of the Low-Countreys, if the League between your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
and his Brother should not goe forward, for that the better sort,
and such as doe affect this League, would be discouraged, and the
contrary part much enlarged He answered me, That he would doe any thing
that might be for the Queens service.</p>
                  <p>I delivered also to his Highness, the care that your Majestie hath of his
safety, and therefore that you wished that he should not goe this Voyage
in person, but commit the conduct of it to some other sufficient personage
of quality, and meet for the enterprise; and moreover, that your Majestie could
not but advise him to seek to be advised and assisted with good and sufficient
Councellers fit for the ordering of so great an enterprise. After thanks rendred
for your Majesties care of him, he said that the Noble men and Gentlemen which
were com to accompany him in this enterprise, did it rather of affection they bear
to his person, then to the cause, and therfore he could not but go in person with
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:54478:192"/>
them, especially seeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>here is no one amongst them to whom the conduct
of the action might be committed with the security of obedience due to him,
and freedom of jealousie, as in a matter of so great consequence more to be
desired. As for a sufficient Councel to be about him, it was his greatest care;
and therefore he desired your Majestie would be a means to the King his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he might have the Marshal of Cosse to attend upon him: Whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I answered, that your Majestie had been already mindfull thereof, and I would
not fail to sollicite it at mine access unto the King. <hi>Du Uray</hi> returning to me
(after the report that he and his associates appointed to confer with me, had
made to conferr with his Highness) told me, that whereas they had perswaded
him, seeing your Majesties resolution was signified, to forbear to prosecute
it any further; they found his affection so setled, that he minded not so to give
it over, and how that they perceived by him, that after he had once taken order
for the matters of Cambray, he will make a voyage over to your Majestie, to
lay down before you his own reasons himself, with this affection, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that if his reasons and perswasions shall not be found meet to take place,
he will never hate where he once loved, but will for ever imbrace the amity of
your Majestie and the Realm. Also your Majestie by these Letters written to
my Lord Treasurer, shall understand what passed this day between Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and me at the time of my audience, which I thought meet to impart unto
the Duke, who being then in bed; when I had finished with Queen Mother,
I desired that I might have the honour as to speak with him at his bed-side,
which it pleased him to assent unto; who after I had let him understand the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of that which passed between his mother and me, praying his assistance
to remove the impediments that I saw she did stand upon, which was to have
the League accompanied with the marriage, for that it greatly imported the
action he had in hand, that the League were presently proceeded in. To this
he answered, That the matter of a League partained to his brother; the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of marriage, saith he, is the only matter that concerneth me, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the small hope I put him in, yet was he resolute not to give it over:
And thereupon fell into very earnest request with me, that I would plainly let
him know whether I had not some further matter to deliver, then that I had yet
imparted unto him, touching the marriage, whereof when I assured him I had
none to impart unto him, he did then declare unto me as he did before, that I
should find the King very resolute, not to imbrace the League without the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
I did then shew him, that I hoped that if he and his mother with that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
that the cause it self did merit, did joyn together, they might so dispose
the Kings mind before hand to give better ear to the League; then his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
did put me in comfort, wherein I shewed him that I should hope he would
deal the more effectually, if he could lay aside his affection, and look into the
cause as a politique Prince ought to do, preferring the publique (especially his
honour being so farr ingaged, as it was) before his private desires; but in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
I found, now I shewed him that I greatly suspected the Kings resolution
grew through his perswasion, wherewithall he was very merry, and did let me
understand again, that it was very hard for a man upon the sudden to lay aside an
affection which he had harbored in his breast so long a season.</p>
                  <p>Touching this subject there passed many pleasant speeches from his Highness,
which he delivered with a singular grace as any person that ever I knew. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
the rather to write these particularities to your Majestie, for that by some
speech that passed from him, I perceived I should do a thing very agreeable to
him to acquaint your Majestie withall. Amidst these publique matters, I may
not forget with all humility to signifie unto your Majestie how infinitely I think

servant, which though the undeserved favours cannot increase my
wonted care, yet do they minister unto me a most singular comfort, by making
my service less burthenous through your Highness gracious acceptation of the
same. The Lord bless the rest of your Majesties years with that happiness of
Government which hitherto through Gods goodness you have enjoyed, and
confound those which wish the contrary.</p>

                  <head>To the right honorable my very good Lord, the Lord Treasurer.</head>
                  <p>MY very good Lord, It may please your Lordship to advertise her Majestie,
that on Wednesday last, being the 20 day of August, I arrived at the
Castle of Fere in Tartinois, a house of <hi>Montmorencies,</hi> about the 11 in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
somewhat sooner then the Duke looked for me, through the negligence
of the Gentleman whom he sent to visit me at Meaulx, whom I prayed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise
the said Duke that I meant to be at the place above mentioned, the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
morning I arrived there, notwithstanding I found before my coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a Lodging very well furnished, prepared for me, and order given for my
Diet, and for the placing of my horses in the stable belonging to the said Castle;
immediately upon my repair thither, the Duke sent his Chancellor <hi>Mr. le Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Reyne,</hi> and <hi>Kingsey</hi> his Secretary, to excuse the Duke that there was sent
no body to meet me. After that divers Gentlemen, as <hi>Farmangues,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of quality came by his order to visit me, so that there lacked no good will
in his Highness to make it appear that he was most ready to honour such as
should be sent unto him from her Majestie. I doe the rather dwell upon
the setting forth of the manner of the entertainment, lest perhaps some
other might advertise that, forasmuch as there was no body sent to meet
me by the way; the Ministers sent from thence be not received here
with the like regard and care as they are there; I do assure your Lordship, that
no man could have more care to excuse the omitting of the ceremony, in that
there was none sent me by the way, then the Duke had: Besides, in this time
his Highness is to be excused for omitting of ceremonies, being overcharged
with affairs, having especially to direct an Army compounded of voluntaries;
about three of the clock the same afternoon, I had access unto him, and after I
had acquainted him with the points propounded by the King to her Majesties
Ambassador, and Mr. <hi>Sommers,</hi> before I did let him understand what answer was
made by her Majestie to the same, he shewed me that the King his brother was
most resolute not to proceed in the amity untill it might appear what might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the marriage; and therefore he advised me to think how I might be
able to satisfie him therein, for that otherwise he saw no likelihood that the
other two points touching the League and the secret Treaty should take any
effect: Wherein I replyed, that I doubted not but that the King his brother
being a Prince of wisdom and judgement, would be satisfied with reason, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I prayed his assistance, though for some respects I thought him a very unfit
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:54478:193"/>
advocate to plead in that cause, and thereupon declared unto him the causes
that made her Majestie to forbear to assent to the marriage: Whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That he hoped that his constant pursuit of the marriage so long a season,
omitting no means that in his judgement might seem meet to advance the same
(wherein he did appeal to the world his proceedings therein, being publiquely
known) should not take so evil effect as now, when he most assuredly looked
to reap the fruits of his travel, he should receive repulse to his own great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
but more to his grief.</p>
                  <p>And whereas her Majestie alleadged the War he was entred into for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the poor afflicted in Flanders, as a matter of very evil satisfaction to her
Subjects, he said it was no new matter, but such as before had been propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as he was before informed by her Majesties Commissioners at the time of the
Treaty: And for that at that time it did breed no breach or stay of the Treaty,
but that the same went forward, he hoped that would not now be alleadged
for an impediment.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, He said that the pursuit of those Wars, considering how evil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
the King of Spain was towards her, and the necessity that the poor affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the Low-Countries had of present relief, in whose fortune her Majestie
was interessed; it seemed strange unto him, that a thing so beneficial to her
Majestie, should be a hinderance to the marriage.</p>
                  <p>Thereto I replyed, That I thought it very necessary, before I answered the
said points, to assure him that the allegation of the said impediment grew not
for want of good will in her Majestie. For when she did with the eye and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of her natural body, look into his constant love born towards her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with many apparent effects, that did shew that it was not feigned,
as the hazard he came in, passing the Seas, the imployment of sundry messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
especially men of that quality, as lately were sent over, and the goodness
of his own nature, whereof her Majestie at his last being with her, grew to
have so great a liking, as she rested greatly afflicted and perplexed in mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that in respect of those impediments that concerned her pollitique body
(which did so greatly import her, as the alienation of her Subjects good wils
from her, in case her Majestie should be accompanied with a War) she could not
proceed as she did desire.</p>
                  <p>Touching the two points, for the first, I shewed him, that though at the time
of the Treaty, mention was made how ingratefull it would be to her Subjects,
to have her marriage accompanied with a War, yet was it never otherwise
conceived, neither by her Majestie, nor by the Councel, but that the charges
of the War should be born by the King himself, and by the States of the Low-Countries,
considering her Majestie was to reap no benefit by any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
as should be made, otherwise then such as did depend upon the issue of her
body, which being a thing that was to grow from above, was doubtfull, and
ministred no matter of present benefit in requital of the present charges: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
it would seem strange that the first day of her marriage, the Treaty should
be violated by the uniting of her Highness fortune with a husband, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the said Treaty, should throw her into a War which might minister fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause of miscontentment, and breed an unnecessary and dangerous jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
by carrying them into some doubt, that as the Treaty was broken in one
point, so there would ensue some further breach thereof, a matter of very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
consequence, considering that in the due observation thereof, consisted
the preservation of their Liberties.</p>
                  <p>Touching the second, I shewed him, that if the League offensive and defensive
might take place, and the secret Treaty, that this enterprise for the relief might
<pb facs="tcp:54478:193"/>
very effectually go forward without the marriage: And therefore her Majestie
did greatly marvel to see the King so resolute, as that without her marriage he
would have no League, when it is apparent to the world, whatsoever become
of the marriage, that it were most necessary that such a League should be
made, as well for common defence, as for the preventing and staying of the
over-greatness of Spain.</p>
                  <p>In the end, after much debating to and fro, he shewed me that he
was greatly grieved, considering the assured hope he had put on, that
the marriage being a thing that he desired above any thing in the world;
even now when he looked it should come to a full conclusion after so
long a pursuit, so many messengers being employed, a Treaty through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concluded by persons of quality, it should now grow from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
to a kind of dissolution, that he hoped I was come hither with
matter of more comfort then he should receive thereby.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon I prayed his Highness to look well into the cause, wherein
if he could lay his own affection aside, I doubted not but he should
very apparently see that her Majestie esteemed nothing more then
the good will and love of her Subjects (the true strength and
glory of a Prince) had great reason to resolve as she did, considering that
the chief end of her marriage (which was to content her people) should be
now performed with a farr contrary effect, which could be no less grievous to
his Highness, if the marriage should proceed, having protested alwaies, as
he hath done, that unless it might be with her Majesties contentment, and
the good liking of her people, he would never desire it; and so concluded
with him, that I hoped after he had well digested the matter, he should then
see that her Majestie had just cause to grow to that conclusion which I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
unto him, and he no less cause to content himself withall: I prayed
him that at my next access unto him, for that the place was so furnished with
Gentlemen, and not that silence used that was fit, I might have audience in
some private place, for that many times we could hardly, one hear the other,
in respect of the noise.</p>
                  <p>About half an hour after my departure from him, he sent his Chancellor
the President <hi>Mr. de Preureaulx,</hi> and <hi>Combelles</hi> unto me, who did let me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
they were sent by his Highness to me, to confer with me about that
which I propounded unto him in her Majesties name, letting me know from
him, that the Duke found it very strange, that afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the matter of marriage had
been drawn unto so great length, even now when he did look for an execution
of that which was accorded by Treaty, there should be an impediment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
first by Mr. <hi>Sommers,</hi> and now by me, not new, but such as before the
time of the Treaty, was thought upon, besides that her Majestie was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
how Monsieur had long before intreated the cause of the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
having from time to time made her privy to his proceedings therein,
whereof she never made shew to have any misliking, especially as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tending to the hinderance of the marriage.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon I did at length let him understand the causes why the same
marriage hath depended so long in Treaty, the manner and course of proceeding
with the Commissioners at the time of their being there, and how her Majestie
seeing her marriage subject to so great difficulties, and thereby doubting great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what issue the same would take, could hardly have been induced to have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the coming of the Commissioners, but upon hope that if such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
as were by her to be propounded, accompanied with her
Marriage could not be salved, the said Commissioners might then have
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:54478:194"/>
proceeded to the Treaty of a more streight League, that thereby their travels
might not be fruitless. And in this behalf I did let them understand that her
Majestie found her self grieved, that the Commissioners had not authority to
treat of the League without marriage, especially that considering that not past
four or five months before their coming over, there was some overture made
by certain Commissioners deputed by the King to treat with her Majesties Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
resident, which she did look should have been prosecuted at the time
of the repair of the said Commissioners, and lest the same should have been
forgotten, or neglected, she did send one especially to the Ambassador resident,
to require him in her Majesties name to advertise the King, how that in respect
of the doubt she had what issue the Treaty of marriage might take, she found
it necessary that they should have authority to treat of the said League, which
falling out contrary to her expectation, made her proceed, for the desire she
had to send the said Commissioners away contented, to the conclusion of the
Treaty, lest otherwise they might have seemed to come hither in vain. And
so much before the signing of the said Treaty, she did declare unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
so that thereby they might well perceive that this Treaty (besides
the reservation) did not proceed in so clear a course, as they perhaps had been
informed. And as for their objection, that her Majestie was acquainted with
the action of that War, before that Monsieur did embrace that enterprise; I
shewed them, that though she was acquainted with the enterprise, yet did she
not think that ever she should have been urged (as lately she was) to be a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of the charges of those Wars, which could not but breed a discontentment
in her Subjects, who looked not into the pollitique cause that might move
both Princes to concur in seeking to abate the King of Spains greatness, but
would ascribe the cause to the marriage, which being accompanied with other
discontentments, was not to be made more grievous by the charges
that the Warrs of the Low-Countries (the marriage proceeding) was
like to throw upon her Majestie. After this reply, they proceeded further,
and did let me understand, that whereas the hope of this marriage hath drawn
the King to yield further in the allowing of this said enterprise, then otherwise
he would; So the Duke feared that the said King, upon knowledge of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
resolution in the case of marriage, would grow cold therein: Besides, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
others that were ready to assist him sundry waies, especially with Treasure,
encouraged thereto by an assured hope of the marriage, they feared that now
they would upon doubt thereof, draw backwards, whereby they did see the said
Dukes cause very greatly perplexed upon this her Majesties resolution; and as
for the offer of the League, seeing the King (as far as hitherto can be gathered)
resolute not to proceed therein without marriage, they saw no great cause of
hope to be relieved that way, and so concluded, that besides the hinderance that
the said enterprise should receive by this her Majesties resolution, they did not
see how their Monsieurs honour and her Majesties could be salved, without great
touch to them both, the cause being so far proceeded in, as it was, all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in expectation, that either the same should have taken place, or else break
off upon some substantial matter, as might have yielded satisfaction to the world,
whereby both their honours might have been free from such slanders as are like
to be thrown abroad throughout all Europe.</p>
                  <p>In answer of these points I let them understand for the first, That touching
the Kings growing cold in the cause, I could not conceive how he, being a Prince
of judgement, and assisted with wise Councel, seeing how perillous the King of
Spains greatness would be to the Crown of France, could wax cold, in a cause
that so greatly touched him, seeing the remedy offered, might be performed as
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54478:194"/>
as well without marriage, as by marriage. And to inforce this matter, I did
lay before them divers reasons to shew the perils might ensue, both to the
Crown of France and England, if the said League should not take place;
and also some other thing put privately in execution for the preventing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and therefore did let them understand that there was not so little an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to be made of her Majesties motion touching the League, as by them it
seemed there was; for that heretofore upon like occasion, the Crown of
France hath desired the association of the Crown of England; and therefore
it would be thought strange, the same being now offered, it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
when never the like cause was offered to move them to embrace the same.
And as touching other mens withdrawing of their promised assistance, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of Treasure, I did let them understand, that as her Majestie by her Letters
had offered to the said Duke, to assist him, as I supposed they were made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
withall, with such means as were agreeable to her estate, so should
he find her ready to perform the same; and as for the doubt conceived, that
after so far proceeding, there could be no satisfaction yielded to the world, I
did let them understand, that though they did not think the impediments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
by her Majestie, to be of sufficient force to yield satisfaction; yet I
doubted not but that all wise men that do without passion, consider how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it is for all Princes to tender the conservation of their Subjects good
wils towards them, seeing that by proceeding in this matter, the same should
be put in hazard, for such causes as I had declared, both to the Duke and them,
would upon understanding of the said causes, rest satisfied; and so in the end
concluded with them, after well near three hours conference, that we were not
now to look backward, and to call in question such errors as perhaps had been
committed in the prosecuting of the cause, but to think of some such necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way to be taken, as may best serve to further the Dukes honourable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
and to knit the two Crowns in perfect amity. The day following I had
a second audience, the substance whereof I have thought meet to impart unto
her Majestie, with such Letters as I do presently send unto her, for that I know
her Majestie doth look that I should reserve something to be imparted to her
self. The Vice-Count of Turayne, a Gentleman very dear unto Monsieur for
many respects, and one whose advice he doth use in matters of great trust, did
let me understand the morning I departed, that now the matter of marriage
seemed to stand in doubtfull tearms; they are in very great doubt this War which
Monsieur doth now embrace, is in danger to quail, for two reasons; The one
for that the King, by whom the action is to be countenanced, if any good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
be to be looked for in that, doubting lest her Majestie will draw her neck
out of the Collar, after that he hath once broken with the King of Spain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he is very jealous, will undoubtedly leave Monsieur in the Briers, when he
shall see so little hope in the marriage, which he only reputeth as the surest bond,
for the inviolable observation of the intended association against the King of
Spain. The other, for that divers who now offer to assist Monsieur, both with
money, and otherwise, for the advancement of this enterprise, in hope that the
marriage should have taken place, whereby he shall be able to satisfie them
hereafter, seeing his principal support likely to fail him, by these means will also
withdraw their helping hands from him, and then he shall be constrained with
dishonour, and loss of his reputation, to relinquish the action. He did then let
me understand, that hitherto he had received no help nor assistance from the
King his brother, as by Sir <hi>Henry Cobham</hi> was advertised, and that his only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
was procured to him by the Queen his mother, but the same so small, as
it was not of any moment to the purpose of that he wanteth. And therefore
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:54478:195"/>
he prayed me to consider of the matter, as of a thing of great weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
and herein the Queen my Mistress (saith he) was her self not a little
interessed, being likely, that if the Duke shall abandon the enterprise of the
King of Spain, her professed enemy, having none to oppose themselves against
him, he is likely, by mans judgement, very shortly to become an absolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
which, of what consequence it was likely to fall out for her Majestie, all
men of judgement were able to look into, besides the danger of some enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
likely to be set abroach for the revenging of civil troubles within this
Realm, if the action go not forward, which will fall out very ill for those of
the Religion, being at this present reduced to a very weak estate, by reason of
their late rendring of their Towns of assurances. All which inconveniences
were likely to ensue, without some present support from her Majestie, which
he thought might be performed with the loan of 100000 Duckets, wherewith
Monsieur should be able not only to relieve the Town of Cambray, but also to
keep the field three months together; and yet notwithstanding his great want,
and the weight and importance of the cause, cannot he be perswaded himself to
become a suitor to her Majestie for such a supply, for that being fully perswaded
to prosecute constantly the matter of the match, he thinketh this request would
hinder his purpose therein, fearing lest he should therein give her Majestie occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to think that he sought the match to another end, then by him was meant.
These speeches the Vice-Count delivered unto me, as if himself without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
(as he said) from Monsieur (though for my part I did not think but that
it was done with his privity) requesting me very earnestly, I would effectually
recommend the motion of the supplying of Monsieur with the said sum, for the
setting forward of his enterprise, wherein he said the cause required present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
lest for lack of support, the enterprise should be given over; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
desired to know in what time that I hoped to have answer; I shewed him
within ten daies, he did assure me that the Duke would accept in better part the
loan of 100000 Duckets now, then if her Majestie should freely give him a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
at another time, so earnestly doth he embrace this enterprise of the Low-Countries;
and therefore said he, to have his necessity relieved at this present,
through her Majesties goodness, should bind the young Prince to remain conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
at her devotion, and to do her alwaies what service he might. This in
substance was the speech the Vice-Count delivered me, he seemed to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perplexed that the enterprise should stand upon so doubtfull terms, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what did depend thereon. The Chancellor and the rest of his Councel did
very much doubt the issue of the matter, for lack of support, being otherwise
furnished with such forces, as they doubt not shall be able to over-match the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
so that by paying of them, they might be kept under discipline, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the army being compounded of voluntaries, they fear, will be subject to
infinite and most dangerous disorders, her Majestie, I doubt not, considering how
greatly the yielding of support, importeth her, will take some such like resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
therein, as the weight of the cause meriteth. Besides, if it so touch not her
Majestie in surety as it doth, yet the Duke well deserving of her Highness
(which is as great as ever any Prince did shew by effect) require some Princely
consideration of this present necessity, especially her Majestie having by her late
Letters, put him in comfort thereof, when any just occasion should be offered
wherein to employ her, as well for the satisfaction of the Vice-Count, as that
the cause it self requireth it. I pray your Lordship that I may receive speedy
resolution herein. Having thus far proceeded in this Letter, being departed
to a place called Carlay, about ten Leagues distant from Fere, I received the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed
from Queen Mother, by the which, as your Lordship may perceive, she
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:54478:195"/>

                     </gap> the King and her, to believe that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
proceeding, the same should be sincerely observed on her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>, unless

                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> contrary. For the
first, I shewed her that the King of Spain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> long after that her Majestie did
enter into the possession of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, being solicited in a kind of sort by her
Majesties Ambassador sent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the House of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, and the Crown of England, he could
not be drawn to assen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thereto, since which time, as he was unwilling
to renew the said Treaties; so hath he not slackened to yeeld
such fruites of enmitie against her Majestie, as were publiquely
known to the world, as might appear by his Ministers dealing in furthering of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:54478:196"/>
the marriage between the Duke of Norfolk, and the Queen of Scots, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
of the Rebellion in the North, his nourishing since that time, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of those that were then the principal Rebels being retired out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.
And lastly, the attempt of Ireland, coloured with the Visor of the Popes
Authority. These things being then considered, I did leave it unto her Majestie
to judge what cause the Queen my Mistriss had to seek to reconcile her self, or
to trust Spain. Touching the reasons that might induce them to think her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
would inviolably observe the intended league. First she was to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that the Amitie that we made most account of, was that which this Crown
had with the house of Burgundy, and not with Spain; and therefore, those
Countries being alienated from Spain, and now reduced by a composition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Duke and the States of that Country, under the Government of her
son, and traffique being there established, whereby there remaineth there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
Goods appertaining to her Majesties subjects to the value neer of half a
Million, I did leave that unto her Majestie to judge whether it were not a good
caution for the performance of that which should be promised on her Majesties
behalf. Secondarily, If that would not serve to remove the diffidence, then
might there be Hostages, given interchangeably on both parties, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
her Majestie would not violate for the greatest kingdom in Europe: Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I shewed her that I doubted not but that the Duke her son would become
cautionary for the due observation of the same. I prayed her then, as I had laid
before her such reasons as might induce them to stand more assured of the
Queen my Mistresses performance of the said League, then it seemed they
were, so I might (without offence) put the Queen my Mistress to stand in
doubt of them: First, It was known that divers great personages of this Realm
were more affected to the Amity of Spain then England, whom the world
thought would omit no means that they might put in execution, to dissolve
(or rather to hinder) before the Conclusion of the said Association. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Spain challengeth as of right (in respect of assistance given in the time of
the Civil war, when the Count of Aremberg was sent into this Realm to that
purpose) to have the Amitie of that Crown preferred before England. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
The consent in Religion between Spain and France (which shall not lack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perswations that the Pope and other Catholike Princes can use to dissolve
or hinder the intended Amitie) may give just cause to the Queen to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the performance on their behalfs of the said Association, then any reason
that may be alleadged on the other side, Concerning the Queen my Mistris, I
prayed her (that if the King and she did finde it necessary to abridge the King
of Spains greatness, and could confidently enter into the intended Association)
to consider that there were two occasions privately offered, that required speedy
resolution. The one the assisting of <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> the other the prosecuting
of the enterprise in Flanders; for the first, I shewed her that the Queen my
Mistriss had assented to the preparing of certain ships, with condition that the
King her son would concur in the action, or that she might be assured by the
intended League to be assisted in case Spain, in respect of the said support,
should attempt any thing against her; Now forasmuch as the King and she
seem to be resolute, not to enter into the League without marriage, I saw ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently,
that the enterprise (which was privately to be put in execution, or
else would privately serve to no purpose.) would be quite overthrown. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the enterprise of Flanders (so honorably attempted by the Duke her son,
tending so greatly to the benefit of this Crown, when the States shall see the
said League not to take place, whereby it was not likely to be accompanied with
success that otherwise it might be, the League going forword, it would be no less
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:54478:196"/>
discontentment to them, then encouragement to their enemies. Besides, I did
let her understand that it behoved the Queen my Mistriss (if they did not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the League but upon such condition as she could not in reason agree unto,
to take some other way for the establishing of her own estate, not doubting but
that she would be as well able to withstand the malice of Spain as any other of
her neighbours. To this after she had declared how earnestly the King her son
did affect the marriage, considering he had no issue himself, and had but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brother, upon whom and such issue as he should have, depended the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the house of Valois, she prayed me to consider whether the King had
not just cause to insist upon the said marriage, and as for the League, she said she
had no Commission to wade therein, but a matter that depended onely on the
King; and therefore, because it required (for the reasons by me alleadged) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
she advised me to make haste towards him, I then prayed her, that for
as much as I did understand, she did not mean to be at Paris in five or six days,
she would dispose his minde by Letters, to imbrace the same; which she
promised to perform accordingly. Touching the Companies that are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Duke, I can as yet deliver your Lordship no more, but this in generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
That he is to have six thousand footmen, and two thousand six hundred
Lances, which as the report goeth, are sufficiently appointed, and in such good
order as the like have not been seen this many yeers in France; Their meaning
is to joyn with the States Forces that are now in Flanders, doubting nothing
more then that the enemy will not encounter with them, but withdraw himself
into his holds, I am promised a particular of all the Forces, as soon as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to my hands; I will with the next dispatch send it to your Lordship.</p>

                  <p>SIr, your servant <hi>Bonham</hi> this bearer came hither yesterday, being Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the ninth of this month about of the clock, at which time I was on
the North side of the water, to have gone to Theobalds, but by good fortune, I
had word of his arrival, so as I returned, being not gon from the water-side, her
Majestie had two or three days before spoken of you, marvelling that she could
not hear from you, I answered always, (as now it proved true) that the Letters
or bearer should bring with them reasonable satisfaction; For I knew certainly,
that you would be careful to delay no time of sending, I delivered to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
your Letters directed to her, shewing her also that I had others directed to
my self, but she said she would first read her own, first Monsieurs Letter, and
next yours, &amp; so she having done, asked me what you had written to me, for said
she, I finde nothing in mine concerning the matters for which he went, then I
told her I would read yours to her, But she using breath in speech, said she would
have me make report thereof, which I said I could hardly do, because you had
written at such length what had passed in Colloquie, first betwixt Monsieur
and you; secondly, between certain of his Councel and you at several
times: Lastly, between the Queen mother and you, and so in the end she
was content to hear the whole Negociation, adding her self, that by
your Letters to her, you had spoken to Monsieur, being in his bed after his
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:54478:197"/>
Mothers coming thither. She added also, that she perceived that Monsieur
would come hither and receive his answer himself after his journey of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray.</hi>
Concerning the Negotiation, she saith, she would not have had you to
have made direct mention of the league, but that incidently it should have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
out upon their objection, that if her Majestie would not consent to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with the war, that then the war should cease. Then thereupon, she
saith, you might have thereto answered, that in respect of the King of Spains
greatness in growing, it were good that there were such a league made betwixt
the French King and her. To this I answered, that your ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r in proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was warranted to you, both by your instructions; and also, the same
grounded upon the order of the French Kings answer to her Ambassador,
which was in three points. The first, to know the day of her marriage, which
being agreed unto, they would enter into a league offensive and defensive.
And lastly, to a secret Treaty for the matters of the Low-Countrey. For
orderly answer whereunto, you were instructed to that which you did; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I think she was satisfied at your well-doing: But I found her touched
with some fear, that this league and secret treaty should be very chargeable
unto her. I told her, that there would be no great matter managed that
was free from charge; and if she had no need of assistance to withstand her
perils (which she knew, and so doth all the world besides, see it manifestly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise)
she needed not to have sent you at this time. Then also she spake of her
ayd to Don <hi>Anthonio,</hi> doubting how to use the matter, both because the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the year passeth away, and that she could not be assured what course the
French King would take therein, without whose entring into the action, she
would be loath to adventure any thing; and yet she added, that the French
Ambassadour told her two days since, that the King his Master had willed him
to thank her Majestie for the favours and supports that she gave to Don <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio;</hi>
but in the end, for the matter, she would stay until she should hear
from you, what the French King will do therein. For the greatest important
matter in the Letter expressed by the Viscount of <hi>Turayne,</hi> I dealt with her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
earnestly therein; and having made my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> first acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with your Letters, next my L. Chamberlain, and then Mr. Vice-Chamberlain,
I required the assistance of the said two letters, as a matter most necessary for
the French cause in hand, as that which being neglected, neither a league offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
nor yet hereafter any secret treaties could remedy. Whereunto she told
me (as my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> said, she told him the like) that you had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to satisfie Monsieurs need therein; but presently, upon seeking to
perswade her, that words were no satisfaction, but that deeds must do it, and
such a thing could not be perfected with words nor thoughts, no, nor in short
time; she answered me, that you had warrant from her to yield to that which
was required, when you had found the Kings disposition desperate to help his
brother: For, quoth her Majestie, if he should any way open my good will
herein to Monsieur, afore the French Kings mind were fully known, then the
whole burthen should fall upon me; as for more proof, saith she, you may see
by the speeches of Monsieurs Councellours, alledging, that Monsieur had mony
lent him by divers, upon hope of the marriage, as though the marriage should
serve for all this charge; and thereto her Majestie, with some sharpness of speech,
added, that she knew and saw it now true, that the Queen Mother in counsel
had before pronounced, that if the marriage could be concluded, the Queen of
<hi>England</hi> should be put to the whole charges. This is the substance of that I
can wring from her; for that she saith, until she hear from you of your Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>she hath nothing here to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of. But she wished me to write to you
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:54478:197"/>
as before is mentioned; and she meaneth also to write some letters to Monsieur
to give him some comfort, as I think, <hi>Marchemont</hi> had Letters, and (as I hear
by report) the contents are a report of your dealings, and of Monsieurs resolute
answers to you, that the King his brother (would in no sort consent to any thing
without the marriage) and so they stand like good Chapmen, without falling
in their bargain from the principal; but by this time you can best judge what
will follow. The Queens Majestie asked me, whether if in no letter from you
to me, you had recommended Monsieurs wisdom. I said, by no express speech.
I marvel thereof (quoth she) for to me in this letter he doth greatly commend
him, and so did by reading pronounce very great commendation of him by you,
but I saw not the words written, I answered, that always you, above any other
of her servants, had ever commended him most. I pray you remember to send

all sorts, and what his monethly pay may be in charge, and how he hath been
furnished of money towards this leavy. I am sorry to see so large a time spent
from the beginning of his preparations until this time, and yet I think far off to
put in execution that which he pretendeth: I fear the Queen Mother finding
the marriage desperate, will practice with the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to withdraw his
siege, and that the Town may be relieved, and so Monsieurs Honour saved;
and thereupon Monsieur may leave his general enterprize, wherewith the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
ought to be contented; For thereby shall they have their wills in the Low-Countreys;
and so also the Queen Mother may save her son free from gun-shot,
and put up all her pretences, and live without offence to the King of Spain. Thus
much of the French matters. From <hi>Ireland,</hi> I
have not heard but once since you went,<note place="margin">My Lord of <hi>Kildares</hi> man in the Tower, hath, by some fear of the Rack, confessed all to be true wherewith he was charged, which is to be kept awhile secret, until some persons may be apprehended.</note> which was by

the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> sent Justice <hi>Dowdal</hi> to him, to treat hereupon, but more I

not advertising how great prizes he hath done. In Scotland, the King pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

guided by her Majestie, whereof she conceiveth hope. I pray God she be not

to the assistance with France, and yet her Maj. uttereth not to me these Scotish

Walsingham.</head>
                  <p>SIr, after I had yesternight, being Thursday, written and sealed up my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
I understand lately, that <gap reason="symbol" extent="12 letters">
                        <desc>〈12 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap> hath informed her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
that Monsieur found himself greatly discontented with the manner of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with him, in making the marriage so desperate, as it seemed to him you came
of purpose to break it; and onely to sollicit the league with the K. upon which
matter this forenoon her Majestie told me, that she misliketh of your manner
of proceedings, as though you did not express the causes why she could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to no marriage, but abruptly shewed that she would not marry, and so forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to deal with Monsieur for a league. To this I made answer, Madam, it is
to be seen in Mr. Secretaries Letters to me, which I read to you, that he did so
proceed to open your mind for forbearing to marry, as your self did determine
with us all, and as he is warranted by your instructions; for, Madam, he did not
say, that you would not marry with him, but that as the case standeth, he being
entred into a war, you found it not good either for him or your self, to assent to
the marriage; for so by your marriage, your Realm joyntly with your marriage
should enter into a war; so as your speeches according to your instructions, were
not absolute to deny the marriage, but to shew that the marriage could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
her subjects with a war joyned therewith; and so using as many reasons as I
could, <hi>I</hi> ended, that I could not see that you had done any thing, but that I my
self in your place would have done the same. And I did put her Majestie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
that all her resolutions (with us of her Councel) was, that you should
so deal, as to acquit her of the marriage; and if there might be, a good amity
made, and by a league betwixt France and this Realm, to abate the King of
Spains greatness (vvhich I did object, required a present action) and to that end
you should so proceed, as there might appear no hope of marriage: For as long
as France could perceive any hope thereof, they would not assent to any league.
To this her Majestie could not but assent; but finally, she changed her opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in saying, that if she should make a league, whereby a war might follow, she
said, she had rather be at the charges of a war with the marriage, then without
a marriage. But, saith she, let <hi>Walsingham</hi> know my minde to be this, that I
would gladly enter into a league with the French King, onely with these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
that if I were invaded, he should help me, and if he were inwaded, I
would help him, and so to abate the King of <hi>Spains</hi> greatness. She said, she
would concur with the French King to do that, by aiding of Monsieur; and
also the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> underhand. Against which I objected, that although
she might in some sort aid them both underhand, yet surely the French King
could not aid his brother underhand. Whereupon she concluded, that if by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
she must enter into an open war, she would rather choose to be at charge
with a marriage, then without it. Finally, she said, she would write a few words
to you her self; which I prayed her might not be discomfortable; and so she said,
it should not be: But howsoever it be, use and practice your wisdom as long as
you mean to do well, not to be your hurt. I have made my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi>
acquainted herewith, to whom, at the time of my writing, her Majestie had not
imparted thus much; but when she shall, I think he will friendly answer for
you, and so he hath promised me to do. Since the sealing up of my two letters,
her Majestie sent me word by Mr. <hi>Killegrew,</hi> that concerning the motion made
by Viscount <hi>Turayne,</hi> you should let Monsieur understand her Majesties intention
therein according, that she did signifie to you her mind, without that you should
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:54478:198"/>
that you should name any sum in certainty, since the writing hereof she hath
willed me that you should not offer that part above mentioned (for entring
into an open war until she should hear from you first for she desireth most
of all to have a League defensive and offensive without war (but upon first
cause by the king of Spain) and to joyn in ayd secretly underhand. To
the which if they will not assent without open ayding; then you shall
so advertise, for as her minde now seemeth to be, she will rather marry with
the war, then have the war without the marriage; Even now at the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up of this Letter, her Majestie sent me this little Letter to you, and so I
have directed it, wishing you not to be troubled therewith,</p>

                  <p>OUr very good Lord, may it please your Lordship to let her Majestie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that upon Thursday the eleventh of this month in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
at the time of our access unto the King, I the Secretary declared unto
him her Majesties Answer to the three points, according to mine Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with reasons and perswasions to make him like thereof; after the King
had heard them very attentively, he answered to the first, That he was sorry
to hear the Answer so far from his expectation, for that he trusted to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfyed therein to his contentment, as a thing he desired most in the
world; and (for the singular affection he beareth to his brother) he rejoyced
in it as much as in any good thing that might happen to himself, and
thought his brother to be the happiest of all other, to match with a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of that Virtue; and that he himself having no children (and yet God
might send him some) esteemed of his brother, as of his son and his heir;
and that with his brother her Highness should marry himself, and all his
means, wishing her Majestie would believe with what affection he imbraced
that marriage; but that seeing her Majestie findeth now that difficultie,
and amongst other the misliking of her Subjects to this marriage, he took it
to be one of the <hi>Malheurs</hi> that happened to him; and that he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the grief he hath carried ever since he hath heard of this alteration, by
the Queen his mother, and that if his soul might be seen, his grief should
well apear therein. But yet laid, that he trusted her Majestie would give
him and his brother more comfort then this; and that her Highness would
procure the good liking of her people therein, praying us all very earnestly
to be a means, and to do good offices to her Majestie in that behalf. Many
other speeches he uttered of great affection in this point, to have the marriage
go forward: as to the other two points, for a League offensive and defensive, and
for a private Treatie for the matters of the Low-Countries, he said, that though
there were good Amitie and Intelligence already between her Majestie and
him, yet he was most desirous to enter into a streighter Amitie with her
Highness, for the better assurance of his good will towards her, and that he
would in both these matters confer with the Queen his mother, and then
would appoint some to come to us, to let us understand his further determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therein; adding again his former desire, that the first matter so well
begun might not be thus ended; for he had a special confidence in her
Majestie, that she will not suffer it so to do, and then prayed us all again
particularly as he had done before: thereto I the Secretary said, that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
should be speedily advertised of this his Answer and request, praying his
Majestie, that because these other things required speedy resolution, and among
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:54478:199"/>
other the case of <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> it would please him to deliver his pleasure so
soon as might be, whereunto he consented. Then we went to the Queen his
mother, being in her Chamber, where I the Secretary remembring unto her
what had passed between her and me before, and how I had at this time
proceeded with the King, and what answer his Majestie had made, I prayed her
to procure the Kings resolution therein with speed, which she promised she
would do; this was the effect of our Negotiation at this time; whereof we
have thought meet to advertise her Majestie in the mean time; until we may
further understand of the Kings Deputies, how other things will be answered
and offered to be treated upon. And so we take our leave of your Lordship,</p>

dated the tenth from you; the ordinary Ambassador, and Master <hi>Sommers;</hi>
containing your Negotiation with the French King, and your private Letter
dated the eleventh, with another of your own to her Majestie, and one from
<hi>Pinart</hi> as her Majestie informed me; by the Treaty with the King, it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the King refuseth not to have a Treaty of streighter Amity, and yet
he carpeth upon the marriage; by your Letter to her Majestie, as she tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
me, you think there may be a Treaty without the marriage, but
not without charge. And therein her Majestie saith, she had as good be as
charge with a marriage, as without; and therefore, she hath again
willed me to write unto you, That if Monsieurs action may be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards the Low-Countries, she can be content to be at some reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
charge by Contribution with the French King to maintain the same,
so it be underhand, to bring her into no war, otherwise she will not you
shall consent without making her privy, and having her answer, and for a
Treaty offensive and defensive; she can also be content therewith, but
not thereby directly to enter into a war; in this sort she hath willed me
expresly to write unto you, not allowing any Argument to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whereof I made divers; and those apparant necessary: for by these
means the King of Spains greatness shall grow to such ripeness as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
no open force shall withstand it. And it is not likely that the French
King will aide his brother which he cannot to any purpose do secretly,
where her Majestie will do it but underhand; For the matter mentioned
by the Viscount <hi>Turraign,</hi> both my Lord of Leicester and I have deal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:54478:200"/>
very earnestly with her, and she hath answered my Lord of Leicester that
she hath given a full order to you for the same, but by me she answereth
that you know her meaning to be, that if the French King shall not ayd
his Brother, she will not see him abandoned; But I desired to know how
she would ayd him; and the Viscounts motion importeth both necessity and
speed to be relieved, she answereth, that until she may hear from you, what
the French King will do for his brother, she will answer no more particularly.
This evening she willed me to advertise you that she is in great doubt that the
Queen mother will induce Monsieur to leave the enterprise of <hi>Cambray,</hi> with
an intention to compass the marriage, and then she saith, if the marriage shall
not follow, Monsieur shall be dishonored, and the King of Spain shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper;
hereof she commanded me to write to you, that you should have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
good regard. In this sort I am commanded to write unto you, but in
what sort you shall deal to remedy this inconvenience, neither by her Majestie
can I direct you, nor of my self can I inform you; but I know you will do
your best, as the place and time shall serve, and more cannot be required.
Her Majestie would have Master <hi>Sommers</hi> to return, and so she willed me to
signifie her pleasure; and yet I told her that he was in Commission, and might
hardly be spared: but yet she commanded me so to write; if his being there
cannot be spared, you may do well to write so, otherwise I do leave the matter
to your consideration, I know it will greatly grieve you, not to have a good
Answer to the matter for the Loan moved by the Viscount, but surely all
means are used here to help, but none prevail as yet. The Letter written
from Master <hi>Cobham</hi> the ninth of August, consisted on two points, very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
the first shewed the French Kings allowance to have <hi>Don Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
case furthered here; as also it was there. The second contained matter
of great appearance, that Monsieur should be withdrawn from offending
of Spain; and contrariwise, to marry, which two points cannot concur.
Master <hi>Beal</hi> hath the ciphered Letter of <hi>Twyns</hi> to procure to be interpreted,
but as yet it is not done, and so with my paper I end.</p>

Walsingham.</head>
                  <p>SIR, since my writing yesternight, though the Letters be not gone, yet her
Majestie by way of repetition hath willed me again to warn you, that you be
not overtaken with this, that her Majestie doubteth that the Queen mother will
withdraw Monsieur from the Low-Countries actions, meaning thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the marriage, which her Majestie cannot allow in any sort to have the action
left; how you shall be able to order this, you must there seek the way. For ayding
of Monsieur, these are her Majesties words, that if you finde the King not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to support his brother, rather then the action shall fail, you shall say that her
Majestie will not see him destitute, but the sum she will not name till she hear
from you, we are desirous to hear how the King will deal to ayd <hi>Don Anthonio</hi>
for her Majestie here is in such a suspence, as at this present, the journey stayeth;
namely, because besides her 5000. l. there is demanded 2500. l. more, which she
will not yield, and neither <hi>Drake</hi> nor <hi>Hawkins</hi> will go onward further: and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some scruples, Mr. <hi>Bingham, York, Fenton,</hi> and <hi>Ward,</hi> do forbear, her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
saith, you know some cause why Mr. <hi>York</hi> should not be trusted, She speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of a practisement by him in the Thames mouth, whereof she hath willed me
to write to you, that you should call it to memory, I renewed my opinion that
you could not spare Mr. <hi>Sommers,</hi> whereunto she answered, that if you could
not, you should do as you thought best, although she said she would that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>

                  <head>To the Right Honourable, and his very good Lord, the Lord
Treasurer.</head>
                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to advertise her Majestie that the next day after our
Audience in the afternoon, there repaired by the Kings Commandment unto us
Mr. <hi>Chivergni Villeguier,</hi> President <hi>Brissac la mothe Fenelon,</hi> Secretary <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nart,</hi>
and <hi>Du Uray,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Chivergni</hi> in the name of the rest did declare
unto us, that they were sent by the King to let us understand the great hope he
conceived of me the Secretary, serving her Majestie in that place of trust, I
should have brought her Highnesses full resolution for the proceeding in the
marriage, considering how far forth the matter had been already proceeded in,
the benefit that would have ensued thereby, as well for her Majesties own
Realm, as for the knitting the two Crowns in an Amitie indissolluble, that
now finding the matter to fall out otherwise, his Majestie was greatly grieved
withal, for that he did not see how there could be any sound or perfect Amitie
without marriage. To which speech, after I the Secretary had declared unto
them at length, the manner of the proceeding in the prosecution of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and the Reasons that did move her Majestie to take that resolution as she
did presently send me withal; We shewed them that we found it very strange,
considering the speeches used to us the day before by the King, by the which
he declared, that he was content that the Treatie of the League should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
without annexing thereto the condition of the marriage, that there
should now fall out an alteration thereof; and therefore prayed them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us with the reasons of the change, whereby we might advertise her
Majestie thereof, who might think great lightness in us to give her an assurance
of a thing proceeding from the Kings own mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th, which afterward should not
fill out so in effect, Upon which speech <hi>Du Uray</hi> made a very long discourse
touching the earnestness of his Masters affection, the full assurance he made of
the marriage, and the touch of credit that would grow unto him, if the same
should not take effect. And did declare unto us, that the Duke his Master
had given express commandment to be an humble suitor to the King, that he
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:54478:201"/>
would not proceed to the Treaty of the League, before assurance given, that
the marriage should take place: thereupon the rest of the Commissioners in
excuse of the King did declare, how that <hi>Du Uray</hi> had not delivered his
charge unto his Majestie, until the morning following<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in audience, who if
he had understood before his brothers request in that behalf, could not have
yielded that that Treatie should have been proceeded in without the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
Then I the Secretary shewed the Commissioners, how that I found
<hi>Du Urays</hi> speech strange, for that the Duke himself at the time of my
being with him, did promise that he would not oppose himself to any
thing that her Majestie did desire, and so concluded, that though he
could not be a furtherer of the League without marriage; yet would he not
hinder the same.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Pynart</hi> as he said by the Kings commandment, and his mothers,
did let us understand, that whereas they did finde that the principal difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
whereupon the stay of the marriage grew, proceeded through the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise,
that Monsieur had in the Low-Countries, their Majesties being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
that the marriage should take place, had dispatched that afternoon
Monsieur <hi>de Bellieure</hi> to the Prince of Parma, to procure that the said Prince
might withdraw his siege fom <hi>Cambray,</hi> and that the Town might be left in
a newtrality, as a member of the Empire; and further to perswade, that
there might be a general abstinence of war for the space of five or six months
in the which time there might be some composition treated between the
King of Spain, and his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>That the King and his Mother were in good hope that the same might be
brought to pass, which they did the rather desire, to the end Monsieur might in
the mean time go over into <hi>England,</hi> and finish that which had happily been
begun. Upon this overture we did let them understand, that if there might be
such a peace procured as might be accompanied with safety, none would be
more glad of it then the Queen our mistress: Notwithstanding we did signifie
unto them, that there were many apparent reasons to shew that the same was
not likely to take place but to the great prejudice and peril of those of the Low-Countries;
and therefore prayed them to call to remembrance how that her
Majesty at the time of his Ministers being in <hi>England</hi> did protest unto them
(at such time as they did let her understand that Monsieur should give over the
enterprise of <hi>Flanders,</hi> for that they saw it was an impediment to the marriage)
that she should be loth, considering how much it would touch him in honour,
and how dangerous it would be for them of the Low-Countries in case he
should give over the same, that her marriage should be accompanied with so
dolorous effects. And as she did then protest upon the overture made to give
over the enterprise, so we her ministers seeing the danger that might g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow
many wayes by the intended Treaty with the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> serving better
for the suffering of the King of Spain to grow to his greatness, then for the
relief of the poor afflicted in that Country, could not in reason, and our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
opinions, (having no Commission to deale therein) see any likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that the same might take any good effect: And therefore prayed
them, that unless they saw some other cause that might move them to take
that course, they would forbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> so to do.</p>
                  <p>This matter did minister unto us argument for the space of two houres at
the least; which for avoiding tediousness, we think meet to omit. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
the end grew to this conclusion with them, that either it would please them
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:54478:202"/>
that we might proceed in the said Treaty, or else that they would procure us
audience, that we might understand from the Kings own mouth, the revocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that he had assented unto, letting them also understand, that we did mean
presently to advertise her Majestie of this change, to the end that thereupon
she might give order for the stay of the Ships prepared for <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi>
being well assured that her Majestie upon this alteration, would forbear any
further proceeding therein; which we did the rather to let them understand,
for that it might provoke them to perswade the King to maintain his former
resolution: Whereupon they withdrawing themselves apart, did afterwards
let us understand, that they would make report unto the King of that which
had passed between us; and in the mean time did earnestly pray us, that we
would forbear to advertise her Majestie, as also not to disswade the going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the support appointed for <hi>Don Anthonio;</hi> whereunto, after most
earnest request made by them, we did assent, with condition, That we
might receive answer by ten of the clock the next day, and therein we did
the more willingly yield, for that they did put us in hope that we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
answer from the King to our contentment. The next day Monsieur <hi>de
la Mot, Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>zar</hi> and <hi>Pinart</hi> came to us, and told us, that the rest of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues,
and they had communicated with the King, the Negotiation passed
the day before between them and us, and that they had remembred to his
Majestie, his Speech delivered unto us, which we conceived to be this, That
he was pleased to appoint some to Treat with us touching a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be had with her Majestie, seeing there were such difficulties that did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
the marriage: That his Majestie answered, That the alteration
grew upon two causes, the one of a motion made to him by me the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for a further prolongation of certain daies to conserve the validity of the
reservation, the last prolongation being to expire within a day or two, which
motion gave him hope that the marriage might take effect. The other upon
a request made by <hi>Du. Uray,</hi> in the name of the Duke his brother, that the
League in no case might be proceeded in without the Marriage; which the
King, seeing the matter touched so greatly his brother in affection and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
could not deny his request. And to the end he might understand his
further mind therein, he thought good to send <hi>Pinart</hi> unto him out of hand,
to acquaint him what had passed hitherto in the matter, since our last audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
upon whose return we should then understand the Kings further plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
praying us in the mean time to have patience, and to interpret the
Kings answer touching the alteration, in good part, assuring us, that this
delay would rather further then hinder the matter we sought.</p>
                  <p>To these two allegations, I the Secretary did reply, That as for the first,
concerning my motion for a further prolongation, the same grew only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, that understanding as well by Monsieur, as by the King himself,
and Queen Mother, that their meaning was, that the pursuit of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
should be pursued still, in hope that her Majestie might in time remove
by her wisdom, those difficulties, for the which she could not presently for
divers important causes, proceed in the same. I thought good, for the
more validity of the reservation, to propound a further prolongation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
considering that the last was to expire within two or three daies, and
therefore the King could take no just cause upon any motion, to revoke
his former resolution. And as for the second, concerning a request of
<hi>Du Urayes,</hi> made in the Duke his Masters name, for the stay of the said
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:54478:202"/>
Treaty, unless it might be accompanied with marriage. I alleadged, that it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very unlikely, that at the Queen mothers being with the Duke, which was
two daies after <hi>Du Uray</hi> was sent from the said Duke unto the King, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
no such request unto her for the stay of the Treaty; for if he had, it
was likely she would have acquainted the King withall; and thereupon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
would have framed his answer accordingly: Which we finding not to fall
out so, cannot but greatly marvel at this change; whereunto they replyed, that
though the Queen mother had indeed charged <hi>Du. Uray</hi> therewith, yet he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
still upon the same, as a matter he had received in commandment from
the Duke his Master, and could not dispence with it without order from him.
We then finding by them, that we could not prevail to induce them to assent
to proceed to the Treaty, untill they heard from the Duke, thought good to
forbear any further pressing of the matter, and to attend Mr. <hi>Pinarts</hi> return; and
to the end we might know Monsieurs intent in that behalf, we thought good
to send Mr. <hi>Sommers</hi> forthwith (as well to perswade with him to remove his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments,
as also to acquaint him with such speeches as are given out here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> an

                     </gap>ound him in the one,
as in the other) In this conference we did let them understand of some cause
we had to mistrust (especially upon this voyage of Bellieure) that they were
loath to separate themselves from the amity of Spain, praying them therefore,
that if they were so disposed, we might know the truth thereof, letting them
understand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat the cause of our coming, was not to dissolve any amity they
had with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or any other Prince, otherwise then should stand with the
Kings honour, and his surety. Whereupon they made great protestations, that
the King had great cause for sundry respects, to look into the King of Spains
greatness, and therefore prayed us to lay distrust aside, not doubting, but
in time the King would deal, we should see, very honourably; the cause
whereof <hi>Pinart</hi> did assure us with most earnest protestations, as a man that
was acquainted with the secrets and inwards of the Kings own soul.</p>
                  <p>At the end of our conference upon the Speeches, I the Secretary, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them, how that her Majestie understanding of this alteration with the
King, for entring into the association, would cause the preparations for Portugal
to stay; <hi>Pinart</hi> desired very earnestly in Queen mothers name, that in no
case they might stay, but be furthered with all convenient expedition, and
that she would take it as a singular favour done to her self by her Majestie, in
case she would go forward therewith, as she had begun, assuring us that there
were at Bourdeaux, certain ships in a readiness likewise, to set forwards towards
the Isles, to be imployed in this service.</p>

                  <head>A Memorial for Mr. Sommers.</head>
                  <p>FIrst you shall declare to the Duke, That whereas the King had yielded to
proceed to the Treaty without marriage; the same resolution was altered
by a request made by <hi>Du. Vray</hi> in his name, that it might not be proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in without the said marriage; whereupon our Negotiation in that behalf, is
stayed untill the King and the Queen his Mother shall by Secretary <hi>Pinart,</hi>
understand his determination touching the continuance of the said stay by
<hi>Du. Uray</hi> procured, that whereas I the Secretary, at the time of my being
with him, did pray his Highness, considering the proceeding in the League,
did require expedition, that it would please him to recommend the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he King. He did then declare unto me, that though he could not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the same in respect of the doubt, and conceived that it might impeach
the marriage, which was the matter he chiefly sought; yet considering he
found by me, that it tended to the advancement of her Highness service, he
would not impeach or hinder the same, we are therefore to pray his Highness
it would please him, for the satisfaction of the Queen my Mistress (hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng
advertised her of his promise made in that behalf) to let us understand the
cause of the alteration thereof, that it shall be meet to lay before him the
benefit that may grow by the said League unto the enterprise that he hath in
hand, by comforting his own party in the Low-Countries, by discomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the adverse party, as also that it will serve to very good purpose, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the jealousnesse here within this Realme, and thereby to continue
the present peace, whereby he may the better prosper in his present actions;
that we doe not see how it may greatly hinder his intended pursuit of the
Marriage, but will rather further the same, for that it will breed a good
satisfaction in her Majesties Subjects, and to put them in hope to receive
more fruit of the Marriage, when they shall see these two Crownes to be
knit together in amity against their common Enemy the King of Spain. That
we hearing of certain bruites given out at Paris, not by mean and base per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but by such as doe pretend to know how matters of importance d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e
passe, how that there should be some overture made hy his Highness, of a
marriage with Spain; which we for our parts can in no case beleeve, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the earnest protestations that have been made by the King, his Mother,
and himself, touching his intention, for the continuance of the pursuit of the
Marriage, and therefore did think meet, in respect of the Honour that we
think our selves bound to bear towards one that hath so well deserved of the
Queen our Mistress, to acquaint him therewith, to the end we may receive
from himself, some such matter as may yield satisfaction to her Majestie
upon the hearing of the said bruit; That we esteem him to be a Prince of
so great honour (so long as he shall pursue the Marriage with her Majestie)
not to entertain any other. Besides, knowing how greatly those Marriages
knit between persons in nearness of bloud, are condemned in the opinion
of the world, being both against the Law of God and Nature, we cannot
be perswaded that he, being a Prince of that integrity, and one that is guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by conscience in all his actions, can be drawn thereunto. That it is also
given out, that in consideration of the said Marriage, the Prince of Parma
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:54478:203"/>
will be induced to withdraw his siege from Cambray, as also to yield to a
surceasance of Arms with the States of the Low-Countries, for the space
of five or six moneths, that in the mean time there may be some way found
for the pacifying of those Countries, and the reducing of them to the obedience
of the King of Spain, with the preservation of their Liberties: That we have
cause to believe some part of this, for that at our conference here with the
High-Commissioners, it was declared unto us, that <hi>Bellieure</hi> was sent unto
the Prince of Parma, for that purpose, that if the same might be brought to
pass for the surety of the States, none would be more glad of it then the
Queen our Mistress, who hath desired nothing more then the repose of that
Countrey, that herein we cannot but let him understand, how men of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doe see this project is onely layed to stop the pretended course for the
impeaching of the greatness of the King of Spain: For they that consider
how greatly the States are alienated from the King of Spain, and how reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
the King is bent not to yield to them in matter of exercise of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
so no reason that ever there can grow any good by any such Treaty, unless
it be unto the King of Spain.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we, as those that wish him all honour, doe pray to God also,
that it fall not out so, that some part of that project doe not tend to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.

                  <head>To the right honorable my very good Lord, the Lord Treasurer.</head>
                  <p>MY very good Lord, by the general Letter and Copy of that I writ unto
her Majestie, your Lordship may conceive as much as we are able to decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
of the causes of their alteration here with us; but the greatest cause of
stay and hanging off for hearkening to our motion is a doubt, they conceive
that her Majestie will not resolutely imbarque her self into any such certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of charges (as both this action of the Low-Countrys, and other char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which in time may be found necessary) will require: Spain and the Pope
make great and large offers, which are not lightly hearkened unto: Now if we
shall not (in our treating, be able to countervail them either with as good, or
with some such certainty as may be to their liking, our conference will be to
small purpose; and in my simple opinion, it were much better that we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
then that further imployment of time and charges should be fruitlesly
expended; and therefore I beseech your Lordship to be a mean to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
that we may have some certainty set downn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o us, which in our conference
with them, we may deliver to them, and that we may particularly know to
what sum, and for what time her Highness can be pleased to extend her aid,
and whether in case it be demanded of us, and they will have it so concluded,
she can be content to enter into open Warre against the King of Spain, or not;
for in these two points chiefly, will all their treating consist, wherein if we shal
not be able to resolve them, your Lordship can easily conceive what end our
Negotiation will have: I am given to understand, that in case her Marriage
shall not take place, then the King will enter into a League Defensive onely,
adding to the Treaties already in force, such other matters as shall be thought
necessary for common defence.</p>
                  <p>I pray your Lordship therefore, that we may know her Majesties mind in
this, and what shall be thought necessary meet to be added to the former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And so I humbly take my leave of your Lordship.</p>

the Kings alteration of his former resolution very strange, and therefor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
would be glad to know the true cause of the change, wherein I would to God
I could satisfie your Majestie of, with truth, to think that the same proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of two causes alleadged by the King, whereof we have in our general Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
unto the Lord Treasurer, made mention, I have many reasons to lead me
to be of contrary opinion, and have rather just cause to think that the ground
of the change grew upon advertisements received from thence, being put in
hope, that either your Majestie (they insisting still upon the League with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage)
will yield thereto, or else in respect of the doubts they are put in, that
the marriage not taking place, your Majestie will not go so resolutely forward
in the prosecution of the Warr against Spain (in case it should be found so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient)
to enter into a publique and open Warr: If your Majestie have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
the diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>culty in your own nature, as also other difficulties of Estate,
touching the marriage, and shall be disposed to proceed to the effectuating
thereof, then we your poor Ministers here, do hope that we shall not receive
that disgrace, as that your resolution therein shall rather be delivered by others,
then by us: On the other side, if that your Majestie shall not be disposed to
enter into an open action against Spain with this Crown, in respect of the
charges, then were it good that any further proceeding therein were forborn,
to give them occasion by the entertaining thereof, to think that your Majestie
dallieth with them (both in marriage and League) cannot but greatly exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them against you; how your Majestie shall be able alone to bear the malice
of Spain, France, and Scotland (for such a concurrency against you, is to be
looked for) I doe not see otherwise then to depend upon Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>The consideration of this matter doth minister necessary questions in State,
The one, Whether it were not better for your Majestie to joyn with France a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Spain, or to have them both with Scotland against you; The other, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were not better to convey the Wars out of your own Realm, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
association with this Crown, or to have this Crown, with the rest of
the evil affected neighbours, to assail you within your own Realm. The solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is very easie; for as in cure of a natural body, being diseased, it were evil
advice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o councel the application of inward medicines, when outward will serve;
so were it less dangerous to attend a Warr at home, the inward corruption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
throughly looked into, when that the same (by some provident course, by
your Majestie taken) may be put off; the only difficulty resteth only upon
charges, which if the likelihood were, would grow greater then your Estate
or Crown might bear, then were it reason for your Majestie to forbear the
same, for that <hi>Ultra posse non est esse,</hi> and to stand upon your own defence: But
if the charges may be reduced into such a convenient proportion as the Crown
may bear, then were it very hard that treasure should be preferred before safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
I beseech your Majestie, that (without offence) I may tell you, that your
loathnesse to spend even then, when it concerneth your safety, is publiquely
delivered out here. We find also the doubt thereof, by the Commissioners
particular and private speeches with us, to be a principal impediment, why
the King here is loath to joyn in association with your Highness. For the love
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:54478:205"/>
of God, good Madam, look into your own estate; and think that there can
grow no perill so great, as to have a War break out in your own Realm, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what number of evill Subjects you have; and therefore your Majesty
cannot redeem the perill that is like to grow thereby at too dear a price. I hope
your Majesty will bear with my boldness, and interpret th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you after the speech with the King the ninth of this month. I hope you have
received my Letters sent by <hi>Walton</hi> your servant, and therefore I think it not
needful to repeat the whole contents thereof, but her M. suspendeth all resolute
answers, till she hear from you, In no wise she would have the enterprise of the
Low Countries lost, but she will not particularly warrant you to offer aid. She
alledgeth that now the matter is so farr gone, the King will not abandon it; Her
Majesty feareth that the Queen mother will contrarily withdraw the Duke her
Son from it, and then will say, That the Queen must marry with him, because
she alledgeth no impediment but misliking of her people, to have a Husband
beginning a Warr. Her Majesty also is very cold in the cause of Don <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio,</hi>
alledging that she liked it but by opportunity of her Councell; and
now that all things are ready, as ships, Victuals, Men, &amp;c. the charges whereof
cometh to 12000 pound, she hath been moved to impart two thousand pound
more as a thing needfull for the full furniture of this Voyage, wherewith she is
greatly offended with Mr <hi>Hawkins</hi> and <hi>Drake,</hi> that the charges are grown so
great, above that was said to her, when the five thousand pound was demanded
of her.</p>

                     <pb n="389" facs="tcp:54478:205"/>
They, for Answer, say, That the number of ships is increased, by a ship dearly
provided by Mr <hi>Bingham,</hi> without their knowledge; hereupon her Majesty not
content to give one penny more, they were willed to abate the number, and
consequently the charge to rest at 12000 pound; but they say all provisions are
ready, and answer given as they cannot possibly. In the end <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Hawkins</hi>
will make shift for 2000 pound, and her Majesty so answered, yet will not suffer
them to depart, untill she be well assured from you, that the French will aid Don
<hi>Anthonio,</hi> for she feareth to be left alone. She also is informed that the Fleets
from the West-Indies arrived in Spain the 27 of July, and also that the Island of
Terceras is rendred to the K. of Spain: All these things (though these adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements
are not very certain) do marvailously stay her Majesty from assenting
to their departure, and yet she loseth all the charges spent in vain, the poor King
utterly lost; and therefore her Answer yesterday was, that the voyage should
continue in readiness, but not depart untill this Evening, before which time she
looked to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>SIR, Because this Bearer, your servant, is by you commanded to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delay, I cannot by him, send any thing of moment, for that your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
came not before this forenoon by <hi>Iohn Wils,</hi> by reason of contrary winds,
as he saith, that kept him two daies from England; and all this day, since her
Majestie received your Letters, my Lord Chamberlain, and my Lord of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,
by a former appointment, were at Westminster to examin the Lord
<hi>Vaux;</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Tresham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Griffin,</hi> of which three, the first two are
close-prisoners in the Fleet, who deny <hi>Campians</hi> being with them, but they
will take no oath; the other confesseth plainly and simply. By this occasion
her Majestie forbeareth, without advice, to make any censure of your Letters,
or to give me any charge what to write to you. She saith, untill she shall hear
what Mr. <hi>Bellieure</hi> shall do with the Prince of Parma, and <hi>Pinart,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
with Monsieur, she cannot guess what will be the event. She denieth
that any one here, had any cause to give comfort to the marriage. But truly,
I think some have had such a conceit, and whether they have sent it over since,
I know not; you shall do well to write to her Majestie, or to me, of the state
and proceedings of Monsieur with his Army, for she findeth fault therewith.</p>

                  <head>To her Majestie, August 16. 1581.</head>
                  <p>MOst gracious Soveraigne, The particular Letter it pleased your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Princely favour, to voughsafe to write unto me, did mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
unto me two singular comforts, The one, that your mislike conceived
of my dealing with the Duke, is in part quallified. The other, for that
it hath pleased your Majestie to lay open unto me your disposition touching the
charge committed unto me, whereby I may use the same as a load-star, the beter
to direct my course.</p>
                  <p>Touching the first, I hope, when your Majestie shall be throughly
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54478:206"/>
informed of my proceedings, you shall find that I swerved not from your instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
I received, nor yet had cause that indiscretion might lead me to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
course. The principal cause why I was sent over, as I conceive it, and as
I trust your Majestie can call it to remembrance, was to procure a streighter
degree of amity between the King and you, without marriage, and yet to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
my self in the procuring thereof, as might not altogether break off the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of marriage; yet the success of my travel fell out so, through Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as I did assuredly, not without good ground, make account that the amity
would have taken place, had it not been crossed by some practice (as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
may perceive by some former advertisements) not yet discovered; and
yet both the King, his Mother, and Monsieur, resolute to continue their former
determination for the prosecutiou of the marriage, which if I had made the case
so desperate as I perceive your Majestie hath been informed, then surely would
they not have continued their disposition to follow the matter: I was sundry
times pressed, both by them and their Ministers, to yield a resolute answer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I had power to say that your Majestie would not marry. Whereunto I
answered, as I was directed, that I had no such authority, otherwise then to
lay before them the impediments that made your Majestie doubtfull to proceed
in the marriage, which was to have the same accompanied with a Warr. This
then being true (as the effects do shew) I hope your Majestie in the goodness
of your own Princely nature and uprightness, in your judgement will rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
For otherwise, If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, or any other like Minister imployed, shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
unheard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it cannot but minister great cause of grief and discouragement.
Touching the other benefit received by your Majesties particular Letter, by
which you have so farr forth opened your self, as if you shall of necessity be
thrown into a Warr, you find it more agreeable with your surety, to have it
accompanied with marriage, then without.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but let your Majestie understand, as I declared to you before my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
that if your Majestie shall be content to yield to marriage, I am fully
perswaded that the King will be induced to covenant with you, that you shall
be discharged of such burthen as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> may cast upon you, which is the only
matter that we have presently to deal in, considering, that now your Majestie
hath so far forth opened your self to Monsienr <hi>Marchiamont,</hi> as to let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that if the impediment of the charges that the Warr may cast upon
you, may be removed, your Highness seeth no cause why the marriage should
not proceed: For this thing being known to their Majesties, all hope to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the League without marriage, is excluded. I beseech your Majestie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we may receive your speedy direction in this case, as also what other thing
you would have annexed unto the marriage, besides the removing of the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
above mentioned.</p>
                  <p>And so with all humbleness do beseech God of his great and infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

(whereof I send your Lordship a copy) that her Majestie hath
so farr forth opened her self, as that she hath signified unto him, That so the
burthen of the charges that the War may cast upon her, be born by the King,
she seeth no impediment why she should not proceed to the marriage. I see
our Treaty of League without marriage utterly overthrown: so that now there
resteth nothing for us to doe here, but to perswade the King to take upon him
the burthen of the Warr, as the only impediment in the marriage; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are to pray your Lordship to procure her Majesties Warrant under her
own Hand, in plain and clear termes to proceed therein: And if there shall be
any thing besides, that her Majestie shall desire to have annexed to her marriage,
that is not contained in the former Contract; then we beseech your Lordship,
that we may understand her Majesties further pleasure therein: for untill such
time as we shall hear from her Majestie, we have nothing to doe here, the League
without marriage being utterly broken off.</p>

pray to God so to bless her Majesties resolution to marry, with that good effect
that may be to her own comfort, and the benefit of her Realm.</p>

                  <p>SIr, I thank you for acquainting me with that you write to her Majestie,
whereof you sent me a copy, but until this afternoon I had it not; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the original from your self was delivered to her Majestie, the delay (as Mr.
<hi>Mills</hi> told me) of the delivery grew, for that your Cousin had not time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
it yesterday to Mr. <hi>Mills,</hi> who also was absent. But having now read it,
I see you have great cause why her Majestie should be well content with your
actions, in all occurring with the course appointed you; and lo now this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without using any token of sight of your letters, I repeated to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
that the course you held to procure the League, without marriage, was
specially committed to you to obtain, against which it was certain, that Monsieur
for his particular (and all his Ministers for his sake) would spurn, and so in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your duty, you were subject to their misliking. Hereupon I found he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to
assent to that I said. But she added, that she wished that Monsie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r might have
been perswaded thereto. I answered, that she her self should not be able to
perswade him to content himself, and much less her Ministers. This afternoon,
finding her Majestie unwilling to send the Fleet to the <hi>Azores,</hi> whereby charge
should grow without profit, it was motioned, that in the mean time that her
Majestie should be assured of the French Kings actions to concur with hers, two
or three of the ships, with a Bark, should forthwith repair to the <hi>Tercera</hi> with
some Captains, Souldiers, Powder and Munition to comfort the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>slanders to
stand fast, and to direct to be furnished for the defence of the Island, until
more forces might come; a matter, as my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> saith, <hi>Don <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to him, and so I think the ships shall away to morrow, if it alter not. By the
next you shall know, though the French King to our Ambassador there, and
by his own said, that he would aid Don <hi>Anthonio,</hi> yet these being but words
changeably by a Prince, if now he shall reveal to you his minde, it is reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to say, that though it will require some longer time to contract a treaty
hereupon; yet if it please him to write a letter to her Majestie, to assure her that
he will joyn with her in aiding Don <hi>Anthonio,</hi> and if for her action, the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> shall offer offence to her Majestie or her subjects, he shall repute the
quarrel his own joyntly with her, in defence of her, and offence of the King of

with Letters from the Qu. mother, of great earnestness to her Majestie to aide
<hi>Don Anthonio</hi> (by that name, but not by that of the K. <hi>Anthony)</hi> whereof the
Fr: Ambassador made reason for the Q. mothers pretence) but from the French
King her Majestie had no Letter; Thereupon her Majestie is scrupulous, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to give occasion of a Warr to be born by her self alone, and the more She
doubteth, finding the Fr: King so precise in his Brothers cause. We finde in a
Letter of <hi>Tuyns</hi> here decyphered, that the King sent <hi>Gondy</hi> to him with ample
Commission to carry away the 300000 Crowns, wherewith the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>

not have it detained for her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he were satisfied. Surely Mr Secretary the cause hath been but lightly condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,

not much above 3000 <hi>l.</hi> and it is brought almost to 14000 <hi>l.</hi> and the King
<hi>Anthony</hi> regardeth nothing therein done, but remitteth his payment to the
Island, or rather to the pay of the King of Spa: Indies; yet we here do what we
can to content him. I hear that the Count <hi>Vimioso</hi> will be here within these

                  <p>IT may please your Lordship, after the long stay from proceeding in our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,
upon such reasons as in our former letters we have advertised. <hi>Du
Vray</hi> came unto us on Friday, to acquaint us with such answer as he had received
from the Duke his Master, touching the furtherance of the league desired. The
sum of the speeches that he delivered unto us being this, That the Duke was
contented that the treaty should go forward, as a thing found necessary by her
Majestie, so that it might be no prejudice to the marriage. And for that the
Duke his Master rested assured of her Majestie, that she had no such meaning,
as by the one to prejudice the other, he did let us understand, that by the said
Dukes order, he had imparted so much unto the King; and that he thought
upon the return of Monsieur <hi>Pynart,</hi> who was looked for that evening, we should
know the Kings further pleasure touching our proceeding. This report of <hi>Du
Vray</hi> we thought good not to advertise before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> Duke, as your Lordship
may perceive by his reports set down in writing sent down herewith. This day
<hi>la Mot</hi> and <hi>Pynart</hi> sent unto us, to let us understand, that the King meaneth to
morrow in the morning to confer with his Councel about the cause we are come
for, praying us to excuse the delay, that the King (by reason of letters from the
Duke his brother, and others from the Duke <hi>du Main)</hi> was so entertained, as he
had no leisure to consult touchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>g our said cause. As for the manner of our
proceeding in the Treaty with the French King or his Ministers, we mean to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the course prescribed by her Majestie, as well contained in our Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as also in your Lordships letters of the 13 of this present. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the contents of the said letters, whereas her Highness conceiveth by a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
written by me the Secretary the 10 of this present, that a treaty, without
drawing her Majestie into charges, will not be effected, which causeth her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to put on a resolution, that it is as good for her to be at charge with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
as without. In which behalf, for that the one seemeth to us to depend
upon the other, and both of them doubtful, we neither receive perfect directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the marriage, nor for the charges without the marriage; especially what
sum her Majestie can be content to yield unto, in case the contribution shall be
accorded to be done underhand. We humbly pray your Lordship, that we may
speedily have her Majesties resolution herein; for that otherwise the treaty will
be drawn into great length, both to her Majesties and the Kings charge here;
besides that, we know that it will breed some misliking, and will be found strange,
that we should have autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity to deal in general terms onely, without entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
particularities, but must be driven to send over for resolution in such points
as might well be considered of before hand, we are the rather moved to pray
your Lordship to move her Majestie in these points, for that we are given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
they mean to grow here to deliberation in Counsel, whether it shall
be fitter for Monsieur to continue the prosecution of his action in the Low-Countreys;
or else having discharged his promise, by releeving of <hi>Cambray,</hi> to
give over further proceeding therein. In the debating whereof, such as are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>in</hi> (as we are informed) mean to lay before the King such reasons
as may induce him to think it not fit to concur with his brother in assisting him
in his action, in respect of the great charges which the following thereof wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
Besides, divers other inconveniences that may accompany a war against
such a Potent Prince as the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Others, that consider the danger
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:54478:209"/>
that may grow to this Crown, if his greatness be not impeached, do mean on
the other side, to perswade him to joyn with her Majestie upon the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
given, for the abating of the said greatness. Now to the end the King
may stand assured how her Majestie will proceed in that behalf, it is meant that
we shall be effectually dealt withal, both for the manner of the attempt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
for the charges; wherein, if we shall not be able to yield sufficient satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it is to be doubted that the resolution will fall out that Monsieur shall be
persvvaded to give over the enterprize, whereunto, without support, and by
the great offers likely to be made unto him, he shall be of necessity forced to
yield and run some such course as shall not be good for her Majesties safety. Thus
much we have thought good to impart unto your Lordship, referring the same
to her Majesties consideration, praying your Lordship to procure her speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
which may be without alteration, or else it shall be thought here that all
our doings are but dalliances.</p>

                  <p>MY very good Lord, your letter of the 17 sent hy Mr. Vice-Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
man. I have received the contents, vvhereof I mean to send by the
next. Sorry I am to see her Majesty so apt to take offence against me, which
falleth not out contrary to my expectation, and therefore I did protest unto her,
after it had pleased her to make choice of me to employ me this way, that I
should repute it a greater favour to be committed unto the Tower, unless her
Majesty may grow more certain in her Resolutions there: Instead of Amity, I
fear her Highness shall receive enmity, and we her Ministers here be greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted,
having no certain direction what to follow. The Kings charges
here are great for my Diet, amounting to One hundred pound <hi>per diem:</hi> And
the charges of his Ambassador that he last sent over, stood him in well near
60000 Crownes, now in the end of it prove neither Marriage nor honourable
Amity, he may besides the dishonor, think his charges hardly employed. To
think that the Amity (such as may bring surety) will be compassed, we here see
no reason so to conceive. Now her Majesty finding it more for her surety to
have the charges accompanied with marriage then without, I pray your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
that we may have warrant to proceed accordingly, and then by experience
her Highness shall not finde that any particular passion beareth that sway with
me, as I finde She conceiveth it doth. Whereas her Majesty would have me
to signifie my knowledg touching Mr <hi>Gilbert York,</hi> surely for mine own part, I
cannot but report well of the Gentleman, and therefore her Majesty hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
information some other way: The Marshall <hi>de Coss</hi> is greatly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
here, for that he did not accompany the Duke: he required at the Kings
hands a Warrant, not contenting himself with a verball commandment. The
King answered him, That he might as well without Warrant accompany his
Brother in this Voyage, as to take a Pension of him of 12000 Francks yearly,
which no Marshall of <hi>France</hi> ought to doe. Besides this pension, he hath in
Abbies and other benefits bestowed on him, by the Duke (as I am informed)
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:54478:209"/>
15000 Francks. The rest of the Marshals Monsieur doth not desire. And
so, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>To Mr Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIR, when I had imparted to her Majestie all the Letters brought hither
this 24. from your self alone, and from Sir <hi>Henry Cobham</hi> with you, and
Mr <hi>Sommers;</hi> and also the contents of Mr <hi>Sommers</hi> Negotiation with
Monsieur, of all which particularities nothing did or could content her Majestie,
more then that Monsieur was entred into <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mbray,</hi> according to his honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
intention and promise; so as her Majestie rejoyceth greatly with this
his fruits of so great an enterprize. And whereas by Mr. <hi>Sommers</hi> report of the
Dukes own mouth, as also by that you have sought to understand, that he is
not relieved by the King in this his action, being so chargeable unto him, so as
if he have not some present relief otherwise, then as the Duke himself hath told
Mr. <hi>Sommers,</hi> he shall be forced to desist from any further action in the Low-Countreys.
As also you by your Letters do signifie, that you fear it will be so
concluded by the French King and his special Spanish Councel, that some peace
may be made, and Monsieurs honour saved by the revictualling of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
and so his promise being therein acquitted, he may retire and disperse his forces:
Upon consideration whereof her Majestie findeth it strange, that Mr. <hi>Sommers</hi>
gave no more comfortable words to Monsieur, upon the declaration of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of, and from her Majestie, in such earnest sort as Mr. <hi>Sommers</hi> himself do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h
report it: But said, he had no Commission to deal in that matter, but that he
would not fail to report his Highness request faithfully to her Ambassadour,
whereas contrariwise you Mr. Secretary did in a Post-script of your letter of the
17 of <hi>August,</hi> write to me, that Mr <hi>Sommers,</hi> who was then with the Duke,
had Commission to offer him support in case he should see his necessity great, or
not likely to be otherwise supplyed: so as her Majestie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith, that either Mr.
<hi>Sommers</hi> was greatly to blame not to utter such speeches to Monsieur, or else he
had not instruction from you so to do; which to be done by him, or otherwise
her Majestie saith plainly, you knew her mind and pleasure. So that she is greatly
grieved, that for lack of comfort given him, he may in the mean time be forced
to hearken to some other sinister perswasions for some patched peace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as it may be possible, her Majestie hath willed me with all haste to send this
pacquet to you, to will you without any delay to give Monsieur knowledge, that
her Majestie hath regard of his cause, and hath at this present instant hour at
noon, of the 24 of this moneth, when she heard of Mr. <hi>Sommers</hi> his motion
made to him, given order, that assoon as money can be told, and how that by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
advice of <hi>Marchiamont</hi> it may be safely sent, he shall have a support from her
Majestie to continue his action, and not to give it over, being so honourably
begun, and now so fortunately entred, by his entry into <hi>Cambray</hi> for want of
support; and so I assure you, Sir, for your satisfaction, I am commanded by
her Majestie to cause a support to be ready for this purpose, to the value of
<gap reason="symbol" extent="7 letters">
                        <desc>〈7 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap> thousand pound. As for your other matters, concerning your
proceeding in a treaty for a league, her Majestie hath willed me to repeat that
<pb facs="tcp:54478:210"/>
which you have had knowledge of, both by your in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tructions, and otherwise,
since that now the Treaty of the marriage remaineth in suspence, and that the
King will be contented to Treat of the rest; you are to consider, that the first
matter is to Treat of the general League offensive and defensive, whereby
if the King of Spain should offend either her or the King, the other should not
only aid the party offended, but also offend the offender, wherein there is no
cause to speak particularly to what quantity or sum her Majesty for her part, or
the King for his part, should be contributory, as it seemeth to her Majestie, by
your Letters you require to have a particular resolution. But for contribution
of any sums of money, that is to be treated of with the King upon a secret
Treaty apart, in which sort it shall be thought convenient both for the French
King, for the abating of the over-greatness of Spain, in what sort Monsieur
in the Low-Countries should be supported, and also in what sort and manner the
King and her Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>estie might aid <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> to recover his Kingdom of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.
And of this secret Treaty you have especial instruction to deal with the
King, which would be accelerated, and not delayed, as it hath been by the
French, upon a continual pretence to have a resolute answer for the marriage,
which now being by Monsieurs consent put in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o as the other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys
may proceed. It is now then time that this latter Treaty were dealt in, as
well for the necessity of Monsieurs actions, to be continued and maintained, as
the aiding of <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> whilst the Island of Terceras being of most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
doth, as you hear, continue for the said King <hi>Anth.</hi>
                  </p>

and then what probably himself may of his own contribute. And lastly for
supply of that which shall be wanting, what the French King will yield, who in
reason, both for his brother, and for respect that the Countries, to be acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s brother, are to remain to the Crown of Faance, ought to yield a
treble support, and the rather also for that his charges and his Civil Warrs are
now at an end, the rather by the means of the travail of the Duke his brother,
in the procuring of the last Peace; and these parts being by you well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and debated, so as you may see reason to lead you to think these computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
probable, then her Majestie shall finde ground to consider how farr she
may proceed to contribute, which presently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> can neither limit nor ghesse.</p>
                  <p>But because you think the lack of your knowledge to answer hereunto, and
the expence of time to send to her for Answer, will seem unto them there,
strange: You may assure them, that when her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ajestie shall understand the
circumstance of the matters, she will yield speedy Answer, and give a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
contentation, according to her interest therein, which cannot nor ought not
to be so chargeable as percase will be demanded of her; for that herein her
Crown shall receive no benefit. Therefore to conclude the like considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would be had of the state how Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> may be relieved, wherein
there hath been no delay of her part, otherwise then that she would be
well assured, that for yielding Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ief unto him (which both the French King
and Queen Mother have often sollicited) she might not receive offence of the
King of Spain, but that the French King would joyn therein, which her Majestie
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:54478:210"/>
as well for the charges, as to withstand the offence: And yet in both their
matters you must remember, that her Majestie never yielded to proceed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
then that by secret Treaty she and the King, both might accord thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to do all underhand, as it might be; and if any offence should be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against either of them for the same, then by vertue of the general
League, they should mutually aide one another. And if there shall be any
motion made to you to have any open Warr made joyntly by both the Princes,
for the abatement of the King of Spain: You may well answer, that you
have no Commission for the same; and yet you shall advertise her Majestie
how, and by whom, the same shall be mentioned unto you, that she may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
consider thereof, for great incertainties may happen thereof, if her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
should fall into open Warr, upon hope of a mutual aide of the French
King, except there were some greater bond by other means then by Treaties
and Leagues by writing, her Majestie might percase lack such aid in time, as
were convenient and needfull for her. And therefore I think that true, that
in one of your Letters you doe conceive of her Majesties meaning, that if
her Majestie should be forced to joyne with the French King in an open Warr,
it were better to be assured by marriage of the Prince, to joyn with her, then
to depend upon the incertainty of the French King alone, having no bond but
a Treaty upon words and writing.</p>
                  <p>After her Majestie had read hitherto, she willed me to reitterate more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
two reasons to you, why her aides ought not to be such as percase will be
demanded, The one, for that she hath no party interest in Monsieurs actions,
as France shall have. The other, for that Queen Mother hath an interest for
Portugal, and not her Majestie.</p>
                  <p>I need not to add these, but to obey her commandments, as I have done in
all my Letters.</p>

2. Whether her Majestie can yield to the support of the 6000 men named in
the Treaty defensive for the space of four moneths, at her charges; and if
we be by the Commissioners pressed to assent that her Majestie shall bear the
charges any longer time then four months, how farr forth she will yield in
that case; and if they shall require greater numbers then are above specified,
then to what numbers we shall yield, and for how long time to be continued
at her Majesties charges.</p>
                  <p>3. If in case the said Commissioners not content with our answer, shall
insist still upon joynt Forces to be yielded to the Princes Confederates, as by
them was propounded; we desire to know how far forth we shall yield there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and whether her Majestie in that behalf will be content to contribute a
third or fourth part. either in men or money, and whether it shall not be meet
to have the said joynt forces to be limitted by a certain number, as also to a time
in which they shall be imployed.</p>

                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to advertise her Majestie, that as by our last
Letters to you of the 21 of this present, we advertised of the Kings and
Monsieurs consents, that a League should be treated of without speaking of
the marriage. So the same day <hi>Messieurs, Villquier, la Mott, Bellieur, Brisson,
Pinart,</hi> and <hi>Du. Uray,</hi> coming to us from the King, said, that his Majestie desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
much the Queens Majesties amity, and to have the same augmented by
Treaties by marriage, and by all other good means; and finding some impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
in the matter of the marriage, he had sent them to confer with us about
such other means as might best serve to encrease the amity: And so after divers
speeches used to them again, to signifie his H. reciproque inclination in that behalf,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="404" facs="tcp:54478:213"/>
We entred into talk of League defensive, remembring the last made at
Bloys in King <hi>Charles</hi> his time, which they said, if we found not to be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
it should be altered or enlarged: And that they thought it good for
both the Realms to add an Article to it, to meet with dissentions and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
committed on the Sea; whereof they had heard very many. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
they also said touching a Staple to be established at Roan, as is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the said Treaty; but after they had heard good reasons, which moved
against the occasion of that Article, they said little to it, but earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that other for the maintenance of good intelligence, and sure Trade
between the Realms and Subjects. Then something was also propounded
for a League offensive; where it was also remembred, that there were two
kinds of Leagues offensive, the one where two Princes or more doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
themselves against another Prince by name, the other in general
terms, for conservation of Estates. And for as much as France and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
were at this time in amity with all Princes, that League for conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Estates, was thought but to be Treated of, and argued, and so no
Prince could have just cause to be openly offended therewith. And so
without further entring into particularities untill our next meeting, they
departed.</p>
                  <p>On Wednesday the twentithird, they came again, and having shewed
their Commission, it was propounded, That for a League offensive, they
said it was to be first accorded, that either Princes should be friend to friends,
and enemy to enemies, after invasion made upon either of them.</p>
                  <p>And for a second it was propounded, That if either of the Princes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
should be assa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

advertise the other Prince his Confederate, who should send streight to the
Prince that hath assailed, to warne him to cease his Invasion, and to repaire
forthwith the wrongs done, or else in case of refusal, that the said Prince
Confederate will denounce Warre to him that did assaile, as he shall doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if the Invader will not retire and repaire the wrongs within seven
weeks.</p>
                  <p>This motion being found indifferent for both parts, I the Secretary deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them certain other Notes taken out of other Treaties, which they said
they would answer at our next meeting. Your Lordship doth herewith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the copy thereof.</p>
                  <p>Here it was propounded by them, That if either of the Princes Confederate
should be invaded by another Prince, and that the Prince invaded shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his Confederate to declare open Warr, and to enter into open acts of
hostility with him against the Invader, as bound by League (after due admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
and summons made) who shall bear the charge of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Prince required, whether shall he bear them alone, or the
Prince requiring to bear a portion thereof, according to his quality and greatness.
These things being very considerable, we deferred to answer them untill our
next meeting, and so did provide to answer, as your Lordship shall see by notes
sent herewith. Beseeching your Lordship to procure her Majesties resolution
and answer to us, and that by her Highness direction and warrant, these, and
other points that shall be thought meet, may be resolved upon, to be agreed
unto here, to come to an end, without unnecessary spending of time and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
The next day, the 24. whilst we looked for them according to appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they sent us word, that upon occasion of Letters which the King had
received that day from his Ambassador in England, the King had deferred
their coming untill the next day, and then they came and said, VVe might
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:54478:213"/>
well remember, that from the beginning of this Negotiation, and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the King desired nothing more then the marriage, which would bring
with it all other good things, for Leagues and streight bonds of amity, such
as her Majestie would desire, and that since their being with us, his Majestie
had received Letters from his Ambassador Mr. <hi>Mannisiere</hi> on the 24. and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the 25. dated the 22. of this month, by the which he gave the King very
great hope of the marriage, upon speeches proceeding from her Majestie in a
long conference had of late with her Highness; whereupon the King had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to tell us, that seeing that matter was now in so good terms, he
thought good to stay further proceeding in the Treaty of a League. But to
end first that which was first begun, and in such forwardness, which was the
Marriage, and that they thought we should have commandment from her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
very shortly in this behalf; whereunto it was answered unto them, that
though we heard nothing thereof from her Majestie, yet we would believe
what they had said, as written to the King from his Ambassador, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
we might understand her Majesties pleasure herein; we thought that this
Negotiation for a League might well proceed, to bring it to some good point,
and to win so much time, seeing the King had consented and desired to have
such a League with her Majestie; Mr. <hi>de Chevereny</hi> said, that the time would
not be so long ere we should receive her Majesties pleasure, and that they could
not proceed any further in the Treaty, seeing this was the Kings pleasure. Then
it was said by <hi>Pinart,</hi> that the Ambassador had then written (as so spoken by her
Highness to him) that she had rather marry a mean Gentleman of France, then
go now from that which was so farr proceeded in between her Highness and
Monsieur. Thus we being put off from our Negotiation, and at a stay, knew
not how to proceed any further in any thing, untill we may understand her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
pleasure, which we beseech you to procure to be sent unto us in some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
that an orderly and honourable course may be holden to grow to an
end. At this time <hi>Pinart</hi> (as so commanded, he said by the Queen Mother)
did very specially recommend to her Majesties consideration, the estate of poor
<hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> and to remember the great charges he hath been at in providing
shipping in England, to be sent and to joyn with the French Kings ships under
Captain <hi>Carles,</hi> who he assured they had advertisement, was gon to the sea seven
daies ago, thinking to meet with <hi>Don Anthonio's</hi> ships (rigged in England) at a
Cape which he could not name. And that unless the same depart not out of
hand, all the charge will be lost, and that the King shall be fain to venture his
ships alone, if no other aid joyn with them. He shewed there an advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
came that day from the Isle of Tercera, that the French have landed there,
taken the Isle, and certain ships, and put to the Sword 800 Spaniards, among
whom were they whose names were here in a scedule, and that he thinketh they
are gon to meet with the rest of the Spanish Fleet. And thus, &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>To the Lord Treasurer.</head>
                  <p>MY very good Lord, I send your Lordship here inclosed, the last Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
contained in mine instructions for the League, which we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
to adde to those heads of a League, which we exhibited to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
for that we find it somewhat darke, and therefore doe pray
your Lordships explanation therein: For as we conceive of it, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the French King from aiding of the Duke his brother, which I think
is not meant, considering her Majesties promise to assist the Duke in the
action.</p>
                  <p>I beseech your Lordship that we may have speedy resolution by way of Post,
or otherwise, as by your Lordship shall be thought meet, to such things as we
send your Lordship by this dispatch.</p>
                  <p>After I had proceeded thus far in my Letter, thinking that our conference
with the Kings Commissioners, would have bred some good accord touching
the most parts of those points which were by us propounded unto them. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hope the King is put in by Letters lately come from his Ambassador
resident there, our further conference is staid, as your Lordship may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by our general Letters, which if it be not so throughly resolved on as
the Ambassador conceiveth, and as he hath reported to the King his Master
(whereof we her Majesties Ministers here stand in doubt, having no confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
thereof) Then surely this report will doe a great deal of harm many
waies, and ministers to the persons named in mine other Letters, matters of
strange discourse. Besides, we that serve here, cannot but be infinitely
grieved, to see the weighty cause we have in hand, subject to so many inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
especially of the alteration of proceeding upon occasion given from
thence.</p>
                  <p>It were well her Majestie did capitulate with the Ambassador in these great
matters, not to advertise any thing without first making her privy thereunto,
as also that upon any such resolution taken with him, we here might be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
withall, to the end there might be concurrency with us. Touching her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
pleasure for the return of Mr. <hi>Sommers,</hi> I hope when her Majestie
shall consider the weightiness of the cause we deal in, and the number and
sufficiency of the persons we are matched withall, her Highness shall see more
cause to send some other well chosen Civilians to assist us, then to withdraw
him from us. Upon the perusing of a Letter that the Ambassador resident
wrote unto me, much to the same effect he had written to the King, I thought
good to send to <hi>Pinart,</hi> to acquaint him with the contents of the said Letter,
which (as I gave order to be declared unto him) caried no other substance, but
a report of such speeches as her Majestie had delivered to the said Ambassador
the same evening that he waited on her Majestie when she road abroad to take
the aire, wherein her Majestie did rather lay open unto him how she stood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the marriage, then delivered him any resolution, and that it was so,
it might well appear hereby, for that her Highness doth not use to give her
resolution in any matter of importance, without the privity of her Councel,
and acquainting her Ambassador on this side therewith, to the end there may
be a concurrency between her Majesties Ministers, and the King, which being
otherwise in this case, I could not but rest doubtfull of the substance of the report.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54478:214"/>
And therefore was desirous if it might stand with the Kings pleasure (consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great charges his Majesties is at with us, and the time that passeth away
fruitlesly) the Treaty might go on until we might receive further matter from
her Majesty. To this <hi>Pinart</hi> answered, that he thought the request reasonable,
for that it was grounded upon great probability, and would therefore the next
morning move the King in the matter, requiring in the mean season, that as much
might be delivered to some other of the Commissioners, as had been to him,
especially to <hi>Chivergni Villequire,</hi> which was offered to be done by the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
I sent; but they being in conference with the Queen mother, and therefore
for that time not to be dealt withal at his motion, it was delivered to <hi>Bellieure,</hi>
(whom they found in the utter Chamber of Queen mother) who in like sort
found the message and request teasonable; and concluded with <hi>Pinart,</hi> that the
next morning the King shall be moved in it; when <hi>Pinart</hi> delivered this answer
to my messenger, he told him withal, that the King upon the receit of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
from his Ambassador, had put on a resolution not to proceed in any League
offensive, unless the marriage were first fully accorded, and that being done, he
would make a Treaty offensive, not onely against one Prince, but against all
whatsoever. With this I thought good to acquaint your Lordship notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
I finde them full of alterations, to the end that in case the King should
dwell in this resolution, I might receive her Majesties pleasure for my return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
humbly praying your Lordship to use the matter so, that it may be no cause of
stay in her Majestie with this dispatch. For my own opinion, I think that the
King will stay in this resolution until he may hear from his brother, to whom
<hi>Du Uray</hi> this day hath dispatched a pacquet, the 26 of August.</p>

                  <p>MY very good Lord, whereas I perceive by your letters of the seventeenth
of this present, that her Majestie doth marvail that she heareth nothing of
my moving of the King to assist his brother; it may please your Lordship, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to let her Highness understand, that at the time of my first access (unto the
King) I did very effectually recommend the same in general terms unto him,
and did receive from him assurance that he would have care of his brother, as in
honor and in nature he was bound, thinking at the time of our conference,
when we should enter into the dealing for the secret Treaty, the time would
then have served most aptly to have furthered the same in a more particular
sort, which being stayed, as your Lordship knoweth by a request made by <hi>Du
Uray</hi> in the Duke his Masters name, and being given to understand by good
means, that the King protested, that unless he had been assured that the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
would have taken place, he would never have suffered his brother to have
proceeded so far in the enterprise of the Low-Countries. I thought it out of
time to use any perswasion in furtherance of the assistance to be given to the
said Duke, unless I might have had some Authority to assure him of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                  <p>Besides, If he should have demanded as it is probable he would, what
support her Majesty would have yielded for the good will she professeth to
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:54478:215"/>
bear towards his said brother, I was restrained to put him in any comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
by her Majesties special direction for that, as your Lordship knoweth her
pleasure was, I should make no offer of support unto the Duke, unless I were
assured that the King would not ayd him; as also for that her Majesty did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that if the said King should know that his brother should be supported by
her, he would then forbear to yield any relief.</p>
                  <p>The case then standeth thus, as I was neither able to assure him of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
without the which, as it seemed, he was altogether unwilling to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
himself any way, nor acquaint him with her Majesties determinations to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
his said brother, whereby to have provoked him to have concurred with her
Majesty, being restrained as your Lordship seeth by her Majesty, for the reasons
above mentioned, to make any offer of assistance in her Highnesses behalf. I
hope her Majesty, upon due consideration thereof will rest satisfied: it is a great
grief to any minister that shall be imployed in any matter of that weight, as
those that are committed to any charge to have no certain directions. I would
to God her Highness would resolve one way or other touching the matter of her
marriage, the uncertain course that is now held in that behalf; besides, that it
doth offend the Prince here, and discredit her servants that deal therein, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
being perswaded as they are, that I have more authority then I have, doth mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
unto the Secretaries of forraign Princes matters of discourse, greatly to her
Majesties dishonor, and extreme grief of us here that are acquainted withal, as
that when her Majesty is pressed to marry, then she seemeth to affect a League
and when a League is yielded unto, then she liketh better of a marriage. And
when thereupon she is moved to assent to marriage, then she hath recourse to the
League, when the motion for the League, or any request is made for mony,
then her Majesty returneth to marriage, as these things are delivered out here in
discourse among the said Secretaries; so are they all so conveyed and distributed
into other Conrts through Europe, whereof her enemies will make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to throw her into the hatred of all the world; it shall be therefore most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for your Lordship and the rest of the Councel, whose advice she doth
use in this cause to move her Majesty earnestly to grow to some earnest resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in that behalf, as a thing that doth import her greatly, both in honor and
safety,</p>

                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:54478:216"/>
                  <head>To the Lord Treasurer.</head>
                  <p>MY very good Lord, the contents of your Letter written unto me the 24 of
this present, and received the 26. I conceive to consist principally in the
points following. First, that her Majesties pleasure is, that speedy knowledge
should be given to Monsieur, of the regard her Highness hath of his cause, and
of the support it pleaseth her to yield him, to which points is added the dislike
she conceiveth, that at Mr. <hi>Sommers</hi> being with Monsieur, and understanding
the necessity he stood in, he had no direction to make him a more comfortable
Answer.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, That in the Treaty of a general League offensive, there is no
cause to speak particularly in what quality or sum her Majestie should be contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, That in the secret Treatie, no offer should be made in her Highnesses
behalf, before the particularites of the forces that shall be imployed, and of the
charges (that Mousieur himself, the King and States will be at) be delivered and
set down unto us for Answer, whereunto it may please your Lordship to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that immediately upon the receit of the Letters, as soon as I could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
the messenger, I sent to Monsieur to acquaint him with her Majesties good
meaning towards him, and by what means, and with what expedition it should
be made over unto him, and as touching the dislike for that the Answer unto
the Duke was not more uncomfortable. It may please your Lordship to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
her Majestie, that at the time of the sending of Mr. <hi>Sommers</hi> unto his
Highness, because I could not be throughly informed (according to the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
received from her Majestie) how far the King meant to inlarge himself to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and finding also in all former letters received from thence, I was
willed not to be over forward in promising of assistance, without good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
first had of the Kings intention in that behalf, and being not ignorant what
conceits her Majestie hath taken of my service since my being in these parts.
It made me to deal the more warily in the Commission I gave Mr. <hi>Sommers,</hi> and
yet was it not such (as your Lordship may perceive by the inclosed Copy) but
that the Duke might take comfort thereby.</p>
                  <p>Besides, your Lordship can be a witness with me, how upon the motion made
to me by the Viscount Turaign, touching the necessity the Duke stood in, how
earnestly I dealt for private support to be yielded him, so as if by occasion of
want he should have been constrained to have given over the enterprise, or had
carried it otherwise then her Majestie would, I were not to be charged with.</p>
                  <p>Secondarily, Whereas in a general League offensive, it is thought that there
needeth no particular Contribution to be spoken of. Your Lordship may see by
our last dispatch, that such a motion is already made unto us, and that thing
thought needful, having besides the presidents of all former Leagues offensive,
thought it will be long before the Contributions shall be imployed; yea, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
never. And therefore seeing it is material for their satisfaction, and a matter
of no new president, we could do no less but desire to know her Majesties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
therein, which we hope to receive by the next dispatch.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, For the particularties of the secret Treaty, our opinion is, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
proportion set down, such as her Majestie can be content, were very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and greatly for the furtherance of the service intended, whereby in our
Treatie with them, we might frame our course the better in seeking to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of their several Contributions. For to stay the resolution whereof,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:54478:216"/>
until the certain numbers be set down, wherewith the service of the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
shall be prosecuted (which is a matter very hard, and found by experience,
that it never holdeth in any certainty) will draw the Treaty into an unnecessary
length.</p>
                  <p>Besides, We are perswaded that it will be much more chargeable for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
in case she should capitulate with them to furnish them either with men or
mony, according to such proportions as they shall set down; for that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but grow some variance for the numbers of men, and for the time of service
wherein they shall be imployed; whereby her Majestie shall be driven to
pay for greater numbers, and for longer time of employment, then in Reason
and Equity she ought.</p>
                  <p>And herein experience doth teach us, that in former Leagues of Association,
there hath risen always great controversies about the above named Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.
For the avoiding whereof, it were necessary some certain Contribution
were set down, and without yielding Contribution, it will be but in vain to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into any speech of the League, though for the Reasons contained in your
Lordships letter, it ought not to be great, considering that besides the benefit
that this Crown doth receive to have the King of Spain kept under, they are
like to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eceive some particular benefit otherways, which if it be true, as <hi>Du U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>
informeth me, the same also being confirmed by President <hi>Neve</hi> and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>insey</hi> at my being at La Fere, the benefit is only to redound unto Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
in the state that he is now; for when he shall come to be King of France
(if that (for default of issue in the King) should happen) they of the Low-Countries
have capitulated with him, that they may be at their own choice to
choose their Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>But herein such direction as it shall please her Majesty to giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> us, we will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
putting your Lordship onely in minde, that the longer tract of time it shall
receive, the more subject shall it be to practises: Whereby upon great offers to
be made, they may be drawn to run some other course. And therefore the
more expedition is used, the better success it is likely to take. And as touching
the Argument which her Majesties pleasure is, we should use to induce them to
think that she ought not to be burdened with any great charges touching the
matter of Portugal, considering the Queen mothers pretence, we will not fail
when we shall have to deal therewith, to proceed accordingly, though I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that the said Queens pretence is used but for a colour to justifie such assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
as they shall give, rather then in hope of any benefit they look to receive
thereby, otherwise then that the King of Spains greatness shall be abated. And
so &amp;c.</p>

                  <head>To Master Secretary.</head>
                  <p>SIR, Since the departure of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Currier hence, this is done: Mr.
<hi>Sommers</hi> is ordered to ride to Monsieur, he hath secretly to carry with him
so many pistolets as come to—And there is just as much more to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
which is here hard to be gotten. My Lord of Leicester moved <hi>Palla
Vicine</hi> to procure it by exchange at Paris, which he took upon him; but when
I was curious how he would do it, he answered me, that every Crown would
cost me four pence at the least, and yet he could not so answer it; but for a small
sum; and secondly, for the time, he could not answer me, but that he must pass
it forth to Antwerpe, and then to Paris; he also was moved to ride to Paris him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but the charge thereof must be layed to the former, so as the sum would
be slenderly pinched with such abatements. Hereupon I stayed proceeding
with him, and have for the first half made means here, and have gotten <hi>Paul
Swallore,</hi> Alderman <hi>Martins</hi> man to take charge of packing, the wait is more
then two spare horses can carry, and now I am resolved to divide it into four
portions, and to commit to four the several portions to be carried upon a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
and so they may pass in post, whereas otherwise being charged upon two
horses, they could not ride post with it, I am now to pray you to advertise me
what you can do there, to have the rest paid there, if the like sum shall be paid
here with security by Exchange, and what the charge will be, or else whether you
think the same were not best to be sent in <hi>specie</hi> thither to Monsieur himself,
which I think the best; seeing therein are two inconveniences, danger by sea,
to pass for <hi>La Motts</hi> knowledge, and by Land by false brethren, or Spaignoilists;
for I fear such secresie will not be kept of the next, as I trust hitherto in this. I
have such crooked dealing here with <hi>Lopez,</hi> for that the King urgeth the speedy
delivery of the Jewel without satisfaction for your charge, as I think Mr. <hi>Mills</hi>
will advertise you, the Queens Majestie for her part, is content to stand to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
or to loss, for the 5000. l. From Scotland we hear commonly evil, that
the King shall acknowledge to have by evil counsel of his subjects, usurped the
Crown; and therefore he will resign it to his Mother, and she to grant it back
to be possessed joyntly. We hear also that the Earl of Arraign is fully bent to
make a Band of the Protestant Nobility to the contrary hereof. I think my
Lord of Leicester will write hereof to you, for he hath dealt here in very wisely
by means of <hi>Robert Ashton,</hi> that was my Lady of Lenox servant at this time. I
have paid this bearer <hi>Philips</hi> 20. l. in name of his travel.</p>

                  <head>To the Lord Treasurer.</head>
                  <p>MY very good Lord, Finding by the inclosed, that the Duke desireth
that all expedition may be used in the transportation of the mony, I
thought it very necessary to send away this messenger with all speed,
whom I did imploy in this journey towards him. And therefore found it
expedient to send him unto you, to the end he might make report both of the
state of his Camp, and of the present enterprise he hath in hand.</p>
                  <p>If your Lordship mark the Letter well, you shall finde it written with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great judgement, and in most thankful sort. If this young Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the course he hath begun, there are few or none that promise greater things
in our days then he.</p>
                  <p>The pain he taketh, as this bearer can shew you, is intollerable, and his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
(having to deal with so strange and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nquiet humors as serve under him)
is admirable.</p>
                  <p>It offendeth the better sort here to see such Treasure spent here in preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Masks and other vanities, and this poor Prince forced unless he were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
relieved, to give over an enterprise so many ways profitable to this
Crown.</p>
                  <p>Amongst other things I gave this bearer (in his Instructions) charge to know
the Dukes pleasure, whether I should make the King and his mother privy to
the Loan, and in what sort I should deliver it unto them.</p>
                  <p>In answer whereof, he hath willed him to let me understand, that he referreth
the same to her Majesties best consideration; for mine own particular opinion,
considering that the matter cannot be kept secret, I think it meet they should be
both made acquainted withal, for that it might nourish or rather increase in the
King a jealousie, already conceived of some inward intelligence, not to the best
purpose between her Majesty and the Duke.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it would serve to very good purpose to remove the opinion that
both he and his mother have conceived that her Majesties friendship consisteth
altogether in words, who hitherto hath shewed more friendly and better effects
then they thought both nature and policy ought to lead them, to deal otherwise
then they do. This day I had long speech with Queen mother, both about
tha Portugal causes, as also about our stay of the proceeding in the Treaty, for
the first, I do finde by her that the King will attempt nothing by way of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency
with her Majesty without the marriage, and as for our further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in the Treaty; I also learn by her that he is resolute to stay until he hear
from his Ambassador: hereof I will enlarge unto your Lordship more at length
by the next, the conclusion of her speeches were an earnest recommendation of
the marriage, without the which she said she saw there could be no sound friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
she also renewed her former request touching the support to be yielded to
<hi>Don Anthonio</hi> letting me understand that the four ships were departed from <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
with six hundred men at the least; and therefore prayed me most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to recommend the same to her Majesty.</p>
                  <p>Whereas I perceive by your Letter of the one and twentieth, sent by the
Lady Marquesses brother, that her Majesty is offended, for that she is not more
particularly informed of the state of both Armies; I shall desire your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to be an humble suitor in my behalf unto her Majesty, that it will please
her Highness to conceive better of my service here, then I perceive she doth.
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:54478:218"/>
And as for the fault her Majestie findeth, there lacketh no care in me, nor in the
Ambassador resident here, to seek by all the means we may, to get knowledge,
of the particularities she desireth to be informed of. But we finde here so
great uncertainties, as if we should advertise what we hear, we should revoke
one day what we hear another; and therefore are loath to inform until we can
attain to some certain knowledge of the true state of things, and where her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
conceiveth that we may be informed of the Dukes ministers here, I finde
them not hitherto so throughly instructed, or at the least not willing to impart
their knowledge to us, as I perceive her Majesty is perswaded they are. And
therefore as this bearer can shew you, I have prayed the Duke to give order
that by his Ministers here we may be informed from time to time of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
which he hath promised shall be performed. I am privately given to
understand that our Treaty shall stay any further proceeding until her Majesties
full resolution to the marriage be known. And therefore I pray your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to procure her Majesties direction, in case it fall out so, what course we shall
hold.</p>

                  <p>SIR, I am sorry heartily at this time I cannot procure you any such resolute
Answer as I desire, and know the causes do require; I will not write to you
of the incertainties here, as I take patience here in solliciting, so you must in the
lack of that were meet for you, the Letters that have been writ to you in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
have been altered twice, and yet scantly goe with allowance; but that
her Majesty hath since commanded me to add these things as well to the Letters,
as to the Answers of the two papers for the two Leagues. For the general
League her Majesty will not be bound to any number certain, but will aid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the form of an Article in the Treaty of Cambray, which form she
hath chosen upon this ground: She commanded me to press all the Treaties, I
could, both with the Emperor and French King, and to repeat to her the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of ayds, which I did, and though the greater number contained
with number certain, some at the cost of the Prince invaded, and some, but yet
few, at the costs of the confederate not invaded, with reference to his power,
and with charge of his Conscience; her Majesty very earnestly took hold
thereof, and so she would have you proceed; and though the example I sent you
be out of the Treaty between the Emperor and King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, yet you
shall finde in the Treaties between <hi>H.</hi> the 8. and <hi>Francis</hi> the French King, <hi>Anno</hi>
1525. made by the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and in like manner, you shall finde the like in the Treaty <hi>Anno</hi> 1546. between
<hi>H.</hi> 8. and <hi>Francis</hi> the French King. And so her Majesty being not by us here,
to be perswaded otherwise, you are to accept her Answer as she will have it.
After also that she hath directed an uncertain Answer to the Articles of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
or secret League which I do send you, as I conceived her minde, and as her
self did read them; yet she commanded me to write unto you, that she knew
not why she should be at any certain charge, either for Monsieur or <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio.</hi>
For as for Monsieurs Actions, she would therein give such support as she
should please without coertion.</p>

                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:54478:218"/>
But yet she added this thereto, That if by that her answer she should think
that Monsieur for lack of support should leave his actions in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
she will yield to ayd him, though presently she will not declare to
what quantitie. And for supporting of Don <hi>Anthonio,</hi> she knoweth not why
she should be bound to any certain charge, considering the Queen Mother,
how she hath in other sort favoured Don <hi>Anthonio,</hi> then percase his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
will report. For she did cause such preparations to be made for him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as
amounteth to thirteen thousand pound English (you may turn it in speech to
above forty thousand Crowns, and all this charge lost by lack of good answer
from the King. For his conjunction with her Majestie in this ayd, and that her
Majestie nevertheless did offer to the said Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> the price of any
five of six good ships, but he would not accept them. And in them he had
bought and hired certain ships and barks, to the number of eight, which he
doth now mind to send away; and likewise he himself desireth pass-port for
himself to depart, which her Majestie doth yield unto; and to tell your
self truly, he is solicited hereto by the French Ambassador, I pray God he may
find good dealing there, that he be not sold there away. Her Majestie would
have you to have regard to the defence of her in any thing that may be there
cast abroad on the said Don <hi>Anthonio</hi>'s behalf: So as you must answer for
her Majestie therein, that the lack of the intended voyage hath not grown
by her means, Thus full warily must I yield, for in these unpleasant mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>AFter my hearty commendations: upon the receipt of your Letters of the
26 of August, written from you there joyntly, I did impa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t the same
to her Majestie, and to my Lords of the Councel that are here. And for
that one of the most special matters in your letter concerneth the stay of
your proceeding forward in the Treaty already begun, for a League offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
betwixt her Majestie and the French King, which is alledged on the
Kings part to have grown by report of his Ambassador here in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the King, as is mentioned in your Letters, her Majestie denying,
that she used any speech either with the Ambassador or any other tending to
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:54478:219"/>
that purpose, whereof your letters make mention she thought good to send for
the Ambassador, and to charge him therewith; and so she did yesterday in the
afternoon; whereupon he shewed forth the Copy of his letter to the King,
which also I did see wherein her Majestie findeth no such matter as proceeding by
any speech of hers, to move him to write, as it is reported to you she should: And
so he doth also deny, that he hath written in any like sort to the K. but as I do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his letter, he uttered his own opinion to have Mr. continue constant i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
the matter of marriage, thinking that thereby he might prevail, because in
speeches with her Majestie, he found her very careful of him, and of his estate,
and very sorry that he should adventure his person in such sort, as it appeareth
he shall in the Low-Countreys; and so with many other like speeches of his own
conceit, without affirmation of any such thing to proceed from her Majestie,
as hath been alledged there to you to be written by him, he doth confess that
his own principal desire is to have the marriage take place, but doth not affirm
any thing certain of her Majesties speech delivered unto him, to move him to
give any assurance by his writing to the King, or to Monsieur, neither yet to move
them to despair thereof: And to this end, her Majestie hath required him
to certifie the King how he hath been herewith by her Majestie charged, and
in what sort he hath answered for discharge of her Majestie; so as hereupon
her Majestie hopeth, that the King will give order to his Commissioners to
continue the Treaty begun with you, which her Majestie would have you
earnestly to press forward, as a matter profitable as well for the French King,
and his Countreys, as for her Majestie, and not to interpret the proceeding
therein, to tend to the breaking off the marriage, which you can tell upon
what terms and just causes, her Majestie hath suspended, being therein not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with any direct answer from the French King, to clear the doubts and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
committed to the charge of you Master Secretary, to deliver both to
the French King and Monsieur. Now concerning your several articles sent,
contained in your papers: First, of the general articles propounded: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
of so many as you have already accorded; and, Thirdly, of certain points
not fully answered by you, but reserved until you might receive some further
direction from her Majestie for the same, you shall understand, that all these your
writings have been here perused by such of the Councel as are present, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
thereof here at the Court made to her Majestie, with their several opinions,
which shall most properly appear by marginal notes in every of the same; and
if so be it shall chance, that you cannot obtain of the French King that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
and you her Majesties Commissioners, shall proceed in the Treaty
for a league, as you did begin; and as the French did twice yield thereunto,
that is, at your first coming to him from Monsieur; and secondly, after that,
by <hi>Pynart</hi> for the King, and you Master <hi>Sommers</hi> for her Majesties part, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from Monsieur with his contentation, that the Treaty might pass, so
as nothing thereby might be prejudicial to the cause of the marriage. Then
you may say to the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That your abode there is but superfluous, and more
chargeable for the said King, then serviceable, and therefore you shall desire
him to license you to return, which you may say, will be by such as mislike
of the good amity between her Majestie and the King, be interpreted to the
worst, and will give them more comfort then were convenient at this time.
And if notwithstanding, this allegation and reason yielded, they will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the Treaty, her Majesties pleasure is, that you shall return; and so
also, shall Master <hi>Sommers,</hi> except you your selves see any cause proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for your abode, until you may advertise us, and know our pleasure.
Her Majestie commanded me to write to you, that it is greatly misliked,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:54478:219"/>
is greatly misliked, that you have not more particularly and more earnestly
moved the French King to give supprt to the Duke his brother, in a cause so
honourable for the honour of <hi>France,</hi> and the Crown thereof. And her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
understandeth, that the King himself may think you, as her Majecties Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
careless herein of Monsieurs well doing. And as I have heretofore
written to you hereof, so did I impart to her Majestie your answer that you had
moved to the King at your first coming thither, and of the French Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
But her Majestie thinketh, you might have solicited such a matter, both
more earnestly, and more often. And so now I do notifie unto you her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
opinion at this time, concerning the cause of Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> King of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.
You shall declare either to the French King, or Queen Mother, if they
shall give you any cause to speak thereof, that there hath been no lack nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
in her Majestie, that he hath not been in other sort relieved: For, as your
self knoweth, before your departure it was by us agreed, what support he
should have had of ships, and men, and munition, according to his own desire
and demand. And to that end, great sums of money have been laid out, as
therein you have a part of the burthen, and accordingly the ships and men,
with victual and munition, was ready two moneths past; and as you also know,
it was by the King Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> agreed, that he would not press us to grant
him this support, thereby to provoke the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to some hostility against
our subjects trading in his Countreys, except the French King should joyn
with us in this action, and thereof give us assurance. Whereupon Don <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio</hi>
sent himself a Count of his, and other Messengers, to sollicite the
same to the French King; but so the matter hath fallen out, that we never
could have any perfect answer from the King; whereby we might be assured,
that he would joyn with us in this support. But his Ambassadour here hath said,
that the King his Master especially thanketh us for our courtesies and reliefs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> his Kinsman, and exhorted us to proceed, and he said,
there should be ships of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>France</hi> for his ayd. And in like sort the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
required our Ambassador there, to advertise us the like disposition in her;
but all this time we had no direct answer of assurance, that the King would give
him support. Whereupon, with very great charges, the preparations of the
ships and men in wages, and in expence of victuals, hath continued almost two
whole moneths; and thereby the said Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> hath lost the whole op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of the time of the year, over-slipping the recovery of the good Isle
<hi>Madera,</hi> and of other Isles of the <hi>Azores,</hi> saving <hi>Terceras,</hi> which by Gods
goodness was preserved by the Islanders, and indeed not by any aid of the force
of the French men: For in very deed, at the time of the repulse of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,
which was on St. <hi>Iames</hi> day, there were no French men there, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>An. Scabiny</hi> had been there before, and was gone Westward, as was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to make some profit of the straglers of the Italian fleet; for otherwise,
he was not able to incounter the Fleet it self, nor yet to offer fight with the
Kings Armado, sent under <hi>Pedro de Valdes;</hi> besides this, by this delay, for
lack of good answer from thence, this King <hi>Anthonio</hi> doubteth of the constancy
of a great number of his subjects in Portugal, who secretly hoped upon his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
and so now in the end, though we could have no answer from thence,
whereby her Majestie might be build with assurance of the French Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
to adventure the King of <hi>Spains</hi> offence, yet she did offer to the
King <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nthonio</hi> the service of certain good Vessels, well armed, victualled
and furnished with men and munition largely, to repair now in the latter
end of August. But the King prudently (considering, that the time was
past for this year, to recover any more Isles then he hath already; and that such
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:54478:220"/>
as hold for him could not be by the enmity assailed from henceforth, until the
next year) did not accept our offer, but finding the default of answer from the
French King, to have been the cause of our stay, he meant onely to send away
a few ships which himself had bought and armed here; for the which her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
hath already yielded him a pass-port. When you shall again deal with the
King to have care of his Brother now entred into the Low-Countreys, whose
actions, for the honour of that Crown, are to be maintained; you may shew
him that we think he was not well counselled by such as moved him to yield to
* <hi>Tanis</hi> the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Agent, that 300000 or 400000 Crowns were by
his special license carried from <hi>Lyons</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> which if the King
had stayed but one moneth or twenty days to give license as he did to <hi>Tanis,</hi>
there had manifestly followed in the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Army such a disaster, as
is notoriously known, before the coming of that money; that the said Army
was ready, for want of pay, to have broken, and especially all the Almaignes
had revolted to the service of Monsieur <hi>le Duc,</hi> which by the ayd of that money
was altered, to the disadvantage of the Duke his Brother. And you may say
to the King, that by considering of this, her Majestie doubteth, that there are
some in credit with him, that regard not in their counsels, what should be the
means to stay the greatness of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which causeth her Majestie
to be more doubtful how she shal deal in any action tending to stay the said great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
except she might evidently see some more appearance of the French Kings
determination to the same end, which in this cause of his Brothers actions in the
Low-Countreys, both ought and might best appear by some honourable good
support, to be given to the Duke his Brother.</p>

                  <p>SIR, notwithstanding your later letters of the 28 of <hi>August,</hi> importing many
reasons to move her Majestie to give some better answers in particularities;
yet her Majestie reading them, and being reasoned withal, will admit no other
answer then was directed by the letters written, though not sealed up before your
last. What may further move her Majestie hereafter, I know not, but I see
it common to great and small, not to think of adversity in time of prosperity,
and so adversity cometh with double peril. At this present Don <hi>Ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that you may be satisfied, I agree to it, and so sometimes doth her Majestie;
but in conclusion, he would have the jewel answer for all the losses, which of
the 13000 l. I think will be about 3600 l. whereof 170 l. is desperate imprest,
and wages and victuals spent, the rest falleth out in the resail of the victuals. I
appoint Mr. <hi>Mills</hi> to be in commission about this dissolution and sail, who will
better satisfie you then I can. And so, &amp;c.</p>

three points.</head>

find contained in a treaty betwixt <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, 1522.
in the second Article; the sum whereof is, That if any Prince or other person
should offend the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> in his Person, Dignitie or States, or shall take
any thing from the said Emperour, in that case he shall repute the same offence
or wrong as done to himself, and shall repell the same with all his power, and
shall yield at his own charges aids convenient to withstand the same, and to the
reciprock the Emperour was bound; but for tempering these words which are

rather such an Article of a general resistance, then a particular Covenant for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

until the manner of the Prince Invader be known, and thereby consideration
had what manner of ayd defensive shall be needful to withstand the same invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or to revenge it, the resolution cannot be particularly set down what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
shall be requisite. But if the French Commissioners shall mislike of such
a kind of Article; you may say, the like hath been between <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth
and <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth; and yet if that will not satisfie, it may be further cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted,
That upon notification of the invasion, and of the greatness thereof by

                  <head>TO HER
MAJESTIE.</head>
                  <p>IT may please your most excellent Majestie, The Laws of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
soil, are very severe against those, that condemn a person unheard; but
most sharp against such as judge amiss of those that sit in Princely Chair, as
gods here on earth. To tell your Majestie what others conceive upon the late
stay of our proceedings here (as by the Letter it pleased your Majestie to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to write unto me, it seemeth you conceive) who cannot think that such
effects should grow of naked and weak causes) I hope is not to condemn, when
I either look into your Majesties own Princely judgement, who for your own
Highness-sake, ought to have care to preserve your Ministers credit; or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
mine own duty, which teacheth me not to condemn those that I am bound
to defend, I should then be worthy of the most sharp punishment that either
the Ethiopian or Draco's Laws can yield, if I should wittingly, by wrong sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
grow to so hard a censure, as to think that your Majestie should prefer
in matter of trust, a stranger before a servant, that in loyalty will give place
neither to subject nor stranger. I cannot deny, but I have been infinitely grieved
to see the desire I have had to do your Majestie some acceptable service (in the
present charge committed unto me) so greatly crossed. But I will leave to
touch my particular, though I have as great cause as any man that ever served
in the place, I now unworthily supply, being at home subject to sundry strange
jealousies, and in forreign service, to displeasure, though I dare make the
greatest enemy I have the censurer of mine actions and proceedings in such
forreign actions as have been committed unto me. If either ambition or
riches were the end of my strife, my grief would be the less. But now to
the publique, wherein if any thing shall escape my pen, that may breed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
I most heartily beseech your Majestie to ascribe it to love, which can
never bring forth evil effects, though sometimes it may be subject to sharp
censures. And first, for your Majesties Marriage: if your Majestie mean
to remember, that by the delay your Honours useth therein, you lose the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of time, which (if years be considered) is not the least to be weighed;
if you mean it not, then assure your self it is one of the worst remedies you
can use (howsoever your Majestie conceiveth it, that it may serve your turn)
And as for the league we were in hand withal, if the King would have assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the same should have proceeded in general terms, according to such
direction as we have lately received from your Majestie, I am for sundry causes
led to think, that it would have proved unprofitable; as generally I know that
there is a president to confirm the same; but if in that time a King of Scots, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
a title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> was like by matching with <hi>Spain,</hi>
to have wrought that peril towards your Majesties father, as he is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, he would not then have stood upon generality, as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
doth now. For in diseased bodies, there is not alwaies like use of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines;
sometimes when your Majestie doth behold in what doubtful terms you
stand with Forreign Princes, then you do wish with great affection, that
opportunities offered had not been slipped. But when they are offered to
you (if they be accompanied with charges) they are altogether neglected.
Common experience teacheth, that is as hard in a pollitique body, to prevent
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:54478:222"/>
any mischief without char ges, as in a natural body diseased, to cure the same
without pain. Remember, I humbly beseech your Majestie, the respect of
charges hath lost Scotland; and I would to God I had no cause to think that it
might put your Highness in peril of the loss of England; I see it, and they
stick not to say it, that the only cause that moveth them here, not to weigh
your Majesties friendship, is for that they see your Majestie doth fly charges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
then by doing somewhat underhand: It is strange, considering in what
state your Majestie standeth, that in all the directions that we have now recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
we have special charge not to yield to any thing that may be accompanied
with charges. The general Leagùe must be without any certain charges. The
particular League with a voluntary, and no certain charge, as also, that that is
to be attempted in favour of <hi>Don Anthonio;</hi> the best is, that if they were (as
they are not) inclined to deal in any of these points, then they were like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but small comfort for any thing that we have direction to assent unto.
Heretofore your Majesties predicessors, in matters of peril, did never look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the charges, when their Treasure was neither so great as your Majesties is,
nor Subjects so wealthy, nor so willing to contribute. A person that is diseas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if he look only upon the medicine, without regard of the pain he sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
cannot in reason and nature, but abhor the same; if therefore no peril,
why then it is in vain to be at any charges; but if there be peril, it is hard that
charges should be preferred before peril; I pray God the abatement of the
charges towards that Noble man that hath the custody of the bosom-serpent,
hath not lessened his care in keeping of her. To think that in a man of his
birth and quality, after twelve years travel in charge of such weight, to have an
abatement of allowance, and no recompence otherwise made, should not
work discontentment no man that hath reason, can so judge: and therefore,
to have so special a charge committed to a person discontented, every body
seeth it standeth no way with pollicy, what dangerous effects this loose keeping
hath bred (the taking away of <hi>Morton,</hi> the alienation of the King, and a general
revolt in Religion, intended only by her charges) doth shew. And therefore
nothing being done to help the same, is a manifest argument, that the peril
that is like to grow thereby, is so fatal, as it can no way be prevented. If this
sparing and improvident course be held still, the mischief, approaching being so
apparent as they are, I conclude therefore, having spoken in heat of duty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence to your Majestie, that no one that serveth in place of a Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
that either weigheth his own credit, or carrieth that sound affection to
your Majestie as he ought to do, that would not wish himself in the farthest
part of Ethiopia, rather then enjoy the fairest Palace in England. The Lord
God therefore direct your Majesties heart to take that way of councel that may
be most for your honour and safety.</p>

                  <head>To the Lord Treasurer.</head>
                  <p>MY very good Lord, the day following my conference with Queen Mother,
<hi>La Mot</hi> repaired unto me, sent from her to give me thanks for the speech
I had used towards her the day before, and prayed me that I would further
some good and speedy resolution of the marriage: He did acknowledge in talk
that passed between us touching my Negotiation with the said Queen, that
that point which I touched concerning the employment of Monsieur in the
Low-Countries, for the avoiding of the devision that might grow between
the two brethren, is a matter, that those that wish well unto the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the continuance of the repose of that Realm, had great care of, which was
not the least cause that moved them greatly to desire the marriage, which not
taking place, they saw his employment in the Low-Countries very necessary;
letting me understand, that they found it strange that they heard nothing of

                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> of any intelligence that passed between the Prince of Orange and the Duke,

                     </gap> greatly, to the end that the said Duke might be known of the people
of the Low-Countries, he might be drawn to make his residence at Antwerp,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> some of the inward places of the Countrie. I see it a general opinion among
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> wisest sort here, considering the general evil satisfaction that the people have
of the present government, that it will be very hard to maintain good concord
between the two brethren, in case the Duke should reside here within the
Realm. And it is most assured, that the affection that the Nobility here do
bear to Monsieur (which hath appeared by his late Army, compounded of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntaries,
the same consisting principally of Noblemen and Gentl.) hath great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increased the Kings jealousie towards him, and hath not been the least hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of that support, that otherwise the said King might have been drawn to
have given. The Duke of Guise is of late crept into a very inward credit with
the said King, which ought to move her Majestie to be more carefull of the
matters of Scotland, for that there are daily consultations in the Dukes house,
especially since advertisements are come hither out of Scotland, that the King
doth submit himself to any such direction as his mother shall give him, even so
far forth as the yielding up of the Government to her, if she shall think it meet.
<hi>Douglass</hi> attendeth some answer from her; touching some things that he hath
not long since sent unto her, upon the return whereof they are to grow to a
through resolution for the causes of that Realm: I find confirmed by divers,
that a general hope is conceived of alteration of Religion in that Realm, ere a
year come about, in furtherance whereof, they promise to themselves great
support, both from the Pope and Spain. And yet have we neither power to
provide Scotland, nor to prevent that the greatness of Spain may no way hurt
us; yea, rather such as have been perswaders both in the one and the other, have
reaped, instead of thanks, displeasure.</p>

                  <head>The substance of the Speeches that passed privatly between Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and me the Secretary in her Garden at the Teilliers
the third of August 1581.</head>
                  <p>1. THe principal matters I dealt in with her Majestie in this conference was,
first to shew her whereon the stay of the ships in England, prepared for
Portugal, proceeded.</p>
                  <p>2. The causes that moved her Majestie to conceive that the King was not
so forward now in seeking to prevent the Spanish greatness, as by former over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
he seemed to be.</p>
                  <p>3. That it was strange that the Duke her son dealing in a cause so many waies,
profitable for the Realm, and honourable for himself, should be so coldly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
as he was.</p>
                  <p>4. And lastly, I prayed her that she would be a mean to the King, that we
might proceed in the Treaty, considering the stay thereof grew upon no such
cause as ought to hinder so profitable a matter for both Crowns.</p>
                  <p>For the first, after I had let her understand how willing her Majestie would
have been to have satisfied her request contained in her last Letter delivered by
<hi>Mannesiere,</hi> touching the said preparations; I did acquaint her with the whole
course of the proceeding in that cause, and did shew unto her, that <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio</hi>
had no cause (as it seemed she was informed) to find himself agrieved with
her Majestie, neither for the stay of the ships, nor for any charges that he had
been at about the same; for touching the stay that grew from hence, he had
rather cause to mislike with the King her son, then with the Queen my Mistress,
for that the same aid was promised conditionally, so that the said King would
concur in the action, which he refusing to do otherwise then in a naked sort,
by recommending the same to her Majestie, it appeareth manifestly that the
stay hath grown from hence; and as for the charges, I shewed her, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it was given out that he should sustain 100000<hi>l.</hi> loss at the least, I was well
assured that it would not amount to much above 10000<hi>l.</hi> To this she replyed,
That the King had already made appear unto the world, how ready he was to
assist <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> by sending of 500 men the last year to Vienna, and by
the 500 men sent this Spring to the Isle <hi>Tercera,</hi> and of late by the four ships
dispatched from Burdeaux under Captain <hi>Carlo</hi> to the said Isles, which saith she
doth shew manifestly how willing the King is to assist him, though he would be
loath to enter into any such open action as might tend to the violation of the
Treaties between him and the King of Spain, without he were assured that
the marriage would take place. Thereunto I replyed, that the King might
deal therein with much better colour, and less danger then the Queen my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
for the first, in respect of her pretence to the Crown of Portugal; for
the second, for that the Subjects of this Crown have not so much goods in
Spain, as her Majesties have; besides, they might otherwise be relieved, for
that the King of Spain his Subjects, both Spaniards and Portugals, have great
store of goods here.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding these Arguments, she insisted still upon an earnest request,
that it would please the Queen to be content to suffer the ships to proceed in
their voyage.</p>
                  <p>Then I asked her whether she could assure her Majestie, that if any such
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:54478:224"/>
arrest should happen to the King for the indempnity, for her Subjects would
do the like here, as also otherwise to concur with her in common defence, in
case the King of Spain should attempt any thing against her. For (said I) if
her Majestie without some assurance, should be thrown into Warr with the
King of Spain, and have her Subjects goods arrested, and after should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
unto you of the same, and desire the Kings aide, you might with
good reason answer her, That you did not otherwise recommend the cause
unto her, then by referring to her good judgement, to do therein as might
be without the prejudice of her self, or of her estate; and so concluded with
her, that unless it would please the King by some particular Letter of his, to
assure the Queen, that in case any such inconvenience might happen, he
would repute it done to himself, and jovn with her in common defence, if
any such thing should be attempted against her. Whereunto she answered,
That if the marriage might take place, the King would very willingly assent
thereto, or any other thing her Majestie could desire; but otherwise she
thought he could very hardly be brought to yield thereunto.</p>
                  <p>I did then shew her, that for some difficulties the marriage was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
withall, it was thought meet by the King, the Duke, and her own
assent, that it should be suspended for a time, and in the mean time the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
might be proceeded in, which might yield a mutual assurance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
defence to both Crowns. For (said I) if this mischief which is like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
the Spanish greatness, should not receive present remedy, it may
grow uncurable, and therefore to have it depend upon the marriage, which
in respect of the difficulties, cannot so easily grow to a present resolution. It
seemeth that the proceeding in this case may be compared to a Phisitian, that
being moved to yield some present remedy to a dangerous disease that can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
no delay of time, deferreth the same untill he may receive some druggs
out of India, or some other far part.</p>
                  <p>To this she said, the fault was in her Majestie, for that the matter depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
only upon her assent, all other things being agreed on, the remedy
might easily be put in execution. And so fell into some long speech, both of
the desire she had that the same might take, the great benefits that might grow
thereby, both to her Majesties own Realm and person, as also to all Europe,
and the full assurance that the Duke her son did make (considering how farrforth
her Majestie had proceeded therein) that she would not now frustrate the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
hope that he had received of the effectuating of that he had desired above
any thing in the world. And because (said she) there dependeth so many good
things upon the conclusion thereof, the King my son hath thought good by
his Ambassador, to press her Majestie to some present resolution therein.</p>
                  <p>After I had put her in remembrence of such difficulties as I had laid before
her in former speech, to shew that the marriage could not receive present reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:
I did also let her understand, that it was a thing that was to grow
from above, and had his hour appointed, before the which it could not take
place; and therefore the same being uncertain, might perhaps receive later
resolution then the disease required, and that therefore in the mean time, other
remedies might be well enough proceeded in, which could breed no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the Marriage, and were most necessary, whatsoever become of the
same.</p>
                  <p>Then I proceeded to the second point, shewing that the Queen my Mistriss
did of late note a great coldness in the King touching the overture made for the
impeaching of the King of Spains greatness, and that the Reasons that moved her
so to do, were these. First that the last yeer both her son and she upon the death
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:54478:224"/>
of the late King of Portugal, did declare unto her Majesties Ambassador Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
here, how necessary it was both for themselves and her Majesty, to have an
eye to the King of Spains greatness, and to that purpose did require that the
said Ambassador might have Commission to treat with such as they should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
in that behalf, which being assented unto, and thereupon a conference fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
and overtures made to that purpose, the conclusion was referred to be
treated of by such Commissioners as should be sent by the King from hence
thither, at the time of whose repair, her Majesty did look that there would have
been some proceeding therein, which falling out otherwise, was found very
strange. Secondly, that daintiness that the King did make to concur with her
Majesty in this matter of Portugal, and the sundry impediments that the Duke
hath received in this occasion of the Low Countries, instead of furtherance
(being the principal means to abate the King of Spains greatness) And lastly,
the permission made to the King of Spains Ministers for the passage of certain
money to be conveighed through this Realm to the Prince of Parma: These
things I told her, did give her Majesty just cause to think that the King had no
disposition to break with Spain, in seeking to impeach his greatness, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prayed her she would deal plainly with the Queen my Mistris, letting her
understand what her intention was in that behalf: For said I, the Queen my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
is a Princess that desireth to live in repose, and to maintain good Amity
with the Princes her neighbours, and had not waded so far in this behalf, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the Kings motion. And therefore if the King doth now see no such
danger to grow by the King of Spains greatness, as before it seemed he did, her
Majesty I know would forbear any further dealing in that behalf, who being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with ships for her defence by sea, and her subjects being well armed by
land, and carrying the earnest love and affection towards her, they do in respect
of the happy government they have enjoyed under her Highness, should I doubt
not but be able to withstand the King of Spains malice, in case he should attempt
any thing against her. Besides, I did let her understand, that whereas it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
given out here, that her Majestie was greatly weakned by the alteration in
Scotland, and the taking away of the Earl <hi>Morton,</hi> as also that there were of
her own Realm persons of great quality alienated from her, in respect of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For the first, that divers of those in Scotland, that for some particular
quarrels that they had with <hi>Morton,</hi> were glad to concur with those that sought
to make him away, yet are so affected to the Amity of England in respect of
Religion, as when any thing should be attempted against her Majestie, <hi>Morton</hi>
himself would not have been more ready to oppose himself against any such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
then they will be. And as for the great personages that though I did
assure my self that none of them carried so evil meaning as to attempt any thing
against her Majesty, but rather would be content to hazard their lives as duty
commanded them, yet if they were so evil disposed, the subjects of the Realm
being generally so well affected to her Majesty as they are, and grown to that
judgement now, as they affect not the persons of those great ones, as in former
times they have done, but do rather look into the cause then behold the persons
they should not be able to draw in great numbers after them to the execution of
any undutiful action. To this (after she had heard me attentively) she replyed
that at the time of the conference between the Kings deputies and her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Ambass. Resident, then they did as it were assure themselves that themarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
should take place; no other impediments being then alleadged but the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of this Realm, which by the mediation of the D. were in good way of speedy
composition, and in hope thereof they were willing to have taken any course
that her Majesty should have thought good, and do still continue in the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:54478:225"/>
and minde, so as the same might take place, without the which she said she
did not see how the King her son should be throughly backed, in case he should
enter into any action against the King of Spain, for that there might be many
perswasions and devises used to dissolve such Treaties as should onely consist of
Ink and Paper. And as for the enterprise of Portugal, she said that if the King
of Spain might be kept from the possession of the Isle of <hi>Tercera</hi> (which might
keep him as well from enjoying such benefits as might grow out of the conquest
depending upon the said Crown, as also from the Indies in his own possession)
Portugal would rather be a burthen to him then otherwise. And as for the Dukes
enterprise, she said that the King her son (this Realm being greatly weakned by
civil wars) was loath to enter into a war with the King of Spain, unless he might
be assuredly well backed, which no way they could make account of without
the marriage; whereupon she took occasion to shew that it would be a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
course for the King and the Queens Majesty to seek by way of media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to compound the troubles between the king and his subjects, and the Low-Countries,
whereto if the king should not assent, then might the two Crowns
with more honor concur in the action, by seeking to restore them to their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
whereunto I replyed that the Queen my Mistress had made it apparant to
the world that she had sundry ways sought (when the time served more aptly
then now) to bring it to pass. But for the present, whosoever doth consider to
what extreme degrees of alienation from the King, the said subjects of the
Low Countries are grown unto, having beaten down his Arms, and renounced
his Government, how impossible it is to draw the Prince of Orange any ways
to trust the King, or the King to be reconciled unto him, in respect of a book
written by the said Prince, wherein the Kings honor is greatly touched, shall see
no reason to hope for any reconciliation, and that the Authors of that device
do propound the same but for a delay to serve the King of Spains turn. To
this she replied nothing, and did also let pass the permission given to the King of
Spains Ministers for passing of mony without saying any thing to it, whereon I
forbear to press, for that I was informed that the same was done without her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
to the other points of her reply, I did onely touch two things, the one that
at the time of our Conference between the Ambassadors and the Deputies
there was no mention made of marriage, and so I shewed her that this impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath been found out but of late, the other that I marvel, seeing she her
self did confess that it did greatly import to keep the King of Spain from the
Island of Tercera: that the King her son made so great difficulty in so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a matter, to concur with her Majesty. To the latter point she saith as hath
been alledged before, that the King had already given order for certain ships to
be sent thither, and prayed that her Majesty would be content to do the like.
In which point I concluded, that though I would (according to her request)
move her Majesty in that behalf, yet I did shew her that I did greatly doubt that
her Majesty would hardly be drawn to assent thereto without some letter of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
from the King unto her, as had been before moved. And so leaving the
matter of Portugal, I descended to the third point touching the cold assistance
given to the Duke, letting her understand that I had special charge from her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
from time to time, to recommend both unto the King and unto her his
cause; and therefore being given to understand that notwithstanding the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
motion made on her Majesties behalf unto the King, at my first audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
he was weakly furnished of two principal matters incident to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise
he had in hand, that is of Treasure and martial counsel, I prayed her to
have due consideration both of the person, and of the action; of the person,
for that he was her son, and such a one as was like to yield as great honor as ever
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:54478:225"/>
did childe to mother, and for the action, if the damage were considered, that
the Low-Countries have brought to this Crown, since it was joyned with Spain,
having within the space of 24 years given them two notable overthrows, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
ministred within three yeers time, toward the charges of the war 360000000
florens. It shall then appear that to reduce that Country to yield yeerly
3000000 towards the abating of the pride of him that gave the said overthrows
to remove so potent an enemy from them, and to transport the civil wars into a
forraign Country out of this Realm, that both the action and the Author is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of maintenance; and therefore must needs follow that, if so great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
be neglected, it seemeth that there hangeth some secret judgement of God
over this Crown, I did also put her in remembrance how happily this forrein
imployment of the Duke her son did fall out, to put by a thing that might have
proved no less grievous to her Majesty, then dangerous to the Realm, and that
was the division that might fall out between her two sons, a matter that hardly
would have been avoided if either he should live in the Court or out of the
Court within this Realm, considering that this said Realm in respect of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
troubles, is full of persons discontented, and also of such as have no other
virtue to get credit, then by breeding of dissentions, and though for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it was known that there was good liking between the two Princes in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance, yet it is evidently known unto the world, that the King here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
hath stood in some jealousie of him, which sparks being not throughly
extinguished by evil disposed persons, might easily kindle again. With this speech
she seemed to be greatly moved, and letting me understand that she had care
thereof, and did what she might to procure him that support that was necessary,
acknowledging the enterprise to be both honorable and profitable. But (said
she) the King without the assurance of the marriage will not be drawn into any
open breach with the King of Spain, which he should hardly avoid if he should
assist his brother in such sort as was meet: she did also in a sort acknowledge that
though heretofore there had been some jealousie between her two sons, yet now
there was great good-will and love between them, notwithstanding that by
some evil instruments there might be some disunion bred between them, she did
for the avoiding thereof amongst other respects, greatly wish that the marriage
might take place, In the end of my speech I did lay before her such Reasons as
might induce her to use some mediation towards the King, for the removing of
the impediment of our Treaty, for that the same could no way prejudice the
marriage, whereunto she answered, that the King was resolved touching the
continuance of the stay until such time as he might hear from his Ambassador.
This in effect was that which past between us</p>

                  <head>To the Lord Treasurer.</head>
                  <p>MY very good Lord, I received by the last Messenger, two Letters from
your Lordship, the one of the last of August, and the other of the second of
this present: For the first, I am very sorry that the King of Portugal is so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grieved as he is, and yet if the answer made of the conference by those that
were appointed to deal with <hi>Don Diego de Rotelia,</hi> and <hi>Don Emanuel de Silva,</hi>
be by him well remembred, he hath more cause to blame France, then he Q.
Majestie, being at that time resolved that the preparation should not go forward
unless the French King would concur, as also, that he himself should bear such
loss as should fall out through the said preparation. And whereas he findeth
himself grieved, for that his loss falleth out to be greater then he looked for
(whereof the greatest part of the blame is laid upon me) surely no man is so
much to be charged therewith as Doctor Lopes, who sundry times in the Kings
name, desired me that the preparations might be greater then was first agreed
upon for that the King doubted that those forces would not be sufficient. And
for the defraying of the charges, he did assure me, that the King did mean to
procure some money out of the Low-Countries upon Jewels. Seeing then
that this encrease of charges grew upon the Kings own motion, he cannot in
reason be offended either with her Majestie, nor with any of those that have
been dealers in the same; notwithstanding, it were a very Princely part (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
into what a perplexed estate the poor Prince is thrown) for her Majestie
to take upon her the discharge of the loss that is sustained in the said preparations,
whose estate I do not think yet so desperate, but that God will one day raise
him up again to pluck down the pride of him who is the sworn enemy both to
God and her Majestie; I do utterly mislike of his repair hither, seeing no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that should move him to attempt the same, considering how he hath been
dealt withall, especially upon the Kings denial to write his Letters to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
if my first advice touching his repair into the Low-Countries had been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
both the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sles of the Asores had been preserved, and also the East and
West Indian Fleet defeated. This day there is come advertisement out of Spain
that the Fleet is arrived from the Moluccaes, who besides the bringing of great
quantity of Treasure, have brought advertisements that the said Islanders have
yielded to the Kings obedience, I am very glad that the poor Prince resteth so
well satisfied of my dealing towards him, for I was in doubt that the Count <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>so,</hi>
who is a very vain man, had sought to cause him to conceive otherwise of
me then I deserved; notwithstanding that it is apparent to all the world, that
the stay for the preparations for the Islands, hath grown from hence (no man
being better acquainted with all then himself) yet doth he blame her Majestie,
being carried away with a vain hope that the King here is greatly disposed to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
his Majestie when he shall repair thither, which in the end will prove bnt
an abuse, and I pray God it be not with the peril of his person.</p>

                  <p>MY very good Lord, by the general Letter your Lordship may perceive
what resolution the King is grown unto touching the Treatie; which
(considering the naked direction we received, in case the Treatie had held) fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
out very well. Surely, unless her Majestie shall hereafter be better inclined
to prefer safetie before charges, it shall be but in vain for her to have any deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with forreign Princes; and I would to God her Majestie had no need of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
assistance: Notwithstanding, I see she is not disposed to redeem her peril
otherwise then necessity shall lead her (who is one of the most dangerous Pilots
that can take the helm in hand, for where necessity ruleth, election and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
can take no place) and though dealing underhand heretofore hath accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(in respect of the weakness of the Princes her neighbours) continued her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
in a peaceable kind of Government: yet now that <hi>Scotland</hi> is aliened from
her Highness, and the King well near of years fit to match with the daughter of
some Prince (that may stand with him for his pretended title) her Majestie is
to look for another kind of reckoning. That house that is most affected here
to the said King, and doth above others imbrace his cause, never carryed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
sway then it doth presently, upon such causes as I will open to her Majestie
and your Lordship at my return. I hope to depart hence on Thursday next, and
in the way to visit the Duke <hi>de Anjou</hi> with whom I think meet besides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
dutie, in respect of the good will he beareth to her Majestie, to confer,
before my departure out of this Realm. And therefore being doubtful where
to find him, and how long he will stay me, I cannot certainly let your Lordship
understand at what time I shall return to the Court there.</p>

                  <p>IT may please your Lordship to understand, that on Sunday the tenth of this
moneth we had audience of the King, where I the Secretary did remember
unto him, how far we and his Deputies had proceeded in the Treatie of the
League defensive and offensive by his consent: where, by means of letters from
his Ambassador in <hi>England</hi> the same was broken off, for such causes (as it was
said) as he had written; whereof her Majestie being advertised from us, and
she having conferred thereupon with the said Ambassador, found by the Copy
of his Letters (which he shewed for his excuse) that the same was not in such
terms as had been reported to have come from him, as we thought his Majestie
had been advertised from his said Ambassador by his last dispatch: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her Majestie had given us in charge to pray his Highness in her name, that
we might proceed with his Ministers in the treaty of that League, being so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for both Realms, for the causes which his Majestie had heretofore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.
The King answered with long speeches, how much he desired her
Majesties amity, and especially to see the effect of this marriage, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be shortned of six years of his life: and how happy he would think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
if it might please her Majestie to think his brother worthy of that favour
therein: The great good which such a conjunction would bring to both Realms:
and further in effect, the like speeches of affection as he had used before time:
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:54478:227"/>
and in this matter continuing still upon the point of the marriage, as the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
bond of amitie of all other. And as for a league, he said, there was a
already a league defensive between them, which he was content to enlarge for
the more assurance of his good will in any thing that might be found to lack, or
were meet to be added thereto: But as for a league offensive, he did alwaies
wish and mean that it might go with the marriage. Thereunto in answer divers
reasons were used to move him to proceed to the Treaty begun; and among
other that there was, none so strong a bond as that which was grounded upon
necessity, and that the cause of the necessity thereof at this time was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to him, that by the concluding of such leagues, the marriage was not put
back; that the great benefit that this Realm was like to receive by it was not
small, by assuring a Countrey unto it, where, and by the help whereof, this
Realm had taken great loss of late years, by two overthrows in the King his
fathers time, letting him also understand, that her Majestie (seeing the Duke
in an enterprize so profitable for this Realm, and honourable for himself, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of assistance to receive rather overthwarts and impediments) had just cause
to confirm her opinion touching the difficulty propounded, for the stay in not
proceeding in the marriage; for seeing that if the same had proceeded, the
greatest burthen of the war must have lighted on her self, the ability of the
Duke and of the Sates being not such as was able to encounter the forces of so
puissant a Prince as the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> And therefore seeing his Majestie upon
answer from his brother, had consented that such league should be treated
upon, without speaking of the Marriage; and Deputies appointed by him, the
same well begun, and some particularities for a league offensive agreed upon;
her Majestie and all the world may find this alteration now to be very strange.
Hereunto, after he had used many speeches of the former substance, in general
terms, without answering any particularities, offering himself and all his means to
be at her Majesties devotion whose good will he sought with his soul and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
he concluded, that there was no such surety in a league offensive, as
there was in the marriage; which proceeding, all should be as her Majestie
pleased; and that if he had been otherwise understood, either he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
his mind so clearly as he did mean; or else his meaning was mistaken of us,
and of his Deputies; for that he did never mean but that the league offence
and the Marriage should go together, and not otherwise. Having heard this
his Majesties conclusion, and repeated it unto him, I the Secretary said, That
seeing his Majestie was so resolved, her Highness had in that case commanded
me to return home my service, being more needful there then here, for causes
which I remembred unto him; and that he might think himself of some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it time
to treat further of these matters, praying his Majestie to appoint when I might
receive his commandments to her Majestie, and to take my leave. He said,
he would gladly have us at this marriage of the Duke of <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> the eighteenth
of this moneth; but seeing her Majestie had commanded me to return, it
should be when I would, using many speeches full of affection to her Majestie,
to be uttered at my return to her Highness. Then we went to the Queen
Mother, and rehearsed unto her what had passed by the King: Whereunto
she used in substance the like speeches the King had done; adding more plainly,
that they feared such a league being made defensive and offensive, the marriage
would be clean broken, with divers other speeches, wherewith I think not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to trouble her Majestie, until my return. At this time I the Secretary pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Queen Mother to think well of these matters, being of such importance
against the time, that I should come to take my leave of the King and her, and
so for that time we departed. And for that we might doubt of some alteration,
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:54478:227"/>
we did forbear to send away this Corrier, until we had taken our leave, which
was upon Thursday the twelfth of this present; at which time there passed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from the King and Queen Mother but ordinary complements, and specially
recommending the Marriage.</p>
