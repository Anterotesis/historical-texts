            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing lately in Antwerpe,
it was my fortune to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke
an old printed Booke
in prose, which I haue tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into Verse, of the life,
death &amp; buriall of our blessed Lady: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I read many things worthy of obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and many things friuolous and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent;
out of the which I haue (like a Bee)
suck't the sacred hony of the best authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Scriptures, and Fathers which I
best credited, and I haue left the poyson
<pb facs="tcp:3650:5"/>
of Antichristianisme to those where I
found it (whose stomackes can better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
it,) I put it to the Presse, presuming
it shall be accepted of pious Protestants
and charitable Catholikes; as for luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme
Neutralists that are neyther hot
nor cold, they doe offend my appetite, and
therefore vp with them. The schismaticall
Separatist, I haue many times discoursed
with him, and though he be but a Botcher
or a Button-maker, and at the most, a
lumpe of opinionated ignorance, yet hee
<pb facs="tcp:3650:5"/>
will seeme to wring the Scriptures to his
opinions, and presume to know more of the
mysteries of Religion, then any of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend
learned Bishops and Doctors.</p>
            <p>I know this worke will be vnrelished in
the pestiferous pallates of the dogmaticall
Amsterdammatists; but I do, must, and will
acknowledge a most reuerend honor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
vnto the sacred memory of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
virgin Lady, Mother of our Lord and
Redeemer Iesus; and in my thoughts she
shall euer haue superlatiue respect aboue all
<pb facs="tcp:3650:6"/>
Angels, Principalities, Patriarkes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Apostles, Euangelists or Saints what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soeuer,
vnder the blessed Trinity; yet
(mistake me not) as there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Immortall Creator, and a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
creature, so (whilst I haue warrant
sufficient from God himselfe, to inuocate
his Name onely) I will not giue man, Saint,
or Angell any honour that may be deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to his eternall Maiestie.</p>
            <p>As amongst Women she was blest aboue
all, being aboue all full of Grace, so amongst
<pb facs="tcp:3650:6"/>
Saints I beleeue she is supreame in Glory:
and it is an infallible truth, that as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists
doe dishonour her much by their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
honourable seeming attributes;
so on the other part, it is hellish and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to God and good men, either to forget
her, or (which is worse) to remember her
with impure thoughts, or vnbeseeming
speech for the excellency of so deuine a
Creature. I confesse my selfe the meanest
of men, and most vnworthy of all to write
of her that was the best of Women, but my
<pb facs="tcp:3650:7"/>
hope is, that Charity will couer my faults,
and accept of my good meaning, especially
hauing endeuoured and striuen to doe my
best: So wishing all hearts to giue this holy
Virgin such honour as may be pleasing to
God; which is, that all should patterne
their liues to her lifes example, in lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and humility, and then they shall be
exalted where shee is in Glory, with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

            <l>But as her Sonnes death made her woes abound,</l>
            <l>His Resurrection all griefe did confound:</l>

            <l>She found him rich, most glorious to behold:</l>
            <l>She lost him when vpon his backe was hurld,</l>
            <l>The burthen of the sinnes of all the world:</l>

            <l>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> did out liue th'Apostles euery one,</l>
