            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the best ministers and people, untill their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses come off handsomly, which is the finall cause of making this book of Canons, which lucky book hath been gainfull to Prelatists as ever Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory was to the popes Kitchin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The new book of Canons which for want of wit and skill in the makers (who were some of them no better then doults) were made cleane Kam contrary to expectation, and something too boisterous and violent, so that at the first shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off they recoiled upon the authors and knockt down their makers, and being neither made of bell mettall nor <hi>Parliament</hi> proofe they burst in the discharging being over charged with Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise pouder amunition shot and leaden <hi>et cetrae</hi> whereby their mettall is marred so that it is held but vain for the Convocation to mould or cast them anew: yet they are worth their weight of browne paper at any time for Grocers, Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Tobacco-shops, and Physitians; for such patients as have laxes and trotting agues going often to thee stool; if they have but a new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non in their hand they may come off more cleanly then the Convocation did who marred them in the making:</p>
            <p n="4">4. The new Canon Oath, or Oath for Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which Oath was intended for many singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uses as the sinfull sinod knew very well; as, 1. To sweare up the Bishops though the divell himself cannot do it. 2. To sweare down all the honest ministers in England who for refusing this periurious Oath should presently be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60206:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their livings though their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were beggerd, so that there might be great store of church livings void whereby his little Grace &amp; the rest of the reverend Fathers might have choice for their chaplains and preferre their mad kindred crackt Chambermaids light kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women and younger brother (as Oxford petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) &amp; might put in such idoll shepherds dumb doggs and <hi>Baal</hi> Priests as should be sworn slaves to the Prelates and they to forswear and periure all the fatbelly Prelatists who should take this Oath and must swear to take it willingly (though no man in the world would not rather be free then bound) so that they being become odious to God and good men might stick faster to the Bishops on whom they depend both for bodies soules and estates, but this Oath being now ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered by some criticall fellows of the Temple who have proved wiser then the sinod it will hardly be valied as it might have beene.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A numberles number of many hundred thousand weight and an infinite multitude of yards and ells of length and breadth and many millions of fathoms deep of an <hi>et cetra,</hi> a most precious thing in the Canon oath a thing of so great weight, worth, length, breadth deepnesse, thicknesse and bulke, that it is beyond all exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions dimensions so that the goodly wise fathers of the late more than holy sinod (though they put it in with both hands) yet all those mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous wise and hugely tearned men themselves never knew either the quantity, quality, value,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60206:4"/>
worth or weight of this, <hi>et cetera,</hi> it may be said of this; that <hi>Datur processus in infinitum,</hi> it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in <hi>semper divisibilia</hi> &amp; expounded in <hi>semper exponenda,</hi> they and their successors might from time to time and at all times make of it what they would so that if the Bishops should lose theier Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks and all but this, this alone were riches enough for them and theirs for ever, and tis pitty but that they should take them this and be pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A most rare and super excellent thing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the oath <hi>Ex Officio</hi> or the Beneficiall oath, for never was auricular confession so usefull and gainfull to the iugling priests of Rome as this hath bin to Prelates, for that did but onely make woman and people to confesse their relapses and maids their backslidings: and onely touched deeds done and the Priests would pardon them but this Oath makes men to confesse their thoughts, for which sometimes the Bishop will make them pay deare, and if at any time either the Bishop or any of his shavelings have not their bags crammed by Church Wardens present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Parrators information, then they send for some minister of honest man whom they know to be not so desperatly wicked, as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious maintainers, &amp; tender him this oath, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if he refuse, to prison he goes if he were as good as <hi>George a Greene,</hi> and if he take it, he must either forswear and damme himself as the Bishop doth, or else betray himself and confesse his most pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate matters, words, &amp; the very thoughts of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60206:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heart which he poore man chooseth rather to do, and so puts himself in the mouth of the wolfe, than to periure and damme himself, and to go to hell with Bishops, where upon he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessing, the Bishop suspends, exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municates, deprives, degrades, imprisons or punisheth the poor man at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, then he being in this wofull case will be very glad to speake with some of the Bishops Officers, who will shew him so much friendly honesty as to take a great bribe to speak a small word for him, and so perhaps meets with the man who for that purpose first caused him to be questioned and so he seeing his friend, and the Bishop feeling his mans pulses, gives the poore man some releasement, though he will not quite discharge him, but that his servants may at other times have some feeling of him, and thus this Oath <hi>Ex Officio</hi> hath formerly been wondrous beneficiall though now it grow something old and rotten, and begins to stink and putrefie, yet it will passe currant in some countreys, as <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and some part of <hi>France,</hi> but by all meanes carry it not into <hi>Scotland,</hi> for they be such resolute fellows they will put it in a poke mantle and hang it on blind <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> Nagge and send it packing to <hi>Rome</hi> where is no neede of it because there is already great plenty of this and many such like.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A Most profitable and gainfull piece of Prelaticall policy, to wit, the rubrick of the Liturgie or Service, for the most wise and politick prelates, knowing that men are of divers mindes and dispositions, have so framed the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the service book that it is improbable that all men should like of it, and almost impossible, that all man should follow it so strickly as the Bishops inioyn it, and among some good things, taken out of the Bible, they have min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled some bad things taken out of the Masse book, and then if any honest minister do but omit by oversight some
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60206:5"/>
things least necessary, or passe by other, some things most offensive or leave out any thing which is most fabulous, he is to be had before the Bishop either by the Church Warden, who are sworne to present him, or by the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors or some such like who are ready to informe against him and the Bishop (who taketh himself to be the Lord of the church) perceiving him to be a man of some great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science (which is an odious thing to some Bishop to have some care to discharge his duty uprightly, he hates him and persecutes him and brands him with the nicknames of Puritan Brownist scismaticke and precise fellow, and never leaves him till he either make him forsake all conscience and honesty, or else his living and country and such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as these there have been many thousands so that this is an excellent and gainfull rubrick to the Bishops Officers who while these things are in agitation have many a good feeling, whom here I leave to feele the justice of our happy <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Certaine things of great antiquity and almost as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the subtilty of the Serpent; so wit Ceremonies, which though it might be thought that Bishops might spare them without preiudice to themselves, yet those po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Prelates (for what reason themselves know best) hold that no Ceremony, no Bishop, and they are so little in their defence, that before they will loose one corner of a cap, theyle throw the whole Miter off for it, or one end of a Crosse, theyle breake all the crosier to shivers, or one sleeve of a Surplice, theyle burne their Lawne sleeves, and 'tis pitty but that Bishops and Ceremonies should both be sent packing to <hi>Rome</hi> the place of their originall.</p>
