            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

policy, to <hi>deceive</hi> by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; thus was <hi>Caesar</hi> deceived by his friends <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> who murthered him in the Senate-house! So <hi>Alexander</hi> was deceived by his kinsman, and deare friend (as hee thought) <hi>Antipater,</hi> who poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him in the midst of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes at <hi>Babylon: Adulator Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio est, qui palpando incedit, sed cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da ferit,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Super E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek lib. 1. cap. 9.</note> saith Saint <hi>Gregory;</hi> and if a man doe beleeve this <hi>Scorpion,</hi> the <hi>flatterer,</hi> he shall finde his <hi>tayle,</hi> that is, his end, intent, and purpose, to be <hi>death</hi> and confusion:</p>

            <p>This flatterer deales with a man as the Fox doth vvith the birds, faines himselfe dead, that hee may the more easily catch them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure them; and the flatterer faines himselfe harmelesse, honest, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, that hee may the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17857:44"/>
deceive the hearts of the simple. Thus <hi>Ioab</hi> dealt with <hi>Abner,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. And thus doth this flattering But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher claw a man like an Oxe, that hee may the more easily knock him on the head: I can but vse this prayer either for them or against them; <hi>Aut convertantur, ne pereant, aut confundantur, ne noceant;</hi> Lord, convert them lest they perish, or of thy justice confound them, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others to perish.</p>
            <p>The second ayme at a mans goods, and they are covetous <hi>flatterers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Envie moves the first, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse this. The goods of man is that good which hee aymes at; hee will most love that man, whose purse hee hath at command; and what is it that a man will not doe for gaine; <hi>Committitur cades lucri gratia, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantur templa, violatur amicitia, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des negligitur, patria proditur, omnia mala patrantur;</hi> Money (wee say) makes the man, but money <hi>makes

the flatterer marre the man:</hi> for to get a little gaine, <hi>murthers</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; friendship violated, and all evill by it committed This hath beene fully handled in the booke, I leave it and come to the last, who aymes at a mans <hi>good-name,</hi> and hee is a</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tale-bearer:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is a detractour likewise; who carries two tongues in his head, one to <hi>licke, another to bite;</hi> one to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a man to his <hi>face,</hi> another to slander him behinde his <hi>backe;</hi> hee is one that to please some, will back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite and detract from others. The flatterer that gives his neighbour an ill name, is halse a <hi>hangman;</hi> who with the sharp razour of his tongue doth cut his <hi>throat, Cum actum est de nomine, actum est de homine:</hi> Hee that hath an ill name, is halfe-haa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; the tongue is a dangerous

thing if ill vsed, though it cannot <hi>prevaile</hi> alwayes <hi>ad interitum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> yet it will <hi>ad interitum nominis;</hi> if it cannot <hi>murther,</hi> yet it will <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure;</hi> the <hi>head</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> was cut off with the foote of a vvoman; and a mans good name divers times is cut off by the <hi>tongue</hi> of a <hi>man:</hi> these flatterers are such as do <hi>famam ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famia comparare;</hi> climbe to merit praise by the <hi>stayres</hi> of others <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</hi> These are the fire-brands of the devill; if thou hearkens to them they will burne thee in thine eare; or if thou hearkenest to them, thou hast a devill in thine <hi>care</hi> as <hi>they</hi> in their <hi>tongues.</hi> I have done with the object of <hi>Flattery,</hi> I come at last to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Signes of a Flatterer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first signe is, <hi>to praise a man</hi> (though absent) beyond his <hi>deserts;</hi> so saith <hi>Aquinas, Adulator supra debitum virtutis modum verbis homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem delectare studet.</hi> A <hi>flatterer</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:17857:46"/>
doth seeke to delight a man by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing others beyond their merits.</p>
            <p>The second signe is, <hi>to praise a man to his face;</hi> for this is but to puffe a man vp with pride and selfe-conceit: for (saith one) it is an easie thing to make men beleeve they be better then they be; but you may flatter some vvomen beyond the knowledge of themselues. Wee ought not to be proud of the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers praise, for anothers dispraise can soone blemish it; but anothers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thee concernes thee not so much as thine of thy selfe, in which thou shouldst not be partiall.</p>
            <p>The third signe is, if, vpon small distasts slacks his acquaintance, then he was not a friend, but a flatterer; for a good Bow is not easily broken, vnlesse it be extreamly overdrawne, nor a well grounded affection ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied with the smallest distasts.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last signe, hee is a <hi>tale-bearer,</hi> if he doth backbite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17857:46"/>
and tell thee long tales to the disgrace of another, hee is a flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, for be sure hee spares not to doe the like of thee to another: this is confirmed, <hi>Pro.</hi> 18. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. 22. <hi>Psal.</hi> 41. 6. Hee hath a devided tongue, of two humours like <hi>Ptolomies</hi> man, or as of two colours, <hi>white</hi> and <hi>blacke, white</hi> with a complementall courtesie to thy face, and <hi>blacke</hi> with a defaming iniury behind thy back; hee vses his <hi>tongue</hi> as <hi>Ioab</hi> did his <hi>hand,</hi> hee <hi>salutes and stabs the same man with the same tongue:</hi> beleeve him not, for he will deceive thee.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ript open the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-<hi>Fox,</hi> I hope you may now partly know him, and knowing him avoid him, for there is no <hi>truth</hi> but <hi>deceit</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>(thou flatterer)</hi> I speake to thee, repent of thy sinnes, which by flatteries meanes doe accompany thee; lying, covetousnesse, deceit, malice, ambition, hypocrsie, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17857:47"/>
what not; <hi>Panaces</hi> the hearbe was good for all diseases: so this hearbe Repentance applied to thy heart, is good for these and all other thy <hi>foule</hi> and <hi>soule-diseases: repent</hi> that God may forgive thee; <hi>repent</hi> of all or else of none; for God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thee all, or none.</p>
