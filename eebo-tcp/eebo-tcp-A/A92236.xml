            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS FOR THE Earl of Maclesfeld's <hi>Bill in Parliament,</hi> For Diſſolving the Marriage between Him and his Wife, and Illegitimating her Spurious Iſſue.</head>
            <p>THE Bill by way of Petition, according to the uſual Form in like Caſes, recites the Lady's notorious open Adultery, having had Children begotten on her Body in Adultery, and uſing vile Practices to have her ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Iſſue impoſed and obtruded upon him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it enacts and adjudges, That the Bond of Marriage being noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and ſcandalouſly violated by her Adultery, be from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth diſſolved, annulled, vacated, and made void.</p>
            <p>That it be lawful for the Earl to Marry again; and that the Wife and Children of any other Marriage ſhall enjoy all advantages as if he had never been Married to this Lady, or that ſhe had no Iſſue.</p>
            <p>It illegitimates and diſinherits the Iſſue begotten, or to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten on her Body; and enacts, that all the Eſtate of the Earl, and of his Father, ſhall be in the ſame plight and condition, and Perſons inheritable to it, as if ſhe had no Child.</p>
            <p>Preſerves the Settlement of the Eſtate, which moved from the Earl's Father, in all the Limitations other than to her and her Iſſue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:150194:2"/>As to the Eſtate which came from her Father, gives her what ſhe has by the Settlement in <hi>Biſhops-Caſtle</hi> during the Earl's Life, or after his Death, ſo that it extend not beyond her own Life. As to <hi>Sutton,</hi> preſerves all the intereſt after the Earl's Death without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Biſhop's Caſtle</hi> Eſtate, it is to be conſidered, that this which was valued at 10000 <hi>l.</hi> with 2000 paid, was to be as a Marriage Portion, and therefore was ſetled in the Earl's Family, with the Remainder to his right Heirs: indeed ſhe has her Life in it by way of Joynture; but as Joynture comes in lieu of Dower, according to the Reaſon of the Common-Law, ſhe ought not to have ſo much as her Life in it; for Dower is forfeited by Adultery, and this may be pleaded by the Heir, though never proved in any Court during the Father's Life: agreeably to which, even <hi>Doctors-Commons</hi> takes away Alimony after Proof of Adultery.</p>
            <p>But ſurely there can be no colour that her Adultery, and the juſt conſequent of that, ſhould deprive the Earl's Brother of what he claims in remainder by the Settlement.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Maclesfeld</hi>'s Bill having been Read in the Houſe of Lords, and Leave given for him to make good the Allegations of his Bill, ſhe has petitioned to be Heard againſt their Lordſhips hearing his Proofs, upon the ſuggeſtion, That the ſame matters are contained in his Libel in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and that they are properly determinable there. Upon which, theſe Particulars are humbly ſubmitted to the Conſideration of their Lordſhips.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That an Order was made in a full Houſe, for admitting his Lordſhip to make out his Allegations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Pendency of a Suit in <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> can be no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Proceedings in Parliament; unleſs they were judicially by way of Original Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If this came by way of Appeal from <hi>Doctors Commons</hi> before Sentence, then it might be Objected, That it is of the Nature of an Original Cauſe: But if either Party were aggrieved by Sentence in <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> it has been held, that no Appeal in Parliament will lye, but that the Final Judgment is with Commiſſioners appointed by the King or Chancellor: which makes it evident, that if the Parliament cannot relieve by the Legiſlative Power, it's certain it cannot judicially; and therefore according to the inference from its being as Eccleſiaſtical Cauſe, there can be no Relief.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Matter is not wholly of Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance, for only the Parliament can illegitimate the Iſſue.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Earl is in reaſon to be thought to ſtand better for relief in Parliament than if he had never proceeded in <hi>Doctors Commons;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gone through all the tedious Methods of that Court, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Lady's Adultery; where Publication has paſſed, and as many of his Witneſſes have been croſs-examin'd, as ſhe has thought fit.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:150194:2"/>6. Nothing could have hindred a Sentence, but ſuch groſs delays, as argue her Guilt; nor ought her own Fault to ſerve her for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A Sentence in <hi>Doctors Commons</hi> cannot add to the clearneſs of the Proofs, or credibility of the Witneſſes; which ſhe has declined examining to.</p>
            <p n="8">8. She has declared, That ſhe would uſe delays on purpoſe to keep him from remedy in Parliament; and her Agents have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, They would keep the Cauſe Three years in <hi>Doctors Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. If either Party ſhould dye before this Cauſe were determined, no Sentence could be obtained in <hi>Doctors Commons;</hi> and it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered whether it would not be much more difficult to have relief in Parliament againſt her ſpurious Iſſue, if ſhe were not alive to make her defence.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Earl has Proof to produce before the Lords, which was not within his Allegations at <hi>Doctors Commons;</hi> and that of ſuch a nature, as may ſhew, that ſpeedy Relief in Parliament is neceſſary for his ſafety, and the preſervation of his Family.</p>
            <p n="11">11. She has manifeſtly waved thoſe opportunities for clearing her ſelf, which are the only ground why in the caſe of Adultery, after a Separation from Bed and Board, choſen by either ſide, the Innocent Party ſhould proceed in the Spiritual Court.</p>
            <p n="12">12. She has had ſeveral long days given her to plead any matter to clear her ſelf, and is at laſt juſtly denied to have any farther day: from which 'tis probable ſhe will Appeal to ſpin out the time; and however, may, according to the methods of <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> keep the Cauſe there ſeveral years, upon thoſe frivolous Allegations which ſhe has put in.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The <hi>Popiſh</hi> Canons ſtill prevailing in that Court, nothing but the Legiſlative Power can give the Remedy allowed by the Divine Law, which permits Second Marriages; whereas the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Canons allow of no farther Separation than has been between theſe Parties for ſeveral years.</p>
            <p n="14">14. If want of Sentence in the Spiritual Court has been Objected in any other Caſe, the Fact has not been proved in that Court, and Publication of the Proofs paſſed. Beſides, there has been no proof of Children offered in Parliament; and either the proof of the Fact has been doubtful, or there has been Cohabitation, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, after the Innocent Party has had notice of the Fact.</p>
            <p n="15">15. A Sentence in <hi>Doctors Commons</hi> is not final, or certain, but ſubject to an Appeal before the Delegates; and in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Banbury,</hi> the Delegates ſet aſide a Marriage which the Court of the <hi>Arches</hi> held good.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The Legiſlative Power is not in its own nature confineable to any Eccleſiaſtical Rules or Laws, and has ſet ſeveral good Preſidents of breaking through them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:150194:3"/>The Deprivation of Biſhops is of Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance, their Inſtitution held as Sacred as Matrimony; and yet in <hi>Popiſh</hi> times Biſhops have been Deprived by Act of Parliament, without Sentence in any Eccleſiaſtical Court, and for matters for which they were not depriveable by any Eccleſiaſtical Law. And ſince the Reformation, deprivations in the Spiritual Courts have been confirmed by Act of Parliament, notwithſtanding the Pendency of Appeals.</p>
            <p>The Legiſlative Power has very lately, in the caſe of Mrs. <hi>Wharton,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 &amp; 3. <hi>W. M.</hi> n. 17.</note> declared a Marriage from thenceforth to be Null and Void, without any Proceedings in <hi>Doctors Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And farther yet, ſince the Reformation, a Marriage which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be contrary to certain Decrees and Canons of the Pope's Law, is ratified <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> and enacted to be a Good, Lawful, and Perfect Marriage, as agreeing with the <hi>Levitical</hi> Laws and Holy Scriptures, whereunto it ſays, <hi>All Marriages by the Laws and Statutes of this Realm have been heretofore moſt juſtly referred.</hi>

            <head>Further CONSIDERATIONS for the Earl of <hi>Maclesfeld</hi>'s BILL.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>Beſides the former Reaſons; Biſhop <hi>Cozens</hi>'s Argument for the Lord <hi>Roſs;</hi> and the Earl's Printed Caſe.</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to a Mock-Caſe, publiſhed for the Lady <hi>Maclesfeld;</hi> ſo little for her Service, as if it had been writ by one of the Earl's Council.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THAT Pity which Men are apt to ſhew, to the Frailties and Miſchances of <hi>Ladies,</hi> becomes ridiculous, after a Woman has ſuppreſſed that ſenſe of ſhame, which may be thought, in ſome meaſure, to leſſen the Faults which it covers with Bluſhes; when ſhe withſtands the cleareſt Conviction; and not only juſtifies that Injury to a Family, for which even Repentance cannot expiate; but has the aſſurance, to ask to be publickly rewarded for it: As if the Abſolute Conqueſt of Modeſty were matter of Triumph!</p>
            <p>This would not be thought poſſible, but for the <hi>Lady Maclesfeld</hi>'s way of proceeding to ſupport her Adultery, and the Paper which ſhe has publiſhed as her Caſe: In which her <hi>gentle Caſuiſt</hi> (who, it ſeems, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to ſwear in the <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> That ſhe <hi>was and is a Perſon of a Virtuous Life, and for ſuch was reputed and taken to be,</hi> after publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt manifeſt proofs of <hi>two Children begotten in Adultery</hi>)<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Though ſhe was particularly charged with this above 9 Months ſince, ſhe has not to this day pleaded contrary matter.</note> has perſuaded her to argue upon the preſumption of Innocence: and yet to give it up, as unneceſſary for <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> her Fortune; one of the ends which ſhe propoſed to her ſelf before ſhe left the <hi>Late Earl's</hi> Houſe. For, whatever her Life has been ſince, her <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> will have it, that ſhe ought to have all ſhe brought, back again; becauſe, as the Paper groundleſly pretends, her Husband had <hi>Maliciouſly ſecluded her from</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Some Thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divorce.</note> 
               <hi>Bed and Board:</hi> which is, in effect to ſay, that though ſhe had been contented with her Separate Maintenance of 300 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, before there was proof of her having Children in Adultery; ſhe ought now to have an Allowance from her Husband of 200 <hi>l.</hi> a Year; and if ſhe ſurvive her Mother, of Four, over and above her Separate Maintenance, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that Additional Charge: In plain terms, that her Husband ought to keep another Man's Baſtards.</p>
            <p>And yet this is not all, but according to the <hi>Lady Maclesfeld</hi>'s <hi>profound Caſuiſt,</hi> a Settlement ought to be broken, and the Inheritance of Land taken away, not only from the Earl, but from his Brother, Legally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the Remainder; for the ſake of an <hi>unrepenting Adultereſs,</hi> with the aggravation of having charged her Husband with ſubornation of Perjury for proving the Infamy upon her; and whoſe hate to him has been ſo violent as to extinguiſh all tenderneſs for <hi>her Lover;</hi> carrying her, in the height of her Rage, to wiſh for a Duel between them: and who, after all, threatens her Husband with an intereſt againſt the paſſing an Act for an Abſolute Divorce, unleſs he and his Family conſent to give back what had been ſetled on them for a conſideration, her ſhare in which ſhe has juſtly forfeited.</p>
            <p>'Tis now ſo far from a Queſtion, <hi>Whether Adultery diſſolves the Bond of Marriage, without any Sentence in</hi> Doctors Commons; that her <hi>indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Caſuiſt,</hi> ſuppoſing a <hi>Malicious Secluſion from Bed and Board</hi> to be her Caſe; maintains this to be <hi>a juſt cauſe of Divorce,</hi> and that a Divorce

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150194:4"/>
               <hi>does always diſſolve the whole Frame of the Marriage-Contract:</hi> Which muſt needs be meant of Divorce according to <hi>God's Law,</hi> or <hi>Natural Equity:</hi> not ſuch as is in <hi>Doctors Commons;</hi> which does not <hi>always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Contract.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis to be obſerved, that the <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> in applying his Notion to the <hi>Lady's</hi> Caſe;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Contrary to truth, and without the leaſt ſhadow of Evidence, takes it for granted, that ſhe was <hi>Maliciouſly ſecluded from Bed and Board:</hi> When, to uſe his own words with little variation;</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Proof of this ought to be very cautiouſly received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It ought to be very full, and clearly made out, by Witneſſes againſt whom there can be no ſhadow of a juſt exception;</hi> becauſe ſhe who will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the having Children in Adultery, while ſhe lives wholly Separate from her Husband, and then ſwear in the Spiritual Court that ſhe has li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Virtuous Life, <hi>may be ſuſpected at leaſt, to be capable of bringing an unfair proof,</hi> to extenuate, as ſhe thinks, her Crime. Beſides, Practices of this Nature have already appeared on her ſide.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As he inſinuates, that there can be no juſt Cauſe of putting a Wife away, till <hi>convicted of Adultery, or other Perſonal Misbehaviour towards her Husband;</hi> by parity of Reaſon, there can be no excuſe for living in Adultery with another, till the Husband has been <hi>convicted</hi> of a <hi>Malicious Secluſion.</hi> And they who have obſerved what Lies have been invented, and vile Arts uſed, to keep up the Reputation of the <hi>Lady</hi>'s Innocence, muſt think that even this pretence labours with a ſtrong prejudice.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Had not her <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> too much conſulted her Pleaſures, he might have informed her, That if ſhe had been without Cauſe ſecluded, as is falſly given out; ſhe ought by her virtuous and retired Life, to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to regain her Husband's Eſteem. Whereas the Courſe of her Life, and her own way of expoſing it, are a Confutation of all her vain Pretences: and ſhe her ſelf removes thoſe falſe Colours, with which ſhe would hide Facts that are notoriouſly known.</p>
            <p n="5">5. 'Tis now admitted by her greateſt Advocates, that ſhe has had Children in Adultery; and though the Children have not hapned till ten Years after living apart from her Husband, 'tis well known ſhe did not live Virtuous ſo long. 'Tis in proof, that ſhe has owned a former Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage; and the World talks loudly of Occaſions for more; how largely ſoever ſhe her ſelf has ſworn to her Reputation. Therefore I would ask even her own <hi>Caſuiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether upon his own Principles ſhe is now <hi>entituled to demand a Divorce?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether ſhe has any right to <hi>demand her Fortune to be refunded,</hi> unleſs ſhe has right to <hi>demand a Divorce?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether to give back her Fortune, would not be a rewarding Adultery, inſtead of puniſhing it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. As he confeſſes it to be <hi>againſt natural Right, that Innocency ſhould ſuffer Damage;</hi> would it not be ſo, to deprive the <hi>Earl</hi>'s Brother of part of his Remainder, for no other reaſon, but the more plentiful main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her in Adultery, and eaſing her Keeper, who has hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed the Charges of Lying in, and all other Expences which merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Women put Men to.</p>
            <p>But in anſwer to the <hi>Natural Query,</hi> which the admirable <hi>Female Caſuiſt,</hi> and Defender of <hi>Corrupt Nature,</hi> ſuppoſes to ariſe from the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of her Caſe, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p rend="margQuotes">
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether a Man, who is guilty of making his Wife commit Adultery, deſerves to be plentifully rewarded out of the ſame Wife's former Fortune.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Lady <hi>Maclesfeld</hi> was not denied Marriage-Rights while ſhe cohabited with her Husband, nor was put away by him; and ſhe well knows how tender the <hi>Earl</hi> was, upon a Letter of <hi>Aſſignation</hi> which fell into his hands, within a very ſhort time after they were Married; nor are the other early Occaſions, which he had to have put her away, unknown to her ſelf. And whether ſhe had not been guilty of <hi>Perſonal Misbehaviour towards her Husband,</hi> he might appeal to <hi>her Mother;</hi> were it to be expected, that ſhe, who would give 1000 <hi>l.</hi> to blacken him and his Witneſſes, could imitate the <hi>late Marqueſs of</hi> Dorcheſter, in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous concern for a Son-in-Law, injured by a Daughter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Unleſs the Lady had liv'd virtuouſly ten Years, and after ſo long ſober Converſation, had been rejected by her Husband, and at laſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to Tranſgreſs; his putting her away, [if he had done him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that Right] could not be the Cauſe of her committing the Adultery with which ſhe is charged.</p>
            <p>Beſides, had not her <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> very partially conſidered <hi>Biſhop</hi> Cozens'<hi>s Argument,</hi> and <hi>Sacred Writ,</hi> he might have found, that as one Text ſupplies what is left out in another, an Husband does not commit <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> or <hi>cauſe the Wife to commit Adultery,</hi> by the bare putting her away; till he has cut off all poſſibility of Reconciliation, by a Second Marriage: For as 'tis, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 9. <q>``Whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife, except ``it be for Fornication, [and ſhall marry another] <hi>commiteth Adultery.</hi>
               </q> And he might have learned of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> That <hi>'tis not the Diſmiſſion that is Adultrous, but the marrying of another;</hi> which ſhews, That ſhe ought by her good Life, and reſpectful Diſcourſes of him, to have endeavoured to be freed from the Temptation to Adultery, much rather than to accuſe him of her Crime.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If ſhe her ſelf had with Tears of Repentance diſcovered her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; or after it was diſcover'd by others, had been ſo far from main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her Innocence by Subornations, and imputing her own Perjury to his Witneſſes, that ſhe had thought the complying with his Requeſt of being ſeen by two of his Relations, when ſhe was big with Child, a more happy neceſſity, than <hi>to poyſon her ſelf,</hi> or <hi>Lye-in in</hi> Newgate;<note place="margin">As ſhe declared her choice, upon notice, that the Earl deſired ſhe might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</note> and had ſhe, in that Condition, applied her ſelf to his Compaſſion, and done what was in her power to repair an Injury of the higheſt Nature; then there might have been greater Colour for her having back her Fortune, than now that ſhe has openly defied her Husband, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Nation, and put him to ſuch exceſſive Trouble, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Charge, to free himſelf from her, and the diſhonourable Burthen ſhe would lay upon him and his Family.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Proviſion which the <hi>Earl</hi> offers in his Bill, is as much as ſhe had by Law, while ſhe would be thought to live with the Reputation of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and as much as the <hi>Dean of the Arches judged ſufficient Alimony,</hi> till the time of forfeiting it by the courſe of the <hi>Spiritual Court:</hi> And as that <hi>Grave and Learned Judge</hi> thought it unreaſonable to advance her Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, after Allegation and Proof of Adultery; it would be very ſtrange, if after the Matter were paſſed into the moſt ſolemn Judgment, a Divorce for Adultery, which works a forfeiture of Alimony (even where the Remedy is ſhort of what God's Law allows, if not requires) ſhould oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion a larger Proviſion than ſhe had before.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the Earl had put her away, 'tis manifeſt it could not be from any<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Some Thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. No man ſhould be encouraged to put away his Wife by the largeneſs of that Fortune which ſhe brought.</note> temptation of being better'd by her Fortune; for ſhe or her Mother has from the firſt parting received all the Profits of the Eſtate which came with her; nor would have been put to account for the Overplus beyond the ſeparate Maintenance, but for the greateſt Provocations that could be given.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:150194:5"/>As to 1000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year Rent-charge out of his own Eſtate, which was ſetled in Jointure, that could not be ſaved by the putting her away; nor is it any Eaſe to the Eſtate during the <hi>Earl</hi>'s Life, or after his Death, if he marry another on whom he has power to make the like Settlement: And beſides, the 1000 <hi>l.</hi> a Year is not taken from her by the Bill, but falls by natural conſequence, upon the diſſolution of the Marriage-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Even the proviſion which the Bill makes for her out of the Eſtate<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leviticus 20. 10.</hi> The man that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth adultery with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's wife, the <hi>adulterer,</hi> and <hi>adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs</hi> ſhall ſurely be put to death.</note> which came from her Father, is more than conſiſts with the Reaſon of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, and the Laws of other Nations, by which the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs ought to be put to death.</p>
            <p n="7">7. 'Tis more than agrees with the Reaſon and Wiſdom of our Law, as we have received it from our Anceſtors, even though the <hi>Earl</hi> had put her away, and that without cauſe: When, in truth, whatever cauſe he had for it, he did not put her away.</p>
            <p>'Tis to be conſidered, that ſo much of the Eſtate as her Father gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Money, is ſetled on her as part of her Jointure: and in this the <hi>Bill</hi> allows her no more than her Life; but leaves another Eſtate as 'twas given in worth near 4000 <hi>l.</hi> to her and her Family, after the <hi>Earl</hi>'s death: when according to the Equity, if not to the Letter of the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the <hi>2d. 13 E.</hi> 1. ſhe ought not to have any Allowance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>That Statute declares, <q>That if a Wife goes away voluntarily, and ſtays with an Adulterer, ſhe ſhall <hi>loſe her Dower for ever,</hi> unleſs the Husband voluntarily, and without Eccleſiaſtical Coertion, be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to her, and permit her to cohabit with him:</q> This has been held to<note place="margin">2d Inſt. f.</note> extend to a ſubſequent Conſent, though a Woman was forced away at firſt: But more directly to the <hi>Caſuiſt</hi>'s Queſtion, it has been adjudged by the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>his Council in Parliament, 30 E.</hi> 1. that though a Wife be<note place="margin">Placita Parl. f. 231, 232, 233.</note> formally made over by the Husband, and reſigned to another Man, yet ſhe forfeits her Dower: Nor is it any Objection, that the Statute mentions only Dower; becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Jointure</hi> is but in lieu of <hi>Dower,</hi> and within the ſame Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Dower</hi> at the <hi>Church-door,</hi> or, at leaſt, <hi>with aſſent of the Father,</hi> which, as has been held, ought to be by Deed; is truly a <hi>Jointure:</hi> And yet this would be forfeited in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The forfeiture of <hi>Dower</hi> is incurred without any manner of Divorce; and a <hi>Divorce for Adultery</hi> takes away <hi>Alimony</hi> in the <hi>Spiritual Court;</hi> but by an Act of Parliament which diſſolves the Bond of Marriage, a <hi>Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſuppoſing it of a different nature from <hi>Dower,</hi> of courſe falls to the ground: It being ſetled upon the Woman no otherwiſe than as a Wife; which relation ceaſing, there remains no colour of Law to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>Nor can there be Equity; becauſe <hi>Equity follows the Law,</hi> and muſt be governed by the Reaſon of the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter the 2d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since, however, ſome make Scruples, becauſe there has been no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce in <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> and as if there could be no other due <hi>conviction</hi> of Adultery; not here to repeat what has been mentioned in the former <hi>Reaſons for the Earl's Bill,</hi> 'tis to be obſerved; That the Memorable Judgment in Parliament, 30 <hi>E.</hi> 1. was even contrary to a Sentence in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court;</hi> where the Woman that <hi>eloped with the conſent of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> had been <hi>purged,</hi> or <hi>acquitted</hi> from Adultery: And the Parties believing, it ſeems, that a Jury would not go contrary to <hi>Holy Church,</hi> offered an Iſſue, that they had not lived in Adultery during the Life of the former Husband; but were denied the benefit of a Trial, becauſe, as was then declared in <hi>Parliament, there's no need of Trial for Matters which appear manifeſt to the Court.</hi>
