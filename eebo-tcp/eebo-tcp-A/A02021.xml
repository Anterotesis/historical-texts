            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

one of the ſect of fleſhly and bloudie Goſpellers,<note place="margin">Math. 7. Chap.</note> one of the

of treaſon to murther Kings, helliſh inſtruments
to ruine Countries, ſworne enemies to God, and diligent
factors for the deuill. If thou be a man of this Categorie,
I hate thee to the very death: but if thou firſt be true to
God, and next to thy owne Prince: if thou be faithfull to
thy Country, if thou judge all men with equitie in ſpite of
loue or briberie, if thou wrong no man: and laſt of all, if
thou be all in all a good Christian, thou art an honeſt man,
&amp; thou art the man who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I place in my harts hart: if thou

at honeſtie, and proſecutes all thy deſires with the feare of

making the eyes of man (which was curious to behold

this tragicall ſpectacle of the great mans grovelling

the euill man from his wickednes. Therefore I ſend thee
forth to be a preceptor and defender of Orphanes, a helper

how is the honeſt mans actions miſdeemed, and his

O how watchfull ſhould the honeſt minded man be

beggerlie, and lay the moſt parte of your cloaths

ambition, which brings nothing with it but the

Cunny-catchers, take vp commodities, skambell,

ſpares not to ſeek &amp; ſerch be al means to know who
will giue their money out for intreſt, making large

making the world poynte at his oulde garment,
furniſhed with newe faſhions, till ſome poore

What folies and ſuperſtitious vanities may the eies

who employes thee well, and ſpends the not in

it to ſee braue ſpirites ſo careles of time, and ſtill
waiſting of their wits in vaine? Conſuming their
youthfull yeares in ſuch ſlauiſh ſervice, where ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

ingratitude, how oft hath the cowardlie flatterer
cropen in favor, and catched the gallant mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde?
O but the diſgrace of indiſcretion pertaines
to the diſtributer, &amp; not to the wel-deſerving man.
Let the man whoſe meriet is great, put on Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

what a ſhame is it for ſuch as are borne

noble now in theſe dayes, it is thought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal,
and ſo the hearts of higher powers, are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the hearts of avaritious vſurers, who
makes their gould their God, he houlds his hand

downe, for he that comes firſt, ſits firſt, and then
ſits like one flightred in rops, if he holde not his

but bare railing ſhould work revenge vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the baſe
abuſe of ſuch ſtrange monſters, whoſe degenerate
haerts from true Nobility are gilt overwith golden
words. But what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſaid to a cautariſd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience,
a remorſles mind, or to a hardned &amp; ſenſles heart,
who never died the face of <hi>honor</hi> with the bluſh of
ſhame, the gentle heart of an honeſt minded man,
bolds his turret of reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ruinous grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb facs="tcp:3538:19"/>
of idle promiſes, ſtill credulous, and ever ritch in
naked hope, till at laſt his merit growes ſo great,
that his ſight becomes loathſome to him, who
ſhould reward him. Who is it then that gets and
gathers all the gaines? flattering pick-thanks, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
fowles, cowardly poltrones, and canailies,
who ſtill keepes begging in requeſt. So ideots,
ſtoyicks, and paraſites, are ritch, when Princes and
gallants are poore. Such is the ſubtilty of ſnakie
hatchers of envious treaſon, and ſubtill villaines.
To ſee two crafty knaues meet in Court, in ſtreet,
or any where, how will they ſalute one another
with ſhaking of hands with low courteſaies, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nixt
complements, offers, vowes, and large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
will paſſe betwixt them: how ware will they
be ever doubting, not vnlike two cunning and ſure
Fenſers lying at a ſafe guard: O that then their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
were tranſparent like chriſtall, and that an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
man might ſee what hid miſchiefe lies in their
hearts. I thinke the honeſt man might gnaſh his
teeth, to ſee the hote rancounter of equall deceit,
the true race of <hi>Babilonian</hi> raſcalls, the ſlaues of
pride, and generation of <hi>Haman.</hi> If any ſuch vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine
haue the credit to gather &amp; take vp his Lords
rents and revenewes, in receaving and deburſing:
then be ſure he keepes the two rules of <hi>Arthme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
to wit, <hi>Substraction</hi> and <hi>Multiplication,</hi> the one
helps him in his receaving, the other in his debur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
hee muſt enterline his counts, enlarge his
ſummes, invent new journeyes, exploit all kinde of
courſes that may be expenſive, onely a purpoſe to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3538:19"/>
make great volumes of reckonings, that his vantage
may be the greater, &amp; his theift the better covered.
Hee robs his Maiſter of his revenewes, and makes
him ſelfe a great rent, and with a godleſſe purchaſe
he liues like a Prince, enritching his owne poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and puts his Maiſter ever in debt: the Noble
man thinks him ſelfe to be well ſerved, and that he
hath a faithfull and truſtie ſervant, when the villaine
is a cut-throat, a vnderminder of his Maiſters ſtate,
and brings his lands in morgage: this man will
counſaile his Lord to ſell his lands, and this villaine
will be the firſt will offer him money; theſe kinde
of deeeaving Paraſites are made ritch with falls and
godleſſe conqueſt. O this man is he that hath no
ſoule, he plagues the tenants, and ſtops the eare of
his Maiſter from the poore farmourers complaint:
he hath no compaſſion on the widow or fatherleſſe,
in giving of rewards he robs his Lords honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commaunded, he either giues little, or none at
all: he payes the well-deſerving man with faire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing-words,
&amp; the poore diſtreſſed begger with
God help you, but when the purſe-bearers recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are produc'd, how large, how liberall, and
how honourable will he make his Maiſters rewards
to be. O this affronted villaine with a ſhameleſſe
face, and with perjured oathes, will damne the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſoule of him ſelfe. O that the King, the Duke,
Lord, Laird, Maiſter, or the ſuperiour, be what
thou will, would take ſuch a treacherous knaue by
the neck, and ſay, Sirra, giue me a reckoning of my
goods; thou art a cogging villaine, thou art a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
<pb facs="tcp:3538:20"/>
and betrayed me: thou haſt ſtollen my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
and begirt me, thy deceit hath over-ſiled my
<hi>Parents,</hi> robd their lands, &amp; made me to liue in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty:
thou haſt woone all with falſe dice, lay down
againe, or elſe thou ſhalt ſmart for it. I thinke, be
what thou may be, thou may doe this, and thou may
doe it with auctoritie of a good conſcience, and ſo
giue an example to all coſoning raſcals, to cogging
flatterers, and to all treacherous villaines. When
Generalls, Coronals, or Captaines, receaues pay
from the Prince or his Pagadore, to doe good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the Countrey, they who are commanders
of the Armie, will make new Callenders of their
owne enlarging yeares and moneths: for ſomtime
they will make the yeere to be 15. moneths, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
fiue or ſix weekes, to the wrack of the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
and againe, their monters ſhall be given in to
be thirtie, fortie, fiftie, or a hundreth thouſand
ſtrong, when they ſhall ſcarſe be half ſo many men,
ſo that falſe monters is the ruine of a camp, the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of a Prince, and the only deſtruction of poore
ſouldiers by the law of Armes and counſaile of
warres, ſuch caterpillers of a Campe ſhould be
hanged, caſhiered, raked and tortured, and at leſt
get the <hi>ſtrapado.</hi> Many a Captaine goes gallant, and
playes the bravado with the poore ſouldiers pay:
how can a ſouldier liue, when he gets no pay to
maintaine him. Js it not a great and worthy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and a mightie courage to the Generalls heart,
when he ſees all his Armie of gallant men in good
equipage, and his Camp well furniſhed. And to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3538:20"/>
be more carefull for the ſouldiers then for him ſelf,
ſeeing the ſouldier is his defence, and the onely
fortreſſe of his eſtate. O that the eyes of Princes
would not winke at ſuch villanie, and that their
wealth ſhould not be ſo vnworthily beſtowed. A
kings minion that knowes all the ſecrets of the king,
and next to the Kings body, perchance will be an
intelligencer, a factor, &amp; a doer for neighbor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
preſſing to raiſe and keepe them vp, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding
his owne King and Maiſter, taking large
ſums, ſo that he becomes a Pentioner to a forraine
Prince, yea if it were to ten Kings, he will take of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this buſie-headed and craftie knaue, for all this he is
not miſtruſted, but ſtill advanced and eſteemed to
be a true ſubject, and ſtill thought a man who doeth
good ſervice to his King &amp; Country. Now in this
chirping time of peace, when none triumphs but
cowards &amp; poltrones, ſouldiers and ſchollers are
baniſht Court &amp; Country, they are counted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
Peſt, and vnprofitable inſtruments. What
ſhal we all turne cowards, &amp; ſtill try our patience in
ſuffering wrongs? when the couragious ſouldier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to diſcourſe how he hath ſpent his time in wars
he begins to tel in the Winter how he lies in garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
&amp; in the ſpriug-time like a well managed ſhip
going to her voyage, ſo in braue equipage goes he
to the fields commanded by his Chieften, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in his march with ſound of Trumpet, and
tuck of Drummes, if they approach the enemie in
faire fields, they muſt marche in battaile, if the
Campe defende or purſue a Towne, they muſt
<pb facs="tcp:3538:21"/>
enritch them ſelues, make redoubts, and conques
ground, defend their Cannon, ſet their Gabions,
and paliſade their weaker places, the ſouldier muſt
ſtand his houre ſentinell perdew, vnder the mercie
of Musket and Canon, and what is all their ſport?
naught elſe but flying of Colours, ſounding of
Trumpets, touking of Drummes, claſhing of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſhooting off Muskets, roaring of Cannons,
thundring of vp-blowne-Mines, giving aſſaults, and
getting repulſe with ſundry &amp; thick ſortes, making
retreats, and with freſh courage joyning hote and
fierce rancounters, bringing deſtruction, rape,
bloud-ſhed, murther, and cruell vengeance. O this
fearefull diſcourſe makes the haires of a coward
ſtand right vp, he will not buy honour at ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous
rate, he will ſtay at home and be knighted
either by moyen or money: ſuch is the abuſe of
worthy knighthood, that now every kitchen-fellow
may attaine to, be flattering credit of euil-purchaſd
wealth. <hi>Non venit ex molli vivida fama thoro,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,

much more then in travaile or going in farre jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes.
I hate this miſerable ſect of <hi>Epicurians,</hi> who
onely loues to eate, ſleepe, and drinke. Looke on a
drunkard, how the continuall exhauſting of drinke
enflames his face with fire, and transformes his
noſe in a red rock of ſpurtled and white-headed ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,
whoſe gliſtring luiſter yeelds a vermilion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3538:21"/>
to palenes it ſelfe: and yet the more the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack

more it heates and dries vp, <hi>Quo plus ſunt potae, plus
ſitiuntur aquae,</hi> ſuch ſort of tiplers who loues and
hath pleaſure in bibbing and continuall ſupping of
ſtrong drinke: this <hi>Epicurian</hi> ſect, I ſay, makes their
back &amp; their belly their <hi>ſummum bonum.</hi> O I blame
the great abuſe of companionrie, who can not keep
ſocietie, and be merrie in honeſt &amp; civill paſtimes:
they think all nothing if that they drinke not drunk:
what a beaſtly thing is drunkennes? and what an
abhominable mother is it to all other ſinnes, it is
the very gate of hell. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, when
he had conqueſt the world with valour, yet drinke
overthrew him, and killed him: how many bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of miſchiefe ſprings from that filthy rowt? J
ſay to thee who hath bene a drunkard, &amp; hath bene
an abuſer of the benefits of God, perchance rather
for the loue of company, then for the loue of drink:
If thou haſt remorſe, and is angry at thy ſelfe, thou
art happy. And I will entreat thee to behold the
beaſtly behaviour of a drunkard, when he is in his
drunkennes, and it will make thee hate drunkennes
worſe then any thing:<note place="margin">Eccle. 26. cap.</note> in man it is more then filthy,
and in woman ten thouſand times worſe, <hi>becauſe
ſhee can not hide her owne ſhame.</hi> J confeſſe and
alow that both men and women ſhould drinke mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly,
for the better health of their body: but J
thinke it odious, when one ſhall (as it were) force
another to drinke more then meaſure, to ſurfet and
ſpoile them ſelues to this, I ſay with the <hi>Italian, è qual

within this Iland, that it is in all ſorts of eſtates cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from vice to vertue. How many ſundry ſorts of
ſins hath intruded them ſelues amongſt vs; ſtrange
and new invented ſinnes comes from the Court to
the Countrey, like the new faſhions of apparrell:
how new fangled are we to follow them, diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by degrees, for we may ſtill ſee the baſer ſort
ſtriving to imitate their betters, and rather in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
then in goodnes: the Clowne ſtriues in his
faſhious to follow the Gentleman, and the Court
waiting Ladies is counterfaited with the Country
drab, few or none followes the honeſt mans maners
honeſtie, &amp; truth are becomd baniſht traytors, nor
yet dare Charitie come neere Court: the civill and
vpright man hath waited long in the glorious
Coutts of Kings, &amp; can not find favour, he is turned
back wearied, he weeps to ſee a ſcurvie &amp; vngodly
conſort of villaines, crowned with deceit, &amp; wrapt
vp in the painted robes of flatterie, in the Triumph
of thieft, adorned with inequitie in the Chariot
of forgetfulneſſe, drawne to hell with the ſeaven
deadly ſinnes. What can heroyick ſpirits ſay to
the hainous abuſe of pretious time in this laſt and
miſerable age. Let him pittie forgetfulnes, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3538:22"/>
ſigh at villanie, or rather let him turne home againe
to burthen his friends when his lands are engaged,
when he hath ſpent all, and left nothing, and when
moyen and mony failed him both at once, he could
not begge a ſuit: he could not buy an Office, nor he
could not get one church benefice gratis: ſuch was
the rage of ingratitude. Let this man J ſay, who hath
ſpent his time, turn; &amp; ſay with that moſt galant ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<hi>Awfull regard diſputeth not with Kings, but takes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
and neuer asketh why.</hi> We may ſee what ſtrange
paines the worldling takes on him, to be ritch, what
inventions, and with what great induſtrie: behold
the Merchant what he vndertaketh, to be ritch:
what reſtleſſe travailes with great hazard of his life,
compaſſing (as it were) the whole earth to flie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie,
and leaues no corner in the worlde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought:
<hi>Impiger extremos currit mercator ad indos
per Mare Pauperiem fugiens per Saxa per ignes.</hi> Then
looke againe on the <hi>Machanike</hi> or <hi>artiſant,</hi> with rare
inventions of his ſpirit: the diligent labourer of
the ground, with the ſweate of his bodie, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one by lawfull or vnlawfull meanes wrings
their wits, and ſtill travailes to be ritch. Now let
vs conſider what it is that ritches will not doe? We
may beholde and ſee howe it mendes all defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and oft-times transformes Vertue in Vice:
firſt, it makes the baſe Poltrone proude, the
fooliſh eſteemed wiſe, the ignorant ſtoyick to
be preferred. And it makes a Lord or Chiefe
Commaunder, to honour a borne Raſcall, and
a verie ſlaue by Nature, hee will make him
<pb facs="tcp:3538:23"/>
ſpeake with a covert head, waſh with him, ſit at
meat, and eate in his owne diſh, with a flattering
eare he will entertaine his diſcourſe, ſomtimes with
gravitie, and ſomtimes with ſmiling, as it were to
giue a counterfait grace, to the ignorant Aſſe: why
will it pleaſe his Lordſhip to doe all this? Becauſe
his honour thinkes ſuch men are needefull inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to ingage them ſelues, and become Catio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
for the Lords debt. A help to furniſh his houſe,
to ſtore his Citchin, and ſtill to lend him money.
O but when this poore deceaved ſot, begins to be
beggerd, then his Lordſhip preſently decards him,
becauſe hee can not ſerue more to make vp a full
hundreth. At laſt, this gulld raſcall comes with cap
in hand, with low-ſtouping courteſie licking the
way with his ſlaviſh knees, and halfe weeping begs
his owne; then his Lordſhip becomes deafe, and
hath no more <hi>Iudas</hi> kiſſes to beſtow on his fooliſh
worſhip. What may this man thinke of him ſelfe,
and of his deere bought courteſie, the Lord leaned
on his ſhoulder, the Lord called him Sir, and ſtill
bad him cover his head; the Lord ſet him at his
ſide, and dranke healths to him: and now when all
is gone, the Lord payes him with a promiſe, and ſo
bids him farewell. What will ritches doe more?
it will cover villany, invent miſchiefe, and bring
forth treaſon, it betrayes beauty, and makes loue
mercinarie, it corrupts juſtice, and with damnable
deedes damnes the ſoule of mankinde. This deſire
of ritches hath made, and ſtill makes many a man
to hazard all, there is nothing but the worldling
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3538:23"/>
will doe for gold, even all in all: This made that
heroyick and learned Poet crie out, <hi>Quid non mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia
pectora Cogis auri ſacra fames:</hi> What ſhall I ſay
to thee who is contented with ſobrietie, and caries
truth in thy heart, when thou ſeeſt the great abuſe
of ritches, it makes thee deſire no more then is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to maintaine thee with all, yet for all this, thy
good deedes perchance can not purchaſe it: thy
Lord or Maiſter enranks thee with the deceaved
ſort, and ſo forgets thee! O thou, <hi>had I wist</hi> what
an excellent plaiſter art thou for the incurable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
of repentance. What a great griefe is it to
the well-deſerving man, who hath a promiſe to be
rewarded, and becomes aſhamed to importune his
debter? but O, when he ſtands in his ſight, what a
loathſome booke, becomes he to deſired forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
which yeelds naught elſe but flattering ſmiles,
and never performd promiſes. Now I ſpeake to the
young aſpiring gallant, learne in time to beware
at other mens harmes, Provide for age and ſicknes.
Looke on the aged Conrtiers, who hath ſpent their
youth in waiting on, they goe ſcambling like But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
dogs in Lentron, they are like old cart-horſe,
like out-worne hounds, and the very ſcoffe of time.
Therfore when thou looks on the <hi>Anatomie</hi> of time,
&amp; hath conſidered the ſecrets thereof, O how deere
ſhould it be to thee, &amp; how ſhould thou behaue thy
ſelfe in this time, to provide for the time to come, if
thou be poore, who wil care for thee, ſuppoſe thou
art of the moſt rare wit in the world, adorned and
made perfit with all the chiefe, &amp; principall gifts of
<pb facs="tcp:3538:24"/>
nature enricht &amp; decoird with the aditions of Art,
yet for all this, if poverty hant thee, few or none ſhal
eſteeme of thee now in thy youth-head. I counſaile
thee to thinke well on the time paſt, conſider the
time preſent, &amp; haue a care of the time to come.</p>

bleſſed Angell charge of me, who never left me in

deceit, when the father doth oppoſe himſelf againſt

how to betray his neighbour, <hi>Bonds, Seales, Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

thou appeale him before a Judge, with new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſhifts of Law he will out-wearie thee: with bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie
he will begger thee, and thou ſhalt never be
the better. O thou wicked oppreſſour, and thou
falſe and partiall Judge, what ſhalt thou anſwer to
the head Juſtice of heaven, when God ſayes by his
Prophet <hi>Ieremie, Ego ſum Iudex &amp; testis,</hi> I am both
Iudge &amp; witnes. O ſayes the wicked man in his hart,
I feare not God, therefore I can not loue him with
my ſoule, nor yet can I loue my neighbour, becauſe
J envie his good eſtate, and covets his ritches, and
would wrack him: ſo J owne no duty to God at all,

nor loue to my neighbour, I ſcorne, ſpurne, &amp; treds

Then I will ſpeake againſt ſuch phantaſtick fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
which I haue ſeene heere in this Iſle of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
and in many other forraine Countries (where
I haue travelled) profeſſe the Art of <hi>Medicine,</hi> and
produce their great Charters, and Patents, ſealde

and then they are noght elſe but the very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſers
of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> what a deriſion is it, to heare &amp; ſe
<hi>Domine Doctor</hi> diſcourſe with a borrowed Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and commonly at meat over the table, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect of perſons? O ſaith he, you muſt not eate
of this, it offends the ſtomack; ſuch and ſuch is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoratiue,
and this againe breeds conſtipation, this
is laxatiue, this breakes winde, and expels the
Collick, and this is your onely meat for confirmde
ſtones, it purges the raines, and diſſolues quickly, O
what a ſcurvy diſcourſe is this for the ears of a cheſt
and skunring-hearted Ladie? and cheefly at meat to
talk of confirmde ſtones, purging of raines, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving

ſuffred, &amp; yet for the faſhions ſake, my Lord <hi>Doctor</hi>
will not ſpare to produce ſome place of <hi>Gallein</hi> to
make his leyſings good and currant. Then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
he to frame a large Comenter vpon a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
text, interluding ſuch a long Parentheſis, till at
laſt his haulting ſpeeches makes him altogeher
<pb facs="tcp:3538:31"/>
forget the origenall of his former ſubject. O how
will he heſitat when his long diſcourſe beginnes to
challenge memory, then obruptly will he change
purpoſe not vnlike a bloud-hound which hath loſt
his ſent. Woe be to poore patients comes vnder
the Cure of ſuch ignorants, who ſcarce can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne
a docken leafe from <hi>Tobacco.</hi> And yet he will
ſay, that he is a rare herbeſt, how oft he viſits the
ſick, as oft muſt he viſit gould, or elſe his viſitation
is ſtark naught: When he feeleth the punſes of any
diſeaſed perſon, O ſaieth he, it is an <hi>Ague,</hi> a raging
fever, houlde you warme, keepe your ſelfe quiet,
let no bodie moleſt you, I will come againe, and
ſee your water: Then the next time he comes with
a conſort of Cut-throts like himſelfe, and after
many whiſpering doubts, they call the <hi>Apotechar,</hi>
and giues him a <hi>Recepie</hi> of I knowe not what, which
poyſones the poore diſtreſſed patient, and ſo ſends
him to his everlaſting home. Then doeth their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
lay the fault on God, or elſe on the poore
Patient, ſaying, he would not be reuld, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
he would not obey their precepts; and
they make the man or the woman author of their
owne death. When the Painter is asked why he
left his trade of painting to become a Doctor of
Phyſick. O ſaid he, when I was a Painter, all the
world ſaw my errors, but now being a Doctor of
Phyſick, I make the earth to burie my wrongs, they
ſeeke forth the life and ritches of mankinde. Well
may ſuch ignorants be calde, the Officers of death,
for the life of mankinde, is the tryell of their drinks,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3538:31"/>
and with their poyſning drogs, they furniſh graues,
and feeds wormes. When the Patient is dead, the
Doctor muſt be payde for all his viſitations, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potechar
for his drogs, the Barber for his <hi>Inſitions,
Fmmetings, Vnguents, Cataplaſms, Emplaſterings,
Balmes,</hi> and mollefying <hi>Ceir-cloaths,</hi> this muſt all be
payed and much more. What if worſe, none except

that ſtill gnawes vpon glad backs, bloud-ſuckers, &amp;

of a ſubtle <hi>Pandros,</hi> the exploits &amp; tricks of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
<hi>whore,</hi> the fals reckoning hoſt, the marchants

No, I meane be a <hi>Ianus-headed Lawyer</hi> who hath one

whoſe ever-gaiping hand muſt ſtill be anoynted in
the Palme with the holie ounction of Gould,
who muſt be courted like a whore with the ſight
of Angels, ſtrange peeces of gould, and purſe
pennies. Woe be to many heart-tortred Clyants,
whoſe right dependes vpon the defence of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varitious

            <q>Patientia pauperum non peribit in finem.</q>
            <p>Therefore, O man, arme thy ſelfe with Patience
in this miſerable time, and couragiouſlie fight it
out; for ſo long as thou art heer into this little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe

are thy miſeries which doeth oppoſe themſelues
againſt thee; like vnto the reſtleſſe motion of
the ſea, one trouble being gone, another fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
Many ſorrowes, and few pleaſures, when
we expect joy, then comes greefe, every one hath
their owne croſſe, ſome les, ſome more. As poverty
to an honeſt heart brings miſery, greef of minde, &amp;
melancholy, becauſe he conceals his want, and can
not practiſe ſhameles ſhifts to perrell honeſty, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; many a languiſhing diſeaſe, which is lade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

they who ſhuld help thee are gone, &amp; hes no body
to comfort thee in thy deſtres. <hi>Ship-wrack</hi> when thy

when thou in a ſtrange country, becomes a
poore ſtranger, far from thy own ſoyle, thou liueſt
an out-caſt, and thy enemies injoyes thy ritches at

doth impriſon many a man within a Jaill,
or caſts him in chaines within a Galies, triumpht o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with Raskals (and as it were) the very reſting
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3538:32"/>
place of all wrongs, when a gentle heart is forſt to
harbor patience; and when revenge in a gallant
breaſt turns coward, O this earthly hell, which hes
no other Muſick, but locking of doores, the noiſe of
irons and chains, the heavy complaint of diſtreſſed
priſoners, lockt with bonds in miſery, conſuming in
ſtink and filthines. This ſaid the Apoſtle S. <hi>Taul, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
them that are in bonds, as if ye wer in bonds with
them,</hi> ſo that every one aught by charitable works to
haue compaſſion on the poore diſtreſſed priſoners.
Saith not the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> with great grief of hart
<hi>Let the ſighing of the priſoners come before thee O Lord:</hi>
as though he wold ſay, O Lord God, conſider the
great anguiſh of their hearts, take mercy on them,
and releue their wants, how heavy and comfortles
is this grievous cros. Some again are croſt with loſe
of <hi>honor,</hi> when a man either falles in diſgrace, and
commits ſome baſe and filthy fact, or when he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
wrong, and can not repare himſelf, the croſſe of
mariage where there is no peace, quietnes, nor reſt,
voyde of all contentment, and ever barking, and ſo
makes the devill ſmyl at their diſſention. And what
can be ſaid to the croſſe of idle loue, which hangs
on the ſhoulders of all ſortes of people, as well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
as vnmaried. In this Frenaſy many ould do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardes
beginnes to renue their declyning age,
and takes vpon them the apprehenſion of youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heid,
whilſt their gray haires, and hairles heads,
reckones vp their yeares, and telles the worlde
their folly, <hi>Turpe ſenilis amor,</hi> it is more tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in youth, ſo that it be not ſuperſtitious loue;
<pb facs="tcp:3538:33"/>
as ſometimes to faſt from meate and drink, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nights, and ſending their lamentations
written with bloudie letters, railling on crueltie;
and being alone in their retearing walks, they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat
the ſolitarie deſerts with the ſorrowfull voice of
a diſcontented minde, with weeping eies in ſplaine
of paſſion, O ſaieth he,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>THe furious force of loues conſuming fire,</l>
               <l>No tyme can quench, nor thoght can not expell:</l>
               <l>Such is the reſtles rage of my deſire,</l>
               <l>Which makes my wits within my ſelfe rebell:</l>
               <l>Thus am I wrongd, and euer ſaikles ſlaine,</l>
               <l>I ſhift my place, but can not ſhift my paine.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>They ever eſteeme their paines worſe then the
paines of hell, ſuch are the ſort of penetential lovers,
who are alwaies <hi>Anatomiſd</hi> with humorous follie.
&amp; yet how often comes it to paſſe, that they who
taks moſt pains to pleaſe, are moſt diſpleaſd, for it is
knowne be vnfallable experience, that the duetifull
lover in a reſpected perſute, is often rejected with
many ingratfull diſdains. For ſome they are which
are Monſters in the womaniſh ſex, will hate that
man moſt, who loues her beſt, and yeeld her ſelf to a
cowardly pultron of no deſert. And againe, we may
evidently ſee, how ſome men of a curriſh &amp; maſtiſh
kinde, will be moſt careleſſe of that woman who is
moſt carefull of him. Such are the vnthankfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
and interviewing controverſies, of this fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
thing which the world calleth <hi>Blinde-loue,</hi>
it is not the ritch apparell, nor the rare bewtie,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3538:33"/>
nor the art of curious engines, nor yet is it the gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
geſture of a glorious woman, which makes
the woman: it is the good education, which brings
forth good qualities, &amp; it is the vertue of the mind,
which doeth produce diſcretion, makes the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
a perfit woman; and that man, may truly be
called a perfit man, who makes wiſedome the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable
companion of valour, whoſe liberall
minde aymes at honour, and whoſe couragious
heart treads on feare to conques <hi>fame.</hi> O it is not
the externall ſhew of a <hi>Peacocks</hi> pride, who with the
geſture of his painted plumes, ſeemes to threaten
Kingdomes: it is not the man of perſonage, nor the
robuſt nature, neither is it the quantitie, but onely
the qualitie doth the turne. A woman may ſeeme
very coy in braue attire, with a faire face, and yet
a <hi>whore:</hi> a man may be cloathed in fine cloathes,
he may be very ſtrong of body, of a great ſtature,
and he may in a feareleſſe <hi>humor</hi> diſcourſe of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
but when it comes to the puſh of <hi>Fortune,</hi> he
may proue naught elſe but a faint-hearted-coward,
a turne-back to courage, and a runne-away from
<hi>honour.</hi> What a world of vanity is it to ſee a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fellow, that can doe nothing elſe but court a
woman, how effeminate will he be, and how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall
will the tongue be to lend vowes to the hart:
<q>
                  <l>Nec jura retine, veneris per juria venti</l>
                  <l>irrita, per terras &amp; freta longa ferunt.</l>
               </q>
How perrillous is it to beleeue a Lover, how temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
will their words be, and how will they ſtraine
them ſelues to ſpeake with vehemencie. <hi>Lady Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3538:34"/>
ever hants the mouth of a Lover, and with
borrowed ſpeeches of braver wits, doeth enlarge
their deceit, his perjured promiſes, his oathes, his
vowes, his proteſtations, his waiting-on, and all
his <hi>iron</hi> ſences drawen to feed vpon the actractiue
humors of her Adamantall beautie, as when the
ſong or liſping ſpeech of a <hi>Syranicall</hi> wench doth
enchaunt his <hi>eares,</hi> the feeling of her too-much
tempting fleſh, doth intangle his <hi>touch,</hi> her perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
breath doth ſweeten his <hi>ſmell,</hi> the nectar of
her laſcivious kiſſing, giues delicacie to his <hi>taste,</hi>
and her petulant beautie feedes his <hi>ſight,</hi> her ſmile
is his heaven, &amp; her frown is his hell, ſhe is the only
idoll of his minde, for when he ſhould ſerue God,
he worſhips her, if hee comes to Church, his loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on her behaviour takes away his hearing,
robs him of devotion, and makes him a ſenceleſſe
blocke, with ſtaring in her face, hee learnes the
Arte of <hi>Phiſiognomie,</hi> his vaine apprehentions
will reade a womans thought in her viſage, and
when hee lookes on her hands, O then hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a rare Palmiſter, for hee will not ſpare to
reade her fortunes by lynes, for heere (ſayes hee)
is the true ſcore of death, and there goes the
ſcore of life, from this part comes the venerian
ſcore, and if this cloſe with that, ye may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
to looſe your Mayden-head, it is onely this
makes the too-much beleeving wenches deſpaire
of their virginitie, his braines are tormented
with new inventions, fancie leades him to a fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
next <hi>lunaticke,</hi> and if hee eſcape madneſſe it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3538:34"/>
ſelfe, hee may thanke GOD. Hee ſpendes the
time in his Chamber, with no other thing but
with a great Looking-glaſſe, how to take off his
Hatt, how to make his geſture, and in a diſcourſe
how to frame the motion of his hands, to kiſſe
his finger, to make courteſie with his legge, to
ſet his arme, to ſmile, to looke aſide, to walke,
and then hee ſtands gazing on the full proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his owne bodie, which J ſweare is not elſe
but the verie true image of ſuperſtitious vanitie.
When the Miſtreſſe of his deſires beholdes the
Lovers dilligent attendance, then to keepe the
Lover ſtill proude in a ſlaviſh ſervice, often times
ſhee will in a willing ſloathfulneſſe, make her
Gloue or anie ſuch thing fall, that hee ſtouping
may attaine to that looked-for-honour, to kiſſe
what hee takes vp, and ſo receaue a ſmile for his
offitious <hi>humour:</hi> Hee will entertaine her dogge,
keepe her Fanne, call to light Torches, holde vp
the Tapeſtrie, bring the Coach, and with a
loude voyce hee will call, to make way for my
Lady, to make vowes, weare favours, and doe
pennance, they are the true follies of idle loue,
but once beeing cooled of that hote and luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
frenzie, O howe will hee then bluſh at his
owne folly, when hee beginnes to examine his
wits, and conſiders with him ſelfe how farre hee
hath gone aſtray. But what can be ſaide to ſuch
who wants grace to make a retreat, but ſtill dwels
in that endleſſe miſerie, they never wearie,
but thinkes all ſlaviſh paines pleaſure, ſome by
<pb facs="tcp:3538:35"/>
night with muſick, ſome with walking in her ſight,
ſome with gifts, ſongs, letters, and convoyes, every
one by degree doeth pouſe his Fortune, and every
one by degrees counterfets their betters. I often
ſmiled to ſee a Pandorly-fuſtian-Raſcall, lead a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinarie-Perpetuana-drab,
there is nothing invented
and put in practiſe by higher eſtates, but the baſer
ſort doe ſtill ſtriue to imitate, and chiefly in appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.
It is moſt true that a man is to be commended,
if he be cleanly, and chiefly in his linings, his haire
well dreſſed, his beard well bruſhed, and alwayes
his vpper lip well curled, with an freſado vp-ſtart,
as if every haire would threaten to pull out his eyes,
for if he chance to kiſſe a Gentlewoman, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
haire may happen to ſtartle in her noſe,
and make her ſneeſe, ſo by this meanes, he applies
both phiſick &amp; courteſie at one time, then he may
freely ſay, God bleſſe you Lady, receaving back
the chirping Eccho of <hi>I thenk you ſir.</hi> But looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
on the other part of ſnotty noſd Gentlemen,
with their drouping muſtaches covering their
mouth, and becomes a harbroy to meldrops, and
a ſucking ſponge to al the watery diſtillations of the
head, he will not ſpare but drinke with any bodie
whatſoever, and after hee hath waſhed his filthie
beard in the cup, and drawing out dropping, he wil
ſuck the haire ſo hartily with his vnder lip. I aske
at Civility, if ſuch a poyſonnous ſup can be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome?
of if the kiſſe of ſuch a ſlavering mouth be
ſweet? Farre may ſuch beaſtly filthineſſe be from
handſome and perfit men, who ſtil attends vpon the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3538:35"/>
handy labour of pittifull Ladies, if a Lady be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
woman indeede, and ſtill aymes at honeſtie:
what although ſhe hit not the marke of gentilitie?
yet the pendicles of her deſires ſhould be cleanly:
as ſhe her ſelfe is moſt daintie, neate, pollite, and
fine in all things, and chiefly in her ſleeping cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to ſee the whitenes of her linings, the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
of her night-cloathes, her chamber-pot fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with ſweet flowers (to ſtay the ſtur of water) her
perfumed odours, ſweet-waſhing-balls, Poman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſundry ſorts of ſmelling waters, fannes, hatts,
feathers, glaſſes, combs, brouches, ruffes, falling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
red and white face-colours, ſcarfes, vardin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales,
artifitiall locks of curled haire, with vp-ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-friſadoes,
their ſmoothing-skin-clouts, night-ſmocks,
muffels, maskes, petticotes, waiſtcoates,
gownes, picadels, attires, chaines, carkats, caſes,
coffers, boxes, and many things more, that if a man
intrude him ſelfe in a Ladies bed-chamber, &amp; look
vpon every thing about him, he ſhal think him ſelfe
to be no elſe where, but in an evil deformed ſhop of
Merchandiſe. But on the other part, looke vpon
filthineſſe it ſelfe, when ſome women in a ſluttiſh
eſtate, hath their bed-chamber like a ſwines-ſtie,
ill-favoured (and vnſcoured) Piſpot, their combs
and bruſhes, full of looſe haire and filth, their foule
ſmocks ill laid-vp, their knotty phlegme and ſpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the walls and floore, the black and ſlaverie
circle on their lips, ſweating, ſmoaking, and broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in their vncleane-ſheetes, that if any would
hold their head within the bed, I thinke the ſtrong
<pb facs="tcp:3538:36"/>
ſmell were an excellent preſervatiue againſt the
Peſt, and none like it, except it be the jumbling of a
Jakes, or of a Cloſe-ſtoole: for it is a true Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme,
that the force of ſuch odious and hatefull
ſmells, doth occupie the ſence, and holdes out the
peſtiferous aire of the Plague, GOD forbid, but
the beaſtly filthineſſe of ſome women, ſhould
make the delicate and fine faſhions of other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
(who are civill and honeſt) appeare pleaſant.
And even ſo, why ſhould not the graue and good
life of a diſcreete woman (who feares GOD)
make the filthie faſhions of an harlot (whoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are moſt abhominable) appeare loathſome to
the world? and ſtill to be diſdained and hated of all
honeſt Matrones. What a monſtrous thing is it,
when a ſhameleſſe woman caries the jewell of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie</hi>
on her fore-head, giving her boldneſſe
to exploit any thing, and to execute all her fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
actions without anie reguard: Farre be it
from mee to crie out againſt the modeſt Matrone,
the chaſte Widowe, or yet to miſconſter the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
behaviour of an honeſt Virgine, whoſe edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is true Vertue, who reſolues conſtantlie,
and performes wiſely, and whoſe doubtſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
are all mixtured with feare, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with a Virgine bluſh, in everie thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete,
a graue geſture, a ſpotleſſe ſpeech, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
ſmile, and a chaſte minde, and whoſe
thoughts are not polluted with leacherous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites:
Such ſort of women are to be valued at
a high price, they are of great worth, and moſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3538:36"/>
worthie to be honoured and eſteemed of by all
men, when vilde and brutiſh women (that is rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of all vertue, and loaden with vice) makes the
tranſparent perfection of a good woman ſeeme
glorious to the ſecret ſight of God, and to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhew of the world? ſo J do what I can to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the skild Painter, who makes a darke ſhadow,
giue a bright luſter (&amp; an ſhining life) to his vpright
colours. Why ſhould not filthie kennels avoyde
the corrupted excraments of Nature from faire
ſtreetes? And why ſhould I not ſtriue to make an
honeſt behaviour, ſpurne at a ſhameleſſe geſture?
and I doe not doubt but the wiſer ſort will ſpurne
at the increaſe of ſuch ſuperſtitious vanities that are
in this preſent age, and the great aboundance
of idle, ſtrange, and new invented toyes: as
when ſome women deckes and trimmes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

Yet there are many men and women whom
God hath bleſſed with children, who are vnworthy

will poſſes all the parts of her bodie? what pittifull

for all theſe torments, greefes, and vexations, ſome

O How farre (beholde) doeth it goe beyond
the reatch of mans capacitie to ponder the
great and wondrous workes of GOD,
when we meditate vpon his miracles, to ſee the
frame of every thing, preſenting ſuch ſtrange ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
this large proſpect of Heaven and Earth, the
admirable operations of every thing which hath
bene wroght, and ſtill works in the ſwift courſe of
time; and when we haue conſidered all that we
can, or may, we ſhall ſee that mankinde of all other
creatures, are moſt ingrate to his Creator. So that
this great and vniverſall Glob, whoſe ſpatious
ſhoulders is over-lodned with the wickedneſſe of
mankinde, and wearied with the heavy burthen of
weghtie ſinne, and the vnnaturall ſtrife in all
kinde of eſtates, even from the ritch Monarch to
the poore begger. We may ſee Kings oppoſde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Kings, theſe great and earthly powers tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph

ſhall never get mercy, all his abhominations ſhall
not leaue him, but ſhall follow him and accuſe him,
his ambition, and the complaints of the oppreſſed,
ſhall condemne his Soule. And what is all this
world, it is noght elſe but a ſtage where euery one
acts their parte, and then makes an eternall retret
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3538:48"/>
without returne, Heavens incloſtred powers looks
downe, and they ſee all the dulfull Tragedies of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recalled

of mankinde, how many folies are acted vpon
this ſtage, for the moſt parte playes the <hi>Buffone,</hi> and
all their life is but a pleaſant Comedy, and with the
<hi>Ethnick</hi> they cry out, <hi>Ede, bibe, dorme, poſt Mortem,
nulla voluptas.</hi> Vpon the other parte we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
the picture of true repentance, painted with
ten thouſand miſeries, the pittifull geſture of men,
how vnlawfull Law hes made miſerable, the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerd
Marchant, who hath bankerd-out his credit:
the Artiſan whom age and ſicknes brings to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
and we may ſee how the threed-bare Catio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
goeth with melancholious grones, diſperſing
the ſighs of his greeved minde in the Aire: we may
ſee how the curious <hi>Alchamiſt</hi> in ſeeking the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher-ſtone,</hi>
with continuall travell, and far-ſoght
inventions hath wrung out all the ſubſtance of his

wealth, ſo till at laſt, his ſweating labors, rypes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but ſmooke. O then, his repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes
to challenge time, when all his ſmooking
hopes are vaniſhed in the aire, in end, he payeth his
debt to Death, and dyeth a begger. And we may
ſee the <hi>Necromancer,</hi> one who hath ſtudied the black
Art, for a little borrowed (and yet a very vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine)
tyme dambs his owne ſoule, and giues it as
a proper tribute to Hell, and why? becauſe with
the <hi>Arch-deuils</hi> direction, he will command all the

<pb facs="tcp:3538:49"/>
pleaſure which brings nothing with it, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
horror. Now when all men hath acted their
parte vpon this vniverſall ſtage, then comes Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanding
Death, &amp; ſwiftly cryes to every one,
<hi>Away gette you gone, your parte is playde.</hi> So with his
Imperiall Darte, he ſtreaketh all kinde of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
without reſpect, and then with his reuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
hand, he draweth the darke Courtaine of the
Graue, over the paill bodie of mankinde. So ſhall
thy ſoule compeare before the Great Spectator of
Heaven, who hath ſeene all thy actions, and how
thou haſt plaide thy parte in this world, there the
booke is opened where all thy doings are in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter,
if they be vpright, then art thou crowned
in the Majeſticall Throne of Eternall Glory; if
thy actions and doinges be falſe, and found deceat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
if thou haſt ſtopped thy eares, and woulde

Good Chriſtian Reader, againe I will requeſt
thee, and all ſinners, to print this in the depth of thy
heart: And I my ſelfe, I confeſſe to be a moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
ſinner, when I thinke vpon the loſſe of preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
time, it ſhrills my wearie ſoule with griefe, it
wearies my dayes, and diſturbs my reſt: with that
holy Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> I crie to God with a repenting
heart: <hi>O Lord, remember not the ſinnes of my youth,
nor my ignorance, but according to thy great mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3538:51"/>
thou me, euen for thy goodnes ſake, O Lord:</hi>
The workes of our Lord God are great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous,
they are incomprehenſible, and yet his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
exceedes all his ſtupendious workes, therefore
once more let vs conſider ſo neere as wee can the
great works of God, the creating of all things. <hi>The
heauens</hi> (ſayes the Prophet <hi>Dauid) ſets forth his glory,
and the firmament ſhewes the workes of his hands:</hi> The
earth, the ſeas, and all living creatures therein, the
ſtrange courſe of every thing in heaven in earth, &amp;
the naturall inclination of all living creatures. Look
on the ſeas how they are limited, that they ſhall not
paſſe their bounds, but keepes their due courſe:
Looke on the creation of mankinde, he hath made
vs according to his owne image, and of the verie
dirt and ſlime of the earth hath he created and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vs, he hath alſo made vs ſubject to many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of Nature, the filthineſſe of our fleſh, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementall
corruption of many ſundry and ſtrange
diſeaſes, which are naturall, and inſident both to
man and woman: And what would this carcaſe of
ours be, if it had not the change of cleane cloathes?
it would be naught elſe but a maſſe of vermine, and
with time the ſmell of our fleſh would be loathſom,
and ſo in the end wee would putrifie and conſume
to naught. O man, why is all this done? onely to
baſe our pride, and God hath done it to let vs ſee
what ſtuffe wee are made of: and what bath our
good God done more? Within this earthly veſſell
of our body, he hath placed a ſoule made of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and heavenly ſubſtance, adorned with all her
<pb facs="tcp:3538:52"/>
faculties, and garniſhed with reaſon: The Prophet
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Hebr. 2. Cap.</note> 
               <hi>Little inferiour to the Angels.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all this, he hath caſt vnder our feete all kinde
of other creatures,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. cap.</note> and aboue all his workes that
work of vdſpeakable loue, that miraculous worke
of our redemption, and yet the mercie of our Lord
God goes farre aboue, and farre exceedes all his
wondrous works: for the holy Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayes,
<hi>The Lord is good and kinde to all, and his mercies are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all his great and wondrous works,</hi> And heare what
our good &amp; loving God ſayes more with his owne
mouth:<note place="margin">Eſay. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The mountaines ſhall remoue, the hills ſhall fall
downe, but my mercie ſhall not depart from thee: neither
ſhall I breake the couenant of my peace, ſaith the Lord,
that hath compaſsion on thee?</hi> What great and true
confidence may we then haue in Gods mercie? he
ſayes againe by the mouth of his Prophet:<note place="margin">Eſay. 30. Cap.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord
doth attend the ſinners conuerſion, to the end he may take
mercy on him, and thereby be exalted:</hi> Yet heare more
what God ſpeakes to <hi>Ezechiel</hi> the Prophet: <hi>Say vnto
them, as I liue, ſaith the Lord God, I deſire not the death
of the wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">33. Cap.</note> 
               <hi>but that the ſinner ſhould turn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſinful
life &amp; liue:</hi> And farther, with what great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion
goes he on to allure &amp; perſwade his people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert:
O ſayes he, <hi>Turne you turne you from your wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
for why will you periſh and die, O you houſe of Iſraell:</hi>
How many kind &amp; loving perſwaſions doth our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God giue vs to draw neere, and come home to
him. What gentle &amp; kind corrections? what large
and great ſpace of repentance? what wonderfull &amp;
ſweet Parables of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3538:52"/>
Evangell: Of the good ſheepheard who brought
back the ſheep vpon his ſhoulders, which had gone
aſtray, what joy and feaſting makes hee with his
friends, and of the honeſt woman when ſhee findes
her loſt peace of ſiluer. And the pittifull father with
teares of mercie &amp; compaſſion receaved his forlorn
ſonne, with what joy and gladnes did hee embrace
him. Here doth our ſweet Saviour <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſhew what
great joy is in heaven at the convertion of a ſinner.
Our loving God again entring in more conference
with the ſinner, he begins to reaſon with him: <hi>Thou
ſayest that I am ritch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. S. Iohn. 3. Cap.</note> 
               <hi>and encreaſed with goods, and full

thou not know how poore thou art? how wretched? how
miſerable? how blinde? and how naked thou art?</hi> Then
our Saviour goes on with ſweet perſwading ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to allure the ſinner, ſaying: <hi>I counſell thee to buy
of me gold, tried be the fire, that thou mayeſt be made
ritch, and white rayment, that thou mayeſt be cloathed,
and that thy filthie nakedneſſe may not be ſeene, and anoint
thine eyes with eye-ſalue, that thou mayeſt ſee:</hi> And when
he with chaines of loue keepes his owne faſt to him,
he ſayes, <hi>As many as I loue, I rebuke and chaſten, be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
therefore and amend.</hi> Now againe at laſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with fervent compaſſion, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the

would the heart of mankinde craue? or what

<pb facs="tcp:3538:53"/>
the dore of his heart to entertaine ſuch a worthie
gueſt of infinite loue and mercie, even Chriſt Jeſus
the onely ſonne of God omnipotent: he gaue his
life to ranſone the ſoules of ſinners, he left the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
heavens for our cauſe, and cloathed him ſelfe
with our wilde and filthy nature. Many yeeres did
he preach, he ſuffered cold, hunger, and reproach,
he was tempted, and faſted forty dayes in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes,
in the agony of his Prayers, he ſweat bloud,
he was tortured, ſold, and impriſoned, his head was
crowned with ſharpe thornes, his body torne with
ſcourges, he was mocked, buffeted, and ſpet in the
face, his body hung on the Croſſe betwixt two
theeues, and his armes out-ſtretched, his hands and
feete peirced with nailes of iron, and his ſide and
heart wounded to death, neither was we bought
with ſiluer, gold, or pretious ſtones, but with the
infinite price of the bloud, and life of our <hi>Sauiour
Ieſus Christ,</hi> the onely ſonne of our ever-living
God. O it was our ſinnes and wickednes put him
to death, and laid all his cruell torments on him, it
was our wickednes made him faſt forty dayes when
he was tempted in the wildernes, we crowned his
Imperiall head with ſharpe thornes, we bound his
delicate armes with cords, wee mocked him, wee
ſtripped him naked, and ſcourged his bleſſed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
we buffeted and ſpat in his moſt glorious face,
we laid the Croſſe on his patient ſhoulders, we caſt

who peirced and wounded his heart, and it was
wee who made him in his cruell paines of death,
cry out in his laſt paſſion, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt
thou forſaken me:</hi> All this, and much more hath our

<hi>Surely he hath borne our infirmities, and caried our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowee,
yet we did judge &amp; eſteeme him plagued, and ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

traſgreſsions, it was for our iniquities he was puniſhed,</hi>
The burthen of our ſinnes was laide on his backe
like a ſimple ſheepe, ſo was he led to the ſlaughter,
in patient ſilence ſuffered he all ſorts of paines, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was wickednes with him, fraud nor deceit was
never found in his mouth: this Innocent was put

Captaine Chriſt to ſay, <hi>You haue left me in time of
temptations:</hi> this lets vs ſee how feeble wee are of
our ſelues, and that without the helpe of God wee
are nothing, nor can doe nothing. Our omnipotent
God diminiſhed the Camp of <hi>Ierubaall,</hi> and with a

what the wiſedome of God ſayes,<note place="margin">Prou. 19. cap.</note> 
               <hi>Many deuiſes are
in a mans heart, but the counſell of the Lord God ſhall
ſtand:</hi> Thou mayeſt flatter thy ſelfe with many faire

the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay,<note place="margin">Philip. 4. cap.</note> 
               <hi>I am able to doe all things
through the helpe of Christ which ſtrengthneth me,</hi> and
when it pleaſes God to lay a croſſe vpon the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of any Chriſtian, that he may be glorified, and
to be a chaine of loue to bring thee to him, and to
keepe thee faſt with him: how will he helpe thee to
beare thy Croſſe? how will he draw the forward?
and how will he peace, and peace releeue thee and
ſet thee free:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. cap.</note> is it not written, <hi>Our God is faithfull,
and he will not ſuffer vs to be tempted aboue our ſtrength,</hi>
Hee will lay no more on thee then thou art able to

he ſayes, <hi>I chaſtice them whom I loue, for the Lord
your God doth try and proue you to know, if you loue your
Lord God with all your heart, and with all your ſoule.</hi>
Now in this meane time of his aduerſitie, what
comfortable ſpeeches? and what great aſſurance
giues he by his Prophet <hi>Dauid, He called on me</hi> (ſayes
he) <hi>and I heard him when he is in trouble, I am with him,
and I will deliuer him, and ſet him free, and I will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
him.</hi> Now when a man or woman is burthened
with any worldly croſſe, can he goe to a better (or
can he goe to a more loving and wiſer) Counſailer,
to diſcharge the burthen of his griefe to, then to
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who knowes what is mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
for the <hi>Intellectum tibi dabo et instruam te in wia
hac qua gradieris, firmabo ſuper te occulos meos,</hi> J will
(ſayes he) giue thee vnderſtanding, and I will teach
thee how and what way thou ſhalt winne free of
thy trouble, and I ſhall ever fixe my eyes vpon thee.
Now wilt thou but looke on all the great rulers and
<pb facs="tcp:3538:56"/>
principalities in this world. From the mighty and
ritch Monarch to the baſe and poore begger. And
tell me who can ſay he hath no Croſſe: beleeue me
not any, for that man hath not beene, nor for the
preſent is not, but he hath vexation, a griefe, and
a continuall croſſe. What although hee appeare
to the eyes of this worlde, moſt content in earthly
glory, in ritches or authority, yet for all that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
night that day was never but hee had ſomwhat
to repent him ſelfe of. Then thou who art croſt, wil
thinke in thy heart, and ſay: O this man or woman
are happie, they haue no tribulation, they haue no
fighting with this world, their minde is in peace
and quietneſſe, they liue ſecure, and are crowned
Kings of their owne deſires. O foole, thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
for what is all our chiefeſt joy in this vale
of miſerie? euen nothing elſe but a ſunne-ſhine
pleaſure, bringing nothing with it but a grievous
ſtorme of infinite cares: O but what remedie, euen
this muſt be thy onely remedie, to ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Dauid, Tribulationem &amp; dolorem inueni &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
domini inuocaui,</hi> In the time of my tribulation
and griefe, I called vpon the name of the Lord, hee
is the true Phiſitian that muſt heale thy ſores, and
be aſſured he will ſay to thee as hee ſaid to S. <hi>Paul</hi>
in his great temptations, <hi>Sufficit tibi gratia mea,</hi>
My grace is ſufficient to ſtrengthen thee, to keepe
thee, and defend thee in thy greateſt conflict, and
to be a ſtrong and mightie bulwarke againſt all
temptations, and aboue all things, let vs that are
ſinners and grievous offenders of GOD, thinke
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3538:56"/>
and aſſure our ſelues that it is onely our owne
iniquities, and wicked life, which procures our
croſſe of tribulation: O then let vs not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
againſt GOD, but let vs looke to our owne
ſinfull life, that is the onely originall of all our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries:
how ought we then to repent, for it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ſinne diſpleaſes GOD, and nothing can pleaſe
him but repentance and mourning. Heere I will
ſet thee downe this compariſon: <hi>Take eye-ſalue and
applie it to any feaſtred part of thy bodie, it will neither
helpe nor releeue thee of thy paine, but take that eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalue
and applied to thy eye, it will helpe and releeue thy
eye. Euen ſo take mourning, and applie it to the loſſe of
ritches, it doth no good, applie mourning to the loſſe of
friends, it doeth no good, applie mourning to the loſſe of
honour, it doeth no good: but applie the teares of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to thy feaſtred ſoule, it will doe good, it will bathe
thy feaſtred ſoule, it will embalme and mollifie her
wounds, and giue thee a true comfort in thy ſweete Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> It is onely he who will heare thy
lamentations, conſider thy diſtreſſe, and exhauſt vp
thy reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance in his mercy. When thou art wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
&amp; faints, he is the true fountaine who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
thy wearied ſpirit, he calls vpon all that are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated
and oppreſſed: <hi>If any man be thirſtie, let him
come vnto me, and hee ſhall haue drinke.</hi> How joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
may the thirſtie ſinner be,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. cap.</note> to haue acceſſe to
come and drinke of the true fountaine of life: heare
yet againe what ſweete conſolation hee powres in
thy heart by his Prophet:<note place="margin">Nahum. 1. cap.</note> 
               <hi>I haue afflicted thee alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and I will not afflict thee againe:</hi> As he would ſay,
<pb facs="tcp:3538:57"/>
there ſhall not come from me a double tribulation.
Now good Chriſtian, how may thy troubled ſoule
repoſe vpon this loving and infallible promiſe. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and conſtant <hi>Iob,</hi> in the middes of his torturing
griefe,<note place="margin">Iob. 18. cap.</note> cries out to God, <hi>Although he kill me, yet wil
I truſt in him:</hi> and to animate thee, and to giue the
more ſtoutnes, that in aduerſitie thou be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne:
The royall Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> cries to thee
with great courage, <hi>Expecta dominum viriliter age,
&amp; confortetur cor tuum &amp; ſustine dominum:</hi> Truſt in
the Lord, and fight manfully, our Lord will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
thy heart, and therefore abide his will, for the
Lord our God will not leaue thee, hee will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from thee? what great confidence hath this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man had in GOD, for in the beginning of this
Pſalme, he ſayes, <hi>Seeing God is the protector of my life,
who can harme me:</hi> And againe, with great aſſurance
he ſayes, <hi>Si conſistant aduerſum me castra non timebit
cor meum: ſi exurgat aduerſum me prelium, in hoc ego
ſperabo,</hi> Giue whole armies were comming againſt
me, I ſhall not care, but hope in God, then hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
with this requeſt: <hi>I haue ſought one thing of
thee my God, that I may dwell all the dayes of my life in
thy houſe, and that I may ſee the glory and beautie of thy
Temple.</hi> Then when this bleſſed man begins to
thinke vpon the wondrous benefits of God beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
on him with joy and gladnes of heart, he cries
out and ſayes, <hi>What ſhall I render the Lord for all his
benefits beſtowed vpon me, I will take the cup of ſaluation,
and call vpon the name of the Lord:</hi> If wee poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
creatures, would meditate vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
<pb facs="tcp:3538:57"/>
loue of GOD of his long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and gentle patience. How ſlow is he to wrath,
and how ſwift is he to mercy, what wrongs doeth
he receaue? <hi>They haue</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>repayed euil for good.</hi>
Then when he perceaved their great vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
their dulneſſe and hardneſſe of heart, and
that all what he did, could not moue his people to
turne to him. Then he cryeth out in great paſſion,
<hi>O ye Heauens be aſtoniſhed at this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iere. 2. cap.</note> 
               <hi>be affraied, and vtterly
confounded.</hi> And yet with more vehemence be his
Prophet, he ſayeth, <hi>Heare O Heauens, and harken O
Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay. 1. cap.</note> 
               <hi>for the Lord hath ſaid, I haue nuriſhed and brought
vp children, and they haue rebelled againſt me: The Oxe
knoweth his owner, &amp; the aſſe knoweth his maiſters crib,
but yet my people knoweth not me: Woe be to this ſinfull
Nation, a people loaden with iniquitie, a wiked ſeed, and
corrupt children, they haue forſaken their Lord, they
haue prouocked the holy one of Iſrael to anger, and they
haue gone backwarde.</hi> What an heavy lamentation
is this, how grievous was this complaint to the
Almighty GOD to make vpon baſe and filthy,
wake and worthleſſe, creeping vermeine of the
Earth, whom the twinkling of his eie, might haue
deſtroyed, and with the ſmalleſt breath of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
brought an infinite number of worlds to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<hi>Who can ſtand before his wrath,</hi> ſaieth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

               <note place="margin">Nahum. 1. cap.</note> 
               <hi>his wrath is powred out like fire, and the rocks and

that heavy and terrible wrath of GOD, even that
<pb facs="tcp:3538:58"/>
wrath, I ſay, which moues the Mountaines and
makes the hilles to trimble. Look (good Reader) and
thou ſhalt ſee how the ſparkes of GODS furious

and afflict vs aboue meaſure?</hi> As he wold ſay, wilt thou
not take compaſſion vpon vs, and wilt thou not

the Mountaine of Amendement, and then
lookes forth from the turrat of a good-life, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the filthy ſhape, and the ougly portrate of ſin.
<pb facs="tcp:3538:60"/>
O how will he then deteſt himſelfe that hath bene
ſo long ſwatring in that filthie myre, in that ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
puddle of ſinne, putrified with all abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and how loathſome will ſuch company be to
him thereafter, he will eſchew them as a contagious
peſt, and ſay with the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Diſcedi te à
me omnes qui operamini iniquitatem quoniam exaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit
Dominus vocem fletus mei,</hi> Goe from me all ye
workers of iniquitie, becauſe my GOD hath
heard my weeping voice, and hath receaved my
prayer, or elſe he will intreate the wicked man with
gentle perſwaſions, with good examples, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
admonitions to ſhake off that filthie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
habiet which infects the ſoule, and keepes
him back, and debarres him from the loue of GOD
and makes the Death of Chriſt to be for him in
vaine. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangeleſt ſayeth, It is onely to
them who beleeveth in him,<note place="margin">1. cap.</note> that hee hath given
power to be the ſonnes and children of GOD. It
is moſt ſure that onely want of faith maketh the
ſinner obſtinate, he is a lyer and can not beleue in
GOD. O thou poore and diſtreſſed creature looke
vpon thine owne miſerable eſtate, how thou gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops
poſt to hell, and will not looke back but goeth
on thy cairleſſe journey! When we walke alone
on the fields, when we walk ſolitare in our chalmer,
when we ly in our bed, will we but meditate vpon
the fearfull and terrible Majeſtie of GOD (whom
all the Heavens can ſcarce containe) of his vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
glory, of his Almightie power. And it is onely
this great and Omnipotent <hi>Iehouah</hi> that we offend,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3538:60"/>
               <hi>To thee onely haue I ſinned,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dauid.</hi> And let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how for the eating of a ſillie apple, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trare
the Lords commandement, he condemned all
mankinde, and nothing could appeaſe his wrath,
nor yet ranſome the world, but the bloud and death
of his owne dearly beloved Sonne Jeſus Chriſt.
When wee thinke on this ſeveritie, and of GODS
terrible anger againſt ſinne, how loath ſhould we
be to offend GOD, and yet in very contempt
of GOD the wicked man will perſeveir in all
kinde of wickedneſſe, and ſtill deferre his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
till at laſt there ſhall be no time given him,
yea, not the halfe quarter of an houres minute gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him. Heare how the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaieth of
ſuch men, <hi>Convertentur ad veſperam, &amp; famem patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
vt canes &amp; circuibunt civitatem:</hi> And in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
they ſhall convert, they ſhall runne about the
Cittie, and barke like dogs, they ſhall houle for
meate, but ſurelie they ſhall not be ſatiſfied. O
that in time we wold take heed to this woful ſpeech!
And what more? GOD will mock them, and hold
them in derifion. It is to theſe that our Saviour will
ſay,<note place="margin">Mat. 25 cap.</note> 
               <hi>Neſcio vos,</hi> I knowe you not. Why? Becauſe
you had no Oyle in your lampes. And when he
hath knowen them, and all their wicked deedes
(which ſhall be accuſers of them, and laid open
to beare teſtimonie againſt them) O what will
he then ſay to them? <hi>Ite malidicti in ignem aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi>
Goe you accurſed vnto the eternall fire of
Hell. And beſides all this, remember the ſharpe rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
muſt be made, when the leaſt idle word
<pb facs="tcp:3538:61"/>
we ſpeake, we muſt giue a count of it. O GOD
according to the multitude of thy mercies, be
mercifull to vs miſerable ſinners, in that fearfull and
terrible day of judgement. In time convert vs O
Lord, and we ſhall be converted. How happie is
that man who can withſtand the dangers of this
life with a well reſolved minde, and ſtill calles on
GOD to aſſiſt him in all his actions, for the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of this world, are many, and wondrous
ſtrong. The devill is ſubtle, and we are eaſily inſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and this our fleſh is exceeding ſubject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
infirmities. So that without Gods helpe we are
not able of our ſelues to fight. Then with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Dauid,</hi> Let vs all ſay, O Lord fight for vs, how
feeble, how weak, and faint-hearted are we? When
the leaſt blaſt of affliction ruines, all our ſtrength,
we can not ſtand after we ar raiſed vp, but preſently
falles againe, and turnes to our former wickedneſſe,
notwithſtanding of our repentance, and promeiſt
amendement. We haue no force to command
our ſelues. We periſh in our owne paſſions, and
moſt cowardly yeeldes to all ſorts of ſinnes. Thus
are we made ſlaues to our owne infirmities, in ſo
far that we make no kinde of reſiſtance to the ſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
motion. Concerning the paſſion of anger S.
<hi>Paul</hi> writting to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> he ſayeth, <hi>Be angry,
but ſinne not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. cap.</note> 
               <hi>neither let the Sunne goe downe vpon your
wrath.</hi> This paſſion of anger is exceeding perillous,
for in that time that it doeth poſſeſſe the heart, it
for careth nothing, nor hath no reſpect to thinges
preſent, nor thinges to come: the fury of anger is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3538:61"/>
is the higheſt degrie of ſelf-madneſſe. The <hi>Italian</hi>
ſpeaking of the nature and condition of anger, He
ſayeth, <hi>Ira è breve furor, è chinol frena, è furor, longa
che el ſuo poſſeſſorè ſpeſſo à vergogno è talhor mena à
morte,</hi> Anger is a ſhort furie, and to him who
will not brydle it, it is a longſome furie, which
bringeth the poſſeſſour, either to ſhame or death.
That happie and learned Father Saint <hi>Aguſtein,</hi>
makes a very godlie and religious diſcourſe in his
conflict of vertue and vyce; firſt he maketh anger
to ſpeake, <hi>Quae aequanimiter ergate ferri non poſſunt
haec patienter ommino tollerare peccatum eſt, quia niſi
eis cum magna exaſperatione reſiſtatur, contra te de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inceps
ſine menſura cumulantur:</hi> Who will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
themſelues well towardes you, it is a ſinne to
ſuffer ſuch wrongs with patience, becauſe if thou
reſiſt them not with great bitterneſſe, and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
heatred of heart, they will (without all kinde
of meaſure) heape more vengence on thee. But
deere Chriſtian, heare how he maketh Patience
to anſwere, <hi>Si paſsio Redemptoris ad mentem redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur,
nihil tam durum quod non aeque toleretur,
quanta enim ſunt haec quae patimur comparatione illius?

But if thou woldeſt call to minde the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of our Maiſter and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,
There is nothing in the world ſo greivous or
heavie that thou woldeſt not ſuffer. Alas, what
can we ſuffer in reſpect of him, he ſuffered ſhame,
<pb facs="tcp:3538:62"/>
and mocking, contumelies, buffets, ſpitting in his
face, ſcourges, and the Crowne of thorne; and laſt
of all, he was Crucified: and we poore ſoules are
over-throwne with ſimple ſpeech, a word caſts vs
downe. O what a bright mirror may the Patience
of Chriſt be to man, even in his greateſt wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and miſery. Let him call to minde the Paſſion
of our Saviour, and then we ſhall ſee what great
oddes is betwix his ſuffering and our ſuffering. It is
onely the example of ſuch a kinde and loving ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
will giue the patience, if thou confideſt in
Chriſt and art a true Chriſtian, <hi>Doctrina viri per pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientiam
noſcitur.</hi> Againe, will we deeply conſider,
and we ſhal finde that in this tranſetoreous life, that
our eſtate is but meere miſery, and a continuall
change of ſorrow; ſo our beſt is not elſe, but vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of minde, and greef vpon greef. We are heere
in this world like the diſeaſed creature, warſling,
and ſtil turning on a bed of ſorrow, burdained with
ſicknes, and can finde no repoſe, no ſatled lare,
nor no reſt to our reſtles tortring-tribulations. Or
we are here like the wearied <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> who in many
forraine Countries, far from his owne ſoyle, liveth
exiled from his naturall home, and ſtill wandering
through many ſtrange parts, in ſundry perels, and
divers dangers of his life, ſpending his dayes, and
moſt parte of his nights in reſtleſſe travell, he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the ſolitary deſerts, and wanders along the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
wilderneſſe; ſome-times oppreſſed with the
vehemency of heat, and ſome-times tormented
with the extremity of colde, when charitable harts
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3538:62"/>
affords him hoſpitality, and refreſhment to his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
bowels, how contented will he be, and how
welcome will that reſt and repoſe be, then he be
ginneth to recall his paſt perrels to a reckoning,
when all his paines are turned to pleaſure, and
when his longſome journey ends, which brings an
end to all his miſeries, when his fatigations is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed,
and his peregrinations hath no farther
courſe, then rypeth he a fruitfull harveſt, a joyfull
ſeaſon, and al the wearied <hi>Pilgrims</hi> paines are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in pleaſure. We are all on earth going our
pilgramage, toſting and tumbling vpon the large
and depe Seaes of this world, threatned with the
devouring gulfes of temptations, and ſtill allured
with the glittering vanities of this preſent life.
Chriſt Jeſus being our carefull Pilot, he crieth to vs
poore paſſingers, and bids vs take heed to our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,
that we periſh not in our paſſage, but that we
may be ſtill earneſt and watchfull, how to arryue
to that ſaif harbery of all tranquillitie, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
and eternall joy, which ſhall finiſh all our
troubleſome travels. How may the thought of this
progreſſe make vs to hate, to diſdaine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
the vain-glory of this world. O how ſhould
we cloſe our eies, and winke at ſuch abuſe, ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
vanities. Tell me who ever lived in

had moſt command over this world, but was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to dye, and after death, be (as it were) quyte
forgotten. Holy <hi>Iob</hi> ſayeth, <hi>That their memory ſhould

               <pb facs="tcp:3538:63"/>
ſaieth, <hi>That they ſhould be as duſt blowen abroad

is all our ornaments? Noght elſe but filth. Our
ſilkes and velvots which we wrap our ſelues in, is
noght elſe bot the excraments of wormes, and all
our eſtimations are but borrowed from beaſts, our
retches comes from the Centure of the earth. And
ſo all this that makes vs proud is but very filth.
Then what art thou, O man? Or what ſhall I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
thy ſelf to? to noght elſe but to duſt, and all thy
glory is but earth &amp; duſt, blowne before the winde,
thou art a maſſe of earth, wraped vp in earth. This

become proud? When we haue tryed all things in
this world, then with experience we will ſay, all
things are vaniſhing like ſmooke, &amp; nothing is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
