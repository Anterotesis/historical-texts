            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO ſatisfie your curioſity, knowing you to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with all News; but more eſpecially with that of Prodigies: witneſs your kind acceptance of my Letters to you upon the apparition of the Comets. I ſhall now give you an account of a Prodigious Army of <hi>Mice,</hi> that have lately invaded us, and have poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Rotterdam, Schedam,</hi> and many other places; their manner of Invaſion was as followeth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of this <hi>November,</hi> there was obſerved by the Inhabitants near to the <hi>Maes,</hi> whole ſholes of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſwimming towards the Shore; at firſt they were ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be ſmall Fiſh flying to the ſhore for their ſecurity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purſued by ſome ravenous Fiſh that ſought to devour them; but it proved quite otherwiſe: for theſe ſuppoſed Water ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals proved to be <hi>Water-Mice,</hi> creatures of the nature of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles,</hi> that can live in both the Elements. They were no ſooner Landed, but they, without asking leave, fell to tearing and rooting up Graſs, Plants, and what ever came in their way, ſaving the Plough-men a labour by turning up the Graſs, and making that which was before Paſture, good arrable Ground, well cleanſed and freed from Weeds; whether the Countrey-men do account theſe courteſies, I cannot tell: but their number makes them ſo undaunted, that they neither fear the <hi>States</hi> threatnings of ſending an Army of <hi>Cats</hi> againſt them, nor care for being Sued at Law for Treſpaſſers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They declare nothing but Free Quarter, and are of that generous and good Nature, that they never quarrel with their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, but ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> well contented with what they find in the Houſe. At their firſt coming they took up their Quarters in the Fields but now they have left off their Field-Quarters, and are com
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43742:3"/>
into our Towns, obſerving the common cuſtom of Armies to Summer in the Fields, and Winter in the Cities. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Prodigy hath been controverted by all perſons, whoſe Ingenuity leads them to a Scrutiny of things of this nature, as well Divines, Phyſicians, Lawyers and Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
            <p>The Divines conclude it to be a ſevere Judgement of God upon that Countrey, for the <hi>States</hi> tolerating all ſorts of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, under pretence of tolerating all ſorts of Religions.</p>
            <p>The Mathematicians are of the opinion that it is a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, but they will have the Cauſe of it, to be, not the tolerating of Religion, but their too much encroaching upon <hi>Neptune's</hi> Bounds; and it's feared by many, that theſe Creatures being ſo numerous, they may in time eat down the Banks, and give liberty to the Sea, to re-aſſume that which is its undoubted right.</p>
            <p>The Opinion of the Phyſicians, is, that appearance of theſe ſtrange Bodies in the Body-Politick, are certain Diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks of ſome ſtrange Malignant Diſtemper to happen; But coming to conſider what particular Diſtemper it might be that ſhould afflict the Countrey; One of the Company deſired to have a ſight of the States water, But that would not be granted at that time; But it was thus concluded concerning the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diſtemper; that in regard of thoſe dangerous Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes that do now appear, as the Generation of ſtrange Bodies, denotes a great Putrefaction of the Humours, the Ulceration and Corroſion of the interior parts, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the Animals, do argue ſome foul Diſeaſe, It is much to be feared that the Countrey this year will <hi>ſub Morbo Gallico laborare,</hi> as a nimble witted fellow amongſt them, ſuppoſing that it might be meant, that the <hi>French</hi> would invade the Land; anſwered, there was no fear of the <hi>French</hi> coming amongſt them, ſince the <hi>Mice</hi> had ſo devoured the Plants, that they could not pick one Sallet in the Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43742:3"/>
The Lawyers coming to conſider what might be the events of this Prodigy: Some determined; ſaying, that they were Prodigious Treſpaſſers; and in regard they lie skulking in holes and corners, and will not be taken by the lawful Proceſs of a Trap, they ought to be ſued to an Outlawry,</p>
            <p>The Aſtrologers have been a great while Calculating the Nativity of this Prodigie rectifying it by the Trutine of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, Animodar,</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and by accidents, which they ſay is the ſureſt way of Rectification; But as yet they cannot find the <hi>Aphaeta, Alcocoden,</hi> or <hi>Anareta</hi> of this Prodigie; ſo that it may be ſuppoſed that theſe <hi>Mice</hi> may prove a greater <hi>Flagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Aſtrologorum;</hi> then ever <hi>Picus</hi> of <hi>Mirandula</hi> was, or <hi>Lillies Gold Chain.</hi> They have put out a Book, which they call <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Aſtralis,</hi> or an account of the reaſons of the Generation of <hi>Mice,</hi> according to the Rules of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> of their Progreſs and Declination of ſeveral Prognoſtications raiſed therefrom, Predicting the preſent and future condition of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the ſeveral Accidents, whether good or bad, that ſhall happen to that State for Twenty years to come; By the next Pacquet you may expect the Book, which you may think worth your Reading. In the mean time take this ſhort account.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they tell us, that the eſtimate time of this Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Birth, was when the Sun entred <hi>Scorpio,</hi> a venimous watry Sign; and from this they conclude, that they were bred in the water, and have venimous teeth, becauſe Graſs, nor any thing elſe grows where they have once been. And about the ſame time <hi>Jupiter</hi> did oppoſe <hi>Mars,</hi> and ſquared <hi>Sol,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> was in oppoſition to <hi>Saturn,</hi> they do Predict from hence, that in regard that <hi>Jupiter</hi> is Significator of Lawyers and Divines: And <hi>Mars</hi> the general Significator of Soldiers, that there may be many Controverſies, Quarrels, Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Duels between thoſe of the Long Robe, and the Buff-Coats; Then <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſquaring <hi>Sol,</hi> doth ſhew that the Soldier will have the better on't at the Sword, and the Lawyer at his Tongue; the <hi>Moon</hi> in oppſition to <hi>Saturn,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43742:4"/>
doth plainly ſhew; that old Men will have the worſt of it, if they deal with young Women, <hi>Saturn</hi> being the ſignificator of old Men, and the <hi>Moon</hi> creſcent of young Women. From all theſe aforeſaid Aſpects, with other Tranſits; Revolution, Profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctional Figures, <hi>Speculums, Radices,</hi> with many more hard words, which you will find in their Book; They do conclude, that <hi>malum principium, malus finis ſequitur,</hi> the Conſequencies will be very Bad and Ominous, a Grand <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen either to the <hi>States,</hi> or ſome other Perſons; But what theſe Conſequencies are, they tell you, it is not ſafe to diſcover the Politick Secrets of the Nation; They intend therefore to ſee the Event, and then they will explain their Prognoſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and tell you, They did Predict all thoſe things that have happened, as <hi>Lilly</hi> Predicted the Kings Reſtauration by theſe words in his <hi>Merlin</hi>'s <hi>Propheſies; A Grand Cataſtrophe ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in</hi> England <hi>between the Years</hi> 1655, <hi>and</hi> 1665, <hi>in</hi> 10 <hi>Years over or under;</hi> Though in the ſame Book and Place, he ſaith poſitively the contrary.</p>
            <p>Thus having tired your Patience with Mens Opinions; I will come now to the Matter, and give you an account how great a trouble theſe inconſiderable Animals, whoſe number being conſiderable, makes them formidable.</p>
            <p>They deſtroy all our Proviſion, knawing holes through VVood, Cloath, &amp;c. ſo that nothing can preſerve our Bread, or other Proviſion from them, but Iron; And therefore many of our Inhabitants are fain to provide Cupboards made of Iron Plate; They do ſo increaſe, that we begin to fear they will devour us, as well as our Food; they being already ſo bold, as to come upon our Beds, and ſometimes bite us by the Toes, or Fingers. Great Care is taken for their Deſtruction, but all in vain, by Traps, Cats, Dogs, all ſignifie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing.</p>

The Burgo-Maſters at length approve of the Art, and deſired him to haſten the experiment.</p>
            <p>But ſince this, there hath been another Project thought on for freeing the Town.</p>
            <p>A <hi>German,</hi> who it ſeems, was born in the Town where the Pide Piper whiſtled the <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice</hi> out of the Town, and drew them into the River, doth affirm, That not long ſince, the Pipers Tomb was diſcovered by digging for ſome Mine, and in it was found the very Pipe, which hath been proved ſince by the ſame Experiment, making all the <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice</hi> in the Town to follow him that played upon it. This <hi>German</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertakes to procure this Pipe for a ſum of Money, and ſo to free us from theſe Vermine. The Papiſts are very importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with their Prieſts to Excommunicate them; and it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed amongſt them, that they have ſent to the Pope for a Bull to ſcarr them all away,</p>
            <p>We have no other News or Diſcourſe here, but concerning the <hi>Mice.</hi> I remember a Story that I have read in <hi>England</hi> of the like Prodigy in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> which put us in ſome comfort of being freed after ſome ſuch miraculous manner; The Story was thus,</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43742:5"/>
About <hi>November</hi> in the year 1581, in the Marſhes of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> Hundred, in a place called <hi>Southminſter,</hi> in the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> there ſuddenly appeared an Infinite and Prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Mice,</hi> which almoſt covered the whole Superficies of the ſaid Marſhes, treading and knawing the Graſs by the Roots, ſpoiling and tainting the ſame with their venimous teeth, in ſuch ſort, that the Cattle that graized thereon, were ſtruck with a Murrain, and many dyed thereof; which Vermin by all the Policie of Man could not be deſtroyed, till at laſt, it came to paſs, that there flocked together all about the ſame Marſhes a great number of <hi>Owls,</hi> whereby they were ſhortly after de li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the vexation of the <hi>Mice.</hi> The like of this was about that time in <hi>Kent,</hi> as Chronicles relate.
