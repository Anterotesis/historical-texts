            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Innocency and truth of my Cause, doth lift up its head unto all people, and stands Justified in the sight of God and all Just men, and in Justice and Righteousnes it cannot be condemned, or judged guilty by any man; And it is upon me yet once more to state it before you, that you and all men may see the countenance and favour thereof, (for it dare shew its face unto you, and all people) though much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hath been written and spoken about it, which you have not taken notice of (as you ought to have done) but yet many are informed in the truth of the matter, &amp; what hath been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is not in vain, though my just cause lies alwayes at the stake, and is hardly thought upon by you, and vilified and evil spoken of before you by my adversary, who alwayes seeks false judgement against me, to justifie himself in his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and to condemn the guiltlesse; For the Lord knows, and just men knows, and the witnesse of God in your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may shew you that I have not wronged <hi>Richard Mayo,</hi> nor spoken of him any thing saving <hi>the truth,</hi> and because thereof, and without any other cause, am I thus prosecuted by him in his pleading before you, and begging of you for false Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which if he should obtain it, and you should give it, yet should I be clean in the sight of the Lord, though by you I may deeply suffer; And your own unrighteous judgement if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from you) will return one day upon your own heads, and the weight of your own iniquity shall the Lord lay upon your own consciences, in the day when he judges the secrets of all hearts; and to God I have appealed in this thing, who Justifies me because of truth, and then who shall justly condemn me, while Truth is on my side, and I not convinced to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the fear of the Lord God, I say unto you, take heed what you do in this matter; but deal impartially in the sight of the Lord, in the examination thereof, and try, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have spoken the truth, or whether I have spoken falsly; and hearken to my plea, which I have often asserted before you, and do yet once more lay before your view, and I do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52813:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the light of your consciences, and let that justifie me, or condemn me; and this I testifie as my sufficient Plea: unto you, (which no man hath truly answered before you,) that I have spoke nothing but the truth of <hi>Richard Mayo</hi> my adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; to this I stand to be justified, and if I be condemned, it is for this, this resteth with me for ever, and if I fall, I fall for it, (viz) <hi>for speaking the truth,</hi> and if I stand, I stand by it, and no man whatsoever can convince me to the contrary; and hereof am I invincible, and if you condemn me for this (to wit) <hi>for speaking the truth,</hi> it will be upon you, and I am clear, and this is my onely plea, which I have often, and may by the spirit of the Lord alwayes clearly demonstrate, and I do indeed wave all the multitude of arguments that hath been, or can be made, by the lawyers in this businesse, and not by words of mans wisdom, but by <hi>truth</hi> must I be justified; and I do here again return to my first manner of proceeding, and stand to the naked simplicity of truth, and I have no other defence to shelter under, neither do I chuse any, nor no other weapon to resist my enemy with, but the word of the Lord which is truth; and if truth will not justifie me, I will not be justified, and if it will condemn me, my mouth shall be stopped; for by the truth I stand, and if I fall, I fall for it, in this matter; and therefore you my Judges patiently hear a few words again, as to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the matter betwixt <hi>Richard Mayo,</hi> and me, which is thus, He sent for me by a messenger to come to him, and being come to him, he challenged me to speak what I had against him, &amp; again under his own hand he challenged me to dispute, either in publick or private with him; and he again bad me call him deceiver if I durst, and upon all these four particular invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and challenges, and also knowing him to be guilty, as I am still able to prove; I did say to him that he held forth <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrine, and errour,</hi> and that he was a <hi>deceiver,</hi> and this was the beginning of the controversy; whereby I would have you to take notice, how unrighteously he hath dealt with me, first to invite me, and challenge me several times; and then for speaking the truth of him (which I am able prove) to arrest me, imprison me, and thus to prosecute me, is not this unchristian like, &amp; not like a Minister of Christ? and this I proved in your court, his challenging of me, and also I have manifested divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52813:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sayings of his, which doth appear to all sober men to be damnable Doctrine, and error; and for the manifesting of my innocent cause further, and that you may know, that you ought not to condemn me, (neither can you with a safe and good conscience in the sight of God) and to lay the truth as plainly as I can before you; therefore I do here insert the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to you again, which <hi>I proved in the open Court</hi> against <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Mayo,</hi> which I do say is damnable doctrine, and error, all, or some of them at least.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That <hi>Paul,</hi> as a Minister of Christ exhorted Saints (the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) to follow and obey a light which was not Christ, nor the light of the Gospel.</item>
               <item>2. He did exhort the people of <hi>Kingstone,</hi> as a Minister of Christ in his preaching to them, to follow and obey a light, which (said he) is not Christ, nor the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</item>
               <item>3. He said that a man may be a righteous man, and not a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man without distinction.</item>
               <item>4. Also at another time before that, <hi>Rich. Mayo</hi> affirmed that the light of Christ which every man is lightened withall, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1 9. is carnal, and darkness.</item>
               <item>5. He did affirm under his own hand, that Christ was not the word that <hi>David</hi> walked by.</item>
               <item>6. He affirmed that the Devil is the power of God.</item>
               <item>7. He affirmed that the Gospel is not the power of God, no more then a rose cake is, which he laid his hand on in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, at the present of his so saying.</item>
               <item>8. He affirmed, if one man murther another, he did it by the power of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now hereby it may appear to you, (if you do not wilfully harden your selves against the truth, and the righteousnesse of my cause) that I have done <hi>Richard Mayo</hi> no wrong, onely I have spoken the truth of him; I said he held forth <hi>damnable doctrine, and error</hi> which saying, is <hi>truth,</hi> and I had a good cause to speak it, for he invited, and challenged me divers times to speak it, and then when this is considered by you, let your consciences judge what wrong I have done him; seeing it doth appear I have spoken the truth of him, and had good reason so to do; yee my Judges, at whose door my cause (which is innocent) lyes despised, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52813:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be condemned, come but to plainnesse and honesty in your own hearts, and be not passionate towards me, but use meeknesse, and let the sincerity of your hearts tell me, whether I have lyed or spoken truth; but if you do the worst that can be done against me, I must, and have already committed my cause to God, and I doubt not but he will avenge my cause, and recompence my adversaries in his season. Now again consider, if <hi>Richard Mayo</hi> did make his invitations to me, on purpose to ensnare me, (as it may be justly supposed that he did) that he might have occasion to execute his malice upon me, then you ought not to give <hi>judgement</hi> against me, and to be his <hi>executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> for if he hath laid his plot to ensnare me, how can you justly give him power over me? and he hath no power over me except you give it him by <hi>unjust judgement;</hi> and you can but give him power over my body, for my spirit is at liberty, and in dominion over you and him, because I have the truth on my side, and it is hard for you to strive against that, for it cannot be buried, but the <hi>truth of my cause</hi> will alwayes live to vex its opposers; but and if his challenges to me was not to insnare me, but for information (supposing himself to have been clear from all damnable doctrine and error) then he had done well to have owned my words as a <hi>reproof,</hi> and to have repented, and not, to have held forth any more such doctrine; and you ought not for reproving him, to condemn me, for reproving any man for evil ought not to be condemned; good men will not do it, neither would he (were he) not an ungodly man prosecute me thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, &amp; thus continually beg your Judgement of 100 l. against me, for reproving of him, &amp; declaring against his false doctrine, wch he delivers to the people, when as himself first invited me to speak to him; and the Lord knows the souls of people are so dear to me, that where I hear false doctrine held forth, which would destroy the innocent soules, I cannot but reprove it, least people receive false doctrine for true, to the destruction of their own Souls, and upon that account I spoke in this Cause; Wherefore take you into consideration what <hi>Richard Mayo</hi>'s end was in inviting me, &amp; do not you fulfil his evil purpose, wch I believe, if he had power over me, would execute his farthest cruelty upon me; I have good reason to believe it, for many cruel threatuing words have proceeded from him already agianst me,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52813:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but the Lord can deliver me from them all, but if he will not, he will give me patience to bear it, whatsoever is suffered to come to me; But, and if any shall doubt, and cannot receive these things, and believe that these particulars are <hi>damnable doctrine and errour,</hi> as they are laid down in themselves, and if what is spoken already be not sufficient, I may upon any just opportunity prove unto you, and all men, in the sight of my enemies that these particulars held forth by <hi>Richard Mayo,</hi> and alleadged by me before you, are damnable doctrine and errour, and if I could be convinced to the contrary by him, or any man, in sober Arguments, according to the Scriptures; and if he shall be able to prove that these things are true, and sound, and saving doctrines, then may I confess that I have wronged him, which never can be done; Therefore can I never confess (without lying against my Conscience,) that I have wronged him; but God justifies me, and just men, and my own Conscience <hi>excuses me</hi> from all wrong in this matter; and here, or hereafter shall you and he know it also, that I am without offence to him in this cause; And if I suffer, I suffer, be it upon you that are my Judges, and the guilt of my sufferings will be upon you one day; For, for the truths sake am I not afraid nor ashamed to suffer whatsoever you lay upon me. And whereas it is chiefly pleaded by my adversary and his Councel, that he is damnified, and much dangered by the speaking of my words, and because I said he held forth damnable doctrine, therefore say they, he is in danger to loose <hi>his place,</hi> and so he and his wife, and family cannot tell how <hi>to live</hi> &amp;c. These things they plead, and upon this account begs judgement against me, because he is, <hi>or may be in danger to be damnified.</hi> To this I reply, and Friends I would have you to consider, he hath not yet proved to you the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the value of two pence, nor is he in any outward estate worse, by loss of any thing outwardly, by any thing that I have spoken; and it is unjust to condemn me in an 100 l. upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed danger, and dammage, which may come, while as he hath sustained none at present; and further I say unto you, I have had no intentions of evil against him, nor purpose in my heart to endanger or damnifie him in any outward thing, God is my witness; But that nakedly, and simply I <hi>spoke the</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52813:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>truth of him.</hi> And if speaking the truth to him doth endanger him, and damnifie him, according as they plead, then is he a bad man, and an evil person, and not well worthy of you ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king part with him, if you be just men, (as yet I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrary) nor worthy of giving your judgement against me for him; if the speaking truth to him can so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger him, then consider you what a man he is; for speaking of the truth can never hurt an honest man, nor damnifie a good man, for honest men rejoiceth in the truth, and the speaking of it is an honour to them; but speaking the <hi>truth</hi> may indeed endanger and damnifie a bad person, as to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his wickedness, and to prevent him of more wickedness, which he may intend, but speaking the truth cannot <hi>damnifie a a good man;</hi> And if it be so that <hi>Richard Mayo</hi> (because of his badness) be damnified by my speaking the truth to him; Must I therefore be condemned for <hi>speaking truth,</hi> or ought you to do it? Let that of God in you answer; will you justifie his false <hi>doctrines,</hi> and condemn me for <hi>reproving</hi> him? Did ever any good men, or just Judges of old condemn any man for speaking the truth? or will you shame your selves, in the sight of wise men, by acting contrary to a good Conscience? which if ye do condemn me for speaking the truth, I do, and must tell you (while I live) that your <hi>judgement is unjust,</hi> and you act contrary to a good Conscience, and are unrighteous judges, and that you commit the great abomination, in justifying the wicked and condemning the Righteous; And is it not a shame to him that professeth to be a Minister of Christ, to plead the loss of his livelihood and of his calling, and the poverty of his wife and family, &amp;c. because of my speaking the truth to him? Never any of Christs Ministers pleaded any such thing; Were not they reproached and much spoken against? And they were called Deceivers, and seditious men, and such like; and did they proceed on this manner, as he hath done against me? Nay, they forgave their enemies. And if I had spoken falsly of him: (as I have not) he ought not to have done thus, if he had been a Minister of Christ, as he professeth; and doth his livelihood, and his place, and his maintenance of himself and his family depend upon my forbearing to speak the truth? For he pleads that he is damnified, and endangered in all these,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52813:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by what I have spoken; And I still testifie and all good men, knows, that I have given no offence, saving then speaking the truth; and rather then he shall be damnified by my speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of him, Will you unjustly damnifie me for speaking the truth? Is this the way of justice to condemn the truth that I have spoken, to save the guilty from supposed danger? Consider of this, and save your selves from <hi>unjust judgement,</hi> least the Lord justly Judge you, and condemn you; This I shew in short, and much more I might, as to the unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the action prosecuted against me; and now I come to shew something of the unjust proceedings in this matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me in the time of my tryal, and other times, and some part thereof I here lay before you, that you, and all may see I have had as unjust proceedings against me in the matter, as an unjust action at first brought upon me.</p>
            <p>At my first appearance in my first answer, I demurred to the jurisdiction of your Court, and shewes that your Court and Judicatory being temporal, you could not (in that Courtt)ake cognizance of this cause, being of a spiritual Dependancy, and ought onely to be tried in spiritual Jurisdiction by spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Judges (if there were any such) and shewed out of the <hi>Laws of England</hi> reasonably that your Court had no power to try this matter; But one of the Bayliffs, <hi>Iohn Forth</hi> said (which should have been my equal Judge) they would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule that, and they would try the matter, without shewing any just reason out of the Laws, against my Argument groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Laws, and they did over-rule me in that; and the Court-day before the Tryal, when the Jury-men was to be chosen and nominated, I told them that the Jury-men should be such as had the gif of the holy Spirit, and the holy Ghost in them, or else they could not try the matter, because it was <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> that was to be <hi>Tryed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which none could try, but by the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> Neither could I cast my self into the <hi>Determination</hi> of any in this cause but such; And the Bayliffs <hi>Obadia Wicks,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Forth</hi> answered, if they were men that could take the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that I spoke my words against <hi>Richard Mayo,</hi> they were sufficient to try the matter; whereby it doth appear that they had unjustly determined in themselves, not to try the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, but to have a verdict against me howsoever; again some
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52813:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that were called to be of the Jury were heard to say, before they saw me, or ever heard the matter; if I came into their hands they knew well enough what to do with me; hereby it doth appear they were not equal men, but malicious and prejudiced against me; and moreover in the very time of the tryal, some of the Jury, at the Bar, said, they would not believe any thing, or take any witnesse for testimony, which any of those on my part, that were called <hi>Quakers,</hi> spoke; and this was also the witness of their <hi>malicious, and envious spirits against me,</hi> who were rather as a party against me, then my equalls; And were not these unjust men for the tryal of such a matter? and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when all his witnesses could not say enough to give colour for a verdict against me, one of the Bayliffs, <hi>Iohn Forth</hi> by name, who was one of the Judges upon the Bench, proffered to come down off the Bench, and swear as a witnesse against me; and when some spake against that, he sent for a man into the Court out of the Town, <hi>Iames Levite</hi> by name, and whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him upon the Bench, &amp; told him what he should swear, and he went to the Bar and took his oath against me, that I followed <hi>Richard Mayo</hi> with reviling Language, in three several roomes, in Bayliff <hi>Gunstones</hi> house, which I do testifie, was a false oath, before the Lord, and all men; and many knowes that I speak the truth, &amp; that that man took a false oath, who was sent for into the Court, &amp; told by one of the Judges what he should swear; I suppose Bayliff <hi>Gunston</hi> himself knowes that this was a false witness, &amp; are not these unjust proceedings? I appeal to your consciences, and upon such proceedings as these, was a verdict gained against me, by much a do, in above three hours time; and the <hi>Foreman</hi> of the Jury himself said, he would not have brought <hi>a verdict against me,</hi> but onely for the mans oath, <hi>Iames Levite,</hi> which as I have said, <hi>swore falsly,</hi> being sent for, and told by another man what he should say; Again, when the <hi>foreman of the Iury</hi> said, they could not try the cause, and desired it might be referred, the said Bayliff <hi>Forth</hi> on the Bench cryed no, and told <hi>Richard Mayo</hi> he should not referr it, he should have <hi>a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict first,</hi> and ought my Judge thus to have spoken? no, he appeared to be rather a party against me, then my equal Judge; and to all sober men, these proceedings may appear to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just; And I hope some of you will make more conscience of your
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52813:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doings, then to passe judgement upon such an <hi>unrighteous verdict</hi> And moreover, the Jury did not <hi>try the cause,</hi> which onely ought to have been tryed, which was, whether I had spoken <hi>truly,</hi> or <hi>falsly</hi> of <hi>Richard Mayo,</hi> that is to say, they ought to have tryed, (and that was the thing in controversy between us) whether these particulars alleadged by me against <hi>Richard Mayo</hi> were <hi>true, and sound doctrine</hi> or <hi>damnable doctrine and errors,</hi> for if the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars mentioned be true, and sound doctrine, wch were affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Richard Mayo,</hi> then I have <hi>wronged him,</hi> and I must confess it, and assent to your Judgement; but if the particulars be <hi>false doctrine, and errour,</hi> then I have done him no wrong, for I have spoken nothing but <hi>the truth;</hi> and for that, how can you condemn me? And this was the cause to be tryed, which the Jury themselves confessed they did not try, and therefore the matter is not yet <hi>tryed in truth,</hi> neither have I had a legal <hi>tryal</hi> Before you, and then how can you give judgement against me, being the action it self, is so <hi>unequal,</hi> and the procedings so <hi>unjust</hi> also, and the matter yet not fully tryed? do but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of these things in the coolnesse of your Spirits, and let not me receive worse dealing from you, because I am <hi>a stranger,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because I am a <hi>Quaker</hi> so called; but deal justly, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for I desire nothing else of you, but true judgement, for that will justifie me, and clear me, and respect not persons, but have respect to the Law of God, which commandeth you to hear, and Judge the cause of the poor, and of the <hi>stranger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect of persons,</hi> and if you give regard to the Law of God in this matter, you cannot give Judgement upon this verdict, which is thus unjustly brought in, by unrighteous and partial men, as is manifest, and you must either wholly <hi>arrest Iudgement,</hi> or at least you must bring it to a <hi>new tryal,</hi> else you do me much wrong and injustice, and all good men will so Judge of it; And further, divers sufficient reasons hath been shewed by men of knowledge in the Law, first against this action, and also against the proceedings herein, which might be reasons to you not to go on in Judgement against me, but to clear me; and even in your own way, (as I may say) you have been dealt with, and you have been shewed my <hi>innocency;</hi> so that if your hearts be not hardened, you cannot go any further against me, but go contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the truth of my cause, and contrary to your <hi>own Law</hi> also;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52813:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and though it was the dear love, and respect of friends to the truth, in freeness of their love to me, more then any desire of mine, or my knowledge; I do own their love, and justifie it, yet much that hath been spoken in forms and tricks of law, and punctillio's of Law I do wave, and lets it passe, and keeps al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to the naked truth of the matter, as before laid down; And therefore if any Jury shall upon their oaths Justifie, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Mayo his doctrines</hi> to be true and sound doctrine; and if you your selves, upon your <hi>oathes dare give Iudgement,</hi> that <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Mayo</hi> his doctrine, is not damnable doctrine, and errors; Then I must lye patiently under your Judgement, and under the breach of such Jury-mens oathes, and of your <hi>own oaths also;</hi> and therefore I demand of you according to right and Justice let me be cleared, otherwise let me first have a fair tryal before I be condemned, which yet I have not had, because the matter was perverted from that, <hi>whether I had spoken the truth,</hi> upon which the true issue dependeth, and upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. <hi>Whether I spoke maliciously,</hi> was a straining of the cause to a wrong head, and perverting it from its <hi>proper issue,</hi> and hereby was the Just cause of the innocent clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded over, and rejected, and vilified, and even betrayed into another meaning, more then it ought to have been; but it can shew its face above all this, and truth cannot be daunted though it may be veiled and lie hid for a season, and though I be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Prejudice and unsaithful Jury speaking <hi>malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,</hi> yet the Lord bears me witnesse to the contrary, and that I have no malice in me against any man, and I love your souls better, then that you should endanger them to destruction, and to everlasting burning, by giving <hi>Iudgement</hi> upon <hi>your oaths</hi> against me upon this <hi>verdict,</hi> in this cause which is thus unjust and unequal in it self, and in its proceedings also; for if the Jury had tryed, whether I had spoke the truth, or whether I belyed <hi>Richard Mayo</hi> then it would easily have been known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I spoke <hi>malioiously;</hi> for if I belyed him, and if his doctrine be true, and sound, and not error, then may it be easily Judged that I spoke <hi>maliciously,</hi> because I spoke not the truth, but if his doctrines alleadged by me, be not true, and sound doctrine, but <hi>damnable doctrine and error,</hi> then I have not belyed him but spoken the truth <hi>in love,</hi> and not <hi>maliciously,</hi> for truth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice

goes not together; and till this be tryed, to wit, whether I have spoken <hi>truly</hi> or <hi>falsly,</hi> who shall be able upon their oathes (without forswearing themseves) to give it upon their oathes that I spoke <hi>maliciously?</hi> nay, how shall any men lawfully swear, that one speaks maliciously? it is a hard cause to swear that any man speaks in malice, for who enters into the heart of another man, to know the thoughts, save God, and his Spirit.</p>
            <p>And this I may say at least, and safely too, that, that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which gave into the Court upon their oaths, that I spoke my words maliciously against <hi>Richard Mayo,</hi> have greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered the forswearing themselves, and the breach of their own oaths, and some of them knows before this day that they did transgress therein against God, whom God suddenly after cut off with Judgment, and took off the earth by death; and though they, that are yet living may be insensible of their own wickedness, yet let all good men fear to dye out of this body with that burden upon their Consciences, as some have, and others of them may have, in this particular, for breach of oaths; and though they have given it to you upon their oaths, that I spoke <hi>maliciously,</hi> yet wo will be unto you, if you shall upon your oaths justifie, they have done well, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me falsly upon their false verdict, and if you do condemn me, it is upon their false verdict, because I spoke maliciously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Richard Mayo:</hi> and you cannot do that, but you forswear your selves, and acts contrary to your trust, who are set in place to Judge justly by what doth appear to your view; And cannot nor dare not, I know, upon <hi>your oaths,</hi> say, that I have spoken <hi>falsly and maliciously</hi> against <hi>Richard Mayo;</hi> But and if you do, one day you will feel that you have spoken against your <hi>own oaths,</hi> and Consciences, and against God, and against your own Souls. And this is all that I can lay before you, as to this particular, to warn you, that you do Judge justly, and that you condemn not the innocent &amp; just cause of the upright, but that you may save your selves from the anger of the Lord, who will be avenged upon all false swearers and unrighteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that Judges not in righteousness the cause of the Poor, and of the Stranger; and the Cause yet remains before you, to shew your selves Just or unjust, righteous or unrighteous

Judges in this matter. And whereas <hi>Richard Mayo,</hi> and some of your selves spake to me, to confess I have wronged him, and would have me to acknowledge that I am in a fault, and that I have spoken wrong of him; yea, it was said to me, if I had not wronged him, could I not confess that I had, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve my self? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this I must answer; Nay, I cannot confess contrary to a good Conscience, and contrary to Truth, that I have wronged him; if my life stood upon it, as it is but my liberty at most, for God hath given me to make Conscience of my words, and to keep it void of offence towards him and all men, and to confess that which is false, to be true, would stain a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in the sight of God and his people, and that I may not do, no not for my own preservation, and the Lord deliver me from the Judgement of such who would have me confess that which I am not guilty of, for that is all one to say I am clear, when I am guilty, as to say I am guilty, when I am clear; and I rather chuse to suffer what can be imposed upon me, then to transgress the truth, in my own heart, and if I should say, his doctrine were sound and true doctrine, and not damnable and errour, I do believe the witness in your own Consciences would rise against me, and many more would say, I then spoke falsly, then doth now; for I hardly ever heard any, no not your own selves say, that his doctrines alleadged by me against him, are sound and true doctrine, neither can you in good Conscience say it; So I say, I cannot lye against my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, what ever comes of it, for to walk with the Lord, and to have his Peace, and not to loose his presence, is of more worth to my Soul that is immortal, then all the sufferings that you can lay upon me, can be dammage to my mortal body; for my life and Soul you cannot touch, but therein am I free, though outwardly entangled amongst bryars and thorns, which would pierce me and seek to catch me, and if there be no other way for me to be preserved, but by confessing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my Conscience, that I have wronged <hi>Richard Mayo,</hi> I freely give up my self to suffering, rather then to be preserved by such means, and you do evil in putting such a thing upon me, and expecting it from me, which I cannot give, but trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress the Law of God, and offend him, and my own Conscience,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52813:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and if you defer the determination of the matter, upon such hopes, that I may confess that I have wronged <hi>Richard Mayo,</hi> I desire, you would not defer it one moment longer, but let me be quitted of your temptation, for it is your temptation and not true love; for I cannot confess any such thing, though thus I do acknowledge, it hath now depended in your Court, and at your door, near two years, and I should be glad that it were ended justly, because I am not a man given to suits in Law, neither do I love it (though it be so that I am fallen into it) to offend any man, or be offended in that way by any, yet may I not use any unlawful means, or indirect way to obtain an end of this business, but the rather I am content with what the Lord suffereth to come to pass, though it be the very greatest malice of my very devouring enemies, and because I would have peace with all men, and have all men reconciled to God, and one to another to live in love and unity one with another, upon that account I would this business were ended, and though I do not doubt my cause, nor am faint of it, but can freely receive the determination thereof in the Court, be it for me or against me, yet I would have it ended, and have sought it in Justice, and once did to my adversary say, I could refer it to any sober men; and another friend being with me, <hi>Oliver</hi> then Protector, or <hi>Charles Fleetwood</hi> or Col. <hi>Pride,</hi> all these was mentioned, and to any of these, I could freely have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred my Cause, and though before he seemed willing, and said that if any sober man in the Nation, that was no <hi>Quaker,</hi> would say that his doctrine was not sound, and that he had not wrong, &amp;c. But when these men were mentioned, he was unfaithful to his word, and would not refer it.</p>
            <p>And also not long ago, a day and time was appointed by his own advice and consent, by a friend of his own, to bring the Cause before Alderman <hi>Tichburn,</hi> to which I was willing, and that he with some other man might here and determine the matter, and at the time appointed we met at the Aldermans house, and the Alderman with some more of us waited for <hi>Mayos</hi> coming, till near the 9th hour in the evening, and he never came, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and unjust was he to his own friend, to Alderman <hi>Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> and to me, that we waited all for him some hours, and he came not at all, though his own friend, by his own consent and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52813:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
desire did bring that appointment about; And thus I would have you to know, that I seek peace with all men, and with him, upon just and equal means, &amp; can refer it to honest men to hear and determine; for who are truly just towards God, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me nor my cause; And likewise ye may see how unwilling my Adversary is to bring his business to hearing and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by wise and descreet men, and how unfaithful he is to his own words and desires, only he thinks he hath gotten a verdict that will do something for him, &amp; upon that he depends, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also for your unjust Judgement, and because he hopes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies for your Judgement, which I say is unjust, if you condemn me in this matter; Therefore he will not bring his cause to be heard and determined by any other, because he supposes you will proceed according to that unjust verdict, which if you doe not, you offend him, and loseth his unjust cause; and if you do, you offend God, and condemneth the guiltless cause of the just, and whatever ye do, this follows upon ye, and if you offend God and despiseth the cause of the Inocent, and the truth, ye must bear your own burthen, in the sight of God and Just men; And if his cause were good, he need not thus shrink and faulter, to let any man hear the matter, but his hope of your unjust Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nourisheth his heart in his unrighteous cause.</p>
            <p>And these things were in me to lay before you, that it may not be said by you, we know not these things, for I would have you to know them and take notice of them, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all things in equality, &amp; to Judge according to the Law of God, and the good Law of this Land; I am not careful at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to answer or say more to you about this matter, onely this remains with me; the Lord God can deliver me from the teeth of the wicked if he will, but if he will not, I cannot bow to the Devil, but hath given up my life, to live to him, or to suffer for him; and this Testimony remains for ever; not as I will, but as He will, who brings all things to pass, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his pleasure;</p>
