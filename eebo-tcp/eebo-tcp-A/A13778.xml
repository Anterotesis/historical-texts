            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the time, tyll it was néere Noone,
and when the Sunne began to waxe som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
warme, we determined to go from
thence, vnto a worthy Ladies house there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
called the Lady <hi>Iulia,</hi> where we might
rest vs the heate of the day, and as it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced,
we came in very good time. For euen
as we entred the Ladies house, they had
newly washed, &amp; were ready to sit downe
to dinner, where we founde a ioyfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
assembled togithers, both Ladies,
and Gentlemen, amongst the which, was
Madame <hi>Iulias</hi> daughter, called the Lady
<hi>Isabella</hi> a very faire gentle woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There
was also y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lady <hi>Aloisa</hi> with many other
Ladies, and their lincked Mates, beside
M. <hi>Lodouic Viues,</hi> and an olde Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
called M. <hi>Erasmus,</hi> of whome after
we had taken acquaintance, and vsed such
courtesie as the time, &amp; place required, we
sate all downe orderly to dinner, where
there was such exceding chéere, such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt
talke, such melodie, and such swéete
chéering of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Ladies, that it was a worlde
<pb facs="tcp:14298:5"/>
to sée how mery we were. And being thus
in our pleasures, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lady <hi>Iulia</hi> deuised w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
the company in what pastimes we should
spende the after noone. Some lyked well
of carding, and dicing, some of dauncing,
and other some of Chestes, al which were
condemned by the most parte, who allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that those Pastimes were not aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to the tyme of the yeare, but
more méete for Christmas: and therefore
such game were fittest, that might be vsed
abroade in the fields, as bowling, shooting
and such other like. But M. <hi>Pedro</hi> nothing
at all lyking of such deuises, wherein the
Ladies should be left out, said y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he wel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred

For the knowledge of duetie is the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
of friendship. All the company
commended Maister <hi>Pedro</hi> for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

What is more honorable, and praise

mother in Canaan did not onely with his
presence make honorable, but also wyth

more iust, than to render that to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie,

<pb facs="tcp:14298:8"/>
our Lorde commaundeth that man shall
forsake Father and Mother, and cleaue to

holy, than loue towardes parents, which
GOD in the commaundements hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded

Romaines, as <hi>Cicero</hi> recordeth, were
<pb facs="tcp:14298:9"/>
two kindes of mariages, wherby they had
also two sortes of wyues, the one more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarye,
whom they called Matrons, the
other were called houswyfes, which were
married by conioyning of handes, almost
like vnto vs. These dyd they estéeme as
their daughters, and had like enheritance
of their landes, who bare the rule of their
houses, and therefore called houswyfes.
But no excesse of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> husband might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto them. For on the Matrons
began they their children.<note place="margin">The Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians.</note> The Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
maried their maides without dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in this maner. All their maids, which
were to be married, were assembled in a
place appoynted, and placed orderlye the
fayrest first, then the meaner sort, and last
the fowlest. The fayrest was gyuen vnto
him that would giue most money to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
with hir, still paying according to their
bewtie, more or lesse, till they came to the
fowlest, &amp; to them, that woulde mary any
of those, was gyuen parte of the money,
that was taken for the fayrer sort, paying
according to the rate, as they excéeded in
foulenesse. The like maner also, was vsed
<pb facs="tcp:14298:9"/>
amongst the auncient <hi>Venetians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</note> as say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Sabellicus,</hi> an vnhappye custome
was it, quoth the Lady <hi>Iulia,</hi> &amp; likely that
the <hi>Flower of Friendship</hi> was but weak
lye rooted betwéene them of so slender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:
But I pray you tell vs, how
the indifferent sorte were maried, that
were neyther foule, nor fayre, but louely
browne. Mary quoth he, for such amongst
the <hi>Venetians</hi> there was no money either
gyuen, or taken, but were maryed for
naught. And so perchaunce, quoth a mery
gentleman, that stoode by, called maister
<hi>Gualter</hi> of Cawne, were some of the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
as they be sometimes nowe a dayes.
I haue also redde, quoth Maister <hi>Pedro,</hi>
that in Fraunce,<note place="margin">The French men.</note> the Maydens did choose
their husbandes in this sorte. The parents
calldd a number of young men to a banket
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they thought fittest, &amp; him, to whome
the Mayde gaue first water, by that signe
she chose for hir husband. In <hi>Mauritania,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanians.</note>
as sayeth <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> there was

which also after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> death of their husbands
<pb facs="tcp:14298:10"/>
within one moneth eyther willinglye bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
themselues wyth him, or were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
executed by the lawe. In the Isles of

               <note place="margin">In the Isles of Canaria.</note> there were contrariwise so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men, and so fewe women, that euerye
wife might haue seauen husbands, &amp; could
not take lesse than fiue. But I trust, quoth
the Lady <hi>Aloisa,</hi> that those men were not
so kinde harted, as to be buried with their
wyues, as the woman in that other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
were with their husbandes. I thinke
not quoth Mayster <hi>Pedro,</hi> and I doubt
whether those women of <hi>Mauritania,</hi>

béene no lawe to haue compelled them.

to the <hi>Flower of Friendship?</hi> lady quoth
he, I am not yet come to my purpose. But
one word more, and I will to my charge.
The <hi>Chaldeans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans.</note> that honored the fire for
their God, had an easie custome: for when
they minded to marrie, the Priest kindled
the fire in the good mans house, and both
the parties touching it, were assured to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither,
<pb facs="tcp:14298:10"/>
and when any of them mislyked,
one of them quenched the fire, and so were
they as frée, as euer they were before. In
another Countrie the Priest of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
enioyed the first nightes pleasures of

to be considered in this matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall

But <hi>Licurgus</hi> the law maker well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that,<note place="margin">Licurgus.</note> when he ordained that women
shoulde be married without dowries, so
that then they had nothing to be prowde
off, saue onely their vertues, which ought
to be accounted y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> chiefest dowrie. For that
which is more excellent, is to be preferred
before things of lower valour. Why then
for lack of substance, shall a vertuous wife
be repelled,<note place="margin">Alexander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> or for want of wealth, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

Monarch of the whole worlde, shewed his
noble courage in nothing more, than in
that hée reiecting the riche Barbarian
Quéenes, vouchsafed to match with <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina,</hi>
daughter of <hi>Arbaces,</hi> a poore gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
but of noble parentage, wherein
not riches, but nobilitie adorned with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb facs="tcp:14298:11"/>
preuayled. Well quoth the Ladie
<hi>Iulia,</hi> I pray you what is he now a dayes
that had not rather marie a woman ful of
money, wanting vertue &amp; grace, than that
hauing vertues, lacketh money. For my
parte, it well lyketh me that equalitie, as
you say, be obserued, seing equalnesse cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
friendlynesse. But I vnderstande not
this kinde of equalitie, wherein you séeme
to allow the greatest inequalitie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can be.
For <hi>Alexander</hi> being Lorde of the whole
worlde coulde finde no equall match, in
respect of his greatnesse. Much lesse <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina</hi>
that was so farre his inferiour, both
in parentage, and substance. Not so farre
his inferiour, quoth Maister <hi>Pedro,</hi> for
the great vertues which abounded in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina,</hi>
and as I sayde before, the onely ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse
to be required in a woman, was in
al respects comparable to the great great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, neyther did
she want sufficient parentage, &amp; though
not a conquerour of the worlde, yet well
knowne to be procéeded from the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
own linage, so that a vertuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
being wise, and of good lynage, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb facs="tcp:14298:12"/>
no equalitie on hir parte to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peyse
the greatest ryches or treasure, that
any man can haue. For where vertue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth,
all good things doe flowe. And
to conclude, I say that great regard ought
the man to haue in his choyse, that he may
leaue hys childe parentage, which being
ioyned to vertues, maketh men perfite.
Now for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> equalitie in age, I say co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fisteth
likewise in the equalitie of yeares, but
not so much as the Philosophers, in times
past affirmed. For <hi>Aristotle</hi> by his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
woulde haue the man to be twentie
yeares elder than his wife, bycause they
might leaue off procreation at one tyme.
<hi>Hesiodus</hi> the Gréeke Poet, &amp; <hi>Xenophon</hi>
the philosopher woulde haue the woman
fourtene, and the man thirtie yeares olde,
so that there shoulde be sixtéene yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
them, bicause in that time, the man
shoulde be best able to rule his housholde,
and the woman taken from euill occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>Licurgus</hi> lawe was amongest the
<hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Licurgus.</note> that the man shoulde
not marry, before thirtie and seauen yeres
of age, and women at eightene. What
<pb facs="tcp:14298:12"/>
maner of equalitie is this, quoth the Lady
<hi>Isabella,</hi> I woulde neuer marry, rather
than to take such olde crusts, whose wiues
are more occupied in playstering, than in
enioying any good conuersation. You say
truth, quoth Maister <hi>Pedro,</hi> neyther doe
I allowe it, yet may I not condemne the
auncient philosophers. For in those daies
men liued longer, and their natures were
much stronger. Therfore by likelyhoode it
was at that time more tollerable. But my
opinion is, that they differ not aboue foure
or fiue yeares. After this match made, and
equalities considered, next foloweth, to
loue, &amp; to lyke well: For perfite loue knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
louinge heartes,<note place="margin">What loue in mariage shoulde be.</note> in an in insoluble
knot of amitie. Loue indifferent serueth
not, loue fayned prospereth not. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must be true, and perfite loue, that
maketh the <hi>Flower of Friendship</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
man and wyfe freshlye to spring.
This loue must growe by little and little,
and that it may be durable, must by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées
take roote in the hart. For hasty loue
is soone gone. And some haue loued in post
hast, that afterwards haue repented them
<pb facs="tcp:14298:13"/>
at leysure. Wée all séeke the fayrest, the
richest, and noblest. But vertues are laide
aside, and naught accounted off, we seeke
so feede our eyes, and not to content our
eares. Why? quoth Maister <hi>Gualter,</hi> shal
a man choose his wyfe with his eares. To
choose with our eares, quoth Maister <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi>
is to inquire of hir vertues, &amp; vyces
by reporte whereof you shall vnderstande
hir conditions, and qualities, good, &amp; badde.
As for that, quoth <hi>Gualter,</hi> it booteth not.
For the best of them all hane their faults.
And if she be vertuous, shée wyll looke to
be so honored, that hir husbande shall haue
the more a do to please hir. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that a wyse man, I knowe not hys
name, being enquired of a friende of his,
with whom he shoulde marry, aunswered
that hée hadde béene married foure sundry
times, first with a faire woman, who was
so prowde of hir beautie, that he was faine
to please and content hir, least she shoulde
dishonour him, the seconde verye riche,
whose substance made hir so statelye, that
he was forced lyke a slaue to obey hir, the
thirde was so vertuous, that he was glad
<pb facs="tcp:14298:13"/>
to honor, and reuerence hir, to kéepe hir
still in hir vertuous goodnesse, the last was
of good lynage, which so exalted hir sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,
that shée made him hir bondman.
Nowe choose, quoth hée, which of these
foure thou canst best content thy selfe. You
haue made a fayre reason quoth the Lady
<hi>Aloisa,</hi> I neuer knewe that you were so
déepelye learned before and all the Ladies
woulde haue driuen Maister <hi>Gualter</hi> out
of the Arbor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But father <hi>Erasmus</hi> sayde
that he remembred the lyke thinge of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxagoras,</hi>
and therefore hée was not to
be blamed, bycause he did but repete the
wordes of a Philosopher. What then,
quoth Maister <hi>Pedro,</hi> it is no parte of
my charge to disprayse women, but to
speake the best of them, and to plant the
<hi>Flower of Friendship</hi> betwéene them,
and their husbands. Wherfore, let loue be
rooted déepely in the mans heart towardes
the woman: Let the person be sought, not
hir substaunce, craue hir vertues, not hir
riches, then shall there be a ioyfull begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and a blessed continuance in amity,
by which all things shall prosper, &amp; come
<pb facs="tcp:14298:14"/>
to happie ende. Beware of hatred, be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect
in loue, which of them first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
place, doth abide during lyfe. And
loue grounded remaineth for euer, which
being once gone, al other goodnesse folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for companye.<note place="margin">The man must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware in chyding when he is newly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</note> Therefore to confirme
this loue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> married man must as much as
he can, alwayes abstaine from brawling,
lowring and grudging, especiallye, when
he is newly married. For if the wyfe first
conceyue hate, she will neuer receyue loue
againe. The husband then must be mery,
and pleasaunt with his wyfe, to make hir
the more in loue wyth him at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
so that if afterwardes they chaunce
to fall at square, it shall ryse but of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne
anger, which will be gone againe
as soone, and not of anye olde conceyued
malice. There be manye men that boast
much, how they be serued, and feared, like
Bugges, of their wyues, but they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylously
deceyue themselues. For much
better were it, if they were better beloued
and lesse feared. For whome the wyfe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
in feare she serueth, but whome shée
loueth, shée gladly cherisheth. It is good
<pb facs="tcp:14298:14"/>
reason, that all women doe labor to stande
in the good grace of their husbandes, but
much more ought wée men to foresée, that
we fall not into the hatred of our wyfes.
For if she once fasten hir eyes on another
he shall enioy hir in dispite of hir husbands
beard. In this long and troublesome iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of matrimonye, the wise man maye
not be contented onely with the Spouses
virginitie,<note place="margin">The maried man steale away his wyues pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate will.</note> but by little and lyttle must
gently procure that he maye also steale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
hir priuat will, and appetite, so that
of two bodies there may be made one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
heart, which shée will soone doe, if loue
raygne in hir, and without this agréeable
concorde, matrimonie hath but small plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or none at all, and the man, that is
not lyked, and loued of his mate, holdeth
his lyfe in continuall perill, his goodes in
great ieoperdie, his good name in suspect,
and his whole house in vtter perdition. I

that loued their wyues well,<note place="margin">Such as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued well their wiues. Adam.</note> and then I
will procéede. The first that loued hys
wyfe, was our father <hi>Adam,</hi> who being

<pb facs="tcp:14298:15"/>
death, one onelye trée in the Garden, to
consent and please <hi>Eua</hi> his wyfe, did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
eate of it, and dyed. <hi>Darius</hi>
the great King,<note place="margin">Darius.</note> being ouercome by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
in all things shewed himselfe stout
and inuincible, till he vnderstoode that his
wyfe was taken prisoner, who then pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
oute of his teares aboundantly, as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
for that which he more estéemed
than his lyfe,<note place="margin">Tiberius Gracchus.</note> or estimation. <hi>Valerius
Maximus</hi> saith, that <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi>
finding two Serpents in his bed, sent for
the soothsayers to knowe what y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> straunge
chaunce ment, and signified, which aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that if he killed the male serpent,
bée shoulde dye before his wyfe, but if the
female were first slayne, his wyfe shoulde
die before him. He bearing entire loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
his wyfe, gaue his owne death to
prolong hir life, and killed presently the
Male serpent. There be, quoth the Ladie

<pb facs="tcp:14298:15"/>

Maister <hi>Pedro,</hi> hée increaseth our sporte,
and therefore we cannot well want him.
But I will shewe you one example more
of later yeares, bycause the Ladye <hi>Iulia</hi>
sayeth that none nowe a dayes doe loue
their wyfes so well. <hi>Baptista Fulgosa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth

wyfe, that were seeking for their suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

taken awaye, by certaine Rouers, hir

the Pirates to take him also, saying,
that he had rather be with his wife in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

than lacking hir, to liue at lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
whereat the Pirates marueiling, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
them both into their Shippe, and
declaring the whole aduenture, presented
them to the King of <hi>Lunis,</hi> who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the case, gaue them great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
and not onely set them at ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
<pb facs="tcp:14298:16"/>
but also sente them home wyth
great rewarde.</p>
            <p>This maye satisfie to make you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that men doe sometimes loue their
wyues, &amp; hereby may you also sée of what
force the true matrimoniall loue is, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
let the maried man fasten, and ground
all the rest of his doings, and so shall t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

friendly <hi>Flower</hi> be planted in a fertile

herbes, that are great nourishers of this
<hi>Flower:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Weedes that will ouergrow the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flower.</note> so there be certayne poysoned
wéedes, that will ouergrowe it, and in
the ende vtterly destroye it, if they be not
wéeded out by the roote, whereof the first
and chiefest is adulterie. For what god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse
can raygne in that house,<note place="margin">Adultery.</note> where
harlots beare the rule, whose fruits <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
doth greatly describe. For if the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
please the wicked woman, he must
of force displease hys owne wyfe being
godlye, and that iniurie a good woman
cannot with anye pacience support. At
what time the married man determineth
to kéepe a harlot, euen the same houre,
doth he set fire to his honestie, destruction
<pb facs="tcp:14298:16"/>
to his house, and losse of all, that euer he
hath. An honest woman wyll suffer a
thousand discommodities in hir husband,
so that she be assured, that he is contented
with hir, and loueth hir only. What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
crueltie can a man shew vnto his wife,
than to kéepe all his raylings, brawlings,
and chidings for hir, and another to enioy
all his (good) conuersation, and pleasures.
I doubte which of them hath the greater
hart, either he in doing it, or she in suffring
it. Can there be any greater disorder, than
for the husbande to be merie abrode, and
lowre at home, to take from hys wyfe,
and gyue to his harlots, to want for his
childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and to suffice for his bawdes. The
fayth that the woman oweth to hir hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande,

lawe gyueth man the superioritie ouer
his wife, that is not to offende, or dispraise
hir, but in misdoing louingly to reforme
hir. Therefore the abhorring of adulterie
increaseth amitie betwene man, and wife,
and the chiefest way to ground the <hi>Flower
of Friendship</hi> in matrimonie is, first to
<pb facs="tcp:14298:17"/>

which though the woman can with
more pacience suffer, than this others: yet
for his owne sake, let him forbeare it. For
what wisedome is it, that a man at one
chance of the Dice, hasardeth as much, as
the toyle of his whole lyfe hath gottten,
and scrapte togither, and small commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
the gamester reapeth thereby, when he
hath best hap, if all his cardes be tolde. For
suppose hée wynne, yet is there such cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
such lying, such brawling, chyding,
and swearing, that the Deuill laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
them all to scorne. If he lose, he fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
and fumeth so, that beside the losse of
his thrift, he hazardeth both body &amp; soule,
with cursing, and blaspheming. Then if
he eyther wynne, or lose, yée sée these his
gaines and commodities. I condemne not
honest playing for recreatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
for some small matter, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
habilitie is. But what a monstrous
thing is it, to consume whole dayes, yea,
whole daies and nights in gaming, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and foreswearing. For it hapneth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb facs="tcp:14298:17"/>
a daily gamester, a common blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
Wherefore it were no great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

<hi>Pedro</hi> hath done for the mans behalfe
<pb facs="tcp:14298:27"/>
and therein to shew in what sort she must
applie hir selfe, to maintaine this <hi>Flower

began a little to chaunge hir colour, and
standing in doubt what she shoulde doe,
much disschabling hir selfe, but in the ende

quoth she, to hazarde the iudgement of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce,
by my vnskilfull tale, than to be
condemned of disobedience by vngentle

And nowe,<note place="margin">The Lady Iulia be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth the married woman, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with maister Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro in di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ynts.</note> in hope of pardon, if my
vnlearned speache be not aunswerable to
your expectations, of this married wyfe
this is my opinion. In diuers poyntes I
agrée with Mayster <hi>Pedro,</hi> which are as
well necessarie in the woman, as requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>site
in the man. For if in suppressing of the
thrée foresaid wéedes, the chiefest enimies
to the <hi>Flower of Friendship,</hi> the man
must be careful: much more ought the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to trauaile, that they doe not spring
in hir, and also the great regard in choise
with others: wherein bycause mayster
<pb facs="tcp:14298:28"/>
               <hi>Pedro</hi> hath already satisfied you, I maye
be vnburdened of that traueyle. For if the
man ought to be circumspect in the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his wyfe, what shall the siely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
doe, being so often deceyued by you
men? Therfore must she with great care
consider, and be well assured of the mans
honest conuersation, of his maners, and
affections, and specially what loue he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
For the venom of loue blyndeth the
eyes, and so bewitcheth the senses of vs
poore women, that as we can foresée no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,<note place="margin">Loue blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the eyes, and bewitcheth the senses of women.</note>
so are we perswaded, that all the
vices of the beloued are rare, and excellent
vertues, and the thing most sower, to be
verye swéete, and delicate: for the aduoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of which, the woman can not be to
inquisitiue. I meane not of the mannes
welth and substaunce, but of his vertues,
which be the true ryches, and remayneth
for euer. With which thing mooued, <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles</hi>
               <note place="margin">Themisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note>
being demaunded whether he
had rather marrie his daughter to a riche
man vicious, or to a poore man vertuous,
worthily aunswered, that he woulde soner
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hoose a man without money, that money
<pb facs="tcp:14298:28"/>
without a man. Also I dissent not from
Mayster <hi>Pedro,</hi> in his equalitie of match.
And after such hir choyse,<note place="margin">The happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mariage consisteth in a chast wife.</note> let hir endeuour
to encrease a perfection of loue, and aboue
all imbrace chastitie. For the happinesse of

so that if such a woman bée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
in true and vnfayned loue, to hir
beloued spouse, no doubt their lyues shall
be stable, easie, swéete, ioyfull and happy.
But loue taken awaye, in stéede of most
swéete pleasauntnesse, is placed a bitter
vnsauerie, and an intollerable estate. The
first thing therefore, which the maried

thing which shee must with all hir force,
applie hir whole minde vnto, and the first
thing which she must hartilye put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
is to lyke, and loue well.<note place="margin">The woman must lyke and loue well hir husband.</note> For rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

the wife, as the wife the husband, or at

them, as the auncient philosophers
haue defended. For women haue soules as

they should be bounde, whom nature hath
made frée? Naye,<note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaians.</note> among the <hi>Achaians,</hi>
women had such soueraigntie, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they commaunded, their husbands

swept the house, drest the meate, and did al

then of dutie she is bound to obey, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,

<pb facs="tcp:14298:34"/>
For in nothing can a wyfe shewe a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wysedome, than in dissembling with
an importunate husbande. Hir honest ye
hir good nature, and hir prayse is shewed
in nothing more, than in tollerating of an
vndiscreate man, and to conclude, as the
woman ought not to commaund the man
but to be alwaies obedient: so ought he not
to suffer himself to be commaunded of his
wife. <hi>Seneca</hi> in his tragedies of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sheweth a notable example. In the
warres of <hi>Mithridates</hi> &amp; the <hi>Romaines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A notable example.</note>
all the souldiours in Rome were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be in redinesse, to attend vpon <hi>Silla</hi>
the Consull. This edict being published,
the officers came to an olde knights house
to will him to prepare hymselfe. But his
wife withstood them and said, that he was
not at home, &amp; that he shoulde not go. For
quoth she, though perchaunce he were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet being an olde Souldiour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the warres, I will not giue
him leaue. Whereat the officers being
astonied, enformed the Senate thereof,
who forthwith banished the olde Knight,
for suffering himselfe to be commaunded
<pb facs="tcp:14298:35"/>
by his wyfe, and hir they kepte in prison
during his exile for presumption. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
woman, must be also verye carefull,
and circumspect of hir good name. For a
good name is the flower of estimation,<note place="margin">The good name of a woman is very deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</note> and
the pearle of credite, which is so delicate a
thing in a woman, that she must not only
be good, but likewise must appeare so. For
you men are naturally so malicious, that
you wil iudge aswel of that you suspect, as
of that which you sée. The chefest way for
a woman to preserue and maintayne this
good fame,<note place="margin">The good married woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must be resident in hir owne house.</note> is to be resident in hir owne

at home, all thinges shall be better gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

that greatly delighted in huntyng,
who on a daye, néere to a little village en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
with a poore Wydowes daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a simple wench, but somwhat snowte
fayre, whose gaye eyes, had so intrapped
<pb facs="tcp:14298:38"/>
thys iolye hunter, that vnder the colour
thereof, he oftentimes resorted vnto hir
and laye diuers nightes out of his owne
house. When his wife, being both fayre,
wyse, and vertuous, vnderstoode thereof,
as well by hys demeanour, as by other
coniectures, lyke a wyse woman she dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
the matter, and kept it secret to
hir selfe, not altering eyther countenance
or condicions towardes him, but on a
time, when she was assured, that he was
gone another waye, hyed hir to the house,
where she learned of the yong woman the
whole circumstaunce, feyning hir selfe to
be his sister, and when she had vewed the
chambers, and bedding, wherein he lay,
which was verye homelye, she returned
home againe &amp; trussed vp a good bed, well
furnished, and hangings, with other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
which as secretly as she could,
conuayde thither, desiring both the olde
woman, and hir daughter to be good to hir
brother, and sée that he wanted nothing.
The next day, came this gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home
and according to his custome went a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to his old haunt, where he seing this
<pb facs="tcp:14298:38"/>
newe furniture, marueyled much thereat
and inquired what the matter ment. The
olde mother aunswered, that a sister of his
had béene there, and willing them to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysh

money. The gentleman vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
then how the world went, and know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
it to be hys Wyfes doing, returned
foorthwith home, and demaunded of hir
the truth, and what she ment thereby,
who denied it not. The cause why, quoth
shée, I sent such furniture thither, was
bicause I vnderstanding howe daintilye
you were accustomed to lie at home, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you might by such harde entertayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
haue gotten some harme. He should
quoth the Lady <hi>Aloisa</hi> haue had a bed of

now to continue my purpose, I saye that
very circumspect and warie must the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

tyme is, when anger, and malincholye
raigneth not, and in any case, let no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be in place to heare hir. For it is a
wyse mans griefe, to beare the open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
of his wyfe. The best place is, as I
sayde, when they are both in bed, a place
appointed for reconcilements, and renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of loue and friendship, let your words
not be spitefull, but louing, kinde, gentle,
mery and pleasaunt. For though the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

thereby to shewe what loue she beareth
hym, where she may lawfullye poure out
