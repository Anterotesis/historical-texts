         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You have the Subſtance of this, already, upon Evidence, and Experiment.</hi> Next to this <hi>Caution</hi> towards your <hi>Profeſſed Adverſaries,</hi> allow me to propoſe a more <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> and <hi>open Clearneſſe</hi> towards your <hi>Uſefull Friends;</hi> if it were but to <hi>prevent Miſ-underſtandings:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, that the very <hi>Doubt</hi> is both <hi>Injurious</hi> and <hi>Painful. Offices of Reſpect, and Comfort, ought to be performed with Liberty, and Chearfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> without any the leaſt mixture of <hi>Scruple,</hi> and <hi>Reſerve. Theſe Frank and Mutual Enterchanges of Succour, and Advice, beget a Truſt,</hi> and <hi>Kindneſſe;</hi> And <hi>That's the true Foundation of a Happy and Laſting Union.—That Friendſhip which admits a Jelouſie, wavers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>You,</hi> (my Lord) your <hi>Officers,</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> are become <hi>One</hi> with this <hi>City,</hi> you have then but Contracted a nearer Alliance with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whoſe ſeveral <hi>Counties,</hi> and <hi>Diviſions,</hi> (how remote ſoever) are (with this Town) but Parts ſtill of the ſame Body. By a Conſent of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi> and <hi>Senſe,</hi> they <hi>Proſper,</hi> or they <hi>Wither,</hi> they <hi>Grieve,</hi> or <hi>Ioy,</hi> they <hi>Live,</hi> or <hi>Dye.</hi> Nor are they more united in their <hi>Intereſts,</hi> than in their <hi>Votes,</hi> and <hi>Reſolutions;</hi> for they have unanimouſly <hi>engaged with the City, to maintain their Rights, and Liberties, the Reformed Religion, and the Freedom of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, againſt all Hazzards, and Oppoſitions whatſoever.</hi> I need not tell your Lordſhip by what <hi>Audacious</hi> and <hi>Illegal Violences,</hi> this <hi>Declaration</hi> and <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> was <hi>extorted</hi> from them. <hi>The Nation ſtood condemn'd to Servitude, and Beggery,</hi> even by <hi>thoſe,</hi> whom they themſelves had <hi>Rayſed</hi> from that Condition, to aggravate the <hi>Bondage,</hi> by the more Intollerable <hi>Authors</hi> of it. 'Twas now become a Crime, <hi>to name a Full, Free Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament,</hi> and <hi>Treaſon</hi> to appeal to any other <hi>Law,</hi> than the Inſipid <hi>Vote</hi> of a Legiſlative Conventicle. The Gaols are full of Priſoners upon that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſcore.</p>
            <p>Was it not time, (my Lord) to bid theſe People hold their Hands, after the expenſe of ſo much <hi>Bloud,</hi> and of ſo many <hi>Millions;</hi> and all this only <hi>to perpetuate a dearer, and a more Infamous Thralldom?</hi> The <hi>Pulpits</hi> were enured to <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> and <hi>Non ſenſe,</hi> and the <hi>Government proſtituted for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to Perſons able to diſgrace a Bawdy Houſe.</hi>—Theſe, and the like Indignities, put the Nation upon their Juſt, and neceſſary Defence; And in that Poſture they now ſtand Ready, and Reſolved.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency hath been tender hitherto of Bloud, but if a ſpeedy Order be not taken, to Regulate thoſe ſtragling Troops, that Act ſtill in the Countries, <hi>in Oppoſition to a Settlement,</hi> It will come yet to Blows: For queſtionleſſe, <hi>in caſe of a Neceſsity, the People will never stand ſtill, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be picked out, man by man, till they be all Destroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentry and Nobility, are Slaves to every pedling Purſuivant. 'Tis but a VVarrant from our Maſters, and all is Fiſh that comes to Net: No matter for a Crime, if there be a <hi>Booty.</hi> All that the People <hi>ask,</hi> all they deſign, is but <hi>the Benefit of the Law.</hi> VVill any <hi>Engliſh man</hi> deny it us? Firſt, They have <hi>ſworn</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> it; next <hi>We</hi> have <hi>ſworn,</hi> rather to <hi>dye,</hi> than loſe it. This <hi>Faction</hi> hath coſt the <hi>Nation</hi> more than 60. <hi>Millions,</hi> beſides the <hi>Blood</hi> they have <hi>Lapp'd:</hi> and yet 100000 l. <hi>a Month, and not a farthing leſſe,</hi> will do their Buſineſſe, that is, 5000 l. a Man, or ſome ſuch Trifle: <hi>For that, the Juncto ſhares; perhaps the Souldier, once in a year, or 2. may get his Mornings draught, and then be turn'd to Graze upon Free Quarter; and hang'd for Mutiny, if he but talks of Mony.</hi> Its the trick they ſerved all that have ſerved them. VVho ever <hi>strikes,</hi> or <hi>Payes</hi> on their behalf, <hi>fights</hi> but for <hi>Bondage,</hi> and <hi>contributes</hi> to his own <hi>Chaynes.</hi> If they had any <hi>Faith,</hi> they might be <hi>truſted.</hi> But <hi>Oaths</hi> go down with them like <hi>Pills of Butter,</hi> they are <hi>diſſolved,</hi> as ſoon as <hi>taken.</hi> That <hi>Perjury</hi> which would <hi>poyſon</hi> a <hi>good Christian</hi> is but their <hi>Nutriment.</hi> Nay worſe than <hi>Wolves,</hi> they are <hi>falſe</hi> to their own <hi>Kind,</hi> and <hi>enter worry one-another.</hi> I ſhould be endleſs, to purſue this Subject till I want Matter. In brief, <hi>My Lord, look to your ſelf, and to your Friends; Life and Death are before you, Chuſe. May Heaven direct and bleſſe your Councils and Endeavours, ſo far, as you proceed with Piety and Honour.</hi> To prevent Miſtakes, I do declare, that there are divers <hi>moderate</hi> and <hi>ſober</hi> Perſons, in the Mixture, for whom I have a fair <hi>Reſpect,</hi> and that the tartneſſe of my Language, only concerns the <hi>Furious</hi> and <hi>Phanatique</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Word now to the City;</hi> and that a <hi>ſhort</hi> one.] <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> upon your fair complyance with the General, depends much of your ſafety: that is, ſo far as he comports himſelf with Terms of <hi>Prudence, Equity,</hi> and <hi>Honour;</hi> (and he is too <hi>Noble,</hi> to goe Leſſe) next, to <hi>himſelf,</hi> you finde his <hi>Officers,</hi> of an <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> Converſation; and worth your Friendſhips, <hi>their Commands apart;</hi> you likewiſe find the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Army, Civil,</hi> and <hi>well d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſciplin'd,</hi> you doe exceeding well to pay them all due reſpects: and to joyn <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and <hi>Counſels,</hi> with them;—you have done <hi>Wiſely, Honeſtly,</hi> and <hi>Bravely too, to oppoſe Taxes:</hi> that is, <hi>Taxes impoſed without a Law,—to be employed againſt your ſelves;</hi>—and ſuch, as had you granted them, your <hi>Preſident</hi> would have extended to <hi>enſlave</hi> your <hi>Poſteritie.</hi>—Your care next, to <hi>diſarm</hi> the <hi>Sectaries,</hi> was very ſeaſonable, your City had probably been in Aſhes elſe by this time. Conſider, they bear the ſame minde ſtill, and where they had thoſe weapons they can quickly have more. You cannot be <hi>ſecure</hi> without your <hi>Militia,</hi> nor can any thing fairly obſtruct your Procurement of it: <hi>In Titchburn's Caſe,</hi> it was by the Commons ordered, <hi>that any ſix of the Common-council (upon emergent occaſions) might ſend for the Lord Mayor to call a Common-council, and in caſe of default, call it themſelves, and any 40 of them, to have power to act as a Common-council, without the Lord Mayor, any thing in their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the contrary Notwithſtanding:</hi> See the Hiſt. of Independency, part 2. page 83. Not to exceed my limits, <hi>Forget not your ſuffring friends, and ſtand firm to your Aſſociates, and Allies. He that tamely ſuffers one Injury, provokes another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to the <hi>Nation,</hi> for a Farewell.] I need not preſſe my Country-men with many Cautions, your <hi>Freedom of Elections, that's your Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;</hi> 'Tis that you all <hi>declare,</hi> to <hi>Live</hi> and <hi>Dye</hi> for, you are too <hi>wiſe,</hi> to be <hi>cheated</hi> with Reſtrictions and <hi>Qualifications:</hi> as if the Queſtion were the <hi>Number,</hi> rather than the <hi>Choice,</hi> at this rate, you may have a <hi>full Houſe,</hi> indeed; but How? That is, <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>Brats,</hi> the <hi>Kinred,</hi> and the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans of thoſe that ſit already;</hi> and then, they that have <hi>gull'd</hi> you all this while, ſhall <hi>govern</hi> you for ever, your very <hi>Declarations</hi> againſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Tyranny, have brought you to that Point, that <hi>there's no ſafety left you, but in violence;</hi> for, while you <hi>talk,</hi> you <hi>dye,</hi> your ſcattered Friends are gathered up, one by one; whereas, your SEASONABLE UNION MAKES ALL SURE. As your <hi>Intentions</hi> are Honourable, ſo let your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be.

Why ſhould not that be done to him, that himſelf would have done to others? It is true, we give Law to Hares, and Deers, becauſe they be Beaſts of Chaſe; it was never accounted either cruelty, or fowl-play, to Knock Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and VVolves on the head, as they can be found, becauſe theſe be Beasts of Prey: The VVarrener ſets traps for Powlcats and other Vermin, for Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Warren.</hi>
