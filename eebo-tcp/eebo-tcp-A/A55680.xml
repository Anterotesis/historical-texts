            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN proposing a <hi>Scheme</hi> of <hi>Presbyterial Government,</hi> we intend not thereby to carp or cavel at others, whose Light or Conscience swayes them to be of a different Sentiment, but modestly to offer such a <hi>Plain Por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>traiture</hi> of it, as it may conspicuously appear to be comely and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable, at least not so black and odious, as some immoderat Spirits are industriously employed to misrepresent and traduce, following that devilish <hi>Maxime, fortiter calumniare, aliquid adhaerebit.</hi> It is sufficiently known in the World, that there have been clamorous contests and long continued virulent debates, about <hi>Church Government,</hi> specially among us in <hi>Britain</hi>; The LORD send a healing Spirit, and put a final Period to our dolorous dissentions, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>We conclude, lamenting the unhappy times we live in, wherein the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion sadly suffers, partly by the gross immoralities of many of the professors of it upon the one hand, partly by the dissentions, divisive practices, and implacable like ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities of others of them upon the other hand; As for the first of our maladies, we may justly say with</hi> Seneca, collecta vitia per tot aetates diu. in nos redundant; Seculo premimur gravi quo sceleta Regnant. <hi>Sen: Octav</hi>: 355. <hi>And this Epidemical plague of prophanity seems herein to be the more prodigious and desperate, that notoriously, scandalous persons approbriously contemn the cure of their sins.</hi> Viz: <hi>The Faithful Administration of Gospel Ordinances, particularly that</hi> August <hi>and veneral ordinance of GOD, Ecclesiastick Discipline and Censures; Alas! few are perswaded this is a Divine Ordinance, and far fewer will submit to it as such, but rather in their pride, perversitie and ignorance, decline and scorn Church censures,</hi> Tell it not in Gath, <hi>&amp;c: That among Christians, Christs Laws and Constitutions are so contemptuously treated, what other could be expected

of Turks and Pagans, we will sav no more to such Vnchristian Christians, but what a Heathen did say of old,</hi> Sequitur Superbos ultor a tergo Deus. Sen. Here: Fur: 197. <hi>As to the other Maladie of Contentions &amp; Sebisms in the Church, which are also the Bane of Religion, we may complain as</hi> Opratus <hi>did of his times,</hi> Omnes contentiosi homines sumus. <hi>we are all of us a contentious pack of men, for of a Truth on all sides litigant, particularly about Church Government, there are too many inflexible tenacious and peremptorie in every punctilio of their espoused Opinions, as if the whole of Religion were invelopt therein, and are readie to misjudge, nickname and revile one another, yea and some bigots of each counterparty to Vnchurch and Vnchris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian one another [a wild practice, dounright</hi> Antipodes, <hi>and contrare to the Rules and genius of the Gospel] but be gainer or loser who will by these intestine tragick digladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, surely the common enemie Triumphs in our spoils &amp; ruins, as Trophies of Victory. O Christians! what shall be done for the remedie of these maladies? It requires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed much wisdom to propose, and no less prudence and discretion to apply what might be thought fit to be proposed, but in all likelie hood, only Heavens hand can rectifie &amp; redress what is amiss and out of course this day; Yet surelie as Ministers derive their power from the Mediator Christ, so Magistrates derive theirs from God Almightie, and both be vertue of their Office, Commission and Capacitie, are unavoidably obliged to join their power and policie together for the suppression and punishment of vice and wickedness and the promoval and encouragement of Vertue and Pietie, for no less will God call civil Magistrates to an account for their negligence and maladministrations then Church Pastors and Ministers, therefore both should amicably correspond and cordially concur for advancing the peace and puritie of the Church, for which purpose it is our hearty Vote, that God would pour forth a spirit of Wisdom, Zeal and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon Magistrats Ministers and all Ranks and degrees of persons,</hi> Amen.</p>
