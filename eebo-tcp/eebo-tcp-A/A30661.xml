         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The reſtauration of Arts, and the advancement of Sciences has been the ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reſearch, and the unwearied endeavour of ſome, both Ancient and Modern
Writers, men of name for Learning; but, whilſt they dig for it in ſome

deceitful diſputings, and falacious concludings, and ſubdolous circumventings,
impoſing of miſtakes upon the ignorant and undiſcerning, thruſting of errours
upon them by captious arguings, and ſhiftingly evading the evident force of the
moſt convincing demonſtrations, by miſapplyed diſtinctions, which do endleſly
ingage contentious Wits in a ſcholaſtick warring, and vain jangling: the Preſs
ſtill keeps fighting by ſending forth one Book of controverted matter againſt
another, yet are there no Trophies of any conſiderable proficiency and progreſs
all this while, either by victoriouſneſs over Error, or by triumphingneſs of Truth;
whereas, there would ſoon be a more amicable league, a more pacifick confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
amongſt the ſound and ſober of men of depth of Learning, and of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringneſs
of Spirit, if all their Books were either apt ſignificant Commentaries
upon the holy Scriptures, or due right interpretations of created Beings accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thoſe Scriptures. That Light, which the unſcriptural, antiſcriptural
writings of Philoſophizing men have afforded us, has been to manifeſt this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, what erring, wandring by-ways we would turn aſide from, not what
even, ſtraight paths we ſhould walk in: much of that knowledge, which ſuch
have themſelves attained unto, and which they would have others to be wrong
led into by following of them, is this, that there is no certainty of knowledge,
nor ſatisfactorineſs of underſtanding throughly compaſſable by any or all mere
humane diſquiſitions and diſcoveries, ſo that many of the moſt eminent of
them are ſelf-condemned, and have pronounced the ſentence againſt their own
inventions, and againſt themſelves, for thoſe merely humane excogitates, in the
Judicatory Courts of their own Intellect and Conſcience, and have thereby o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
renounced and quitted their former uſurped Authority, by which they too
long, and too much impoſed upon the over-credulity of blinded minds. But
what, ſhall ſuch a traditionary receiving of corrupt notions never have an end
put unto it? ſhall the opinionative conceits, and the conjectural ratiocinations
of deceived deceiving men be ſtill handed down from one to another? Such

do purſue them, will find them at the laſt to be erring in Theory, failing
in practice, fruitleſs in experience, after much expence of difficult labour, and
of chargeable travel. The wild little fancy of vain fooliſh man would be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a new imaginary world of Artals, and of Scientificks, which are his
own formed <hi>Ideas,</hi> and ſpeculated conceits, and modelled opinionativeneſs, and
then would not only make an Idol of ſelf to fall down before its own miſ-ſhapen
Image, and to fail in love with its own empty ſhadow, but would alſo ſet it
up before others, that they may worſhip it too, which has been for ſo many
ages of the world, the grand deſign, and the too far prevailing attempt of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick
Phantaſms, of Humane Magiſtralities, of ſelf-weaved Ratiocinations,
of forced Extractions, of indulged Senſations, and of unſetling Scepticiſms,
which ſix have laid ſome of the moſt claim to the higheſt advance of Humane
Learning, though their Arts and Sciences have been hitherto ſo far from being
really in their nature, or uſe liberal, that they have been ſome of the moſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous
enſlavers of mens judgements, and impriſoning fetters of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
How many thouſands have by their wandring after ſuch miſguiders
left and loſt their way in the dark, where their Souls have been filled with
troubleſome doubts, and with tormenting fears, expoſing them to violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
of Atheiſm and Unbelief? and what wonder, that it is thus with the
Scholar, when ſome of the learnedeſt of the Maſters themſelves have reſolved
upon this, as the concluſion of all their knowledge, that, All things are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of doubtful queſtionings, and are intricated with knotty difficulties, and do
paſs into amazing uncertainties, and reſolve into coſmical ſuſpicions? And this,
not only is the deliberate Judgement of particular Virtuoſo's in our day, but
has been the publick determination of an whole Univerſity, if there be truth in
thoſe Hiſtorical Records, that do report them to us; even with thoſe has it
thus been ſo, who made proficiencie in Arts, and progreſs in Sciences, to be the
ſubject of their profeſſion, the matter of their inquiry, and the deſign of their
ſtudiouſneſs. How manifold the inconveniences? how miſchievous the effects
of this have been, if the Readers Spirit would not be exaſperated thereby,
might be ſoon inlarged upon; for the Writer would not provoke or inrage
mens paſſions, but would come in words of truth, and of ſoundneſs to hold
forth a Scripture Light before ſuch as are of a temperate and ſober underſtanding,
and of a ſerious conſidering ſpirit: The hurt that has been done to my own ſoul,
and the ſcars that are viſibly upon me, by my ill-choſen-ſtudies, and miſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
hours heretofore, though in a way of ſome diligence, do ſtir up ſome
compaſſions in me towards others, to indeavour the preventing or curing
of the like ſpreading diſtemper in their underſtandings, the infectiouſneſs of
which diſeaſe in mens intellects, has been hitherto little ſuſpected, and its dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſneſs
leſs felt: And therefore, if in faithful plainneſs, I do oppoſe paganiſh
or Ethnick Philoſophy; let it be once more remembred, that where-ever this
expreſſion is found, or ſuch other words relating to the ſame matter in this
Treatiſe, I mean thereby, that vainly affected humane wiſdom, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by Pagans, by Heathens, (or by Satan, who taught it unto ſuch) by ſuch
as had not the ſound ſaving knowledge of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim,</hi> or of His word;
but did write beſides it, and contradictorily to it, and ſo far as this kind of
Philoſophy is ſtill retained and defended by any Chriſtians; For, this is that
which has ſo anticipated mens minds, with ſuch corrupt principles as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with prophane practices, with ſuch miſ-ſhapen notions as are ſuited to
carnal reaſon, with ſuch wrong opinions as do plead for depraved Cuſtoms,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55870:7"/>
with ſuch flattering perſwaſions as are humouring to ſenſual affections; it doth
ſo infect and ſicken their intellect, ſo weaken and make it Conſumptive, that, who
can cure it, if the LORD Chriſt himſelf be not actually the one and the only
All-skilful Phyſician, and if Scripture-Learning be not ſeaſonably well applyed,
as the one and the only univerſal remedy of this of the mind? whilſt ſome
do write and others do read ſo many expoſitions upon paganiſh Philoſophy,
and do ſo little ſtudy the Scriptures of Truth; the Preſs may bring forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
curiouſly arted Books, but there will be in the intellectual World a famme
of Progreſſive Literature: The frequent Divertiſements by ſuch unfruitful Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are ſo many, and ſo tedious (for, they make art to be long, and Life to be
ſhort; whereas Word-Study and Scripture-Learning would make Art ſhort and
Life long) that thoſe who do waſte their precious time in theſe worthleſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
do find the prime of their day, and the vigorouſneſs of their age even
decaying and dying away, before they know aright what to know, and how to
live: Some who have had that Univerſity honour put upon them to be called
Maſters of Arts, yet have afterwards experienced, that they had little elſe but
the name, and have look'd upon thoſe years (as the corrupted education then
was) to have been the void ſpace of their life, which would have been the choice
ſeaſon of their time, if Tutors had put them in a right way of Scriptural
Learning. One of the skilfulleſt advancers of Humane Learning, in one of
the moſt laboured and beſt wrought Treatiſes upon that Subject, has in the cloſe
of his Book given a ſhort proſpect of a new world of Sciences, or the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
of them, fifty in number; and he that ſhall make uſe of his Directory to
attain theſe, yet would, though he lived to old age, bring in an ignoramus for
the Verdict when he comes to die: Whereas, all thoſe and more, ſo far as they
are neceſſary and uſeful, might have a clearer diſcovery, and a fuller ſupplement
in Scripture, and in Nature according to Scripture, were it throughly ſearched
into for that end. If Heatheniſh Philoſophy did not ſtrangely bewitch and
awe young Scholars, with a reſpect of the Authority, and a greatning of the
names of its Authors, and an eſteem of the multitude of its Books, which do
ſo fill the Shops and Libraries, and with the difficulty of making many of its
notions and diſtinctions, and obſcure terms reconciled to ſome degree of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
ſenſe, after ſo much diſpending of Time and of Coyn, its price would
fall in the Printers Market, and its trade go down in the Bookſellers Shop.
How little can there be of certitude in that way, where all muſt reſolve into
fallibleneſs of Authority, and falaciouſneſs of Teſtimony, or into pretended e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of forced experiments, which may be variouſly effected, whilſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick
Natures and genuine cauſalities of created Beings, and of their products
are altogether hidden from ſuch great adorers of Humane Wiſdom as count
themſelves, and would be ſo eſteemed by others, to be, if not the only, yet the
moſtly learned men in the world; and who would have their dictates to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as inerring, and their traditions as incontrolable; whereas their aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do end in doubtfulneſſes, and their ſtating of queſtions is not definitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating,
but ſtill the judgement of the pondering Reader muſt ſuſpend it
ſelf, and look further for ſatisfaction. How many Eſſences and verities are
there which Ethnick Philoſophy cannot reach; the clear underſtanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it can never attain unto of its ſelf, neither are they any other way fully
diſcovered unto us but by the Scripture revelation? What meer<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Treaſuries of Creatures there are there? what the work and priviledges of the

appearances of the ever bleſſed <hi>Jehovah Aelohim,</hi> in Father, Son and Holy
Spirit are there? which of them can ſo deſcend into the Abyſs, as to bring me
the trueſt information from thence, where the great Gulph is, that is between
Heaven and Hell? what and where the place of Hell is? where are the ſeveral
Chambers of darkneſs below, and of light above? For, although the Gulph
and Hell are<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 15. 11, 24.</note> open before the all-ſeeing <hi>Jehovah,</hi> yet are they far out of ſight,
and off from the knowledge of men on Earth, by any mere humane diſquiſition
or diſcovery: Who of theſe Philoſophers can by their own natural ability
throughly convince me, of the true Doctrine, and of the real nature of inviſibles,
which yet, now they are revealed, are not incredibles? Can any of them return
a ſatisfactory anſwer to thoſe queſtions which the LORD propounded unto

are ſo productive of ſo many wonderful effects in the World? How defective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Bodies, about their Spheres, their Orbs, their divers Poles, their firſt
Moveable, their contrary motion of Renitencie, their Circles, Eccentricks and

Hypotheſes againſt Objections, and ſetting up ſuch feigned Fabricks as may
not be expoſed to ſo many exceptions and contradictions, as the fictitious conceits

triumph over others, if their own excogitated opinions have not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futable
by the common received principles, whilſt themſelves do not believe
their own ſuppoſitions to be the true nature of the things themſelves? how
then can they perſwade others, that their diſcoveries are real and profitable?
and that they might hold the World yet further on in ignorance, and in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
they daringly affirm the Scriptures not to afford light in theſe matters:
Whereas, theſe alone can ſet mens underſtandings right about the verity of beings,
which cannot by all a mans diligence any other way be ſolidly known. Wiſe

are ſecrets in Nature, hiddenneſſes in Truths, implications in Cauſes; that there
is much darkneſs upon their Mind, blindneſs upon their Intellect, weakneſs
in their Underſtanding; that their Knowledge is but Folly, their Powers are
impotent, their abilities inſufficient, and their reſearches ſhallow; thus they
fall into ſuſpicion, and grow into diſlike of themſelves, concluding an utter
impoſſibility in Humane Arts; ſeeing there are ſo many unknown ſubtilties in

and beyond their hopes, and they profeſſingly declared, that they will affirm
nothing; ſubtilty is their Science, and fallacy is their Faculty: How many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
might be asked of the moſt Learned of them, concerning the moſt plain
and familiar things, ſuch as are moſt obvious and expoſed to the outer ſenſes,
about Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Taſting, Feeling, which would puzzle them,
and amaze their Underſtanding? were all the witty Ingenioſo's, and generous
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55870:8"/>
Virtuoſo's of the World colledged, and incoporated into one Philoſophick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
all their extra-Scriptural diſquiſitions would never reach or hit what
they ſay they aim at, becauſe they uſe not, improve not the adapted mediums
to come at it: It would have been more wiſdom in ſuch bold undertakers to be
Inſtancers of Learning, if they had either laid aſide their attempt, or pointed to
a directer courſe, and to a righter way; for by an ill unadviſed managing of
the inquiry, the inner Rooms of Learning are ſtill locked up, and her Treaſures
are not diſcloſed. If the Reader marvel why one of ſo little Philoſophical
Learning, and of ſo much worldly deſpiſedneſs, will adventure in ſuch a day to
be ſo open a redarguer of the whole Philoſophick World; let him know, that
the Scripture-cauſe will conqueringly plead it ſelf, and its advocate has ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſecurity, that the Glory will be his, who is the Author of ſo full a word:
Let the Writer and his Treatiſe decreaſe into a nothing, as to this; and let <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi>
and his word increaſe into an All; whilſt the Traditionary Learning of
theſe men, which is but the credulous receiving of a falſe report, and their
ſenſitive learning, which is often the wrong information of equivocating wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
and their experimental Learning, which is uſually the haſty obſervation
of indagators, and of caſual inventers; theſe ſhall bluſh and vaniſh, be gone,
and aſhamed to ſhew their faces, which ſo long have been ſet out to ſale under
the gaudy Titles of Natural Hiſtory, reſtored Sciences, and inſtaured Philoſophy;
but leaving the buyer ſick of his bargain, and crying out, That he has all
this while been over-reached and defrauded, impoſed upon, and inſulted over,
by thoſe who themſelves at length do judge this to be a caſe plainly deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
as not knowing how to extract the real truth of things, or which way ſo
to ſeparate all miſtakes, that they may at laſt be brought to ſomewhat, which is
wholly free from errour; and ſo, natural Beings may open themſelves, and
diſcloſe their inſide, in their primordial Virtues, and concealed excellencies.
The whole of the doctrine of the unſeen World, is altogether undiſcoverable
by any lawful means, but only the word Revelation; and therefore it is, that
<note n="c" place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 8, 18. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Paul</hi> doth condemn that Philoſophy, as a vain deception, which would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
upon its Diſciples, a belief of thoſe things it hath not ſeen, making its
own excogitates to be Oracles, when its own phantaſtick opinions are built
upon no other foundation, than the feigned Placents of humane imagination.
It would take away the Prize that belongs to the profiting Diſciples in Chriſt's
School, and give it unto thoſe, that run in the by-race of paganiſh Studies:
thus arrogating unto its ſelf an uſurped power of judging and of defining, who
are the moſt learned and skilful; it doth thruſt it ſelf into a pretended know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of ſuch ſecret hidden things, whereof it is altogether ignorant, as if it
were its own proper poſſeſſion: my task is to direct the Spiritual man, unto that
perfect Word, where he may get deep into the profoundeſt Myſteries of Religion,
and of Reaſon, of Grace and of Nature; where a clear-eyed-Faith may ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it ſelf with ſelf-evidencing verities. I am no inveſtigator of new fictitious
humane knowledges, but would ingage others to be educers of old ſound Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Learning,
which has been ſo long veiled with Philoſophical darkneſs,
and neglected by Sophiſtical prejudice. Shall we any longer walk on in the
circular tract of feigned Arts, and of corrupted Sciences by Humane Authors,
who write one after, and of another according to the-bad Copy ſet before them,
ſaying over and over the ſame falſified things, putting only a new name to an
old Stuff, whilſt they make little or no progreſs, becauſe they do not follow on
in a ſtraight line of edifying knowledge? How far are they from having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaid, all that can be ſaid, though one of them has groſly flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by applying of that expreſſion to his own Writings? Truth and Goodneſs
have mutual influence upon, and friendly fellowſhip with each other; and how
then can Humane Arts, and Philoſophical Sciences approve themſelves good
unto the Will, till they prove themſelves true to the Underſtanding of rational
Creatures? let no man<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 18, 19, 20, 21. <gap reason="foreign">

far true and kind unto our ſelves, as not to deceive our ſelves: What? ſhall
we deal with our ſelves as a falſe Thief doth deal with a ſilly Traveller, offering

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55870:8"/>
end, till he miſlead him into ſome dark and diſmal place, that there he may
rob and ſpoil him of his Treaſure? ſuch are wrong guides in the way of our
Study: It any man thinketh, that he is wiſe in this world, let him become a
fool, that he may be wiſe; for, the wiſdom of this World is fooliſhneſs with
God; the LORD knoweth the reaſonings of the wiſe, that they are vain;
therefore let no man glory in men. No Tutor is like unto that Spirit, who is the
LORD, informing humble Diſciples of the Book of his Word, and of his
Works: Uſeful Arts, and profitable Sciences have their legitimation in his
Word, and their naturalization in his Works: Here the mind of man is at once
both inlightned and ſanctified, informed and ſatisfied; whereas Academick
Scepticiſms do make their apprehenſions to be but appearances, and their propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
to be but probabilities, till he that is of an inquiring ſpirit, ſees he has
fed but upon empty notions, and ſo is diſcouraged into a deſponding fullenneſs,
and doth yield to over-coming difficulties. Whilſt our own unſteddy, unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hands will be drawing out Lines of Arts without a Scripture-rule, and our
Circles of Sciences without a word Compaſs; there will be much crookedneſs
and unequal diſtance therein, and the diſcovery which we make unto others,
will be that of our own weakneſs and indiſcretion. How provoking and
daring is this pride in fallen follyful man, which would ſtill keep alive ſo vain
an imagination, as if by Humane Invention it could equalize infinite Wiſdom,
put forth in Scriptures Science, and in Natures Art? Many of the Philoſophers
<hi>poſtulata,</hi> which they would have us unqueſtioningly to ſuppoſe, and to take
for granted to be evident Truths of undoubted certitude, are manifeſtly falſe,
though they would exempt their principles from contrary arguing, as if all
were well agreed here, and this Philoſophick Faith muſt not be diſputed; and
yet theſe blind guides would have the leading of us by the hand, till we paſs into
their darkneſs, and fall into their ditch. What do the moſt of Philoſophical
Diſputations ruſh into, but a mere ſmokie skirmiſh of hard words, which do
both cloud the Underſtanding, and inſnare the Judgement? Mens minds are
already but too much crookedly ſet by the corruptions of their own depraved
hearts; but, when they are further wreſted by wrying terms of Humane Arts,
they are with much the more difficulty, if ever, ſet right. Thus have men ſought
Sciences in their own brain, and would find out Arts in their own imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
till they have made a new Scheme, and a Syſtematical World of invented
Knowledges, which they do people in their own and in others fancies: their words
of Art have hid Truths from our plain ſerious Chriſtians, who are of humble inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringneſs,
that ſo Philoſophers might keep up their Silver-ſhrining-trade, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
it to be an impediment of Sciences, for the Scholar to require, or for the
Teacher to render, a clear proof of things propounded; from whence it comes,
that the powers of the mind are continually ſhaken with heſitancies, diverted
with impertinencies, abuſed with unprofitingneſs, and miſled into erringneſs.
This has been the miſchievous deſign of the grand Enemy of the rational
World, to obſcure Learning, and intricate Knowledges thereby to keep off
Souls from that Scripture-light, by which they might diſcern the ſecrets of
Wiſdom; and his negotiating Factors would have all the World to buy up his falſe
Ware, and to trade with him till they have almoſt waſted their all, and their
ſtock of Learning doth conſume, and they be quite bankrupted, as to any
ſoundneſs of knowledge: How imperiouſly domineering has this Philoſophick
Tyranny proved, which would have us to receive its ſtamp, and to bear its
image, as if it were that alone which muſt be current, and to admit of its
ſuperſcription, to conform to its platform, and to ſhape our Letters after this
Conquerors hand writing, as if all mankind ſhould ſubject and inſlave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to its intellectual uſurpation, which hath too long, and too far invaded all
Arts, and poſſeſſed all Sciences! If once profeſſing Chriſtians were more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
diſcerners, and more obſequious obſervers of Scripture-diſcoveries in theſe
matters, the plain diſcourſes of experienced Believers, and of growing Saints,
would reliſhingly favour more of ſaving ſound knowledge, and of wholeſome
uſeful Truth, than the learnedeſt Treatiſes of the wiſeſt Philoſophers, from
whoſe Writings we have no good reaſon to expect any transforming efficacie;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55870:9"/>
For the converting of ſtraying Souls, or for the rectifying of erring Minds. Arts
and Sciences, Philoſophick ones have heretofore miſ-called it their honour, to be
their Mother <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Daughters, becauſe there they had both riſe and growth;
yet even there was the grand ſeat of groſs Idolatry; when Pagan Aſtronomers
exalted themſelves as high above others in their knowledge of heavingly things,
they ſet up in their Imaginations and Books, many Monſters in the Heavens,
which have been long worſhipped as Gods. Corrupt Hearts and corrupt
Books will ſoon mingle, and corrupt Principles will quickly paſs into corrupt
practices; and thus does the Candle of many mens lives waſte away about em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty
vanities, or groundleſs conjectures, or ſuperſtitious conceits, or over-curious
nicities, or unprofitable ſubtilties, or intangling perplexities, and they dye away
without the inſighted perception of the moſt myſterious ſecrets, and choice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
and pretious treaſures.</p>
            <p>It is Scripture-knowledge that is the ſublimeſt Reaſon, and the beſt Learning;
the ſhining emanations of Holy Writ are clearly viſible to ſpiritual Eyes in this
age of Light: This is that, which I would hold forth before others, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
unto them. Were we more one in bringing all our Controverſies and
Diſputings to this only Rule of judging, we ſhould the ſooner agree in other
things, the Scripture-league would hold us cloſer together in a brotherly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy.
This deſign is not an humour of innovating in the Common-wealth
of Learning, but an indeavour to revive the true, good old way of written Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to bring back to that word of certainty, according to which the
proficiency in Arts, and the progreſſion in Sciences is beſt and only found:
Sound Knowledges will be upon ruining, till there be an apt reduction of them
to their primitive pure principles in Scripture-verities, where both their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
ſummary is contained, and their due bounds are ſet. Intellect and Reaſon
muſt be meaſured by a Scripture-line, and Senſes and Experiments muſt be
brought to word-axioms; theſe muſt conquer all Opinions, as having the
Univerſal Monarchy over all the learned Territories of the Intellectual World:
An exact diſcovery of the true Cauſes of things, with their efficacious producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of anſwerable effects, muſt be ſearched after here: No other Writing in the
World doth carry along with it Truths, ſuperiour dominion over the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and its magiſtral Authority over the Will; its illuſtration to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and its evidence to the Judgement, but only this; if I pay this reverence
unto Chriſt, and unto his Word, it is a duty which I owe him, and under him
to it as the ſum of Arts, and the treaſury of Sciences, the complete Bibliotheke
of all uſeful Learning: the due reſpect which I bear it, has enboldned me to
make this printed Report of it. The Principle of Eſſence is in <hi>Jehovah</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who is the Principal Efficient Cauſe of all Beings, who put a Being into
all created Natures; who is the great Inſtructer in uſeful Arts, who doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the beſt and greateſt ends of thoſe Arts, and doth direct to the trueſt
apteſt means, which do lead thereunto: But the Principle of Science is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the written Word, which doth give forth the right knowledge of the
Doctrinal part of thoſe Arts, and which doth make wiſe the Student, and
the Practicioner, by the help of ſenſes to collect ſome clear underſtanding, in
particular ſubject matters of thoſe ſeveral Arts, by Obſervation and Hiſtory to
gather and place in the Mind, what is taken in from thoſe Senſes, by inſighting
experiences, to apply to a certain uſe thoſe many collected Obſervations, by
induction inferringly, and improvingly to uſe, to apply, and to accommodate
thoſe many collected Experiences to conſtitute and eſtabliſh an univerſal concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
by theſe ſteps and degrees may we aſcend into ſound knowledge, and with
more ſpeed, eaſe and ſatisfaction, learn the beſt part of profitable Arts and
Sciences. This doth ſet out the true real Nature of created Beings, as they are
in the things themſelves; whereas mere humane attemps this way have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of demonſtration, nor infallibity of evidence, no further convincingneſs
than as they agree with this: there is anſweringneſs in this to the Nature of
Exiſtences, which are printed in this Word, and ſealed in the Creation: here
the laws of words are one with the laws of things; here the conducture of
the word doth lead the way, and the architecture of the Creation doth follow
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55870:9"/>
after: whatſoever doth contradict the grounds of God-inſpired Scripture, and
the reaſons of created Nature, muſt be rejected by us: here Scripture revealeth
Nature, and Nature declareth Scripture; the LORD's Mouth in his Word
doth not gainſay his hand in his Works; there are ſuch inner ſecrets in created
Beings, as are ſeparate from outward Senſes, and exempt from experimental
diſcovery, and withdrawn from mere humane inquiſition, which works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are beſt contemplated in the word of Grace, ſo ſweetly doth this inſinuate
into, and incorporate with thoſe. How is the Intellect of man likely to be
receptive of uſeful Truths, till it be firſt purified by Scripture-knowledge? all
the impreſſes of Wiſdom, of Truth, and of Goodneſs, that are in created things,
they are but the tranſcribed Characters of the Word, and the viſible repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of thoſe ſhining perfections, that are in the All-glorious Author of this
Word, who doth direct their Nature, and govern their operations, to bring
about his own holy juſt ends for the good and benefit of particular Beings, and
of the whole Univerſe. Scripture deſcriptions are moſt ſignificative of created
Natures, and beſt expreſſive of their real Virtues; let therefore theſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
Imperialiſts no longer exerciſe Lordſhip over the Faith of Chriſtians,
however they have thus far uſurped dominion over the Reaſon of Pagans; let
not our Underſtandings be commanded by their Laws of Arts, nor ruled by their
Decrees of Sciences, who would have all Intellects to bow before them, whilſt
they ſit in the Throne, and King it over mens Souls. It is the Scripture
Revelation that doth beſt preſerve the due order of Chriſt's Supreme Soveraignty,
and of its own pre-eminent authority, and of our regular ſubjection under both
him and it, by its winning commendations of Truths, and of Realities, in the
demonſtrativeneſs of their evidence, and in the choiceneſs of their excellencies,
operations of Nature, and efficiencies of Arts co-operating with Nature, and
drawing forth its working powers, are as ſo many inſtances and interpretations of
ſuch Scripture as do ſpeak of them. Wiſdom is<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 11. 19,</note> juſtified of her Sons, though
the common cry of the miſ-judging World be againſt her. Knowledges in this
Word have their univerſal conprehenſiveneſs, and if mens Studies in them were
fitted to their particular inclinations, and framed to their conſtitution-deſires,
more able inſtruments better furniſhed for publick employments, both in State
and in Church, both for Peace and for VVar, would then be found; the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt
Scripturians would prove the wiſeſt Artiſts, and the prudenteſt Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.
VVere Lecturers in all Countries encouraged, and appointed in fit places
to read in the Mother Tongue, on ſuch Scripture-ſubjects, it would make po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Judgements, and common Auditors great proficients in Arts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors
in Sciences; which ſpreadingneſs of knowledge of Chriſtians ſhould
not make it contemptible: whereas, now the Philoſophers would keep Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a few hands amongſt Scholars in the Univerſities, and Readers of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
and Profeſſors in the Schools, who would be monopolizing of Original
Languages, and of Scientifick Skills, and be driving on of their rich Trade of
over-reaching ſophiſtry: I judge it to be an Affirmation according to Truth,
and an undertaking according to Reality, that a plain Believer, of diſcerning
capacity, may be righter taught many uſeful things, about the Hiſtory of the
Creation, in natural Beings, in their proper Cauſations, productive Workings,
and genuine Effects in one year, than ſeveral years, and yet more times ſeven in
the common way of Philoſophical Studies will or can attain unto: In this
Scripture path Believers may expect the teachings of the Holy Spirit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightnings
from the Father of illuminations: much of the written Word
would then receive more evident and full interpretations, when Chriſt's Works
are made a paraphraſe upon his Words: Here particular Sciences are true,
fruitful and complete, not as in Philoſophical VVritings in falſe, barren and
empty. If little Children were commonly taught the Original Language, and
if there were in the Mother-Tongues of the ſeveral Nations ſuch an exact
Scripture Lexicon compoſed, as might ſhew the true meaning of all the Original
VVords, Roots and Branches, and of all the Original Phraſes, relating to the
ſeveral Arts and Sciences; and if the whole of theſe VVords and Phraſes were
orderly and diſtinctly with their cited Scriptures put into a common place of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55870:10"/>
theſe ſpecial knowledges in various profeſſions; and if the moſt accompliſhed,
the beſt gifted, the moſt excellingly graced, the moſt diligently and faithfully
induſtrious, and the moſt practically and skilfully experienced, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular Art and Science, did make it much of the work of their
day, and buſineſs of their life, to ſtudie the Scriptures for that peculiar
end and ſpecial purpoſe, putting not only general Rules, but particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
all methodically together, it would be a complete Summary, and an
exact Directory in that Art and Science. Shall my growing waiting hopes be
only of the next Generation, that they may liſten to this counſel? who will
give, that I may reap ſome good fruit of my labours in the preſent age! if the
LORD, by his ſecret inworking with wonderful efficacy, will renew and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiate
mens minds, if he will bend and bow their wills, change and awe their
hearts, then ſelf-conceit, pride and prejudice, will quickly vaniſh away, and a
teachable Frame will ſo imbrace and improve this advice, as that the ingenuous
and ſtudious will not be ſo injurious to themſelves, or unkind towards Chriſt,
as to kick Him and His VVord out of their Schools; for it will be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in a little time, that created Beings in their natural efficiencies, have ſuch
an hidden way of ſecret operation, as is beyond<note n="e" place="margin">Job 38. 2.</note> the moſt ſignificant expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of any Philoſophical VVorders; and therefore only the words of God can
fully ſo accommodate them to inlightned Underſtandings, as withal to make
them properly declarative of real workings: All true, both definitions and
deſcriptions of things by words, muſt be rectified by Scripture Language.
VVhatever be the iſſue, I have, through Mercy and Grace obtained from the
LORD, done this part of my Generation work, and in this I do rejoyce and
give glory to Him. VVhere doth the whole Scripture, that ſpeaks of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſend us to any other way of getting ſound knowledge? This deſign, that
I am now promoting, doth not interdict School education, nor forbid Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifick
Exerciſes, but it doth ſet both Teacher and Learner in a right way. VVhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can we go to fetch a perfect Supplement for deficiencie in Arts, but from
the VVord? no where elſe is there an unerring rectification of the crooked
variations of Sciences but here. VVere Students once well perſwaded, that this
Scripture-method and way of attaining knowledges were<note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 8. 11. 12.</note> paſſable and plain,
and the walk there experienced to be ſafe and eaſie, how could it then be any
other than pleaſant travelling, which doth ſo directly lead to ſo great a profit,
where all is beſt ſuited, not only to the future eternal happineſs of Believers,
but alſo to the preſent wiſing of the VVorld, gratifying at once both the
ſpeculative Inquirer, and the mechanick Artificer, where both an augmentation
of many uſeful particularities, and a melioration of the whole of gainful Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
would be met with? Expected occaſions are flying away from me now, as
many of them have already taken wing and are gone, and therefore ere a ſtop
be put to my breathing here below, I would by a Scripture-hand conduct a little,
that the more wiſe and skilful may come on and lead others further forward:
I ſhould gladly have ſat down as a teachable Diſciple, at the feet of ſome
well-grown Inſtructer, and would delightfully do ſo ſtill, if others better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and more accompliſhed, and who have more opportunities and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
would more throughly inform both themſelves and others, in the true
ſtate of this ſcientifical project. Here may be at once both the true increaſe of
uſeful Learning, and the real promoting of an Holy Life. This ſound Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-knowledge
is the only cure of arted Phantaſms, and the proper means
of being awakened out of ſcientifick Dreams: Here the regenerate intellect of
the New Creature gets quick acquaintance with the true reaſons of things, and
his inlightned mind is familiar in its converſe with real exiſtencies; here are
ſet before his view clear Aſpects from inviſible Objects, and his inner man can
commune with unſeen talkers, which do give him ready acceſs into the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Country of the other VVorld. The Scriptures are compoſed, not only for
contemplative felicity, but alſo for practical buſineſs, being exactly ſuited to
all weightineſs of affairs, and to all the powers of an operative life. The order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
working, and the real uſefulneſs of created Beings, is to be directed unto her;
all the Philoſophers in the world, with all their Books have no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that profitable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55870:10"/>
Learning in them, which the four and thirty firſt Verſes of the Bible have
treaſured up in them: Here the meditating inquirer may get the knowledge of
thoſe diſtinct works of the Creator in their ſix proper days foregoing, which
works are the viſible Signets, and the lively Impreſſions of the comely Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of the glorious Maker, till the believing Soul cometh and paſſeth into
its reſt, and to ſweet ſatisfaction ſenſibly enjoyeth its holy Sabbath, in Him on
the ſeventh, which is the laſt, the cloſing day of the week; this being much of
my preſent purport and deſign, drift and ſcope in this Treatiſe, from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
days of the firſt week of the Created VVorld, and the eſtabliſhed unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Laws thereof, to propound ſome profitable inquiries from each days pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
ſuch as may have a direct tendency to the real advancement of uſeful
Learning, and then opening ſomewhat of my own apprehenſions from the
collating of other Scriptures, concerning the matters queried, ſuch of them as
are profitably handled, for ſeveral others will be little, if any thing more than
barely propounded, and ſo left to further diſquiſition. In this undertaking
there is no juſt cauſe for any to be, either an humorous Envyer, or a quarrelſome
Contender, or a troubleſome Backbiter, or a treacherous Enemy, or a falſe
Friend; let him but love Chriſt, and believe the VVord, and approve the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
and promote the Deſign, and better the Plot, I have much of my deſire
ſo far; where any will meliorate it, he ſhall have my Prayers and Teſtimony
for him. In this age of ſuch diffuſed rovings of mind, and of ſuch wandring
expatiations of imaginations, my walking Soul has then the more quiet reſting
place, when it gets and keeps within Scripture-doors, and there freely converſeth
with Chriſt. In this word each Artiſt may find out his Myſtery, and get skill
with a little coſt by plainly reading the imprinted Characters of the uſeful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his lawful Profeſſion: Here real Learning wears the Honour of its
Crown, and true wiſdom is beautified with the dignity of its advancement, in
the ſeveral Sciences; here the King may be skilled in the Art of Empire, and
the Magiſtrate may be wiſed in the Science of Government; here the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller
may know how to adviſe, and the Warriour may be taught how to fight;
here the Aſtronomer may beſt underſtand the Heavens, and the Luminaries
there; here the Geometrician may learn how to meaſure, and the Arithmetician
how to number, the Phyſician how to cure, the Surgeon how to heal, the
Anatomiſt how to diſſect, the Apothecary how to compound, the Sea-man how
to ſail, the Architect how to build, the Muſician how to modulate, the Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
how to argue, the Geographer how to ſituate, the Chronologer how to
compute, the Rhetorician how to perſwade, the Hiſtorian how to Record, the
Carpenter how to rule, the Joyner how to frame, the Advocate how to plead,
the Miniſter how to preach, the Coſmographer how to ſyſteme,<note n="g" place="margin">Eſai. 28. 23—29: Eccleſ. 10. 8, 9, 10.</note> the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
how to manure: Theſe and other Artiſts in other honeſt Trades would
find their God inſtructing and teaching them, concerning the righteſt way,
and the fitteſt manner, to manage, and to carry on their ſeveral Functions,
with ſucceſs through his bleſſing upon their labours; all their affairs would
then be ordered with more diſcretion and prudence; even the Hedger, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and the Carpenter, would experience Scripture-wiſdom to have an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of rectification in it, to direct them how to do their work aright. What

any, or all Philoſophick Books of mere Humane Wiſdom can skill in? here is
the Spring and Fountain of all true good Learning: Scripture-knowledge has
the cleareſt light, and gives the moſt certain information, affording the moſt
pure and ſatisfying delights: This doth hold the refined Intellect, and the

here the true real cauſes of Errour are aſſigned and manifeſted: It is not ſaid,
that men do therefore err, becauſe they know not the Traditions of Elders, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55870:11"/>
the Cuſtoms of Fore-fathers, or becauſe they are not skilled in the Doctrines of
the Rabbies, and in the Writings and Sayings of the Fathers, or becauſe they
do not ſubmit to the Authorities of Magiſtral Guides, and of Humane Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers,
or becauſe they do not receive unwritten verities, and ſeek for extra-Scriptural
Supplements, or becauſe they do not ſubſcribe the Councils of Synods,
the Articles and Canons of Churches, or becauſe they do not conform to
rational eſtabliſhments, and comply with the commandments of men, or becauſe
they do not read over the Books of the Ancients, and turn the leaves of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Treatiſes upon particular ſubjects, or becauſe they are not of the ſame
judgement with the Learned, and of the like practice with the godly men, ſo
reputed of theſe times, or becauſe they are not well verſed in Church Hiſtory,
and deeply ſeen in the Monuments of Antiquity, or becauſe they have not been
bred up to be Maſters of Arts, and Doctors of Sciences, in Philoſophical Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and in Univerſity Schools; but,<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 22. 29. Mar. 12. 24—27.</note> becauſe they know neither the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
which do reveal the Truth, nor the Power of God which doth exert
the Truth in created Natures, through which his Wiſdom, and other of his
Excellencies and Perfections are ſo viſible, whoſe Word is ingraven on his Works,
and whoſe Works are written in his Word; therefore it is, that they do err,
greatly err: divers of theſe may be more largely demonſtrated in ſome after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
of this Treatiſe.<note place="margin">Dan. 10. 21.</note> In<hi rend="sup">k</hi> theſe Scriptures of Truth, Arts have an uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and harmony, and Sciences have a conſent and concord: all is here delivered
in apt expreſſions, ſuited to the nature of things, adapting them to their proper
ends, and good purpoſes: here is a lively repreſentation of verities, and of
realities, the right knowledge of which doth carry into the very beingneſs of
created Eſſences, drawing forth their hidden Virtues into active operativeneſs.
What through the artificial cunning of ſophiſtical deceivers, and the ignorant
ſimplicity of the credulous vulgar, the beſt Learning is much undervalued, and
its faſteſt Friends are almoſt wholly forgotten: he, that makes man his Idol,
and is eaſie of belief when man ſpeaketh, will ſo long, be neither maſter of
Reaſon, nor an exerciſer of Faith, neither will he be well ſettled in judgement,
nor quieted in ſpirit, whilſt he thus goes away from experimental Truth in
God's Word, to ſuch doubtful matters in mens writings. The wholy Scriptures
are a growing Treaſury of fruitful knowledge, and would ſtill be bringing forth
ſomewhat more; whereas he, that takes all upon truſt from humane Authors,
and Philoſophical Tractates, will captive his own judgement, and fetter his
own underſtanding, and leave his own ſoul unfruitful and unprofited, who
might have found the Scriptures to have diſcloſed before him, the properties
and powers of created Beings, in order to ſome great uſefulneſs in the life of
man. In a Scripture-way, the ſerious reſearcher may ſafely and ſurely walk, and
unerringly (if he follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit, according to this
ſtraight rule) travel into the Myſteries of Grace, and the Secrets of Nature; if
we follow any others in another path, they are ſuperficial, not profound, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their inquiries or diſcoveries. Practical Chriſtianity, and experimental
Religion is the higheſt Science, and the nobleſt Art, and the moſt honourable
Profeſſion, which gives light to all inferiour knowledges, and would admit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Royaleſt Society, and draw neareſt in reſemblance and conformity, to the
glorified Fellowſhip in the Heavenly College above, where their knowledge is
perfected in viſional intuitive light. Here is the prime Truth, the original
Verity, as to the manifeſtativeneſs of it in legible viſible ingravings, which
would carry progreſſively into other Learning contained therein: all here is
reducible to practice and uſe, to life and converſation; here exiſtences and
realilties are contemplated and proved, not mere <hi>Ideas</hi> and conceits ſpeculated as
elſewhere. The ultimate and beſt end of Learning, is to furniſh a renewed
Underſtanding, and to advance ſanctified Reaſon, and to raiſe diſcerning Grace,
for the promoting of the Honour of the LORD, and the holineſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Souls: This is its laſt and higheſt pitch, the perfection of its diſcovery,
which its nature can reach to heat on Earth: no way but that which is Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural
can direct aright unto the ſpeedieſt attainment of ſound and well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
Learning, although thoſe who are the ſelf-conceited Gnoſticks of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55870:11"/>
times are under a great temptation of being ſome of the ſubtilleſt Opponents of
this Chriſtian Poſition. Come hither therefore thou Inquiſitor of Truth!
thou mayſt find it in the Word; thou needeſt not turn over the many volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
Books, and hiſtorical Records of men, to deſire what the Knowledges and
the Arts are, or who were the firſt Authors and Inventers of them: 'Tis not
all their Writings that can make thee wiſe to Salvation, as<note n="l" place="margin">3 Tim. 3. 15.</note> the Scriptures can.
How filled with doubtful uncertainties are the Ancient Records of Humane
Writers, how many corrupt mixtures are there in them, how ſtuffed with
groſs flatteries, or with perſonal reflections, are modern reports; how corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding
to private intereſts, how wreſted and wryed to paſſion and to party?
What a ſuperfoetation is there of new Treatiſes yearly coming forth, either to
cenſure the errours, or to fill up the defect of other Authors, or to pretend to
ſome rare diſcovery, or new invention, or to boaſt of an exacter method?
though ſtill at beſt, imperfection is their nature, and there is an yet further, and
a more onward. It is no imbaſing or diſtaining unto the holy Scriptures, to
fetch and to derive all uſeful Learning from theſe ſacred Fountains; rather doth
this make much the more for their honour and commendation, that there is
ſuch a fulneſs of Arts and perfection of Sciences in this one Book. The
bringing and wreſting of Scripture to mens Arts and Rules, to wrie and to
force it into a compliance with them, and not examining of all Arts and Rules
by the Scripture, to meaſure and to judge of them by this, has introduced
much errour, and ſhut out much Truth, to the ſullying of Religion, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
of Reaſon, the poyſoning of the Mind, and the polluting of the Life.
Here in this word Studies would be carried on in Faith, and in obedience, which
would greaten the expectation of aſſiſtance, and of acceptance of income, and
a bleſſing, in all indagations after the mind of Chriſt: when Scriptural illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
do ſhiningly caſt their beams on a ſpiritual diſcerner, they do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly,
but withal ſtrongly, influence and operate, by a transforming efficacy
unto a more glorious reſemblance of the Heavenly Image of an holy Chriſt,
and of his holy Word: This way the underſtanding of a Believer doth paſs
into more ſpiritualizedneſs, and doth more freely converſe with its inner
Teacher, under theſe intellectual rays. Students in Scripturaliſm would get
further into the choicer Myſteries of experimental Chriſtianity, even whilſt
they here ſee Liberal Arts in their proper axioms made uſefully Mechanical in
their elicited operations: If every one be to be credited in his own Art, they
muſt then learn this Art in the Scriptures, and then alſo ſhould Chriſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in his Word, who is the<note n="m" place="margin">Jude 25. John 3. 3.</note> only Wiſe One, a Teacher by Office from
the Fathers Donation, and by the Holy Spirits Unction. This gives a great
advantage to plain Believers; for, although they know not well how to
evade Philoſophical Juglings, or to confute Sophiſtical Fallacies, and cunning
cheats, of over-reaching Argumentation, and inſnaring ſyllogizing, yet
through this help, and its ſecret ſuggeſtings, they have ſo much perception,
as to diſcern things to be otherwiſe than colours and ſhews of carnal reaſonings
do make them ſeem to be; ſo that, when they have not their anſwers ready,
yet they will not ſuffer their Judgements to be miſinformed by ſuch impudent
bafflings; and if theſe vain affecters of Humane Wiſdom be once taken off
from their froward way of wrangling diſputations, to reaſon the caſe familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Queſtions and Anſwers, ſuch as are proper and pertinent to the matter
under debate, and by a collating of the whole Scripture, that doth ſpeak of
ſuch a particular ſubject inquired about, that ſort of men would bewray them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be ſome of the moſt ignorant and ſottiſh, eſpecially in the choiceſt
Science of experienced Religion, and in the beſt art of practical Chriſtianity.

little coſt in a ſhort while: This would make skilful Practitioners in ordinary
Affairs, and in the common Matters and Actions of Life, which Philoſophers
do miſcount to be beneath ſouly rationaliſts. Students in Chriſtianity, when
throughly ſeaſoned with the in-working-knowledge of Holy Precepts, and of
practical Truths, are more awed into an obſervance of what is taught in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
Pew; they are inſtructed in Duties, and informed in Manners, whilſt
they inquire into Arts, and purſue Sciences. Where the ſavingneſs of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is ſuck'd in betimes, all growing diſcoveries, if they work kindly, are
improved towards the firm ſecuring of a never-ending-felicity: Faith, and

incidence, but in the Glaſs of God's Word, and he is not as yet in a prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to take in other Learning, who has not hitherto attained to the true

            <p>A growing Artfulneſs in Scripture-Science will commend it ſelf where it is
in any, though the commender of this unto ſuch court not their applauſe, but
ſeek their profit: though I be forgotten who write this, yet Chriſt and his
Word will ſtill have a living name in ſuch for all Treaſures of Learning, there
being here full inſtruction for all neceſſary Employments, and complete
Subſidaries for all practical Converſation. Let not the judicious ingenuous
Reader expect from me a Syſtem of Sciences, or Platform of Arts, with their
proper Rules and Methods: To handle theſe throughly in an exact tractate, is too
great and long a task for my little parts and ſhort day; it were an undertaking
worthy of ſome Chriſtian King to imploy the learnedeſt and holieſt of mankind
about, that either love or promotion could procure, or kindneſs, or reward
ingage, or helps and materials incourage; though in ſome few inſtances I may
a little lead others the way, with a Scripture Light in my hand. I owed a great
duty to the intellectual World of precious Souls, and I had no other way to
make ſuch a publick payment of it: the good of Communion muſt out balance
any private concern of my own: he that would conſult his own reputation and
quiet amongſt men in this age, would have concealed his apprehenſions in ſuch a

day, when many are ſo ſelf-ſeeking, and ſo angrily confident by ſtrengthned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceptions,
and fortified prejudices, and radicated reſolves, againſt any diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that might convince and ſhake them: What is done is ſubjected to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-examination
by ſpiritual diſcerners. When received Opinions have got
the Peoples Applauſe, and Leaders Authority, and Men's intereſt in this World,
he had need bring ſome clearneſs of demonſtration, who would have others to
leave their former ways, to which they have been ſo uſed, that they may come
into a Scripture-path. It would be next to incredible in a mans ſelf, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
belief in others, who are ſo far gone in prejudice and prepoſſeſſion, were
there not a Propheſie and Promiſe, that in the later days<note n="b" place="margin">Eſai. 29. 18—24.</note>, they, who err in

I arrogate nothing to my ſelf of being a firſt Inventer of Arts, but do
refer wholly unto that word, which would illuſtrate and brighten, adorn and

were little Chrildren, and a traditionary credulity would ſtill keep alive the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of them till old age, and ſo would tranſmit the frame of them to poſterity.
Had I not <hi>Jehovah</hi> and his Word on my ſide, there were little expectation of
any conſiderable ſucceſs in ingaging this Scholaſtick War, where ſo many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
are all up in arms againſt me, and are ſo confident of Victory: were
it not for this, the controverſie would ſtare me in the face with ſo many fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
difficulties, that my time about this (that little of it, which I can be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of, to redeem it from the unavoidable intercurrences of other neceſſary work)
would ſcam to be miſ-ſpent, and my induſtry miſ-employed, and the powers
and ſtrength of my mind waſted; I had elſe ſoon been diſ-ſpirited, whilſt the
chief ſcope of ſo many men's aims, ſtudies and indeavours, is either to defend
or execute other mens miſtakes, or to juſtifie and commend their own: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
if hereby the reputation of the Scriptures may revive after my death, and
if the juſt eſteem, and the good opinion of God's Word may be built up,
though on the ruines of my credit for the preſent; I bleſs that <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who
has uſed me to truſt him with hereafters, wherein one of the greateſt trials of
our ſpirit and frame is: and if this only means of improving ſo fertil a ground
of knowledges be diſlik'd, and rejected by this Generation, the ſpringing Race
in after-times will rejoyce when they ſhall reap and gather in, uſe and injoy the
good fruit of theſe honeſt labours. Wordly advancement, and a flattered
name, is the conſulted project, and the fore-caſted contrivement of a low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed
mind, unbecoming that princely ſpirit in a Believer, which has nobler
deſigns, and higher aims. If this tractate be not exact, yet the ſubject matter
is excelling: the Scripture-cauſe of word-learning is ſuch, that he who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth
againſt it, doth quarrel with the Author of it, who wil have a time
to<note n="d" place="margin">Jerem. 44. 28.</note> make ſuch to know whoſe word ſhall ſtand, whether this of him, or that
of them? when it will be manifeſt in the hearts of ſuch, that this deſign is
not the product of a diſcontented mind, or of humourſome cenſorioſneſs, or of
a grave affection, or of a ſplenetick windineſs. Vulgar Prizers are no juſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luers;
for, Scripture-Truth, though all be ſold for it, is never<note n="e" place="margin">Prov. 23. 23. Matt. 13. 44, 45, 46—52.</note> bought too dear,
and though all the World could be had for it, yet would be ſold too cheap; it
is well worth thy dealing for, whatever it coſt thee. Scripture-Learning has
an operative influence to correct and rectifie, to change and renew, to reform
and refine, hearts and lives, to affect the Soul with a due ſenſe of its own
noble excellencies, and widened capacities, that it may be holy and happy, wiſe
and prudent for ever, to make the conſcience feel the weight of preſent Duty,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55870:13"/>
and of future felicity, with the kindlieſt tyes and ſtrongeſt obligations. O how
excellent are the Virtues, how efficacious the Powers, that do flow from hence!
The Patrons of this Book are Chriſt and his Word, Truth and Good, Reaſon and
Religion, Scripture and Nature. Spreading untruths have gotten a name of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and Reputation, and popular Opinion has kept up their credit, and ſtill it
doth them reverence: but they are all falling before the Scriptures of Truth;
for, rather than fail, the Chriſtian verities, and the rare knowledges contained in
them, ſhall be yet further confirmed by ſuch Miracles, as are beyond the
Powers of Nature, and the Arts of Man. The ſeeming impoſſibility of all
profitable Learning in one Book, will in time be removed out of the way, and
off from the thoughts by a ſound belief of the infinite wiſdom of the Author of
it. The true uniform voice of holy Scripture, and of created Nature, is with
me and for me, though the common votes of the miſtaking world cry me
down; although ſuch ill habits have been acquired through the power and
energie, and effaſcination of Philoſophy, as no ability or skill of man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,
yet Almightineſs and All-wiſdom can work Students off from it. If I
publiſh my own imperfections, and proclaim my own ignorances, and bewray
my own follies; yet let not the Reader forget, that I am a pleader for the moſt
righteous cauſe in the judgement of the beſt Law, the evidence is clear for
it, and the ſentence of approbation is already pronounced, that the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
of Truth are the beſt, the perfect Platform of all uſeful Scientificks:
Chriſt is the Head-Captain of created Hoſts, and he will triumphingly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
his Truth is ſtrong, and it ſhall prevailingly overcome. Scripture-knowledge,
eſpecially in the ſavingneſs of its Science, and in the Sanctifying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of its Art, doth ſpeak enough for it ſelf within the breaſt of every ſpiritual
diſcerner, as having an incomparable<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 4. 6. Philip. 3. 8.</note> excellency in it, above and beyond all
other Skills and Wiſdoms in the World: I need not urge many arguments to
convince thoſe Readers of this great uſeful Truth, who have felt the living
power of it upon their renewed hearts, for, when it came there, it brought in
its own ſelf evidence, and left a ſenſible demonſtration, and wrote a ſealed
Teſtimonial under its own hand, there. I have (though this alſo much in my
aim to praiſe it more unto ſuch, and to preſs them to make ſome higher ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
in this beſt Learning, as being a nearer approach unto intuitive perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in viſional Glory, and that which raiſeth the ſpiritual Reaſon, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
Faith of the Saints here below in this Intellectual World, into a
reſemblance of Angelical Wiſdom, yet, I ſay I have) ſomewhat further in my
preſent deſign, which is to win upon thoſe who are under impetuous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
and violent aſſaults, to be Atheiſts and Infidels, both ſpeculative and
practical, by a prevailing inſinuating of this aſtertion, if the LORD will ſay
ſo too, that word-Science, and Scripture-Art, is the Science of Sciences, and the
Art of Arts, every way moſt and beſt correſponding to the capacities, ſuited to
the caſes, fitted to the neceſſities, and promoting the felicities, of rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
ſo that, this diſcovery has its great uſefulneſs to all, even the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the moſt holy: as for others, who may be far gon in this ſpiritual
diſtemper of ſcorning of, and of ſcoffing at, the aſſerted ſufficiencie and fulneſs
of the Scriptures, that which they ſo much ſlight, and ſo ſtorm againſt, muſt be
the means of their cure, unleſs they be ſuch, as will neither hear their diſeaſe,
nor endure a remedy, but are obſtinate to all healing preſcriptions. I take the
cauſes of Atheiſm amongſt many others to be, as an afraidneſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingneſs,
and of the condemningneſs, of the holy Precepts and righteous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
declared in the Scriptures, and an unbelief of its glorious rewards, ſo
alſo this in particular, ignorance of the excellency of Scripture-knowledge:
and although thoſe, who do fall below Religion, will alſo ſink beneath Reaſon
too, yet I am not altogether without hope, but that, when <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi>
ſhall make his Word-light to ſhine forth more in its beautious glory, it will
allure the eyes, and draw the heart, inform the judgements, and incline the
wills of men of intellect, to ſee and to acknowledge, to adore and to admire,
that only wiſe God, who has put ſo much into ſo little, and has given us a
pocket-Book of ſuch abſolute fulneſs. The Antichriſtian party by their paper
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55870:14"/>
plots would blow up all belief of the ſufficiency and perfection of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
as hoping, that if they can once prevail, with a people to be of no
Religion, they will then be of their Religion, and the Anti-ſcripturarians have
but too many followers in this day, who if they be ſo bold as to aſſert this
imperfection of the Word, in the neceſſary matters of Salvation, no marvel if
they deny its conprehenſiveneſs, as to the other knowable things. Ariſe
<hi>Jehovah,</hi> plead thou thine own plea, and magnifie thou above All thy Name,
thy Word! all the Kings of the Earth ſhall confeſs Thee <hi>Jehovah,</hi> when they
hear the words of thy mouth; and they ſhall ſing in the ways of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> for
great is the Glory of <hi>Jehovah:</hi> In Thee <hi>Aelohim</hi> thy Saints will praiſe thy
Word, and a ſecond, and a third time, they will praiſe thy Word, this they
know, that thou and thy word for them.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given thee, Reader, ſome accompt of the deſign of this Treatiſe,
which in ſhort is, to hold forth all Sciences and profitable Arts in one Book of
<hi>Jehovah Aelohim,</hi> and to demonſtrate the Scripture-way to be the true, the right,
the excelling, the only way of perfecting the knowledge of lawful Arts and
Sciences, and of the Reſtauration, and advancement of real Learning, ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to vain, falſe and deceitful Philoſophy, to ſuch affected humane wiſdom
as would make prey of precious Souls, and as being contrary to Scripture-verity,
to word-Theologie, to revealed Chriſtianity, and to created Nature, and
ſo not after Chriſt. If thou be one of a plain underſtanding, and if thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
be only of the Engliſh complexion, ſo that thou canſt skill only in
thy own Mother-tongue, let my beſeeching of thee be prevalent with thee, not
to be offended at it, that ſo many words of other Tongues are uſed in this
Treatiſe, eſpecially in the former part of it: I am not my ſelf fond of it as to
be ſo greatly pleaſed with it, but where I am ſome way even neceſſitated to it,
to expreſs my ſelf in ſome Scholaſtick Terms, Phraſes and Language, chiefly
when I open them according to the Original ſignificancy of Scriptural expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
for the conviction, and confutation of Philoſophical Errours, and for the
confirmation and commendation of Scripture-Truths. I have put the Scriptures
referred unto, moſtly in the Margin, not without ſome reaſons which have been
privatly ſatisfactory to me; yet withal I deſire the ſerious conſiderate looker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
of theſe lines, to examine the Words of Chriſt as he goes along, leſt otherwiſe
he raſhly cenſure, and over haſtily condemn ſome paſſages, which he will miſtake
to be only my own, when it may be upon a more through examination, they
will be found to be Scripture-ſenſe, and ſignificancy: and ſo I put thee over unto

the help of a Nurſing-mother: The All-knowledge, All-wiſe one increaſed in
Knowlede, and in Wiſdom: The Every-where-preſent one was included in his
Mothers Womb: He, that filled Heaven and Earth had not where to lay his
head; He, that is tranſcending the moſt general of all kinds, and of <hi>genus's,</hi> is
made a corporal individual, the loweſt of all ſubſtances: He, who made others
rich, was himſelf poor: The Righteous one did juſtly bear both the fault
and puniſhment of the unjuſt: Here the LORD is made a ſervant, and the
ſervant is a LORD: here the Mother is the Daughter of her own Son, and the
Son is Father of his own Father: Here is the All-ſufficient ſupplyer is himſelf
ready: Here, contrary to the Ethnick Phyſical Science, what was finite is made
capable of what is infinite, and what was infinite is circumſcribed within narrow
limits: Here a Virgin conceives without Man: Here the body is born in one
place, and is taken to him who is in many places, in all places at once: Here

than as they ſpeak and write according unto this, and wherein they ar ſound,
they have borrowed and fetched from this; here they lighted their Candle, and
from hence they have digged their treaſure. It is the ſpecial deſign, and the

can reckon up, may eaſily and quickly foreſee, even by ſuch an enumeration,
as this is, that ſuch an univerſal comprehenſive of all Liberal Sciences, afterwards
diſtinctly parcelled out into the ſeveral knowledges profeſſed and practiſed,
would both take up too much of his time, and over-bulk any one Treatiſe, and
is much beyond the skill and the ſtrength of any one mere man: One of our
own has lately aſſerted a deficiency in the Scriptures, as to theſe matters, and doth
ſend us elſewhere, for a Supplement, mentioning ſeveral Arts and Sciences, as
no where to be found in Scripture: I ſhall ſingle out two of them, which are
of his own chuſing and naming, and then try them according to the Word,
whether much of their Art be not to be found out in the Scripture with a
little ſearch, which, when compared with, and experimented by, the natural
efficiency of their innate and educed Exiſtencies and Workings, would bring in
an augment to their Science, thought it be not my intendment, or undertaking
to draw up Syſtems and Schemes of the ſeveral particular knowledges, but to
quicken up the ſtudious and ingenious to promote theſe Scientificks more by
putting that together, which the Scriptures do afford, relating to each of them,
and then to work upon their diſcovery, by practical improvement, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
obſervation: This Learned man declared his judgement to be, that
the Scripture is no perfect Rule for a Muſician, a Carpenter, a Phyſician, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician,
an Aſtronomer, a Geographer, an Arithmetician, a Grammarian,
a Logician, a Natural Philoſopher, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to do their Work, Becauſe, ſaith he, it
is not a particular Rule for them in Arts and Sciences, the things whereof are
not to be found in the Scripture at all: neither doth he aſſert the Scriptures an
imperfect Rule, only for theſe and ſuch like as theſe, but alſo for Divines, and
for Worſhippers; as if the Scripture did not tell the Divine ſufficiently, and
particularly divers things relating to his office, and the diſcharge of it; and as if
the worſhipper were not to expect there particular Laws or Rules, for all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of worſhip: Thus, and to this purpoſe he.</p>
            <p>If it be not a perfect particular Rule for theſe two laſt mentioned, the Divine,
and the Worſhipper; for what Artiſts and Scientiaries is it a perfect particular
Rule? For, theſe affirmations do charge the Scripture with being an imperfect
Rule (as to particular Laws and Rules) not only as to Natural Things, but
alſo as to Spiritual; it ſhould be conſidered by ſuch, who are of this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
whether they do not hereby lift up Church-Hiſtory, and Humane Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
in the matters of Faith, to the debaſing and denying of Scriputre-perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and alſo corrupt modes and forms of Worſhip, ſuch as are of Humane
Invention, Inſtitution and Impoſition, excluſive of other ways of Worſhip,
where theſe are not aſſerted and conſented to, both which the whole Scripture
doth condemn? At this preſent, it being ſuited to the ſubject I have in hand,
about the advancement of uſeful Arts and Sciences, by making a more through
diſquiſition after them in the Word of Truth, I ſhall cull out two of theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
who my ſelf am of neither of their Arts, nor do I pretend to have Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificies
in them; which may ſo far prove and praiſe this deſign the more, that
one, whoſe Calling and Function, whoſe Office and Profeſſion is not to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Muſician or Carpenter, yet in the ſupply of the holy Spirit, by a little
ſhort ſtudy of the Scriptures, in the midſt of a multitude of other employments,
can diſcover ſo much in Chriſt's Word about Muſick and Carpentry: wherem I
am to ſhew, that theſe are found in the Scripture, both as to name and thing;
and that there is a Rule in the Scripture for theſe things; and that God hath
made the Scripture to be a Rule for them; and that, in the Scripture there are
not only general Rules, but alſo particular Rules of thoſe Arts and Sciences;
which done, I ſhall propound ſome inquiries about Geography and Grammar.

which would raiſe their Ear-taking, and their Heart-affecting-knowledge
in this to more Sweetneſs and Savourineſs, more Exactneſs and Spiritualneſs,
more Naturalneſs and Scripturalneſs, as relating to inſtituted Pſalms and Hymns,
and Spiritual Songs, which are heavenly parts of Spiritual Worſhip, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
with reſpect to the voice: not at all to countenance the common abuſe of
this Art, when it is ſuited to carnal, luſtful hearts, in amorous wanton ditties, or
to other profane corrupt ends whatſoever, which has been in woful, ſinful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
a ruining inchantment to many a precious Soul, and a prodigal waſting
of that time, which ſhould be redeemed: but, ſomewhat to revive the Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of hymnifying, now in theſe times, of the approach of the later-day glory,
and to raiſe Spiritual Singing to its due Purity, whereby that Ordinance may be
reſtored and made edifying, which has been for ſeveral years, either too coldly,
and formally, and carnally performed, or elſe too much omitted and neglected,
what through miſtakes in ſome mens judgements, and through fears in other
mens hearts, who have laid aſide this duty, in times of perſecution, leſt their

my deſign and aim in what I expreſs about this be well remembred, that none
may prevert to any ill uſe, what I am about to write (for, it is too commonly a
corrupt practice by two ſorts of Extremiſts, where cautionary bounds are ſet to

cautionary bounds too large, and ſo will not go ſo far as to come unto what is
lawful, and a duty; the other by a profane licenciouſneſs condemns them as too

if alſo all the Hebrews Phraſes were skilfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,

augment to this Science, and be a great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this knowledge: I have not done with this
as yet, though it may be the Reader here was under
ſome apprehenſion, that I was now cloſing up of this diſcourſe on this ſubject;
it is a practical-Rhetorick-trope in the Muſick Art, to ſlide ſoftly, and to fall
gently from the cloſe or cadence (to ſpeak in their own Phraſe and Dialect)
when it ſeemed even to touch it; it is ſuch a ſweet beguiling of the hearers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
that it renews a raiſed affection, and revives a liſtning-ear, to what
may be further ſung or ſaid, played or ſtruck; this little quavering upon a ſtop,
may give ſome delight to the Muſical Reader. For the promoting of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious
acouſtick-Art, let me therefore refer to ſome Scriptures about Muſicians
and Muſical Singers, about the pleaſant Voice, and ſinging Notes, and concerning
Pſalms, and Songs, and Hymns, for matter and for verſe, as relating to inſtituted
Worſhip, both under the Old and the New Teſtament miniſtrations of Grace.

trained up both to vocal and to inſtrumental Muſick, who by exerciſe were to

whatever they do, it ſhall proſper. As for Timber-pins, it inſtructs the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
to make them of ſtrong firm word, not of that which is weak and yielding,
as the wood of a Vine is; a diſcreet Carpenter will not take of the wood thereof

thereon, a wooden-nail, or peg of it is not fitted for the uſe of hanging up
houſhold-ſtuff, or working-tools, or any heavy matter upon it; by which

which ſome inraged Conquerors have exerciſed their ſubdued Captives with: it
is an Inſtrument meerly paſſive, which doth act no further than it is acted,
having all its force, and receiving all its efficacy from that Agent, or from theſe
Agents, that do move it to and fro, up and down, backward and forward, in
cutting; and therefore the Saw cannot magnifie it ſelf againſt the Agitator, the
Mover of it; it was then a wicked thing in that proud King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> to exalt
himſelf, when the LORD uſed him as a Saw in his hand for the humbling and
ſubduing, the correcting and chaſtiſing, of a ſinful hypocritical people; he
aſcribed his great Victories which he obtained, not unto <hi>Jehovah</hi> as the Author

Who inſtructed the Surgeon how to cure wounds, but the wild Goat by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
ſome Sanative Graſſes, and Herbs, and Flowers, which led him to the
uſe of ſome things in Chirurgery? Hence alſo have ſome been taught the cure
of Impoſtumes, ſuch as are between the skin and the fleſh; for, when there is a
putrified matter which impoſtumiſeth, before it ripen of it ſelf, and come to
break, the wild Goat oppreſſed with the noxious pungency of the itching hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
rubs himſelf againſt Stones and Shrubs, until his Impoſthume break, and
the whole filth from the bag do pour out it ſelf, and ſo the beaſt eaſeth himſelf:
Whence learn'd the Chyrurgeon, the profirable uſe of the Herb Dittany, for the
extracting of Arrows or Splinters, or whatſoever it is that gives a wound, and
leaveth ſome poyſon behind, if the hurt be not mortal; but when Harts, who,
when they were ſtruck with a Dart, or were otherways ſhot with an invenomed
Arrow, preſently reſorted to this Herb, which has a ſpecifick Virtue latent in
it, whereby this Plant, when eaten by them, both ejects the Weapon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
the Poyſon? The cure of wounds with Dragon, Briony, and Comfrey,
ſome have learn'd from the Serpent; as alſo the curing of Eyes, when evil
affected, with Fennel; Cats have found Valerian to comfort the ſight; and
Swallows uſe Celendine, as an Herb friendly to the ſight, with which they heal
the eyes of the young. Phlebotomy, the cutting of a Vein to let out blood,
and the ſtopping of it again, ſome were informed in by the Sea-horſe, which
is skilful at Scarification, and at cutting of a Vein; for, when he feels himſelf
under a great and dangerous diſtemper, by overmuch eating, he rubs himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Reeds, or ſomewhat elſe that is hard, until a Vein breaking, he let out a
ſufficient quantity of his blood, and then he haſtneth to ſtop the aperture, and
to heal and cloſe it up by applying of mud and of dirt to the orifice of the
wound. The Art of Building was ſomewhat taught by the induſtry and skill
of Swallows, and of Bees: ſome Phyſicians were inſtructed in forming of Pills
from Scarabes, that do gather things round on an heap, and then make Balls:
The Art of Spinning ſome have learned from Silk-worms, of Weaving from

Learning are greatly dangerous unto Profeſſors of Chriſtian Religion; the

ſo that, if we could ſearch after the Foundations and Principles, from
whence moſt miſtakes about Religion have their Spring and Origin, we may find
them laid in Humane wiſdom, by its vain Affecters; ſuch as, the pretended power
of Nature, and freedom of will, in fallen man, as to Spirituals and Eternal; the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
Dictates and Placits of the Underſtanding, as the ultimate undenyable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvers
in all Caſes, with a great number of ſuch like: Some whole Societies of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Profeſſors are but Philoſophick Sects received and called by another name;
as, thoſe that make the inſtincts of their own Souls, the impulſes of their own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and the motions and imaginations of their own hearts, to be their only Rule,
by which they meaſure their judgement concerning good and evil; and the
fixed conſtancy of their belief, or the wavering doubtfulneſs of their perſwaſions,
to be the meaſure of duty, or of ſin: whence ſprang this but from that ſort of
Philoſophers, who placed their happineſs in ſilencing of all diſputes of the mind,
and in ſmothering of all ſcruples of Conſcience, affirming Good not to have
any inherent chuſeable Being in it ſelf, and Evil not to have any ſuch conſtant
fixed Malignity in its own Nature; but all their actions they thought to be
condemnable, when they did ſomewhat, which they had any inward relunctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
againſt, and averſneſs from; and to be commendable when they were clearly
reſolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fully determined in their minds and wills, to do this or that:
But no more at preſent of this. It is Scripture-Learning only, which through
the teachings of the holy Spirit can inſtruct us in the right uſe, and holy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of the knowledge of Natural Things, ſo that, the growing Believer
is Holy and Spiritual, even in his trading with thoſe Talents; and whilſt he is
exerciſed about theſe, his Scripture-wiſdom doth commend it ſelf in its own
excellency, and in its preferableneſs above and beyond all meer Humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
for the many good and choice fruits and effects thereof, being

Fruits, not contentious (or void of wrangling diſception) and not hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
(or void of ſimulation). Whereas, ſome have made the obſervation, that
theſe, who are ſo deeply converſant in the ſecrets of Nature, do generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
into Atheiſts, not acknowledging an <hi>Aelohim,</hi> as the firſt Cauſer, but
aſcribing all beings and productions to natural cauſalities: this, where it is
found to be ſo, is to be underſtood only of the Ethnick Philoſophy, which doth
take thoſe who are Students in it off, and doth carry them away, from Chriſt and
from his Word; not of that Scripture-wiſdom, which doth ſo directly lead
Diſciples to Chriſt, and to his Word: for, this ſaving ſound knowledge doth
produce a quite contrary effect, even to make them moſt Saints, and moſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
paſſing them wholly out of ſelf, and off from Creatures, to reſolve all
into, and to refer all unto, the Being of beings, the Cauſe of cauſes, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
firſt Eſſence, the chiefeſt, choiceſt Good, the trueſt, beſt Happineſs, the main
ultimate End, <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> bleſſed for ever. When men of Faith, and of
Experience, do wiſely obſerve the whole frame of this created World, and all
the parts thereof to run their courſe with continued chearfulneſs, and without
weariſome tiredneſs, to diſcharge thoſe Offices which their Creators Will hath
aſſigned and enjoyned them unto: This conſideration doth ſtir up in them high
and honourable thoughts of the Maker and Diſpoſer of all theſe things; and the
ſerious Meditation, that the Creation ſhall be renewed and refined, and reſtored
to its integrity, and perfection of Eſtate, and appear yet once again in its pure
cleanneſs, and in its purged <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the more in growing meaſures of glorious Holineſs. O what a day will that be,
when the New Heavens, and the New Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs,
ſhall be created, for Chriſt's followers to ſee, and to enjoy him in? when the
choſen among mankind ſhall be fully perfect in Viſion and in Knowledge, in
Grace, and in Glory, in Holineſs, and in Happineſs. By this diſcovery I would
remove that occaſion of ſtumbling, which ſome do lay as a ſtone of offence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

proficiency of Learning, as if this would degenerate Chriſtians into Pagans, and
Believers into Naturaliſts, and ſend them from Chriſt to Creatures, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing
of the true, pure Religion; whereas, it would call off men from ignorant
Paganiſm, to a knowing Chriſtianity, and advance all profitable Learning into

Many a choice diſcovery about ſeveral of the Works of Creation, have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to ſome Spiritual Diſcerners in their private Studies, under an impriſoned
ſtate, by the holy Spirit from Chriſt's true Word, before they ever made ſearch
after them, by the uſe of their outer Senſes, into the nature of thoſe Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
before they had any ocular Demonſtration of them, or made any viſible
Obſervations upon them; which afterwards by comparing of theſe Creatures
with thoſe Scriptures, they have found in experience exactly to agree; ſo as no

Of what Nature ſoever thoſe things are, which God hath revealed in his
Word unto reaſonable Creatures, the ſame are they bound to believe them to be,
as he has there made them known unto ſuch: For, they are thereby become a
part of the complete Object of Faith: ſo that, we are not only to believe the
Declarations of the Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion, in thoſe great Myſteries
of Three in One, of God manifeſted in the Fleſh, with ſuch like, and alſo the
Propheſies to come in after-ages, with a great deal more concerning Duties,
Graces, Priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo, that grand Hiſtory of matters of Fact paſt and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55870:30"/>
gone, ſuch as the written Journal of Created Beings, in the beginning of the
Bible, and all the after-diſcourſes of Natural Things, as they are contained in
the Scriptures of Truth. Created Nature is the copyed Tranſcript of Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.
What a bold daring attempt then is it for vain man to be ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of the words of his Creator, concerning the great Works which he has
done, and the Beings which he has formed, as not to admit of the plain ſenſe of
thoſe Scripture-words and expreſſions, the original Letter, and the proper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy
whereof he will not deny or contradict? For, there is great verity
in, and real anſwerableneſs between theſe words and thoſe things. The literal
ſenſe of the Word of Chriſt, where it ſpeaks poſitively of the Works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of Natural things, is not to be gone off from: if an Allegorical or My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
ſenſe be any where, as to this pleaded for, it muſt be proved, that there
is an evident neceſſity thereof in the ſame place, either by the words and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of themſelves, or by the Context, or elſe by comparing of it with other
Scriptures: where it can be evidenced by ſuch expreſſions, ſignifications, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts,
or collations, that any paſſages in, or relating to, the Hiſtory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are ſymbolical, ſignifying ſome other Myſtery, yet even there, if that were
admitted, firſt of all muſt the ſenſe of the Letter ſimply, and the truth of the
Hiſtory in the plain meaning of the Narrative-Record be firmly eſtabliſhed.
Tranſlators ſhould keep cloſe to the proper meaning of the Original words;
otherwiſe they do expound the ſenſe (as they apprehend) in Syntax, and are
not regular Etymologiſts to explain the ſignificancy, and to maintain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of every word: Scripture-words are to be turned into other Languages,
not as men ſuppoſe they mean in trope, but as they naturally ſignifie in Truth:
The uſefulneſs of a literal verſion in order to the advancement of Learning is

miſtake in his expreſſions? would he, who is ſo abundant in Goodneſs, and

firſt revealed <hi>Idea</hi> of all things, manifeſt to rational Creatures. The real Natures
of Created Beings do directly anſwer to Scripture-ſpeakings concerning them:
the things<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 11. 3. Rom. 1. 19, 20, 21. Rev. 4. 11. &amp; 14. 7.</note> ſeen were things made, and the Maker of them would have his own
real perfections to be read in them. How unavoidable would the many dangerous
ill conſequences be, that will neceſſarily follow upon the contrary opinion? how
would all Foundations of credibility, and of veracity be ſhaken and over-turned?

There is a clear and a conſtant evidence and demonſtration of the ſenſes well
exerciſed, and rightly judging amongſt all reaſonable Creatures, all the inhabited
Earth over in all the Ages of the World, who have brought in one and the ſame
Teſtimony concerning the reality of things, as this word doth expreſs them to
be, which is a full proof. It is a Theological Truth of reſolving the probation,
by ſenſes into Scripture-expreſſions, and of rectifying all deceits and miſtakes of
the Senſes by the word-Rule. It was, and is the Scripture-way, to prove things
by Senſes, and to call upon Senſes to bring in their Verdict according to Scripture.
Thus were all the proceedings in <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s judicial Laws in all Caſes, wherein
any matter of fact is to be witneſſed, and accordingly any matter of right to be
determined, as Juſtice, Truth and Equity required.<note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 5. 14. 1 Cor. 12. 16, 17. Job 12. 11. 1 John 1. 1, 2. 3. Luke 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 39. John 20. 25, 27. Lev. 5. 1.</note> Inward and outward

Created Beings, as directly oppoſite to right-judging rational Senſes. Should
we reſort to humane reaſonings, and to carnal imaginations in theſe inquiries, we
could acquieſce here; for, theſe in ſeveral men at the ſame time, and ſometimes
in one and the ſame man, take him at ſeveral times, are varying one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and contrary to each other; and often they are but ſhews and colours,
not the real things themſelves; whereas, the Creator will have his Creatures to be

the Faith, and have miſled others alſo. It is a falſe aſſertion to affirm,
this or that is true in Philoſophy, though in Scripture it be found otherwiſe:
For, if Scripture-truth do contradict it, then, that, which is ſo contradicted, is
not a truth, but an error, (however, Philoſophy miſcal it true) introduced by
the Father of lies. Where any Philoſopher did aſſert any thing about the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

outward Obſervation, and experience from Senſes agreable to the Word: ſome
of them either had the knowledge of God's Word, and did read the firſt Books

in Philoſophick Univerſities would leave much of their Shelves empty, though
he who writes this is like to be judged and condemned for an Heretick in the
Commonwealth of Learning, and to have his Name and Reputation killed whilſt
he himſelf is alive, and buried before he himſelf be dead: But theſe muſt be let
go for the ſake, and in the cauſe of Chriſt, and of his Word, who will have a
day of Reſurrection of Names, as there will be at the laſt of bodies. One of
the moſt learned, and moſt experienced of natural Philoſophers in the preſent
age, who has been at great coſt and pains to make the moſt watchful Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
after all his curioſity in ſeeking and ſearching has conſented to the publiſhing
of a Treatiſe, to let the World of Vain Affecters of Humane Wiſdom, and of
Philoſophick Learning to know, that, after all his inquiries, and reſearches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hidden ſecrets of myſterious Nature, he can come at no certainty (eſpecially
about the Heavenly Bodies, and what doth belong to them, and generally about
what is at a great diſtance from our eye, or quite out of our ſight) Coſmical
ſuſpicions are found in the Title, and in the Pages; ſo that, his Philoſophy, as
to the moſt of the eminent Works of the Creation, particularly as to the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial
<hi>Phaenomena,</hi> and ſubterraneous hiddeneſſes, is, if not come to plain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

Word-knowledges will ere long be triumphing. All other Science is but

Faith; however, the deluded world have given it the name, yet it is devoid of
the Eſſence; it doth ſtart a many thorny and argute Queſtions, and it ingageth
in a multitude of frivolous concertations of Sophiſters, and of Philoſophaſters,
ſuch as School-Divinity, or Scholaſtick-Theology doth abound in, and is almoſt
quite through all over run with Dialectick Nicities, and Metaphorical Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
to raiſe duſt, and to make a miſt, that mens eyes can ſee but little of their

nor can make good ſuch a name. That is worth the name of Wiſdom, that is
Wiſdom to<note n="d" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 14, 15.</note> Salvation, that is the commendable Learning, that is ſanctified
Learning; and that is the praiſe-worthy experience, that is holy experience. It
is Scripture-Science, that is the great, the only<note n="e" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 13, 14.</note> depoſited Treaſury of all
Writings, that is to be kept for the confutation of all Opponents, who object
againſt the Truth. The reſt are but prophane Clamors about empty Vanities,
ſuch as are of a different kind and nature from the Analogie of Faith; frivolous
concertations of Sophiſts, Logical impertinencies, Metaphyſical puzlings, that do
not deſerve the Name, becauſe they have not the Reality of uſeful Knowledge;
where they have any thing of profitable Learning, as a few grains of good Corn
in a great heap of Chaff, there they Originally received it from the Word, and
from the LORD's people, who held forth their knowledge according to the
Word before others. Thus the Chaldeans, from the Hebrews, ſo alſo the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,
the Phenicians, the Grecians, though they all mingle it with their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Errors, Superſtitions and Idolatries. Never yet could the Diſciples of any
Unſcriptural, Antiſcriptural, of any Unchriſtian, Antichriſtian, Philoſopher meet
with ſuch a complete Model of the Created World, from any of their Maſters,
as might give them any through ſatisfaction thereabout, though according to
their ſeveral Sects they have been great Admirers of themſelves: There are of
them, who have pretended to more skill than thoſe, who went before them in the
Philoſophick Way, and have undertaken to be Correctors of other mens Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Writings, about a Syſtem of the World, and yet they have not believed
themſelves, that their own Hypotheſes were true and ſound; as particularly,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55870:32"/>
the vertiginous Aſſerters of the Diurnal Motion of the Earth. One great cauſe
of his E<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ring, who was the famous miſleader of others into this groſs miſtake,
was his ſlighting and rejecting of the Scriptures about theſe matters; as if it
were a ſubject altogether alien from VVord revelation. The ſeveral Earneſt
Contenders, both for the old and new Philoſophy of later years, after all their
new VVorlds, which they have ſet up and trumpeted before, as if all muſt bow
before their Syſtematical Calf, and worſhip their modular <hi>Moloc;</hi> yet, what
have they done after all their ſtudies and endeavours, but proclaim openly in
Print, that they are both of them out of the right way, the one and the other
wandring out of the path of Truth, and that they have taken up with ſuch
fallacious ſhews, as are diſcovered by Scripture-light to be apparent falſhoods?
And therefore the adapteſt, ſhorteſt, and every-way beſt, Method will be to lay
aſide all the reſt, and to take up things purely from the VVord of Chriſt. All
beſides this, are but the fanciful framings, and imaginary VVorlds of ſelf-pleaſing
Dreamers; though they applaud their own cunning in excepting againſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
as no fit Judges in theſe Caſes, yet I cannot commend their Conſcience
in ſuch a wrongful diſhonourable charge, as they hereby bring in againſt Chriſt,
and againſt his VVord. There are ſome parts of the Created VVorld, which
right Reaſon, and enlightned Nature cannot but acknowledge, that they muſt
be: As a place of reward for the Good, and of puniſhment for the Bad: And
yet becauſe they are not, to thoſe who are on this Earth, expoſed to their ſenſes,
they cannot be underſtood what and where they are, but only by VVord-reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
The great miſtakes of ſome, both Tranſlators of, and Commentators
upon, the VVord Hiſtory of the Creation, have been occaſioned moſtly from
hence, that they have followed Philoſophers and their VVritings more than
Chriſt and his Scriptures: which is the great error, and the blemiſhing ſpot in
thoſe expoſitions upon <hi>Job,</hi> which many otherwiſe ſingular Annotators have
completed and publiſhed. For almoſt throughout that whole Book, much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
doth treat of Created Beings, as the Heavens, the Luminaries there, the
Rain, the Dew, the Snow, the Hail, the Wind, the Earth, the Water, the Abyſs,
the Gulph, Hell, Light, Darkneſs, the four Quarters of the World, with many
others, and with many particulars about each of theſe, they do much Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize,
which I now write, not to revile the Name, or beſpatter the Memory of
the departed Authors; nor to undervalue the many choice Obſervations, and
profitable Collatings of Scripture every where almoſt to be found in ſeveral of
thoſe Treatiſes; but to warn the Reader, that when he comes to ſuch paſſages
about this kind of Learning, which I am now upon, he would not ſuffer himſelf
to be impoſed upon, by the Authority of thoſe skilful men, in practical Religion,
and experimental Chriſtianity, and Scripture knowledge. All Authorities, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
Experiments, Reſolutions, that we would have to be cogent and
convincing, muſt be ſoundly Scriptural. That which the ſeveral Philoſophers
with their ſeveral followers have vainly ſought for in their ſeveral Principles, is
to be found in Truth and Purity only in the Scriptures. Art thou for Magiſtral

of his infinite Wiſdom, and to a ſubmiſſion to his infallible Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
revealed therein; ſo that, ſuch either do deny, the profound Principles of
all profitable Learning to be here, and here only, or elſe do not ſearch (neither
would have others to ſearch) for them, to draw out uſeful Arts and Sciences
from this full Treaſury; it is then in ſuch of them, but the proud exalting of
carnal ſelf, and of corrupted Reaſon, which the jealous God will pour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon. But, if withal they will ſtudy their Natural Hiſtory, and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
Art, in the Scripture-Library, acknowledging the fulneſs, and the
perfection of this God-inſpired Book, for all uſeful Knowledge, as the Author
of it hath copied it out, and commented upon it in Created Nature, in the true
Eſſences of formed Beings, in the proper cauſalities, and genuine productions
according to their Primitive make; if they will meaſure the Laws of Nature by
the Laws of the Word, the Rules of Motion by the Rules of the Word, the
Light of Experience by the Light of the Word, that Hypotheſes of Phyſical
Principles, and the Axioms of Mechanical Models, by the Doctrines and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,
the Poſitions and Explications of the Word, ſo far as it hath a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
unto them, they might then be men of Name, and tranſmit the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of their Science to Poſterity; when the Light of Scripture, and the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Nature, and the Works of Art do uniformly frame, and operate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they do wonders. The Reader here is to take notice, that this Treatiſe
doth commend the Scripture for its containing of Arts and Sciences, of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and of Knowledges, ſo far as they are lawful and uſeful, needful and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary:
And therefore if any Objector would be ſhewing of his wittineſs in asking
of a great many Queſtions of Philoſophical Nicities, and of unrevealed Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
if I diſcern them to be impertinent to this ſubject, and unprofitable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they are alien from this inquiry, and do not belong to what I am ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after, who am perſwading of others to be more in the ſerious deep ſtudy of
what is<note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 29. 29.</note> revealed in the Holy Scriptures, and to put together all that which is
found in the Word, relating to any particular Science and Art, and ſo to improve
that,<note n="m" place="margin">Coloſſ. 2. 18.</note> not intruding into thoſe things, which they have not ſeen, vainly puft
up by their fleſhly mind. Could I prevail ſo far, that a due through Collection
were made by the judicious and induſtrious, of what is already in the Word,
about theſe wonders in Nature, it might then be afterwards further conſidered,
whether we may not well be without the reſt of that knowledge, which any
over-prying Queſtioniſt would ask about, wherewith to perplex others, and to
puzzle himſelf? It is not every<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 1. 21. &amp; 11. 25. &amp; 12. 16. &amp; 16. 19. 1 Cor. 3. 18.</note> profeſſing of ones ſelf to be wiſe, that makes him
to bring forth real, uſeful Wiſdom. It would be folly in us to be wiſe in our
own conceits: That is true Wiſdom, which is Wiſdom unto that which is good.
What will it be to ſeem wiſe, and not to be wiſe? The only Wiſe God who
guided the Holy Penmen of Scriptures in their writing about Natural, as well
as Spiritual Things, and about the Arts and Knowledges of thoſe things, did
teach them to underſtand what they did write about, and they have left more
of this Learning behind them in the Word, than is yet found out. There is an
honourable Virtuoſus, who has travelled far in Natures way, and has made
ſome of the deepeſt inquiries into Experimental, Corpuſcular, or Mechanical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
that in the requiſites of a good Hypotheſis amongſt others of them, doth
make this to be one of its conditions, that it fairly comport not only with all
other truths, but with all other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, as well as thoſe 'tis fram'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55870:33"/>
to explicate, and that, not only none of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature, which are
already taken notice of do contradict it at the preſent, but that, no <hi>Phaenomena</hi>
that may be hereafter diſcovered, ſhall do it for the future. Let it therefore
from hence be conſidered, whether ſeeing, that Hiſtory of Nature, which is but
of human indagation and compiling, is ſo incomplete and uncertain, and many
things may be diſcovered in after-times by induſtry, or in ſome other way by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
diſpenſing, which are not now ſo much as dreamed of, and which may
yet overthrow Doctrines ſpeciouſly enough accommodated to the Obſervations,
that have been hitherto made (as is by himſelf fore-ſeen and acknowledged)
whether now, the only prevention and remedy in this caſe (which is otherwiſe
ſo full of juſt fears, of real doubts, of endleſs diſſatisfaction, and of perplexing
difficulties) be not, to bring all ſorts of neceſſary knowledges to the Pan-ſophie,
the Alneſs of Wiſdom, in the Scriptures of Truth, where none of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Scriptures have any ground to ſet their foot on, in regard that Word-Revelations
about Natures Secrets, are the unerring products of infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and of univerſal fore ſeeingneſs, which are always uniform and the ſame,
in their well-eſtabliſhed order, and ſtated ordinary courſe without any variation,
by an unchangeable Law of the All-knowing Truthful Creator, and Governour,
and Redeemer.<note n="o" place="margin">Eccles. 7. 23, 24, 25. Job 11. 6—10. Pſal. 139. 6—12. Prov. 2. 3, 4.</note> Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf was much in the dark, and altogether at a

by all his induſtry and ſearch; no private ſtudying, nor open converſe could
fully inform his underſtanding, what the proper Exiſtence, the true Reaſon,

drawn aſide with ſuch Sophiſtick Seductions. Theſe helliſh impoſters under a
ſpecious ſhew of colourable Religion, would bring in dangerous and damnable
Errors and Hereſies againſt the pure ſimplicity of the Evangelical Doctrine;
and they imployed under them ſuch ſeducers, as did much corrupt and deceive
many of the ignorant and credulous, fetching their Doctrines not from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

curious ſpeculations, taught in the Philoſophick Schools, namely the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Angels, as middle interceſſors between God and men, arrogating unto
themſelves, without any juſt right, a power of judging and aſſigning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of Eternal Life unto none but ſuch only, as would ſubſcribe unto their

at their own will and pleaſures, and not according to Chriſt in his
Word, and all this under a pretext of Humility, and of demiſſion of mind,
which is the Romiſh uſurpation, and Anti-chriſtian Tyranny at this day.
And this is a ſort of Wiſdom, which is therefore called Demoniacal, becauſe it
has the Devil for its Author.<note n="r" place="margin">Rev. 2. 24. Jam. 3. 15.</note> By which Satan would be reputed the learned

Chriſt, and from keeping cloſe to his word, to draw them aſide to that vain,
falſe and deceitful Philoſophy, to ſuch affected Creature-knowledge and Humane
Wiſdom, as would make a prey of their Souls. Reader, let me take thee by
the hand, and lead thee through ſome parts of the Scripture Paths, to ſhew thee
in this walk, how Philoſophy has been corrupting and perverting the Word and
the Works of <hi>Aelohim:</hi> He that ſhall read the Ethnick ſtories about the Origine
of the Univerſe, may ſee, how the Ariſtotelian pride rejected all Scriptural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of Faith, about this Worlds beginning, affirming the Eternity of the
World by his corrupt Reaſoning, and vain Philoſophizing. Thus alſo the Stoical
conceitedneſs aſſerted an Eternal firſt Matter. The Pagan Aſtronomers have
fancied and argued, that there are Nine Spheres in the Heavens. The Pagan
Poets made all created Productions to be out of a firſt Matter, as a common
ſtock and ſubject of all generated Beings; out of which every thing was found.
This is the Ethnick Phyſiology of many others of them. So confuſed were
their Notions, ſo fabulous their Narrations. Some Pagan Naturaliſts do make
a Primogenious Fire to be the firſt Light, out of which they ſay the Celeſtial
Lights were compoſed. Others do make the Firmament or Heaven to be the
fluid watery, or aerial part of a formleſs Chaos: Some would make the ancient
Nature of men to be commixt of Male and Female Sex, in one and the ſame
man. And others have made many feigned ſtories of his Golden Age. How
many corrupt mixtures in Ethnick Poets about the Flood, about Gods and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes,
and their Generations, which many young men are ſo defiled and tainted
withal in the common Schools of Learning, that it is long, if ever, before they
get rid of them. The Idolatries and Superſtitions of Pagans, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by their Philoſophizers, what were they but corruptings of the Moſaick
Platform, of which they had received ſomewhat by Tradition? Such a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was it even upon the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God of old to learn the Modes, the Forms,
the Ways, the Philoſophick-Learning of the Heathen.<note n="ſ" place="margin">Deut. 12. 30. &amp; 18. 9. Pſal. 106. 25. Jo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the Doctrine of Salvation by Faith in Chriſt was the Grecian Philoſophy?
What a disfigured face has it put upon Religion by its mythologizing vanity? How
many of the Original Words and Phraſes, by which both perſons and things
are aptly named and called in the Scriptures, hath it altered and abuſed, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
them in a different equivocal manner? What a miſ-ſhapen Monſter are
its Religion and Laws, whilſt it would ſo apiſhly imitate the Scripture Tradition,
as to adulterate it, if it could, into a reſemblance of its own uglineſs and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity?
The <hi>Corinthian</hi> Sophie and Sophiſtry, received from and by the Spirit of
this World, would be contradicting the Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery. The
Logicks, that Humane Wiſdom taught, were an Enemy to this; that Phyſical
Animal Man was the Phyſical Philoſopher, who did not comprehend thoſe
things which are of the Spirit of God, for, they are fooliſhneſs unto him, and he
cannot underſtand them,<note n="t" place="margin">1. Cor. 2. 4—12. &amp; 1. 18—28.</note> becauſe they are ſpiritually diſtinguiſhed or judged.
Thus has the greateſt part of the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> all the inhabited
Earth over, for many Generations been greatly impoſed upon; and ſtill it is
ſo, even unto this day: And what is yet further matter of more Lamentation,
thoſe, who have the name of the Scholaſtick Learned amongſt Chriſtians, do ſtill
pertinaciouſly adhere unto many of the Philoſophick Errors, and fabulous Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.
He, that heretofore would go into the Philoſophy Schools here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and hear the Lectures of the moſt, might ſit out a whole hour at a time,
and ſcarce hear one ſavoury ſound word of Chriſt, and of the Word of Chriſt.
And there is a deſign ſet on foot of late, to make the vertues of Pagans to be
fully equal to, and ſpecifically identical with the Graces of Chriſtians; as if to
turn Chriſtians into Pagans, were an adapted means to turn Pagans into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
I have long ſtood by, and been a ſecret, ſilent bewailer of this evil, but
the LORD hath now drawn forth my ſpirit to be an open declarer againſt it,
that this way I might be finiſhing of my Teſtimony. There is ſuch a Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Eſteem in ſome of the Judgement of the Ancient, and in others, of the
Learning of the Modern Philoſophy, that its likely I ſhall be thought not ſo
prudently to have conſulted, either my own credit, or my own quiet, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to be ſuch an Univerſal Controler of many Men, Books, Studies, Arts
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55870:35"/>
and Sciences, in ſuch an Age, wherein preconceived Opinions are heightned into
ſuch a ſettled confidence, and grown into ſuch a gigantick ſtrength: But I have
long ſince committed my All to him, who has taken the care of me, and hath
accepted of my acts of commitment; and there my Soul injoyeth its ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Neither am I altogether without expectation, that the adored Almighti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
will uſe this Treatiſe to prevail with ſome ſerious Spirits, to entertain a greater
commerce with the Scriptures of Truth, than hitherto they have: And that,
the right apprehenſions of mens minds will yet better transform into the true
Nature of things. Whilſt Philoſophick Arts are ſo over-prized, there will be
but little further inquiry; and whilſt Scripture knowledges are ſo undervalued,
progreſſions in uſeful Sciences will not be promoted. If Rational Intellects
may be better rectified, and more informed according to the Laws of the written
Word, and the operation of Created Beings, I ſhall rejoyce in the profit of any,
whilſt I am exerciſed with contradictings from many with their perverſe Brawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
or diſputing Exercitations, as the Scriptures do call ſuch ſtrifes of words.
It is not unknown to ſome what ſlye Artifices Satan has uſed in the ſeveral Ages
to corrupt the Word, eſpecially in the more ignorant Ages under Antichriſtian
darkneſs, by Marginal addings, and various readings, unequal dividing, altered
printings, and ſuch other invented devices, whereby to make Truths hidden
or obſcure, and errors paſſable and plaufible, a too deep digging into which, and
an over particular opening of which I judge at preſent to be no work of mine,
though ſome late reputed Criticks in Original Languages, and in Scripture know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
have been too prone upon any little occaſion to ſet theſe before the eyes

He is a Shield to them that truſt in him, when thoſe who have either added

               </note> what he ſpake unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> the
ſame is ſpoken unto us. The LORD Chriſt has raiſed up ſome or other in the
ſeveral ages, to plead the Cauſe of the literal ſenſe? of the Works of Creation,
in the Hiſtoy thereof, in the beginning of the Book of God, and Wiſe men eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in this laſt Age have profeſſed their expectation of the ſound knowledge
of Natural Things, and of their real Eſſence and true Properties, in this firſt
Weeks Journal of the Created World, by their ſeveral attempts to interpret it
this way. The literal ſenſe of <hi>Moſes's</hi> Hebrew (who was an<note n="m" place="margin">1 Chron. 6. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 2. 1. &amp; 1. 34.</note> Hebrew, which
Hebrew is the Tongue and Language wherein the he wrote <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Laws) is the
<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 19. 3—9.</note> ground of all Interpretations; for this Language hath apert ſignificancies
and plain properties of ſpeech, which muſt in the firſt place be received when
opened, that the natural meaning of the Scripture may be evidently known.
Much of ſound Scripture-knowledge, doth confiſt in a right explaining of the
Words and Speeches in thoſe five Books beforementioned, <hi>Geneſis,</hi> &amp;c. by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
them with themſelves in thoſe Writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles,
which are Commentaries upon thoſe five Books, by a true and ſound explication,
as the Letter is, and giving forth thence the genuine meaning of thoſe Words
and Phraſes, which therefore Chriſt<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 5. 18.</note> hath confirmed to every Jod and Chirek.
There is Originally, a certain, proper, diſtinct, and only one, ſignification of the
Hebrew Words, which is true and genuine, and which, under Chriſt, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Spirit, is the beſt Interpreter of the Holy Scriptures upon the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heart of an experienced Believer: which would be abundantly confirmed
by an accurate Collation of other Scriptures. The firſt words therefore of
Scripture, particularly and eſpecially is this Hiſtory of the Creation, muſt be
held forth in their Primitive meaning, where they are firſt uſed in their proper, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
ſenſe, which doth give forth light to the right underſtanding of them in
thoſe other Scriptures, where the ſame Words and Phraſes are afterwards, uſed.
So that it is generally the common Error and uſual Defect in moſt of our Hebrew
Lexicographers, that they give ſo many differing, and ſometimes contradicting
ſignificancies of one and the ſame Hebrew word: whereas they ſhould ſet down
the only one proper, diſtinct meaning of every Hebrew Root, and carry the
juice of that Senſe into all the Branches that do ſpring from the Root, ſuch a
meaning of it as may well agree with that word, where-ever it be met with,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55870:37"/>
throughout the whole Scriptures. Which one Direction followed and improved
with holy skill, and ſtudious induſtry by men fitted for ſuch a work, would
bring in a great augment to uſeful Learning. The Holy Scriptures are written,
as they are to be read, and muſt be ſo acknowledged, eſpecially theſe matters,
Hiſtorical and Narrative of the Creation, without doubtfulneſs or doubleneſs of
meaning. They uſe ſuch a manner of ſpeaking, as is not otherwiſe to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
not to be taken in any other ſenſe, than in that which at the firſt read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
doth plainly offer it ſelf to a man of ſpiritual underſtanding. And of all
Scriptures I take<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 1. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>&amp; ch.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> this of the Hiſtory of the Creation, and<note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 20. 1—17. Deut. 27. 1—8. Nehem. 8. 1—8. Prov. 8. 9.</note> the Law of the
Ten Words more expreſly to call for this. In which two are the complete
ſummaries and comprehenſive Modules of the Truths and Duties of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, and of the Nature and Uſes of Created Beings. I charge not
darkneſs and obſcurity, doubtfulneſs or doubleneſs upon other Scriptures: But
theſe two parts I have now more particularly in my eye, and all the reſt of the
whole Word of God is more or leſs one way or other a Commentary and Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
an Interpretation and Explication, of theſe which have a common and
familiar underſtanding, ſuch as thoſe, who have the due exerciſe of their right
Reaſon, and of ſpiritual Senſes, may, as ſoon as they hear, conceive what it mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
The Scripture-Hiſtory of Created Beings hath its Intrinſecal-ſelf truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
in it ſelf, and its Extrinſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

Text in a ſavingly inlightned-heart. The Wiſdom of <hi>Adam</hi> was, and the

faces to<note n="r" place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 1. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhar. Dan. 5 7, 8, 15, 16. &amp; 7. 16.</note> ſhine) to know well the interpretation of a Word, the Expoſition, the
Phraſe of a Word, the Solution, the Declaration, the Explication of it. The
Original Text of Holy Writ in its literal ſignificancy, muſt, under the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who indited it, and under Chriſt and his Father, he ſpeaking it from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
be the judging Rule of approving, or condemning of mens Explications
of it, and Paraphraſes upon it, and Illuſtrations concerning it, and of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Syſtems and Models of the Created World, anſwerable to thoſe Explications,
Paraphraſes and Illuſtrations, as they are found either agreeing with, or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from that. Created Beings muſt be ſo conceived, expreſſed and modelled, as
to be an exact counterpart, in all things meaſured exactly to this Scripture-Hiſtory
of them. Scriptural Words and Names, by which the ſeveral Created
Beings, are rightly called in <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Word, are the moſt perfect and proper
Definitions of any particular thing in its moſt ſpecifical difference from any other
Creature. The only true Eſſence and ſpecifical Being, and particular entity of
any Creature, is the only true ſpecifical and particular difference of that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and doth give a perfect Definition, and (when the Word is opened) a
proper deſcription of it. Though it were the ſpeaking of the ſame thing, as
the ſame thing identically. Thus if it be asked, what is the Earth? The anſwer
were pertinent and full, to ſay it is<note n="ſ" place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Aeretz,</hi> in its real Being, in the ſame ſenſe
that the Scripture doth call it ſo, and for which it hath given it that Name.
The like may be affirmed of other Creatures; for, every Created Being had a
diſtinct make, and a different Exiſtence. When we would deſcribe a Creature
by ſome its properties, as to ſay, The Earth is dry,<note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 1. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>Jabeſhah,</hi> this relates
to another Matter, the beſt Definitions, and the moſt ſignificant of Eſſences are
thoſe peculiar Words and proper Names, which are given to particular Created
Beings, in the Scriptures of Truth. Till we are more brought off, from Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
darknings and obſcurings of things, into Scripture Light, and into its
way of knowing the true Nature of Created Beings, there will ſtill be capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs

               </gap>ſneſs about ſuch puzling Terms of Humane Inventing, as
would hold mens underſtandings in continued ignorance. Every converted
Being is beſt convertible into it ſelf, and is righteſt known by its own Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs.
Where Creatures do differ, their Names do differ alſo. It would much
forward the ſound knowledge of the real Truths in thoſe Matters, if extra-Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural
Philoſophical Terms were altogether laid aſide, and the Expreſſions were
ſuch as we find in the Word of Chriſt. For, the words of mens coyning are
miſtaken Terms of Humane Art, and do miſlead into Error, and will ſtill keep
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55870:37"/>
up endleſs contendings: Whereas, the Words and Names, by which Scriptures
do call things, do make us to apprehend Created Beings rightly in our Minds,
according as the things themſelves are in their own Nature. This Journal, this
Diary, of the firſt Week of the Created World, is a plain Narrative, containing
a clear Hiſtory of the matter of Fact, which things done are identically declared
and deſcribed by the moſt apt ſignificant expreſſions. It is a moſt faithful pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Record: So that it is no other, no leſs than to give <hi>Aelohim,</hi> the adored
Almighties the lye to his faces, to deny either the plain Truth of the Fact, or the
proper ſignificancies of the expreſſions. The God of Infallible Veracity doth not
in any part of this Narration, intend any thing by any expreſſion, either of falſity
concerning things, or of deception to perſons. Private Opinioniſts can never
evade or elude the unerring Authority of the Exact Expreſſiveneſs of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
Language in this Scripture. He that would be ſatisfied concerning the
foundation of credibility about the Creation, muſt reſort to the plain and ſimple
ſenſe of this Text, according to teh Subject-matter thereof, and the Context
of this, and the Collation of other Scriptures. They very explication of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Terms, doth preſent the Truth of Created Beings in their own naked ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
carrying by the Aſpect and Eradiation thereof, a clear evidence of the
Nature of the things themſelves. This Hiſtory is the Scripture Naturals, and
the Chriſtian Phyſicks. Even young Children that are of quick apprehenſions,
are capable of taking in of this kind of Learning with great delight, ſo far at
leaſt as it is demonſtrate to their ſenſes, and as for the reſt, their ſenſes may be
directed towards the ſeveral places of the inviſible World. As to point out to
them the ſeveral Works of the Creation on the ſeveral diſtinct days: and with the
finger to ſhew them which is the Expanſe, What are the Heavenly Luminaries,
the Fowls of the Air, the Earth, the Waters, the Seas, the Light, the Darkneſs,
the Beaſts, the Fiſhes, the Worms, Man, and ſo of the reſt: And what is the
poſiture of the Creation? Thoſe Hebrews therefore are under a great miſtake,
and do hinder much of the knowledge of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> in this Word and
Works, in forbidding any to read four parts of Scripture till they are thirty
years of age, (the age of the Sacerdotal Miniſtry,) The beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> is
one of thoſe places, where the Creation of the World is deſcribed. Whereas,
the eye of young ones would tell them, the Creators Works are a viſible, legible
Commentary upon his Word. The ſecond place is the Song of Songs; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
this alſo doth ſet out ſpiritual things, by ſenſible ſimilitudes, and doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
much of Created Beings in an affectionate way between the deareſt Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Chriſt and his Churches, Chriſt and the Believers, Fellow-believers, and
Siſter Churches, with each other: And this Scripture is therefore adapted to
the underſtanding of young ones, who may the better be taught what to believe,
by what they ſee, and their own eyes, and other ſenſes may inſtruct their
Souls, and their Underſtandings and Affections may be mutua! Helps and Guides
to each other. The third place is the beginning of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Prophecy, where the
Majeſty of the LORD is deſcribed, the beauty of Cherubins, and of the living
Creatures, of the Angels, in their ſubſerviency. The fourth is, the later part
of <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> Book, from the fortieth Chapter to the end, where the New City is
deſcribed. Though theſe two later places alſo, being Viſions, may the more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
as to the external part of them, be plainly ſhewn to growing young ones;
who might in fewer Months be skilled in Geometry, the Doctrine of Meaſures,
and ſome other Arts, as the Truth, Reality and Uſefulneſs in thoſe Knowledges
is, than others will attain unto in ſo many years, by Philoſophical Studies. And
what a ſhame is it to the Learned Artiſts of the Times, that VVomen and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
would quickly be made more profiting Graduates than themſelves. If any
Traders in Humane VViſdom are angry at this diſcovery for a while, yet let them
obſerve the workings of convictions by this Scripture Light upon their minds;
and they will, when more conſiderate, bring in a Teſtimony for Chriſt, and for his
VVord, if they will be ſo ingenuous as freely to communicate their Experiences.
For, my hopes do promiſe to my ſelf, that I ſhall have moſt mens Conſciences with

nor duſt of the inhabited World. When he fitted the Heavens there was I,
when he appointed the Circuit upon the Faces of the deep, when he fortified
the Clouds above, when he ſtrengthened the Fountains of the deep, when he
laid his Decree upon the Sea, that the Waters ſhould not paſs the commandment
of his mouth, when he appointed the Foundation of the Earth. Thus ſpeaks
the Father by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> concerning his Son, Behold my Servant whom
I uphold, mine Elect my Soul delighteth, I have given my Spirit upon him, he
ſhall bring forth Judgement upon the Nations. The LORD Chriſt<note n="b" place="margin">Iſai. 42. 1 John 6. 27. Iſai. 61. 1. Heb. 5. 4, 5, 6. Mal. 3. 1. Mat. 3. 17. Pſal. 110. 4. John. 1. 32, 33.</note> was
warrantably, lawfully called to this Office, God the father ſealed him thereunto.
As Chriſt ſpeaks of himſelf in what <hi>John</hi> doth write of him, and elſewhere
in his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, The Spirit of the LORD Jehovah is upon me,</hi> therefore
<hi>Jehovah</hi> hath Anointed me to preach. No man taketh this Honour to himſelf
but he, that is called of God, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi> So alſo Chriſt did not take this
Honour to himſelf to become an high Prieſt, but he, that ſpake unto him, <hi>Thou
art my Son, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> gave it him. As alſo in another place
he ſaith, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever,</hi> upon my word, <hi>O Malchi-tzedek.</hi> Hence it is
that Chriſt is called, by the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the Apoſtle
and high Prieſt of our profeſſion, and by <hi>Malachi,</hi> The Angel of the Covenant:
So that Chriſt had a Teſtimony from his Father, for his being appointed unto
this Office, not often after he had taken Fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> when a Voice
came from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my well beloved Son, in whom I am well
pleaſed,</hi> and when the holy Spirit deſcended as a Dove out of Heaven, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
remaining on him, but long before under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation:
And before that alſo,<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 8. 22, 23.</note> even before the World was, he the anointed. This LORD
Jeſus Chriſt was Adminiſtrator under both Teſtament Diſpenſations of Grace.
He chief in Office, and all others, that were lawfully called and rightfully ſent
forth, were ſuch as did miniſter and ſerve under and for him. He was the
LORD God of the holy Prophets, as <hi>John</hi> calls him in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and as
the Father ſent him, ſo did this Chriſt ſend his Apoſtles. It was this Chriſt who
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55870:44"/>
ſo often appeared to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as has been ſhewn. Chriſt was Faithful to his Father
who conſtituted him in Office, and who was Heir of his own Houſe. In which
Houſe he imployed <hi>Moſes</hi> to be his Servant, who was alſo faithful to and under
Chriſt. It was the Spirit of Chriſt, who did witneſs in the Prophets of Old, as
<hi>Peter</hi> mentioned in his firſt Epiſtle. He was the chief one in <hi>Sion,</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him, who did declare the things that were to come to paſs; and this is the
ſame Son of God in whom the Father hath ſpoken to us in the laſt days. Him hath
God made LORD and Chriſt, and to him was given Dominion, Glory and a
Kingdom, that all People, Nations and Tongues ſhould ſerve him. The Father
hath given unto him dignity to execute Judgement; he hath given all Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Son. All muſt obey and ſtoop at the command of this ever Bleſſed
LORD of Glory, who has proclaimed this of himſelf, that all Authoritative
Power is given him in Heaven, and upon the Earth. God hath committed all
into his hands. He ſhall reign, till he hath put all Enemies under his feet. This
is he that is appointed of God, the Judge both of the Living, and of the Dead. In
this was the Love of God manifeſted towards thoſe whom he choſe in Chriſt,
and gave to Chriſt, that he hath ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that
they ſhould live by him; ſo loved he the World, that he thus gave Chriſt, that
whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life. O how
much hath he commended his Love to ſuch! He was firſt in the Love, him hath
God ſet up for a Prepitiatory-covering, an expiatory reconciliation. Thou
LORD art worthy to receive the Glory, and the Honour, and the Power, for
thou haſt created all things, and through thy will they are and were created.
This <hi>Jehovah</hi> Chriſt was the Creator of all things, as the Father is Creator, and
as the holy Spirit is Creator. They the Creators. <hi>Jehovah</hi> was the Creator of all
things. This<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 1. 1. &amp; 2. 4.</note>

the Reaſon is ſtrong, which he draws from Chriſt's being the efficient
cauſe of the Creatures being, the continued preſerver of them, and his Glory
being the great end of their Being. For in him, by or through him, were all

and eſtabliſhed their order to continue in their ſucceſſive courſes to the Worlds
end. It was he, who when he had perfected his Work, that he had made in
the ſix foregoing days of the firſt Created Week, reſted in the ſeventh day. It

becauſe in it he had reſted from all his Work: Thus it was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
unchangeably ſo to remain, and go on to the end. This he expreſly
revives in his after proclaiming of this Law of the Sabbath, that it might be
remembred, <hi>Six days Jehovah made the heaven and the earth, the ſea, and all
that is in them, and reſted the ſeventh day, and hallowed it.</hi> Thus injoyning
both by his own Example and Command, the perpetual Obſervation of that
particular Seventh-day, in order of Time in its ſucceſſive courſe in every week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

no other day of the Week. Thou LORD art worthy to receive the Glory, and
the Honour, and the Power: For thou haſt created all things, and through thy
Will they are and were created. O that thoſe who dwell on the Earth, and
every Nation, and Kindred, and Language, and People would fear him and
give Glory to him, for the hour of his Judgement is coming! And that they

            <p>How great a promoter of Learning as well as of Religion, this would be, all

found Believers of Chriſtian Doctrine will ſoon admit. For there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
comparable to this of the ſaving<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 2—16. John 17. 3. Phil. 3. 4—10.</note> knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt and of him
crucified. Though <hi>Paul</hi> abounded in other ſorts of Learning, yet it was a caſe
determinedly judged aright by him, that all their knowledge was as no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
at all, without this, and in competition with this, this being the ground-work
of all. I ſhall to this end cull ſome uſeful paſſages out of the nine firſt
Chapters of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> relating to this matter. In which one Book;
ſo ſmall a part of the Scriptures, there is more of ſound learning in profitable Arts
and Sciences than in all the Pagan Philoſophical Books that are Extant. O how
much then is there in the whole Scriptures! Here you may find a Directory and
Rules for Theology, for Phyſicks, Logicks, Rhetoricks, Medicine, Politicks, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks,
Oeconomicks, what not, that is uſeful Learning?</p>
            <p>How many ſeveral ſignificant words are there whereby to ſet out the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and preheminence of Scripture-knowledge, and of the Science of uſeful
Arts in a Scripture-way! Such as<note n="g" place="margin">

Intellect, Erudition, Knowledge, Prudence, Skill, Subtilneſs, and the
like, with many choice commendations of it, both in words and phraſes! as
that, this doth deliver Authoritative ſayings, that, it teacheth Rectitudes, gives
apt Counſels, ſpeaks eſſences according as the truth of things is, with much
more! Here the Wiſe will find and<note n="h" place="margin">Prov. 1. 5, 6.</note> addition of Doctrine, the more he doth

of the prime of all Good that he is made to ſuch. All treaſures of Wiſdom
and of knowledge are in him, and in his Word. He is the Authour of all
ſound Wiſdom: And, that is a Man's Wiſdom<note n="m" place="margin">Prov. 1. 2, 3.</note> to learn Chriſt's words, to

conceptions and apprehenſions of Truths, and of things as are in the mind of

We ſhould cry giving our<note n="q" place="margin">verſ. 3.</note> voice to it, to call in this Heavenly Inſtructer

and the finding of this knowledge, is the great<note n="s" place="margin">verſ. 5. 6.</note> Promiſe. This Wiſdom is a
gift from him, knowledge and underſtanding comes from his mouth, from

are but colours and appearances. This Word-knowledge doth influence

If we know <hi>Jehovah</hi> in all our ways, he<note n="z" place="margin">Prov. 3. 6.</note> will direct our paths. As for
others, who<note n="a" place="margin">Verſ. 5, 7.</note> lean to their own underſtanding, and who are wiſe in their own
eyes, their confidence is vain.<note n="b" place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Adam</hi> had happy goings on with a ſtraight foot,

And the wiſeſt among the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould ſtill be making out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

good is the Fruit that is to be gathered from this<note n="d" place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> Tree of ſaving Knowledge!
Will and deſire what thou wilt: This doth by far excel; any thing of Art,
every thing of Science, elſe has no coequation with this. This was the wiſe
choice that<note n="e" place="margin">1 King 3. 5.—15. 2. Chron. 1. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> made, for which he, who is Wiſdom it ſelf, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
him. There is<note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 3 16.</note> no occaſion of complaint here, as in vain Philoſophy,
that Art is long, and Life is ſhort: For, the more skilful thou doſt grow in this
holy Art, the more will it be a lengthening to thy days, and if thou do not
waſte time, it will tell thee thou doſt not want time. Here the walk is<note n="g" place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> all-pleaſantneſſes,
and the way is proſperous Peace. No ſuch hardſhip and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
as in intricate involved Philoſophy, in the Study of which confounding
Vanity, and ſtupifying of Obſtruſeneſs, ſome have thrown their Books againſt the
wall, becauſe they could not overcome its Notions in their Intellect. In Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Wiſdom,
<note n="h" place="margin">Verſ. 18.</note> here the Tree Everlaſting Lives, and this Tree of ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
do grow together, and growing Believers can nouriſhingly feed on both
their Fruits together. Thoſe who apprehend it, and hold it up, and reach it out
to others, are made happy by it. This is a participation of<note n="i" place="margin">Verſ. 19.</note> the Wiſdom of
God. This Wiſdom is ſeen in <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s founding of the Earth, and this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
is manifeſted in his eſtabliſhing of the Heavens; this Knowledge
<note n="k" place="margin">Prov. 3. 20. 21.</note> looked forth in the broken Abyſſes, in the dividing of the Waters, and in the
Skies, diſtilling Dew: Yet vain mens affected wiſdom can make nothing of their
Studies about theſe, nor ever will- whilſt they ſlight the Scripture diſcovery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
theſe, and other Works of the Creation; but the eyes of Believers ſhould
not go off from the Word and Works of God. Thoſe who are thus well-minded
ſhall have <hi>Jah</hi> to communicate his<note n="l" place="margin">Verſ. 32.</note> ſecrets, and his counſels to them,
Here is<note n="m" place="margin">Prov. 4. 2. Lakach.</note> good Doctrine: good in its ſelf, good to thoſe who do receive it,
from which receiving it hath its Name. Our Heart ſhould be<note n="n" place="margin">Verſ. 4.</note> upholders,
bearers up of theſe Oracles of Chriſt. We ſhould<note n="o" place="margin">Verſ. 5, 7.</note> poſſeſſingly acquire this
Wiſdom and Underſtanding, not forgetting, not declining from the words of his
mouth. This Wiſdom is the Leading-head-Commander of Knowledge; This
we are to begin with. It is not, as vain Philoſophy is, a withered fruitleſs Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
but a<note n="p" place="margin">Prov. 16. 16. &amp; 17. 16.</note> ſapid ſavoury Knowledge. It is the beſt Inheritance. O come
to it as ſuch, all ye who are true Friends of real uſeful Learning. It puts a<note n="q" place="margin">Prov. 4. 8, 9.</note> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon the Poſſeſſor of it, and doth highly exalt him, enobling the embracers
of it. Theſe ſayings we muſt<note n="r" place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> take in, not the Dictates or Placits of Men, or
of Devils. In this<note n="ſ" place="margin">Verſ. 11, 12.</note> way of Wiſdom ſhould young ones be inſtructed, they
ſhould tread in theſe ſound paths of Rightneſs, going over the Scriptures again and
gain. How many young Students read over divers Philoſophical Tractates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they read over the holy Scriptures once, at leaſt with an eye togather the
beſt Arts and Sciences thence? Other Books of Knowledges are no further uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than as they, ſome way or other, more or leſs do comment aright on the
Scriptures, or on Created Beings agreeably to the Scriptures. In Humane Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical
Writings, the Student is often brought to perplexing ſtraights, and to
offenſive ſtumblings; not ſo here in this word and way of Wiſdom. Here we
ſhould have<note n="t" place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> and hold real profitable Notions of Truths and of Things, it is our

This Word is a<note n="x" place="margin">Prov. 6. 10, 21, 22, 23.</note> Law and a Light, whereas Philoſophies are darkneſſes. This
Word ſhould we bind over our heart always, and tie it, annect it over our
throats, that as ſoon as ſpeeches are uttered by us, out may come ſome Scripture
<note n="y" place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 11.</note> Eloquies of Myſterious Art and Holy Science, Waking and walking we ſhould

Theſe Words of Chriſt ſhould be<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 7. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> kept by us, and hid with us as the black, the
little man of our eyes. We ſhould bind them over our Fingers (to work by them,
and to wiſe us in and about our work) as well as write them on the Table of our
Heart, to live under the Law of them, and to love them, and meditate upon
them. We ſhould ſay to Wiſdom my Siſter thou, and call Underſtanding a
Kinſwoman, ſo near and ſo dear, ſo intimate and familiar, ought it to be to us,
and with us, and our eyes ſhould ſee by this; all ſenſible experimental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
ſhould be brought to this. This Word it greatly uſeful for an Active, as
well as for a Contemplative Life. Here is work for Fingers, as well as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs
for Hearts. A Believer doth wed this Wiſdom. This kind of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and of Knowledge ſhould be well known unto us, as a Wife, a Siſter,
a Friend, a very amicous<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 12. 49, 50.</note> Relation, and of free Converſe, our conjoyned
Counſeller, of the ſame blood with us, and of cloſe affinity to us. All the ſons of
<hi>Adam</hi> may<note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> learn here, Magiſtrate, Miniſter, and People, Leaders and Led.
What is ſpoken here are Eximious Matters and<note n="d" place="margin">Verſ. 6, 7, 8.</note> Rectitudes, that which is Truth,
all Juſt, no depraved or oblique thing, all<note n="e" place="margin">Verſ. 9, 10.</note> preparedly right to the Intellect,

that true Riches which is<note n="f" place="margin">Verſ. 10, 11, 12.</note> beyond Gold and Silver. Wiſdom is above Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garites.
All a mans wouldlings, his wiſhings have no equation in her. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Philoſophical Arts of Elementary Learning are beggarly Rudiments. So
are the firſt Principles of Coſmical Men, of Vain Affecters of Worldly Humane
Wiſdom, poor and weak Vanities. In Chriſt's Word is the Invention of Science,

of a man's Spirit, and Soul, and Body. This Word would inſtruct Kings how
to Reign, and Counſellors how to Decree Juſtice: How to Statute it out to
Subjects and Inferiours. In this Princes have and ſhould exerciſe their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate,
all the Nobles and Judges of the Earth, according to Chriſt and his Word;
O how much ſhould we love this, and morning it to find it out! It will carry
us to walk in the path of Juſtice. You, that for ſome years have been early at your
Philoſophical Studies, be now at length wiſe, and come betimes to the Scripture
Lecture, that Chriſt by his holy Spirit from his Father, in his Word would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

Here Chriſt utters his Oracles from that exalted Pew or Pulpits, the higheſt

He calls with ſignificant Voice in expreſs words, Come, O come away, come

of locality in the Creation of Places, but that they are mere Bug bears to
terrifie Fools, and Scare-crows to fright Children withal, my work therefore

As for the ſignificancy of the words in the Original let all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures

There is great evidence and natural comelineſs that is in this kind of Scripture-ſpeaking.
It cannot be rightfully affirmed of this Earth in the abſtract; as many
do, that the Earth was emptineſs, or an empty thing, at its firſt creation. For
this appears to be expreſly denyed by <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> in<note n="g" place="margin">Iſa. 45. 18.</note> another Scripture,
becauſe, thus he ſaid, when he ſhews himſelf forth as the Creator of thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and the Former of this Earth, that having made the Earth, he firmly
prepared or eſtabliſhed her, and that he did create her Not-<hi>Tohu</hi> or Not-empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

Thus doth he expreſly deny what men do affirm. <hi>Tohu</hi> only is the Gulphy
empty uninhabited place of the created World. It being only the<note n="h" place="margin">Luke 16. 26.</note> Gulphy
paſſage to Hell; Several parts of the creation being diſtinctly ſpoken unto in

               <hi>Sheol</hi> properly, ſignifie the Grave, but ſome lower place
than that. Divers ſheets of Paper might be filled with this Subject from what
is gatherable out of the Word, which alſo is another very profitable diſcovery
if purſued with diligence and received with meekneſs, and would overturn the
whole of Ethnick Philoſophy about the <hi>Syſtem</hi> of the World and the poſiture
of the Creation. The middle of this Earth is not that common center of the
Univerſal World, towards which all heavy bodies would naturally deſcend there
to ſit down and enjoy their Reſt: The Stone, or Braſs, or Lead, at the end of
the Line in the perpendicular would move downward under all the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the Waters, if it met with no obſtacle. According to Geometricians own
principles, If right Lines do ſtand upon right Lines, making the Angles on either
ſide equal, then either of thoſe Angles is a right Angle, and the right Lines
that ſtand erected are perpendicular Lines to thoſe upon which they ſtand. Such
perpendicular Lines can never meet in one and the ſame center and point, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
one another, for there is no enclining of the Lines any more to one ſide then
another, There is no reclining or obtuſeneſs in any of the Angles; aequidiſtant
perpendiculars prolonged and moved never ſo far on both parts, will never meet
either on the one ſide or on the other. All right Angles are equal to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Such perpendiculars are always equal diſtant the one from the other.
Could ſuch perpendicular Lines meet at a point, if they were prolonged, they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55870:50"/>
will neceſſarily interſect, and the Angles on both ſides would not be equal.
Theſe perpendicular Lines are Rectangled parallels; they are equal perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
conſtituted between the ſame parallels; they are Equi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

drawn: all the quadrilateral (Figures would have oppoſite Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels;
from one and the ſame point can be drawn but one perpendicular Line
to divide a terminated right-lined Diameter (equally dividing the Circle) into
two equal parts, if that perpendicular Line be drawn from the Circumference to
the Center: and from one and the ſame Point and Center there can be but one
perpendicular Line drawn to that part of the Circumference, where a right Line
doth touch the Circle, and where that Perpendicular doth cut that right Line
into two equal right Angles at the point of touching: All other Lines drawn
from the ſame point, have not correſpondent, proportional, parallel, equidiſtant
parts, neither will they make right equal Angles in that point where they do
touch or interſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct that right Line. The oppoſite ſides are not parallel, neither
can they paſs into a right-angled-equilateral quadrilateral Figure, into ſuch a
Square which hath the four ſides equal, and the Angles right-lined. Of all the
right Lines drawn from one and the ſame Point on a right Line, that Line which
is Perpendicular is the leaſt, conſtituted on one and the ſame Baſe, ſo that there
is but one Perpendicular from or to this one and the ſame Point, ſtanding erect
upon a right Line. According to Statick Law there can be no Angular point of two
ſeveral Lines concurring in it, without an unequal divergence or divaricating of the
two lines from it proportionably, as it is nearer or further diſtant from the point.
Improve we this to overturn humane Philoſophy. Let there be an Erect Wall
ſquare of a right-angled equilateral, quadrilateral Figure; and let plumb-lines
be let fall from the two ſides of it, they will naturally move downward to, and
if way were made into the Earth perpendicularly, and theſe perpendiculars
would be equidiſtant, and would be always, if prolonged, equidiſtant and never
meet at a Center and Point, which is quite contrary to the Tenet of ſuch Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
ſeeing there cannot be a Motion of two heavy Bodies from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in two parallel lines towards one Center and Point: For ſtill the nearer
they come to this ſuppoſed Center, the nearer they muſt be to one another, which
affirmation is quite contrary to Senſe, Reaſon and Scripture, as may be ſeen with
the eye in the forementioned parallel Motion of the two Plumb-lines, Thus
the Seamen have their Perpendiculars which do move right down, and do make
perpendicular lines equidiſtant from each other, every where in the Waters that

thereof, and not according to any convex or concave Superficies. A Garden,
though the Ground be riſing and indented, yet may be paled round with as few

without Subſtance, as Ethnick Philoſophy has wronged it. It is an Eſſentiated
Subſtance; It has a diſtinct good perfect Subſiſtence: It has a place of its own;
It has Motion from one place to another, and this Motion is in Time. It comes
and it goes at its Seaſons. It has not only a Local Motion, but alſo its Rays
and Beams, and Species do produce real Effects. The Sun is not the cauſe of
this Light; for, this Light was created three Days before the Sun. They were
diſtinct and different Creatures. The Light did actually Exiſt, or had a reality
of Being without and ſeparate from the Sun, which Sun did not then actually
Exiſt, and therefore the Light muſt neceſſarily differ really from the Sun. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe

looked on theſe Seaſons with joy and with delight, with approbation and

Exiſtence, a natural Subſiſtence, it is a created Eſſence. The Evening doth not
begin at the end of the ninth hour of the Day, or three hours before the going

This Day here is ſo diſtinguiſhed according to number, One, and not according

Scriptures, when they tranſlate one Numeral, the firſt Ordinal, thereby to thruſt
and to force in if they could, the one Day of the Week, into the room of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day,
as if the one Day were now the Weekly-ſabbath-day in the place of
the Seventh, which miſtake hath Scripture Reaſon and Nature againſt it, as may be
ſhewn in its proper place, in an inquiry upon the Seventh-day. There was one
Day which was the beginning of Days, and therefore this World was in Time,
not from Eternity; For, to ſpeak with propriety of Language, Eternity has no
precedent duration. And this and other diſtinct Days in this Week of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are properly a diſtinct Enumeration of diſtinct Days, ſetting out their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
natural meaſures. And therefore the expreſs mentioning of them ſeverally
doth ſhew, that all things were not Created in an inſtant at once, or in one day
only, all of them together. The Evening and the Morning of every Day were
a diſtinct Day, and were diſtinct parts of every Day. The one Day was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſecond, and the third Day was after the ſecond, the fourth followed the
third, and the fifth was after the fourth, the ſixth ſucceeded the fifth, and the
ſeventh which is the laſt Day of the Week, was the Holy Cloſe of that Week.
There is but one Seventh-day in the Week. No other Day in this, or in any fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Week, is properly the Seventh-day of the Week, in the weekly revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Theſe Days have a priority, and a poſterioty in time in their ſucceſſive
parts: and ſo were the Creatures diſtinct Works, or diſtinct Days. They had a
ſeparate Creation on ſeparate Days, that we might with the more ſtaidneſs and
diſtinctneſs of ſpirit, conſider of, and meditate upon them in their created Order.

One deſign of this is to demonſtrate from the Word, that a Week in its ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
returns, has a natural Exiſtence, a created Being, which doth unchangeably
eſtabliſh the ſix foregoing Days of every Week to be working Days, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
the laſt, the cloſing Day of every Week to be the weekly Sabbath-day,
or Day of Reſt. As alſo, to diſcover, that thoſe who would undertake the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of times, ſhould order all Chronology according to Scripture account.
This Doctrine of Days and of Weeks, doth ſomewhat confirm the Seventh-day-Sabbath,
as the Seventh, to be of Natural Obligation. Even the Adverſaries
themſelves are ſo far convinced hereby; that they confeſs divers of them, that all
the World are under a Divine Obligation to ſpend one Day every Week in the
Exerciſe of Religion; that the Hebdomadal Revolution of Time is generally
admitted, that it is Catholick, that all Nations in all Ages have from time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial
made the Revolution of ſeven Days, to the firſt ſtated period of
Time; that the meaſure of Time by a Night and a Day is directed unto ſenſe by
the Diurnal Courſe of the Sun; that Lunar Months of ſolar Years are of an
unavoidable Obſervation unto all rational Creatures: Whence therefore all men
have reckoned Time by Days, Months and Years, is obvious unto all, but
whence the Hebdomadal Revolution, or weekly period of Time ſhould make its
entrance, and obtain a Catholick admittance, no man can give an account, but
with reſpect to ſome impreſſions on the minds of men, from the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Law of our Natures, with the Tradition of a Sabbatical Reſt
inſtituted from the Foundation of the World. A Week is ſpoken of
as a known account of Days in Time. Thus they acknowledge: As
alſo, that thoſe of the Philoſophers, who reſolved their Obſervations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
things Natural or Phyſical, do eſteem the Septenary Number Sacred: A
Septenary Revolution of Days: unto which they found a reſpect in all their
Notions and Speculations about the <hi>Pleiades</hi> and <hi>Triones</hi> in Heaven, Lunar
changes, ſounds of Inſtruments, variations in the age of Man, critical Days in
bodily Diſtempers, and tranſactions of Affairs private and publick. I ſo far make
uſe of this as to ſhew, that if ſuch Authors would but improve their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
and conceſſions, they might be ſpirited and ſublimated into an aſſerting
of ſomething of Honour, inſeparable from the Natural Being of the Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
The order of which Day is not to be diſturbed. Another of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth,
that there have been ſome difference and variation in the account of
Years and Months with people, yet never was the Week counted to be more or
leſs than ſeven Days with any people. In all Ages, among all Nations, the
Seventh-day has been venerable and ſacred. I might put more of ſuch Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
together, were there need. But it is the Authority of holy Scripture, and
of created Nature that ſways with me. It is obſervable in prophetical Scripture
by<note n="u" place="margin">Dan. 9. 24. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the Weeks are there ſaid to be cut off, as the words do properly
ſignifie. The Verb of the ſingular Number, being put to a word of the plural
Number, doth evidently ſhew, that every one of the Weeks, from the firſt to
the laſt ſhall be preciſely and abſolutely complete: It was a preciſe cutting off,
The firſt Week of the created World was the fitteſt time for the giving forth of
the Law of the Seventh-day-Sabbath, becauſe the ground of the Inſtitution of
this weekly Sabbath, was <hi>Aelohims</hi> manifeſting by his Words and Works, that
in that ſame Week he perfected both the working Days, and the reſting Day,
he reſted upon the ſelf ſame Seventh-day, when the memory of his great and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55870:54"/>
glorious Works was ſo new and freſh. So agreeable is this to created Nature

               <hi>Luna</hi> therefore followeth, whence they call the ſecond Day of the Week, <hi>Monday,
Munday,</hi> or rather Moon-day, as if it were Moons day; from this ancient
Ethnick Cuſtom of aſcribing all the Days of the Week to ſome Idol God, or
Planet.<note n="a" place="margin">See <hi>Mirſheus</hi> guide into Tongues, <hi>&amp; Vreſteg.</hi> Pag. 10. &amp; 69.</note> When the moſt Ancient Germans were Pagans, they appropriated
the next Day unto <hi>Sunday,</hi> to the ſpecial adoration of the Moon, who was the
next Idol according to the courſe of the Days of the Week, before mentioned.
Hence in <hi>Teutonick, High Dutch,</hi> or the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, it is called <hi>Der Montag,</hi>
from <hi>Mon,</hi> the Moon, and <hi>Tag,</hi> a Day; and in <hi>Belgick,</hi> or <hi>Low Dutch, Maendach,</hi>
often <hi>Maendagh,</hi> from <hi>Dagh,</hi> a Day, and <hi>Maene,</hi> the Moon: In <hi>French, Lundy,

            </p>
            <p>The third Day is the Day of <hi>Mars,</hi> as it is named in divers Languages, as in
<hi>Latin,</hi> in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> in <hi>Italian,</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> in <hi>Britiſh</hi> or <hi>Welch,</hi> and in <hi>Greek;</hi> they
make this Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> to be the God of battel and of ſtrife, contention, debate,
controverſie, whence the <hi>High Dutch</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Tongue now calls it, <hi>Dinſtag,</hi> and
the <hi>Belgick</hi> or <hi>Low Dutch, Dijnſdagh, Diiſſen dagh, Drings dagh,</hi> from <hi>Dring,</hi>
contention or ſtrife, and <hi>Dagh,</hi> a Day, becauſe they dedicate this Day of the
Week to contention and ſtrife. In <hi>Engliſh</hi> it is commonly called <hi>Tueſday,</hi> of
<hi>Tuiſco,</hi> who, as they affirm was chief Leader and Ruler of the <hi>German</hi> Nation,
from the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> who in honour of him, after his death, called this
Day, <hi>Tuiſtag,</hi> that is <hi>Tuiſco,</hi> his Day. And likewiſe after his name they do in their

as alſo the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> uſing herein the <hi>D</hi> for the <hi>T,</hi> do make it, <hi>Duyteſh</hi>
and <hi>Duyteſh-landt:</hi> Hence in <hi>Latin,</hi> they are called <hi>Tuiſcones,</hi> and <hi>Teutones,</hi> and
their Tongue, <hi>Lingua Teutonica,</hi> and all of <hi>Tuiſco</hi> or <hi>Tuiſto,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> calleth

the <hi>German</hi> denomination.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Day, they call the Day of <hi>Mercury,</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> in <hi>Britiſh</hi> or <hi>Welch,</hi>
in <hi>Greek,</hi> and in other Languages, in <hi>Engliſh</hi> they name it <hi>Wedenſday,</hi> or <hi>Wenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:</hi>
in <hi>Belgick</hi> or <hi>Low Dutch, Woenſdagh,</hi> or <hi>Wodenſdagh,</hi> or <hi>Godes-dagh;</hi> for
ſo they called <hi>Mercuries</hi> Day, as if it were Gods Day, <hi>Wodans</hi> or <hi>Godans</hi> Day,
or as <hi>Verſtegan</hi> willeth, that <hi>Woden</hi> was among the Ancient <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
a moſt valiant and victorious Prince and Captain, and his Idol or Image was
after her death honoured, praiſed and ſacrificed unto, that by his aid and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance,
they might alſo obtain Victory over his Enemies, which when they had
obtained, they ſacrificed ſuch priſoners, as in that battel they had taken: and
from his Name this word, <hi>Woden,</hi> in their Tongue ſignifieth, fierce, furious:
As in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when one is in a rage, we ſometims ſay he is Wood, or he taketh
on as if he were Wood; ſo of this name <hi>Woden,</hi> whom after his death they
honoured as a God, came this name <hi>Wedneſday</hi> inſtead of <hi>Wodenſday.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth Day, they name the Day of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or of <hi>Jove,</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> in <hi>Britiſh</hi>

            <p>The ſixth Day of the Week they called the Day of <hi>Venus,</hi> in <hi>French, Italian</hi>

both Sexes, as well men as woman, and as an Hermaphrodite, but more
of the Female: She was reputed the giver of peace, and of plenty, as alſo the
cauſer and maker of Love and Amity, out of which it appeareth, that <hi>Friga</hi>

            <p>The Seventh day, is named by the Ethnicks, the Day of <hi>Saturn,</hi> ſo in <hi>Latin,</hi>

having long Hair, and a long Beard, and was bare headed and bare-footed: In
his left hand he had a Wheel, and in his right he carried a Pail of Water, wherein
were Flowers and Fruits. In <hi>Low Dutch,</hi> this Seventh-day is called, <hi>Ruſt-dagh;</hi>
from <hi>Ruſt,</hi> Reſt, and <hi>Dag,</hi> a Day, the Day of Reſt. In <hi>Engliſh, French, Italian,

            <head>Paſs we now unto an enquiry concerning the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Work of<note n="x" place="margin">Gen. 1. 6—10.</note> the Second Day.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Whether all thoſe upper Waters (ſuch as Rain, Dew, Hail, Snow,
and the like,) between which and the lower Waters (comprehended
under the name of Seas, ſuch as Springs, Fountains, Rivers, Lakes,
and the like,) the firm Out-ſpread or Expanded doth ſeparatingly
divide, do come down from above this Expanſe, Or are they cauſed
in the Air by ſome influencing operativeneſs of the Heavenly Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries
upon the moistneſs and waterineſs here below, drawing up
ſuch vapours from hence as do condenſe in the cold middle Region
of the Air, and are there turned into thoſe diſtilling Drops which
come down here below? Whether the Air be the proper place where
the upper Waters are generated?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HUmane Sophiſts will reſolve this Queſtion, thus: Rain is the moiſture of
the Earth and of the Seas, of Watery places, drawn up by the heat of
the Sun into the middle Region of the Air, which being thus condenſed
into Clouds, is afterwards at the will of God diſſolved and dropt down again
in ſhowers for his glory in making the Earth fruitful, for good to the good, for
the inſtruction of all men, and for relief to other creatures. As to that part
which is the generating cauſe, Natural Philoſophers do call the Sun the Father
of the Rain, and a late Chriſtian Philoſopher doth own it, as not improperly ſo
called in his Expoſition on <hi>Joh.</hi> The Water of the Sea, and the moiſture of the
Earth, ſay they, being attenuated by the heat of the beams of the Sun, do become
vapours, which being ſo rarefied and reſolved into an aiery ſubſtance are by the
ſame heat of the Sun drawn up into a cold middle loft of the Air, where being
again thickned into Water they melt down into Rain. Thus they deſcribe the
manner of the Formation and Generation of Rain. And it is a common hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh
expreſſion amongſt many who name the name of Chriſt, we ſhall have
Rain when the Moon changeth, or when the Wind turneth. Thus do theſe
therefore greatly err<note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 22. 29. Mar 12. 24. 27.</note> becauſe, they know not the Scriptures, nor the power
of God.</p>

               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:55870:57"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is no ground in Scripture, nor in Nature, to affirm three Regions of
the Air, lower, middle and higher, as vain Philoſophers do in their Phyſicks: as
if then, immediately above that, were the Region of Fire, next under the Orb
of the Moon. Such a partition of the Air into three ſeveral Regions I find not,
either in the original Text, or in created beings: As alſo neither is there ſuch an
enumeration in the word or works of Chriſt, as ten coeleſtial Spheres or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
The <hi>Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,</hi> the Starry Heaven, the Chriſtalin Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
the firſt Mover. It is an humane Figment this. The Scriptures do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us of<note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 2.</note> a third, which is the higheſt Heaven, and in this diſcovery muſt
we acquieſce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> has builded<note n="a" place="margin">Amos 9. 6. Pſ. 104. 3.</note> his ſtories, and hath planted his lofts in the
Waters. But thoſe Waters are ſuch as are above all theſe viſible Heavens, above

the place of theſe upper Waters is<note n="b" place="margin">Jer. 47. 2. Pro. 25. 23.</note> over the North part of the Heavens. This
viſible expanded is<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 1. 6, 7.</note> Diacritical or Diſtinctive between the upper and lower
Waters. This extent or well compacted firm out-ſpread was made much for
this end dividingly to ſeparate between theſe two Waters, ſo as that they might
not be joyned together in one. It was, and is an intermediate orderly dispoſed
diſtinction between them, between ſomewhat that was above, and ſomewhat
that was below, which therefore alſo is not the very higheſt and utmoſt bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the created World, as divers of the Ethnick Sophiſts aſſerted, who would
have it their <hi>Super-AEther,</hi> or <hi>Coelum Daemoniacum,</hi> where they did place the

ſeemed to them to be the higheſt and greateſt, and moſt glorious of all viſible

Which <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf doth expreſly deny: It ſo cometh, as the word cometh

There is a ſecond growth after the firſt cutting down. There is a time for the
gathering of Herbs, and a way of drying them for uſe. I was entring upon
the Doctrine of Trees, and of their Fruit as deſcribed in the Word: But, it is
ſo large, that a diſtinct Treatiſe might profitably be publiſhed to the World
from the Scripture about it. I point out the Word-way for others to travel
further on in, whoſe profeſſion doth lead them more on in this path. Only let
me add ſomewhat more about Herbs. The Scriptures do mention<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 27. 25.</note>, a time of
gathering Herbs, eſpecially the Herbs of the Mountains, when the Herb is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and the Graſs-plant appeareth, they are fitteſt food for man, (thoſe of
them that were appointed for food.) When they firſt ſpring forth, and are well
and full ſprung up, to be fit for that end. And it ſhould be inquired, whether
then alſo they are not in their prime for medicinal uſe, when the Herbs thruſt
forth in their verdure, ſtrength, fulneſs and choiceneſs of Juyce. I pretend
not to any deep inſight into this part of the Medicinal Art, but do put upon
the inquiſition, whether that part of the Spring time, when Sheep uſe to be ſhorn,
(which is mentioned in the<note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 27. 26, 27.</note> Verſe immediately following, that which you have
in the Margin-above.) Then when men uſe to ſell off their Goats, when Bread

joy doth exceed, the Heart forgets its Limits, and leaps beyond its bounds, and
ſo looſneth it ſelf, that the ſpirits too frolickly fly out, whereupon weakning,
fainting, ſwooning and ſickning do enſue. Whereas joy moderated doth revive
the heart, chear the ſpirit, quicken the body, and comfort the whole man.
Over-ſadneſs and undiſciplin'd fear doth oppreſs the Heart, and ſtreighten the

Diſquiſitions, whilſt vain affecters of Humane Wiſdom are
our Teachers, who would Dogmatize over us, and impoſe their peremptory

no wings to fore high enough for a confutation of their New Worlds in the
Moon, and in other Luminaries by a cloſe ocular Demonſtration to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
And thus they are hardened into a confidence of their Art, becauſe
they conclude none can convince them from the received Aſtronomical ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55870:62"/>
that it is otherwiſe than they affirm, and as they would fairly to
the eye repreſent it in their Artificial Syſtems and fancied Schemes, which are
but witty devices of Humane Inventions, not the real Natures of Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Should I ask for ſuch a Scripture-proof, as might directly anſwer to the
truth of theſe Coeleſtial Bodies in their proper Nature, of their Hypotheſes,
whereby they would ſalve their cunningly framed, Schematical Figures and
Appearances; It may be I muſt take a Jear for my information, and a Jeſt for
my ſatisfaction. The Extrinſick Faces of thoſe Heavenly Bodies a vulgar eye may
behold; but what their Created Subſtance is, what their orderly Motion, what
their peculiar Scituation, what their operative Influx, what their periodical
Revolutions, and much more of this Nature, in the true cauſes, and real effects
of them, the moſt skilful of Ethnick Aſtronomers, are but mere conjecturers
about them, and can never give us any certainty of knowledge in theſe matters;
ſo that the reputation of their skill is only maintained and upheld by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and unſearchingneſs of common underſtandings of vulgar Judgements,
who have neither leiſure nor ſtudiouſneſs enough to diſcern the deceitful ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs
of ſuch Philoſophical Fabricks, which have no evincing evidence in
them. That knowledge which theſe ſelf flatterers do boaſt they have attained,
comes in moſtly by the ſenſe of ſeeing, which how fallible muſt it be, if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
were ſo great between them, and thoſe Coeleſtial Lights, as they boldly
aſſert? It appears by<note n="u" place="margin">Ch. 9. ch. 26. ch. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Job</hi>'s reaſoning about thoſe matters, that he had great
knowledge of Natural Things, and could ſpeak much about the Syſtem of the
Univerſe, and the Poſiture of the World: But when <hi>Jehovah</hi> came to argue
with him about thoſe Heavenly Creatures, he now humbly acknowledgeth that
<note n="w" place="margin">Job 42. 3, 4. &amp; 40. 3, 4, 5.</note> he was without the knowledge of them, by any mere humane diſquiſition,
which could never throughly find them out in their proper Exiſtences, and
Operations, no other way could the exact knowledge of this be gotten but by
the LORD, the Spirit and the Word: he rehearſed that which he did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
wonders above him which he knew not; above him, not only in place
by great diſtance, but alſo beyond hls natural powers of rationall Intellect to
underſtand clearly, or to comprehend fully; he is now made willing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
by <hi>Jehovah</hi> and his Word. How quickly doth his Philoſophical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy
vaniſh, which he himſelf readily exploded, when<note n="x" place="margin">Job 38. 31, 32, 33.</note> the LORD ask'd
him ſome few Queſtions, Canſt thou bind the pleaſantneſſes of <hi>Cinah,</hi> or looſen

thou appoint his Government upon the Earth? He points out and nameth ſome
of the Coeleſtial Luminaries, and Starry Lights to <hi>Job,</hi> and quickly ſilenceth
him; who now lays his hand upon his mouth, and will not anſwer; ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
and miſtaking was there in his Optick Art, where ſo vaſt a ſpace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervened
between his own eye, and thoſe Heavenly Objects; whoſe Matter,
Motion and Influx, he was ſo much now at a loſs about, though <hi>Jehovah
Aelohim</hi> hath made uſe of this confutation of <hi>Job,</hi> to inſtruct, and to wiſe
us in thoſe Myſterious Secrets of Created Nature, in the Coeleſtial Bodies
<hi>Ptolemy</hi> and <hi>Copernicus</hi> had quite different Schemes, and accordingly they frame
quite different Theories and Suppoſitions, and yet both of them have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the ordinary view and open face of the Heavenly bodies to ſatisfie their
Scholars concerning the ſame <hi>Phaenomena</hi> and the ſame calculations upon quite
different Aſtronomical principles: and the Diſciples of both theſe may find out
enough whereby to confute the errours, and to demonſtrate the falſneſs of their

any ſolid grounds, that they are in the right. Let the ſeigned Schemes and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary

about theſe Heavenly bodies: According to the Scriptures; Contrary to
vain, deceitful, fooliſh Philoſophy. The ſubſtance of the coeleſtial Luminaries
or Lightners were not made on the firſt day of the created World, as if the
firſt ſcattered light were gathered together into theſe lightſome bodies on the
Fourth day: But the Sun, Moon, and Stars are different creatures of ſeveral
Formation on a diſtinct day, As<note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 1. 3, 4, 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</note> the Hiſtory doth expreſly mention in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it. Theſe Luminaries are in their created Nature ſeparating dividers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Light and the Darkneſs, and ſo are diſtinct beings from the Light as
well as from the Darkneſs: neither are they of an <hi>Elementarily-aethereal Claſſis,</hi>
but have a ſeparate diſtinct exiſtence from the Heavens, from the expanded.
They are not like ſtuds fixed in ſolid Spheres, externally moved by Intelligences
or Angels.<note n="a" place="margin">Coloſ. 2. 18.</note> They are not Deities, as the Heatheniſh Worſhippers by their
groſs Idolatry would make them. They are not fluid Orbs circularly perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
moving, but<note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 19. 1—6. Mal. 1. 11. Iſa. 59. 19.</note> they ſometimes come out and at other times they go in, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Creator's appointment for deſigned ends. They do not move
round about an Earthly Center, nor about an <hi>Axis</hi> of the World. I have ſhewn
before, that the middle of this Earth is not the common center of this viſible
World.</p>
            <p>They are not of Magnetical Verticity, which muſt be only Polar; and if this
were, would reduce them to their Polar reſt, which then alſo would contradict
a pretended perpetual motion. They are not carried about by the imaginary
Rapture of a firſt mover, as if they had a ſecond moveable of Renitency, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

future things, the Fate of men, impoſing a neceſſity upon Mens Wills, and

Reign above two thouſand four hundred years ago, or ſoon after, they write,
that they divided the Heavens into twelve ſpaces, called Signs, unto which the
Judiciary Aſtrologers did aſcribe certain vertues or powers over the ſeveral parts
of Man's body, and over the ſeveral Countries and Nations of the World, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by reaſon of the qualities they ſuppoſed to be in the fixed Stars, which
then did take up thoſe ſpaces. Their Rules are ſtill obſerved, though the Stars
are removed into the ſucceeding ſpaces. The fixed Stars they ſay do paſs
through an whole Sign, in two thouſand one hundred and eighteen years: from the
Creation then in about five thouſand ſix hundred years they have changed their
places and ſpaces, twice and one half at leaſt, which therefore muſt quite alter
their Rules. Aſtrologers do ſcarce look beyond the Zodiack for their Aſpects:
Whereas the Stars, which they miſcal fixed, may have as operative configurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with the Planets, as the Planets one with another. Aſtrologers do differ
much about the dividing of theſe Houſes: Thoſe Stars, Which, according to
<hi>Ptolemy</hi> (who wrote as they reckon, above one thouſand five hundred years
ago,) are in one houſe, and are ſaid to ſignifie thus, after <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> (who is
now moſt followed) are in another houſe for the ſame time and place, and ſo do
ſignifie otherwiſe. As for the <hi>Geuethliacal</hi> part, what ſound reaſon can there
be aſſigned why the Influences of the Stars ſhould make more impreſſion upon
the child in the moment of his Nativity, than they did at any time before in the
Womb? At the firſt conception matter is fluid, and apter to receive impreſſion,
then when the child is ſhaped and the temper more confirmed. There was an
old Aſtrologer who framed a Table to diſcover to a minute of Time when the
conception firſt began: But what man can certainly know that? There have
been thouſands of people of both Sexes of all Ages born in ſundry places, and
under ſundry configurations of the Stars who have periſhed and dyed in the
ſame hour and moment, by the ſame common calamity, as ſhipwrack, War, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,

They generally affirm it to be in the Head, and they conſtitute <hi>Mercury</hi> to be
the Influential Governour, having determining Dominion over the Head and
Brain, and ſo over Knowledge and Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Whereas, if it can be proved, to be in the Heart, as by ſcores of Scriptures, I
can argue it ſo to be, What then do become of all their miſtaken apprehenſions

all, and who doth in thoſe Heavens, and in this Earth whatſoever pleaſeth him,
is thus diſhonoured! When Chriſt was born, ſuch an Infant was born whoſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
or Generation is unutterable, on whom the Influences of the Stars have
no power or force; Who himſelf doth govern by his power the vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy

            <p>Becauſe, this Judiciary Aſtrology has ſuch a malign bewitching influence, on
many in the preſent day, and its Artiſts and profeſſors, and practicers have taken
up this plea for it, that the name of Aſtrologers and of Aſtrology is not found
any where in the holy Scriptures, and that, therefore its Science and Art is not
condemned by them: let me further examine, whether the thing at leaſt ſet out
by that Name, be not found condemned there; (although it be no ſuch
commendation for them, in that, they ſay, their Name is not found in
Scripture.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gnonenim</hi> and <hi>Megnonenim,</hi> ſay they, do not ſignifie Planetaries. Whereas if
the root be, <hi>Gnun,</hi> which both in the Scriptures and with the Rabbins doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note,
opportunity, or ſtated time, then <hi>Megnonen</hi> is ſuch a one, as doth profeſs
himſelf by Art to foreknow, and to be able to foretel to thoſe who do conſult
him, what thoſe conſtituted ſeaſons and definite times are, of good or of evil, of
joyful or of ſorrowfull; of proſperous, or of calamitous, event in every affair
and buſineſs that is undertaken, in ordering a man's life, in taking of a Journey,
in contracting of a Marriage, in ſending of an Embaſſy, in waging of a War,
and in the reſt of ſo many and ſuch various caſes, both publick and private
(which are wont to befal miſerable mortals:) Now ſeeing the Aſtrologer doth
boaſt (For, to this purpoſe they openly hang up their Tables at doors in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and privately put their Printed papers into the hands of ſome as they walk
in the ſtreats) that he can foreknow all theſe things by the motion and poſiture
of all the coeleſtial bodies, eſpecially of the Planets, from which he doth alſo
contend, that they are chiefly effected; how can any ingenious Lover of truth
deny with fairneſs and juſtneſs, but that <hi>Megnonen</hi> doth aptly ſet out an Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger,

Critick, doth call ſuch a one, an inchanter or charmer of the Heavens: as an

that he, can change the natures of terreſtial things, thinking that thereby he
can put new vertues into them, for the bringing forth of ſome ſtupendious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
apprehending that by certain Characters and Images excogitated by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and formed into this or that ſhape or Figure, ſome wonderful energy, ſome
notable power will follow thereupon; thus alſo the Aſtrologer, from a vain
tradition of curious Men and by new-deviſed, invented and ſained rules, ſuch
as have no proper cauſality, at all that way, he being deceived with the errour of
an opinion thinks and ſuppoſeth, that the heavenly bodies are endued with new
and unuſual properties, and not ſo congruous to their own nature; he attributes
to the coeleſtial Images, chiefly to the twelve Signs of the Zodiack Orb (all which
are the ſigments of Men's own brain) a wonderful efficacy for the diſtinct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
and prenunciating or foretelling of particular events So that, both the
Augures and the Aſtrologers are converſant and employed about the Heavens,
thoſe in the acrial Heaven, theſe in the Aethereal Heaven: and as thoſe by Fowls,
ſo theſe by Stars, abaſe thoſe creatures to bring about their own predictions: alſo
both of them do divide the Heavens into certain parts or ſegments, by the aid

that ſingular artifice of Aſtrologers, of making or ſetting in order a coeleſtial
figure, of ſetting or erecting a Scheme, which figure they would have to contain
the ſtate of Heaven and the Planets at that certain time, an Horoſcope, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the time of one's Nativity, or birth under this or that Planet.
Thus by theſe ſegments of the Heavens, which they divide, ſome into four quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

Aſtrologers do it by their black Art, and by the aid of Creatures, by which Art
the Heavenly Bodies are feigned to be indued with certain rare properties, ſuch

            <p>Another Epithet, or addition to an Aſtrologers name in this true Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah,</hi>

wont to divulge and publiſh their elaborate preſentions of future things, digeſted
into certain ſpaces of times, chiefly monthly: they think they have attained to
a prognoſtick skill in the power of the Stars to prenunciate futurities, ſuch as the
ſcarceneſs and dearneſs, or plenty and cheapneſs of Corn, Wars and Peace, the
death of Princes, and of other great Men, Univerſal Health, or Epidemical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
and ſuch like various caſes, both private and publick, that doth befal
the life of man with great uncertainty of contingency, as to us: From theſe
Monthly Pronoſticators do proceed ſo many popular Ephemerides, Calendaries,
and Almanacks, in which they undertake to be Interpreters of the Heavens, and
of the Luminaries there; and moſt of the buyers of theſe Books of impoſture,
do look upon the foretelling part, as the moſt deſireable part of their Almanack:
Some attempts have been made by ſome to correct, and to rectifie theſe abuſes
about computations of times, and predictions of futurities, to bring all to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural
Accounts and Propheſies, upon which ſo many other Truths and Duties
do depend, but the honour of perfecting of this, as well as of other ſuch good
work is like to be reſerved for another generation, the more grown in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

doth apprehend it to be more ancient from the Egyptians, who were famous for
Aſtrology: The Roman Senators and Nobles were ſo bewitched by theſe Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
devices, that they would ſcarce do a common action, without ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
conſulting their Ephemeris, about the Signs, Planets and Stars; and the
Chriſtian Emperours ran into the ſame guilt, who would not attempt any change
without firſt asking counſel of the Stars, in their publick and private affairs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting
to the luminary Tables of Aſtrologers.</p>
            <p>The Judiciary Aſtrology, or Divination by Stars hath ſo far extended its
prognoſticating black Art, as that it undertakes to determine, not only probably,
but alſo certainly, every man's Lot, Portion, Fortune (as they Paganiſhly ſpeak)
iſſues, events and ends; whereas, there are no true neceſſary cauſes of theſe to
be found in the Stars; ſo that, implicitely at leaſt the practitioners therein do
oblige themſelves to the Devil, and daringly fight againſt plain prohibions in
Scripture. How can they anſwer that expoſtulation of <hi>Jehovah</hi> with<note n="t" place="margin">Job 38. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Job?</hi>
knoweſt thou the Ordinances of Heaven? Canſt thou diſpoſe the Dominion
thereof in the Earth? Theſe Artiſts do not know the certain moment of a man's
Nativity at ſo great a diſtance of years, when they were not preſent at it: the
ariſing of the Signs has a Latitude, and a ſmall difference in time they themſelves
do acknowledge doth make a great difference, and ſome Aſtronomers do affirm,
that the ſame Aſpect of Stars hath ſcarce returned from the beginning of this
World: Aſtrologers are yet at an uncertainty among themſelves, how the Houſes
are to be divided, how far their influencing forces do reach, and what Signs they
ſhould uſe: How great a variety is there amongſt them about the diffance of
Planets between themſelves? with much more, that might be added; though
<hi>Gaffarellus</hi> hath feigned an Hebrew Alphabet in the Coeleſtial Figures, and that
the putting of Letters together, gives a certain meaning: Thus the Devil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth
them, to whom as to a Doctor and Interpreter, Judiciary Aſtrologers
do apply themſelves. This conſulting with ſuch Diviners is very pernicious,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55870:66"/>
both in reſpect of its Original, which is wicked, as alſo of the event, which
doth often torment and vex men before the time; for, if evil be foretold ſhall
befal a man, the fears of it do ſadden the ſpirit, and make him miſerable before
the evil actually come; and if it be ſome good that is promiſed, the fruſtrating,
vain, diſappointing, expectation thereof, doth ſo bind up their deceived imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it leaves them in a ſluggiſh diſtemper, and they do not make out after
better things; and however, what is ſo foretold, doth ſometimes come to paſs;
yet it ſhould be remembred, that often times they miſs: Divers by the perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacity
of their Nature, and by long experience may conjecture many things, which
they would have their diſciples to aſcribe to Stars, Planets and Signs: and the
force of imagination is ſuch, that thoſe who ask counſel of Aſtrologers, do
ſometimes fall into the evil they fear, and ſometimes attain the good they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue:
Sometimes the LORD in juſt judgement doth ſuffer Satan to inflict ſuch evils,
as he foretold ſhould come to paſs: Sometimes it is merely providential as to
God, and wholly conjectural as to men: Thus ſome young men feigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

brightneſs which our eyes do ſee. Even when Eclipſed ſhe is viſible to us in her
whole disk, which Aſtronomers do ſuppoſe not to be illuſtrated by the Sun.
Have any of theſe Philoſophers ſatisfactorily proved as yet, that the Eclipſe of
the Moon is indeed cauſed by the ſuppoſed ſhadow of the Earth, caſt upon ſome
part of the Moon, and ſtepping between the Sun and the Moon? For, beſides
that, ſuch a ſhadow at ſuch a great diſtance, according to their common placits
and traditioned ſuppoſitions, could not darken ſo great a part of the Moon, yea
the whole of the Moon, were the Moon of ſo great a bigneſs as they alſo affirm;
Darkneſs and ſhadow they ſay are no real things, but only abſence of Light, and
how can that obſcure a lightſome body, if darkneſs have no poſitivity or exiſtence
of it's own? All the darkneſs in the night cannot hinder a Ruſh-candle from
ſhining. Further, if ſuch a ſhadow were the cauſe, then why is not the whole
oppoſite Hemiſphere illuminated by the direct Rays of the Sun in the Night at
ſuch times, when the Moon doth not ſo ſhine? the Moon hath not all her
Light from the Sun according as that part of the Moon in its increaſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
which is neareſt the Sun is illuſtrated according to it's more or leſs oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
poſition. This they aſſign to be the cauſe, but if it were ſo, then that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
of the Moon, which doth cut the enlightned part of the Moon into two
equal parts muſt alſo in a right line paſs into the Diameter of the Sun. Which
is not ſo: As any diſcerning eye may obſervingly conclude by ocular demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If the Moon as they ſuppoſe, do move about fifty miles in a minute, how
then can ſome Eclipſes of the Moon laſt ſo long as they do, if it were cauſed
only by the ſhadow of the Earth? And how ſmall a proportion is that part of
the Hemiſphere which the body of the Moon doth take up when it is Eclipſed
at its firſt ariſing, if you compare it with the Compaſs, that it goes from her going
forth to her going in? The Eclipſe alſo of the Sun, they aſſert may be total to
ſome in ſome parts of the Earth by the Moon's being in conjunction and ſtepping
in between the Sun and the Earth: But how can this be, if as they ſay, the Sun
be one hundred ſixty and ſix times bigge<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Q. Whether that part of Natural Hiſtory, which doth concern Fowls,
Fiſhes, Beaſts, and Worms, can ever be completed into a Natural
Art in the way of Ethnick Philoſophy? or muſt we ſearch after it
only in the Word of Truth, where alone it can be advanced and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by a due and diligent comparing of their Created beings in
their proper Natures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw.</p>
            <p>THis Natural Hiſtory, and Natural Art above theſe living Creatures
can never attain to any conſiderable growing Augment, much leſs
to a through full diſcovery, in the way of Ethnick Philoſophy;
The reſtoring and finiſhing of this is no where elſe to be found but only in the
Holy Scriptures, by a due and diligent comparing of their created beings, in their
proper Natures. An art when it is diſcovered aright is but Nature opened. This
art muſt be natural, made up of Exiſtencies and of Realities according to the truth
of things, in the Being of theſe Creatures. That which is proper Art, is not
a Supplementary addition of ſomewhat to Nature, which was not Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the Law of the firſt Creation; For, that were to make a created man to
be a creating Artificer of what was never made before, which we all explode.
But it is a revealing, and a drawing forth of that ſecret which did lye hid in
Nature. The art of man may call out the wonderful productions of many
great effects, but ſtill theſe are wrought in the orderly courſe by Natural Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and by Created Efficiencies. The rareſt Artiſt can but co-operate with
Natures Powers, which doth their own work, only man puts them together,
or ſevers them aſunder, according as he would have ſome products by Motions
to be. However yet, the myſteries and wonders of Art muſt firſt be ſought
where they may be found, in the myſteries and wonders of Scripture, declaring
thoſe myſteries and wonders to be in Nature. Practice of Arts is a diſcloſing
of ſecrets of Nature in creation of Cauſes. Art doth ſometimes give a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to Nature, whereby ſhe doth bewray her ſelf ere ſhe is aware, and doth
expoſe her ſelf to view in the light in ſome of her agen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies which kept cloſe in

this out.<note n="k" place="margin">Melaacah. Aaman. Touſhijah.</note> That word which doth ſignifie Art, exerciſing it ſelf induſtriouſly

Officer, one imployed in ſuch a Function, as is put upon him by creating <hi>Aelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him;</hi>
and that Function muſt always be ſought for in the Word, as revealed
there: and another word which doth denote one excelling in Art, nouriſhing of
it, and being nouriſhed by it, doth ſpring from a word which doth include
Faith and Truth. And where can thoſe firmly bottom but upon the Word of
Truth, and the Word of Faith? And the ſame Word which doth ſignifie

Law in his Word. This doth teach ſubſtantial knowledge, and doth
give eſſential Science, and doth skill in the Art of Realities. There are ſeveral
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55870:69"/>
Writers who have undertaken to give us an accouut of theſe Creatures, in their
Elaborate Hiſtories of them; one of the largeſt and learnedeſt upon Animals has
this great errour running through much of his Book, that though he refers much
of this diſcovery to the Scripture, yet he would have Original Hebrew, which
is the Mother Tongue, to go to School, and to learn to ſpeak of Daughter-Languages,
ſuch as the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> the <hi>Syriack,</hi> and the other Oriental Tongues:
<hi>As</hi> if the proper ſignificancy of her words could not be rightly underſtood, but
by their Senſe, and Etymologies, and Phraſiologies, whereby he carries the
Reader off from the Word of God (which yet he doth undertake to tranſlate,
interpret and apply) unto the Authorities and Hiſtories of Philoſophizing men,
and the Opinions and Cuſtoms of Nations; that from theſe, and not ſo much
from that, we might fetch our knowledge of theſe Creatures. A cognation of
other Languages to, and a collating of them with the Original Hebrew, hath
its great uſe, and may be put to a more growing and profitable improvement;
only ſpecial heed muſt be taken, that they be all drawn to ſide with the Hebrew,
but not to put the Hebrew violently by force to be of their party againſt its own
natural meaning. In whatſoever Author you meet this diſconſonancy to the
Scriptures, that would bring an alien ſenſe to the Scriptures, and doth not receive
a genuine meaning from the Scriptures, look upon it as one great cauſe of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
theſe appoſitions and additaments from men are detractions and ſubſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the Word. Let the Learned, in all their ſtudious artificial Expatiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and liberal ſcientifick walks in theſe Fields of Nature, gather and bring
in as much of choice created Excellencies as they can, whereby to contribute to
the augment, of this <hi>Art,</hi> and the perfecting of this Science; only let this be
learn'd by reading in Scriptures Book, and in Natures School. For the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

Ethnick Philoſophy, that of nothing it is impoſſible any thing ſhould come, as if
therefore there were a neceſſity of fore-exiſtent matter to work upon, becauſe the
ordinary courſe of Nature is now ſo, doth diſcover in the aſſertors thereof their
ignorance of the Scriptures. For although out of abſolute Nothing, Nothing
can be extracted, converted, or made to be, yet that doth not neceſſarily infer
that therefore there muſt be a firſt Matter, and a Potency thereof to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Principle of all material things; for Almighty Power can create that unto
a Being, which had no Being before. That Ethnick Rationaliſt who maintained

was it not altogether as eaſie to Omnipotency, and more glorious to all Wiſdom,
at the firſt to create the ſeveral kinds of all Created Beings, diſtinct and perfect,
than to frame and to form them afterward of matter made before hand? is it not
againſt the dictates of Natural Reaſon and Light, that ſuch a pretended firſt
Matter ſhould ſubſiſt ſeparate by it ſelf, and there reſt a while under ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and general Form, yet ſo as withal to have in it ſuch a multitude of ſpecifical
Forms of Natural Beings, and after-created Eſſences, of all future Bodies, not
diſtinct, but in a confuſed lump, and mingled heap, all jumbled together one
with another? God is not the author of confuſion: and how can a rational In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
underſtand that any one common Form could make ſpecifically diſtinct
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55870:69"/>
Forms out of ſuch a fancied firſt matter of corporal things? The internal Forms
of created Beings is that primitive force and original Nature, which <hi>Aelohim</hi>
did ſpeak into, and faſten in the ſeveral kinds of created Beings on the ſeveral
days of the firſt Weak, according to the particular Eſſence and ſpecifick Being,
and different condition of every thing, whereby they are ſome ways diſpoſed
and fitted, ſtrengthned and enabled, to put forth their proper vertues, and
their ſpecial operations, by the exerciſe of which natural powers, they were
orderly to move towards the right end in ſubſerviency under and conformity,
to the will of their Maker, which was their goodneſs and their perfection. The
Creatures could not cauſe themſelves to be from Not-being; neither was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Generation the firſt Original of theſe Creatures, but Creation, or creating
Cauſality, or primitive and proper Creation: Neither were their created Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentialities
latent in a firſt Chaos, produced into their Actualities on the ſix
days, but all and every of the Creatures were immediate diſtinct Works of <hi>Aelohim</hi>'s
Power. He created in every one of the ſix days. Any created Original or
primary Womb, out of which other Creatures were extracted; or the material
ſtuff whereof all things were framed, which one Ethnick Philoſopher calleth the
firſt Matter, as the Potential Principle of all: Another names it <hi>Hyle,</hi> a darkneſs
ſomewhat inviſible and without Form: A third intitles it, a fearful Shadow;
A fourth makes it a ſymbolical Unity; A fifth doth ſtile it a deformed Chaos, or
univerſal troubled Maſs, without form or ſhape: Theſe and ſuch like fancied
Images of Humane Invention have no firm footing in Scripture. All and every
of the Works of the foregoing ſix days of the Week are proper Creatures, each
of them were new Creatures of diſtinct Eſſence or Entities: There were no
former <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or appearance of them. Had there been any ſuch one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Body of Matter, or Corps of the World, and an univerſal created ſpirit,
as the ſoul of the World; then all had been perfected in one day, both the
whole Body, and the whole Spirit of the Univerſal World of Creatures; and
all this had been one <hi>Individuum,</hi> Phyſically, Really, Naturally. Not only was
the firſt Creation in one day by the ſupernatural Power of <hi>Aelohim,</hi> as if the
after productions were by the Power of inſtituted Nature, or application of
Art: But alſo, all the Created Beings on the ſecond, third, fourth, fifth and
ſixth days; which were then Eſſences, when they were Exiſtences, and not Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences
in Potentiality on the one day, and Exiſtences in Actuality on the other
days, as if only productions out of a former Eſſence. (If the Reader do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

he readily know whither to go for the finding out of thoſe citations or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribings,

did not need as men do, Stuff or matter to work upon, not Tools or other
Inſtruments, neither uſed he the aid or help of any aſſiſtant. It is by Faith that
we come to have right apprehenſions of this; it is not wrought and attained by
the ſtrength of our natural reaſon, but it doth ſhine in upon the mind from
that credibility which is in, and from that credence, which is given to the Word
of God, and from the holy Spirits perſwading of the heart that this word is the
Truth: Thus were all manner of Creatures fully and perfectly finiſhed without
any want, defect, or imperfection in them, ſo far as concerned that ſtate and
condition the Creator made them in: The Author or Efficient was <hi>Jehovah Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lohim;</hi>
the means of creating them was by the word of his Power, whereby he
manifeſted his Mind and Will: Though all theſe were created and made, yet
not out of any thing that did or could appear; there was no pre-exiſtent matter
whereof they were made. The Eſſences and formalities of all Vegetative and
Senſitive Natures, are not only matter and motion: <hi>Aelohim</hi> gave primitive
Natures, and different Beings to his ſeveral Creatures. Univerſal Nature is
both an empty name, and an atheiſtical conceit. If only matter were created
in the firſt inſtance of Time, as is pretended and pleaded, how could this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diverſifie it ſelf in the Beginning into Heaven and Earth? For local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being from one place to another, which are ſeveral diſtant Terms, muſt
neceſſarily be in ſeveral inſtants of Time; if ſeveral Local Motions were the
Formalities, or formal beginnings of all Spirits and ſpiritual Qualities, then they
ſhould not be before, nor after, nor any longer than that Local Motion doth
continue. For the Formality of any thing is the very Specifick Being thereof,
and nothing can be without the Specifical Being of its ſelf, otherwiſe it ſhould
not be what it is, or be what it is not. It was<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 1. 2. Pſal. 33. 6. Job 26. 13.</note> the Spirit of <hi>Aelohim,</hi> and not
the firſt Matter, that moved more eſpecially upon the waters. Created Beings
may and actually do exiſt without any actual Local Motion; and therefore they
muſt neceſſarily, really be different from it. The Beginning of all things was
not Water; as one Ethnick Philoſopher miſ judged: neither was infinite Air
the firſt cauſe or original of every exiſtence, as another affirmed: neither was
this pretended Catholick Air, God, as a third eſteemed: neither did all things
take their beginning from Fire and Light, as a fourth would have it, nor as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
ſays, that there is one Univerſal Fire in and over all things in this World:
neither is the beginning of all things the ſubſtance of the Fire by the Air con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into Water, as was the opinion of one: neither are there ſuch Radical
Principles of all things, whereof two are Agents, and two Patients, as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
the Elements, which was the imagination of another. Creating <hi>AElohim</hi>
was before any created Beings;<note n="ſ" place="margin">Act. 17. 24. Gen. 2. 1, 4. Heb. 21. 3. Rom. 1. 20. 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6.</note> He alone was the Creator: All things were
made eſſentially, ſolely, immediately by him, there was no help of ſecondary
cauſes. They had their Original and Being from him; and they have ſtill their
dependence upon him: and therefore is<note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 1. <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> and Ch. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>AElohim</hi> in this ſhort, yet complete
Hiſtory of the Creation expreſly named above thirty times in the ſeven days of

Prerogative of <hi>Jehovah AEtohim.</hi> If created Beings, and their ſubſtantial Spirits,

other, or any way whatſoever ſhould be not only an inſtrumental cauſality or
effect of theſe Bodies, and their Qualities; but alſo the very Eſſence and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
as hath been ſaid, or formal cauſe of them. Whereas, all created Beings
are formal every one of them, ſuch as they were ſeverally created in their different
kinds, and as they are naturally diſtinguiſhed from other Creatures in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in their own proper Being. The Creatures may, and ſeveral of them do
exiſt, and they are ſuch as they are created, without any actual Motion, being

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55870:70"/>
defend it by this place of Scripture. I have on the work of the one day ſhewn
the meaning of thoſe words and things. The four Elements, as ſome name
them, called the ſimple Bodies; were not fetch'd, one contrary out of another,
as out of former Matter, as neither Light out of Darkneſs, nor the Firmament
out of Emptineſs, nor dry Earth out of Waters. Neither were the compound
Bodies out of the ſame Elements, nor for the moſt part of all, four unequally
mingled together. Not every one principally out of the ſame Element, which
they garniſh or inhabit: As not Herbs and Trees out of the Earth: Not the
Sun, Moon and Stars, wholly or ſpecially out of the Expanſe: Not Fiſhes out
of the Waters, not Birds out of the Air, not Beaſts out of the Earth; all and
every of the created Beings are of diſtinct Natures, and of ſeveral kinds. We muſt
put a difference between the firſt Creation, and the after propagation. Thoſe four
great Bodies, Aether, Air, Earth and Water, are ſtill locally and eſſentially ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
one from another, and do exiſt Pure: They each of them have their proper
Bodies of Matter, their peculiar ſubſiſtences, pure and unmix'd in the beginning
of the Creation. The ſeveral Creatures were created an Whole and Entire ſeveral
Subſtance and Quality, Matter and Form, as they call them, all and every of
them on the ſeveral days of their being created; at leaſt this is very well worthy
of a more through inquiry and deeper diſquiſition than hitherto hath been made:

breath in and out, though Ethnick Philoſophy do contradict. For, Fiſhes are
ſome of the Reptils, which have a living Soul, a vital Spirit, breathing to and
fro. The ſwimming of Fiſhes is one kind of creeping and ſliding. So an Eel
ſwims in the Water, as a Snake doth creep on the Land. And though other
Fiſhes in ſwimming do ſhoot forth more directly, and do not altogether make ſuch
crooked in and out lines, yet they only ſlide in a ſtreighter manner, having bodies
of a direct and oblong Figure fitted for that purpoſe, being born up, and partly
carried by an Equidans fulciment of tranſpaſſable Waters, through which they

Reptils. They were neither of the ſame make with Fiſhes, neither were Fiſhes
created of Water, nor Fowls of Earth; but immediately of the adored Almighties,
ſeverally put into their proper natural places; the Fiſhes into ſwimming in the
Sea, the Fowls into the Air over the Earth, flying there. Some flying Fowls
do more delight in watery places; others of them are more for Earth, as the
place of their choice; ſome others are Terraqueous, being well pleaſed both
with Earth and Water, as a place either of them proper, and fit enough for
them: So that, this doth but ſet out their places, not the firſt Matter of their
being, and how it would be in their after production, diſtinguiſhed into Land-fowls,
Sea-fowls, and Sea land-fowls, Amphibious Ones, ſuch as do live and
generate in both. The Creator doth aſſign his Creatures their proper localities
and places of abode, as before he had put the Luminaries in the Heavens and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe;
ſo here the Fiſhes to the Waters, the Fowls to the Air, and ſo afterwards
other Creatures to the Earth. The appointed places of Habitation, of Motion,
and of Working, are proper and natural, and the Bodies of created Beings have
a ſuitable conformity fitting them for their ſeveral abode. The Creator firſt
finiſhed the Theatre or Habitacle of the World, and then Creates the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
thereof, and puts them into their ſeveral dwellings and manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

This World was not from all Eternity; for it had a beginning in Time. One
part of the Created World was after another part of it, by temporary ſucceſſion of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55870:71"/>
nights, and of days in a moſt direct line by eſtabliſhed Order, and immutable
Law. The firſt beginning of Time, was not the moment or meaſure of the
firſt Heavenly Motion. They are miſtakes, the ſuppoſal of the firſt moveable
Heaven, or compaſſing Sphere that doth wheel about all the other pretended
Spheres; and that this firſt Mover was firſt created; which have no foundation
in Scripture, but are the feigned inventions of men high in their own eyes, and
fond of their own conceits. The firſt moment of the firſt created Evening, was
the beginning of Time, as to the created World, when the Darkneſs was firſt
made to begin. Time is not the meaſure of duration, according to a pretended
Motion of the Heavenly Luminous Bodies, for three ſeveral days were paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Creation of theſe. Time, Place and Number, are of the Nature of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things that may be, or may not be, but are neceſſarily things in their
ſeveral circumſtances. Theſe were concreated, and did actually exiſt with
other created beings in the beginning, and without which no created Entity
whatſoever can actually exiſt. There was in the one day of the World ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Duration, every Creature that was made on that day was durable tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
made and exiſted in time: There was conſiſtent extenſion, one part beyond
another, there where another part was not. All the created Beings of that day
exiſt in ſome places. They were where they were made, and no where elſe at
that ſame time, and ſeveral Creatures were in ſeveral places, then and afterwards:
There was then diſcrete numbring; for every created Being, whatſoever it be,
muſt always be numerable. The ſeveral diſtinct days alſo, in which the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were made, are diſtinct in Numeration. Thus for Family or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip,
once every day is not enough, but twice a day is neceſſary, <hi>Aelohim</hi>
having inſtituted the Evening and Morning Seaſons, and not leſt this to our
liberty or appointment. There is an aptitude in Nature for theſe; fitting the
time to the Work. Thus for more publick Church-aſſemblies, once in a
Month, or Quarter, or Year, is not enough, it muſt be weekly on the ſeventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Sabbath;
for ſo is the Doctrine of Weeks in the firſt Creation. Thoſe who
are ingaged in the Controverſie about Non-conformity unto<note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 15. 9, 13. Mar. 7. 1—13. Tit. 1. 14.</note> national Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or eſtabliſhments in the matters of publick Worſhip, ſuch as is of Humane
Invention, Inſtitution and Impoſition, eſpecially when excluſive of all other
Worſhip that is according to the Word-Warrant, and Scripture-Inſtitution, have
greatly wronged and hurt their own cauſe, by their conceſſions and aſſertions,
that the Civil Magiſtrate has the Power in the Nation to appoint humanely-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
Modes of Worſhip, what forms to uſe. The number in Worſhip, how
often it ſhall be, what holy days as they call them, and how many of them in
an year; the time of worſhip, when his will and pleaſure is; and the place of
worſhip, where he will aſſign. As if theſe were Adiaphorous matters, left
wholly to our Governours prudential conſideration and determination, which
all ſubjects muſt comply with, and conform to, that there may be, as they ſay,
Order, Unity and Peace in the Church, by a national uniformity in theſe things:
For, under a colour of this, all the Chriſtian Religion almoſt is degenerated
into indifferents, and thoſe who are moſt and beſt Chriſtians, moſt ſpiritual and
heavenly in worſhip, according to the Laws and Inſtitutions of Chriſt's houſe,
and who have their converſation moſt adorning and becoming the Goſpel, are
moſt hated and oppoſed; this being the ground of perſecution in all ages, but
more towards the latter days, as the ſervants of, and witneſſes for Chriſt, do
bring in and finiſh their Teſtimony againſt all<note n="e" place="margin">Revel. 42. laſt.</note> Antichriſtian, and Anti-Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural
Uſurpations, not in any tumultuous way of rebellious inſurrection, but
by a patient ſuffering, and quiet bearing. All things whatſoever in the matters
of Worſhip are determined by the LORD, and mens prudence doth conſiſt in
this, not in preſcribing to their fellow Creatures, Time, Place and Number,
but in finding out, and in obſerving, what of every one of theſe the Soveraign

and the only Lawgivers own Commentary, judging of all caſes according to
this, whereby either to approve, acquit, and juſtifie what is an holy conformity
to it, or to reprove and condemn whatſoever is a tranſgreſſion of it! and that
the Judicial Laws, which are perfectly exact, holy, juſt and good, might be

where the crawling tredders with lift-up-creeping feet are placed, are ſaid to
have movingly brought forth in great abundance to their ſhaped conditions of
diſtinguiſhed kinds; <hi>Aelohim</hi>'s Decree and Purpoſe in his own Mind and Will,
and his Promiſe and Bleſſing in his Word, reſolved and covenanted, that ſo it
ſhould be. Scripture Hiſtory hath this beſides many other Prerogatives over
Humane Stories, that the Record and Narrative may be before, as well as after
the matter of Fact: From whence I would commend it to the conſideration of
the learned in the Hebrew, and of the skilful in the Scriptures, whether<note n="o" place="margin">Vau.</note> that
copulative particle, which doth ſignifie, and ſhould not every where, in the

judgeth to be the true proper genuine meaning of thoſe words in themſelves,

He will actually ſay (by declared foretelling, and expreſs appointing) it ſhall
be truly ſubſiſting the Light; <hi>Aelohim</hi>'s ſaying is doing, his word is a work,
his ſpeaking is his acting: It doth denote his efficacious Decree concerning his
Creatures, and the execution of that Decree expreſſed by ſpeaking of ſuitable
words. Thus the appellation of the<note n="q" place="margin">Gen.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5, 8, 10.</note> Names put upon the Creatures by their
Creator, do note this Decree and Conſtitution, that ſo they ſhould be called
by men. Thus alſo his Benediction of his Creatures is a real Procreation, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication
of them in their proper kinds. It makes it alſo further conſpicuous,
that<note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 107. 20. &amp; 147 15, 18. Heb. 1. 3. Joh. 5. 17.</note> his Word of Power, and of Promiſe, is that which doth ſtill conſerve
his Creatures, as it did create them. This is one great Reaſon why,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Joh. 1. 1, 2, 3, 10, 14. 18.</note> the Word,
is one of Chriſt's Names, becauſe the manifeſtation of his Fathers decreeing and
ſpeaking about Creation and Redemption is made out ſignificantly, and held
forth expreſly by Chriſt. When <hi>David</hi> ſaith in<note n="t" place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 21. <hi>Compared with</hi> 1 Chron. 17 9.</note> one place, <hi>For thy words ſake,</hi>

of the Act in the ſucceſſive courſes of the Light, and this is a way of
his fulfilling of that firſt Promiſe of his; and believers ſhould enjoy it as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
Mercy; when ever our eyes do behold the Light, we may ſee there are
more ſubſtances, and fewer accidents (as they name them) than Ethnick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
do own: What was the firſt created Light according to their own
deſcriptions? Was it not an Entity of Nature? Did it not truly ſubſiſt? Doth
not the<note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note> Scripture affirm this? Did it not ſubſiſt in it ſelf? VVhat ſubſtance
did this Light naturally flow from, or originally ſubſiſt in? Did it ſpring from
Heaven, or from Earth, or from VVaters? Or from the gulphy ſpace, or dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
place? The Expanſe was not created till the Seventh-day: As for the Air,
neither was that extended, expanded, or made ſo diaphanous, or created on the
one day: And as for the Heavenly Luminaries they had not a Being till the
fourth day: If you imagine it to be inherent in the higheſt Heavens, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
thence; why then is not the Light always ſent forth, to make it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
day? What ſubſtance was the Light adventitious to, in its firſt being
created? Was not the ſpecificial Eſſence thereof in it ſelf? What other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
did the Light affect or perfect? Was not the Light an actual Entity, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically
differing from all other created Beings, in the Time and Nature of it?
This Light is a ſtated, ſolid, ſubſtantial Entity, always actual ſince its firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without continual ſenſible variations: The Light has corporeal quantity
of extenſion, and corporeal Motion in coming and in going. What was that
pretended lucid Body, in which this Light is ſuppoſed to be inherent, to which
to adhere, and in which as in a Subject to be? It is an eſſential and ſubſtantial
Creature, in its own Nature and Being, which <hi>Aelohim</hi> gave unto it. The
Light was not gathered into the Sun, not placed in the body of the Sun, not
affixed unto the Sun, not ſent into, and inſerted in it after its Being diffuſed
and ſhed abroad, not bound to any certain body. the Light doth caſt no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
becauſe it doth ſurround Bodies, whereas the Sun doth caſt ſhadows,
becauſe its ſhining is in direct Beams. It is a real thing, and not only a notion:
all and every of the created Beings are truly ſubſiſting Entities. This created
Light was not Chriſt: though in another ſenſe Chriſt is called Light. For
ſomewhat was created before the Light, as the Heavens, the Earth, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the empty ſpace, the doleful place and darkneſs; whereas Chriſt is the
<note n="z" place="margin">Rev. 3. 14. Prov. 8. 22, 31. Coloſſ. 1. 15, 16.</note> beginning of the Works of <hi>Aelohim,</hi> he was before all created Beings. For
a cloſe of this fifth days VVork, I apprehend the creating of the Beaſts and
VVorms to appertain to the fifth day for ſeveral weighty Reaſons agreeing
with the VVord. All thoſe Creature are here put together. Such as have a
ſenſitive Soul and Life: So nobly formed a Creatures as Man, who was to have
the Royal<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1. 24. 25—2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Religious Rational Soul and Life, he had the honour of a diſtinct day, the ſixth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55870:72"/>
day, for his Creation, apart from other Creatures. The cauſe why it is ſaid
twice, that <hi>Aelohim</hi> will foreſeeingly look on becauſe good, what he created
on the fifth day, may be this: there doth appear ſome need of ſuch a ſubdiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe there were two ſuch divers kinds of Creatures made on that day:
Some in the place of the Waters, the other in the place of the red Earth, the
goodneſs of both, and of each of which, doth the more clearly ſhine forth, and
is the better underſtood by this Spiritual Narration of doubling the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
There is a ſpecial Bleſſing given to Religious, Rational <hi>Adam,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from Bruit Animals. Obſerve well alſo this further Reaſon, here is a
diſtinct Creature from tame Animals, and wild Beaſts particularly mentioned,
the creeping one,<note n="b" place="margin">Remes, Gen. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 24, 35.</note> the Reptil; a word which was mentioned before in the
<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 1. 21. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romeſeth.</note> Participle concerning the Fiſhes, and therefore this kind of Creature muſt be
created on the ſame day of the week, on which the Fiſhes its Fellow-creepers,
were; and ſo alſo the other mentioned here, as the tame Animal, and the wild
Beaſt: Thus alſo I judge, that the gathering together of the lower Waters
from other places, with expecting deſire into the Seas, as its appointed place,
did belong to the Creation-work of the ſecond day: becauſe to every one of
the ſix days of this one week of the Creation this is expreſly aſcribed, that
<hi>Aelohim</hi> will foreſeeingly look on, becauſe good; whereas, if this be carried on
to the third day, then the ſecond day will be left without this approving Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
from its Creator. Further they are much a part of the ſame ſubject-matter,
ſpoken of in the ſecond days Work, which was, that theſe Waters
below might have a diſtinct place, from thoſe Waters above by an out-ſpread
partition between them. They were both of them Waters. This Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ſevering of the Waters was begun upon the ſecond day, and there fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
on the ſecond day. For, as a wiſe good Worker, <hi>Aelohim</hi> reſerves the
approbation till he had perfected that Work, and put it in its proper place, ſo
diſcharged, as it were, his hands of it, as to what concerned the Creation of it,
though as to its continued preſervation, it be ſtill in his manutenancy. How
large and complete an Hiſtory of the Fiſhes, of Fowls, of Beaſts, and of VVorms,
might there be compoſed and compiled for the perfecting of this Art, and
the poliſhing of the Science of Senſitive Soulineſs, if all thoſe VVords and Phraſes
were orderly put together, that do treat of this ſubject matter in the Scriptures
of Truth!</p>

the Scriptures of Truth, and the holy Spirits inſtructing in and by theſe.
Man! what is this man, that the Creator has ſo crowned him with ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
an Honour! Man, how noble is his make! Man is the Articulate Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Creators Praiſes, the lingual Glory of the VVorld, ſounding forth
the ſhining excellencies of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> in his glorious ſelf, in his good
VVord, and in his great VVorks! How uſeful a Knowledge is this, the true
Knowledge of our ſelves! VVhat profit would it be to me, and to the Reader,
though we underſtood all other Myſteries, and all other Knowledges, if thou and
I were ignorant of our ſelves! How Royal Prerogatives hath the LORD digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Man withal! Unto how high a pitch hath he raiſed the ultim ſummities of
the Humane Nature in all its created Perfections of Spirit, of Soul, and of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy!
How full of admirable VVonders is this! How rare its accompliſhments!
How vertuous its Powers, both in the inner and outer Man! How myſterious
are the Communications of the ſeveral parts in Man to each other! How ſecret
their Operations upon each other! How fearfully, how marvellouſly was this
Man made!<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Aelohim</hi> did attribute the ſpecial making of Man immediately, and
expreſly to himſelf, to ſet out the dignity and excellency of Man, and to aſſert
the Truth, Reality and Certainty, of the Hiſtory of <hi>Adam,</hi> againſt thoſe who
dreamingly fancy other Origins of the VVorld. Man was not from Eternity,
but was made in Time. Man was not compounded at his firſt Creation of the
four pre-exiſtent Elements of VVater, Earth, Air and Fire, as ſome affirm, nor
of Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, as others aſſert; but is a diſtinct Creature of a
quite different kind, from other of his fellow Creatures, particularly from Beaſts:
So that, we may not with ſome credulous admirers of Bruits to the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our ſelves, and the reproach of all Humane Nature, adopt Bruits into
the Family of Mankind, and as one doth expreſs it, claim kindred of Apes, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boons,
Marmoſets, Drils, Beſtial Fauns and Satyrs, as if they were but one
degree removed from our ſelves. <hi>Aelohim</hi> did not conſult with other Creatures
about the Make of Man; neither were Angels co-workers with him in this.
That, he created <hi>Adam</hi> a Man, and not a Beaſt, was merely the Grace and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
of the Creator: It was not the VVork of Nature, nor the influencing
Operation of the Stars. Man's Induſtry and Art contributed nothing towards
the creating of the VVorld; For, Man had his being one of the laſt of all the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55870:73"/>
Creatures. How exactly was this man made at the firſt?<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 1. 26. 27.</note> according to the
Primitive Pattern, Exemplar, Type and Model, coming very near unto it! In
<hi>Adam</hi> man may acknowledge, that ſelf ſame Archetype, unto whoſe Effigies,
or Shape, or Figure, or Likeneſs, or Faſhion, he was made. This doth more
denote the quality of reſemblance, which did follow upon the former por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture,
reſemblance, formed ſhape, or expreſſed repreſentation. How glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
how comly, how uniform, was that appearance of Majeſty, which did
ſhine forth in <hi>Adams</hi> inner and outer Man, wherein he differs from the lower
Creatures, and is made like unto his Maker,<note n="g" place="margin">Phil 2. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

in Righteouſnes! Man is called the Image of <hi>Aelohim,</hi> becauſe he is like to <hi>Aelohim:</hi>
and he is like <hi>Aelohim,</hi> becauſe he was efformed in creation to <hi>Aelohim</hi>'s
likeneſs, as to his Nature, Rectitude and State; the Image of <hi>Aelohim</hi> doth
carry with it the very likeneſs to him.<note n="h" place="margin">Tzelem, &amp; Demouth, Gen. 1. 26, 27.</note> There are two words, which as to
their grammatical diſtinction do ſpring from two diſtinct Roots: Otherwiſe

Grace, no leſs than likeneſs: As likeneſs is alſo to Nature. To reconcile all differences
about this, I judge, that theſe two words do ſet out the exact proportionable
reſemblance of created <hi>Adam</hi> unto Creating <hi>Aelohim</hi> in Chriſt, both in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
make, and outward ſhape, in the whole Man, as Chriſt did often appear
of old in the Old Teſtament, as a Man to aſpire and confirm his peoples Faith,
that in the appointed time he would take to his Godhead the Nature of Man
by a wonderful Incarnation, born of a Virgin, and be God manifeſt in the Fleſh.
It is one of the moſt alike Images that is, coming the neareſt of any to the
Prototype. So that here is no Pleonaſm or Tautology, but a comprehenſive
ſignificancy, and a full ſenſe, expreſſed in two words. Man in his Spirit,
Soul and Body, in his whole <hi>ſuppoſitum,</hi> the intire Man is every way like his
Maker, ſo far as Man's created Capacities were. For there is ſomewhat in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah
Aelohim,</hi> which is incommunicable to mere Man, as particularly infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſelf exiſtency, unchangeableneſs of holy Nature: which laſt, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
may paſs under further diſquiſition, whether unchangeableneſs of holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be not one part of Holineſs comprehended in the perfect Law of the ten
Words, which <hi>Adam</hi> in his Uprightneſs, and the bleſſed Angels in their Purity,
being but mere Creatures, were not capable of? If ſo, then whether this would
not diſcover the need and uſe, that even the Elect Angels themſelves have of
Chriſt (though they do not ſo need him, as now fallen, ſinning, ſinful man doth
need him)? in regard, that although they have an unchangeableneſs of State,
yet not of Nature: For, ſome of their fellows do fall by tranſgreſſion: and the
ſtanding, and the ſafety of thoſe of them, who remain in the Primitive Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and Happineſs, is not their perfection in Grace, but their relation unto
Chriſt their Head. And the ſame will hold true alſo with reſpect to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Saints in Heaven, Elect Men and Women; their continued felicity will
not be ſolely in themſelves, even when they paſs into an unſinning State, a State
of complete Purity and Bliſs; but, as they are living Members of the Myſtical
Body of Chriſt. There is ſomewhat peculiar in this Image, wherein man is
like unto his creating Mediator, ſo as other Creatures are not. Though man
were created in the Image, according to the likeneſs of <hi>Aelohim</hi> in Chriſt, yet
is not mere man to be adored, or to be worſhipped; <hi>Aelohim</hi> himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
hath<note n="k" place="margin">Deut. 6. 13. &amp; 10. 20. Matth. 4. 10. Luk. 4. 8. <hi>comparod.</hi>
               </note> adorability properly belonging to him. The Woman as well as the
Man did ſhare in this holy happy Image and likeneſs. The Name,<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 1. 27. Mar. 16, 15. Col. 1. 23.</note> Creature,
is more eſpecially given to <hi>Adam,</hi> as one of the moſt excelling of Creatures,
becauſe of this reſemblance:<note n="m" place="margin">Ha. Gen. 1. 27. &amp; 2. 11.</note> The notificative Particle is ſometimes put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a proper name. As here in this part of the Hiſtory of the Creation, and
elſewhere, contrary to the common Grammar Rule compoſed by men: Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
ſhould be fitted to Scripture, and not Scripture ſuited to Grammar. The
different Sexes, Male and Female, Man and Woman were created at the firſt in
the Humane Nature by <hi>Aelohim.</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 2. 21, 22.</note> That after Hiſtory of the Womans being
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55870:74"/>
taken from the ſide of Man, and given unto him in Marriage by Chriſt, ſhould
alſo be further inquired into, whether it were not diſtinct and different, both in
Nature and in Time, from the firſt Creation of the Man, and of the Woman?
The Woman was of diſtinct Creation by <hi>Aelohim</hi> as well as the Man; and when
the<note n="o" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 13.</note> Man was created, for this is not by Anticipation; both of them were
made, not out of any pre-exiſtent matter, though in Chriſt Jeſus<note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 3. 28.</note> there be not
Male and Female: but they are eſteemed both one in him, in the matters of
Juſtification, Sanctification, Acceptation and Redemption, the one ſharing in
theſe benefits as well as the other. The Man and the Woman were created ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
diſtinct perſons. We have read, that he who made them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

one Husband in the ſingular number. A fair occaſion being here miniſtred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, I ſhall plead the cauſe of holy Marriage, which is the lawful conjunction
of man and woman into one fleſh, againſt the practiſers and defenders of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy,
and of Divorces: Digamy is the having of two Wives, or of two Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
at one and the ſame time, Polygamy is the having of more Wives, or
of more Husbands than one at once: that, both theſe are unlawful, I ſhall prove
from the Scripture, out of the Book of <hi>Moſes,</hi> out of the Book of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
out of Chriſt's recorded ſayings, and out of the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
            <p>The Scripture Record has<note n="t" place="margin">Gen. 2. 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> very early given us an account of the firſt Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of holy Marriage, which doth by divers weighty Arguments cloſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
Polygamy: For <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> did bring and joyn together but one
<hi>Adam</hi> and one <hi>Eve</hi> into, and in this honourable Eſtate of Marriage; ſo the LORD
Chriſt himſelf doth interpret<note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 19. 4, 5, 6.</note> this, he who made them from the beginning,
made them (one) Male and (one) Female: What was of old ſaid, they, that is,
this <hi>Adam,</hi> and this <hi>Eve,</hi> ſhall be in one fleſh, has an explication added unto it
by Chriſt, they two ſhall be into one fleſh; they are no more two but one fleſh;
that expreſſion in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> they both, or they two, were naked, Chriſt doth
refer to the foregoing ſentence, and they two into one fleſh; and that it might
have the greater emphaſis, or expreſs ſignification of his earneſt intention, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

For, of ſuch doth this Scripture here ſpeak, ſuch a one, a Man is prohibited
to take, who is already the Husband of another Woman, and this other is ſtill

Woman whatſoever, who in a large ſenſe is ſome ways a Siſter, but eſpecially if

the taking and the having of more Wives, than one at once, the reaſon here an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed

the prohibition, doth ſhew; ſeeing, evidently from the Nature of it in it ſelf in

vexing to the Wives, when one thinks, that ſhe has too little, and the other too
much of the Husband; a vexing to them, if the one be fruitful and the other
barren, the fruitful Woman will be prone to deſpiſe the barren; the barren is
under temptation to envy the fruitful, if they be both fruitful, a vexing will
follow about their children; one of their Wives will imagine, that the Children
of the other Wife are better cared and provided for than hers are; the ſteward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Family-affairs will paſs into vexing, when one of them will be more Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
than the other, a vexing unto the Children and Servants, when they are
under croſs commands, and when they are more deſirous to pleaſe and to ſerve
one Mother or Miſtreſs than the other, which alſo will be vexing unto the two
Wives: a vexing to the Husband, when he ſees ſuch diſorders in his Family, a
vexing to him, when he diſcerneth, that his kindneſs to one of his Wives doth
beget jealouſie in the other Wife, a vexing to him when they both urge him to
gratifie them in that, which he cannot: a vexing to him becauſe of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
diſcontents, and differences that hereby are occaſioned to his Relations, and
to the ſeveral Relations of both his Wives: a vexing alſo to thoſe Relations of
his and of theirs, upon the account of contrary intereſts, who on each ſide will
be leaning more in their judgement and affections to their own nearer kindred
and alliance: who can expreſs the whole of the vexing, that followeth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon?
and ſtill, the more Wives be taken, the more vexing will follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.
The firſt Wife will be provoked to jealouſie, judging that ſhe is deprived
of that which is her peculiar right and proper due, and that, her Husband's ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinducing
of a ſecond Wife is Treachery and falſeneſs againſt the firſt. The
Law of <hi>Jehovah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aelohim</hi> muſt be our Rule in this as in all other caſes: If the
contrary practice of ſome holy Men in Scripture be objected, their example is no
further in any thing to be followed by us, than as they themſelves walked by the
Rule of the Word. Theſe Hebrew Interpreters, and Commentators, who were

the Husband's former Woman-Wife being ſtill alive; which Interpretation by
ſeveral other Scriptures warranted, where the name and word, Siſter, is any other
Woman (as the name and word, Brother, is any other Man) and to interprer it
otherwiſe, would offer violent force to the particular ſpecial reaſon which is here
expreſſed, as one great cauſe of this prohibition: For, it would no leſs afflict,
grieve, and vex the firſt Wife, if her Husband did marry any other Woman, as if
he married his former Wives natural Siſter, and took her to him to be a ſecond
Wife: if <hi>Polygamy,</hi> or the having of more Wives than one at once, were lawful
and there were no injury done thereby, to the firſt Wife, by which, vexing might
be cauſed and contention kindled, then the propinquity, the nearneſs of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of two Wives to one another, and to one and the ſame Husband, ſhould
rather beget, encreaſe and confirm love, than beget jealouſie and enmity: for
all ſuch hatred and vexing would be cauſleſs, were this taking of a ſecond Wife
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55870:75"/>
whilſt the former living, lawful: This being provoked to jealouſie, and being
put into a vexation, doth fall out not only between<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 30. 1. 14, 15.</note> natural Siſters, as <hi>Leah</hi> and
<hi>Rachel,</hi> but alſo between thoſe,<note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam. 1. 6.</note> who are not near of kin, as <hi>Hannah</hi> and <hi>Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah:</hi> As for two natural Siſters, for them to be married unto one and the ſame
Man, more eſpecially both of the Siſters living at once, this was forbidden
before in thoſe Laws of prohibited marriage in that place of<note n="p" place="margin">Levit. 18. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Leviticus:</hi> the
marriage of the natural Brother's Wife is expreſly forbidden; by an Analogical
rule therefore a Woman may not marry her natural Siſters Husband; ſo that two
Siſters were already forbidden to be married unto one Man, and therefore<note n="q" place="margin">Levit. 18. 18.</note> in
this place, it muſt be a new caſe which has this new prohibition. In theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
of ſuch inceſtuous marriages as were, and are, and will be ever unlawful
to contract, there is no difference between the Maſculine and Feminine Sex; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<note n="r" place="margin">Levit. 18 7. 8.</note> in the firſt ſpecial prohibition Marriage of the Daughter with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is expreſly forbidden, as much as of the Son with the Mother, whereby the
LORD doth declare, that, though in the following prohibitions mention be made
what Males ought not contract with what Females, yet by neceſſary conſequence
of that firſt prohibition, and by the ſame Analogy and proportion, the prohibition
is alſo given to the Female; As it is forbidden to the Man to marry the Siſter of
his Father or Mother,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Levit. 18. 12, 13, 14.</note> by the ſame reaſon it is forbidden to the Female to marry
the Brother of her Father or Mother, becauſe it is in the ſame equal degree:
which is alſo further here confirmed, becauſe the Siſter of the Father is equally
prohibited as the Siſter of the Mother: thus<note n="t" place="margin">Lev. 18. 10, 11.</note> the Daughter of his Son is equally
prohibited as the Father, as the Daughter of his Daughter; there is no difference
in this as to the Sex: As the Siſter is prohibited to the Brother:<note n="n" place="margin">Lev. 18. 9.</note> by the ſame
rule and reaſon, the Brother is prohibited to the Siſter, of the whole or the half
blood, and whether born in lawful Wedlock, or otherwiſe: for, there is equal
propinquity; and therefore,<note n="w" place="margin">Lev. 18. 12, 13.</note> as the Siſter of the Father is prohibited, ſo the
Brother of the Father is underſtood to be forbidden.<note n="x" place="margin">Lev. 18. 18.</note> Upon the ſame ground,
it is unlawful for one Woman to be married unto two Men at once, ſeeing it is
unlawful for one Man to be married unto two Wives at once: and I would know
by what new name, theſe two Wives can call themſelves in this new Relation:
for all marriages do bring on new names of new Relations: if they do call one
another Siſters, then it is either only more large as all Women whatever in that
ſenſe are Siſters: thus they were before their Marriage to one Man, and what new
Relation is there contracted by this marriage? if they call one another Siſters,
in a reſtrained proper ſenſe it is either by conſanguinity or by affinity: by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity
it cannot be, for they are not of the ſame blood either by the Fathers
or by Mothers ſide, neither is it by affinity: For neither of them can call the
Husband Brother rightly; and yet, if it were ſo<note n="y" place="margin">Lev. 18. 16.</note> it were unlawful for a Man to
marry a Siſter by affinity: Two Siſters may not marry the ſame, though ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively,
one of the Siſters being dead, much leſs may they marry one and the
ſame Man, whilſt both the Siſters are alive.</p>
            <p>Doth the Scripture give any ſuch new ſpecial name of new ſpecial Relation
unto ſuch? Whereas unto all lawful marriages it doth. In this place of <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
when the LORD had ſhewn what was not an holy marriage, nor a lawful
conjunction, becauſe, and when it was within the degree of conſanguinity, or
affinity, prohibited to contract, for otherwiſe thoſe who did ſo, were guilty of
Inceſt: He then cloſeth theſe forbodes with one ſpecial inſtance, where there was
not ſuch a Relation of either conſanguinity or affinity, and that was, when a
Man having a former Wife living, becomes a Digamiſt in marrying of a ſecond
Wife, or a Polygamiſt in marrying of more Wives, which unlawful marriages
are more expreſly prohibited to Magiſtrates, and to Miniſters: Plurality of Wives
would render a Magiſtrate effeminate, a King would be leſs apt for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="z" place="margin">Deut. 17. 17. 17. 1 Tim. 3. 2. 12. Tit. 1. 6. 1 Tim. 5. 9.</note>

luxury, ſenſuality and Idolatry; <hi>Solomon,</hi> as wiſe as he was, was a ſad inſtance of
this bruitiſh folly: When he multiplyed Wives they turned away his heart from
<hi>Jehovah</hi> after other gods, and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his
God. Did not <hi>Solomon</hi> King of Iſrael ſin by theſe things, yet among many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
was there no King like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55870:76"/>
him King over all Iſrael: Nevertheleſs, even him did out-landiſh Women cauſe
to ſin, though his Mother had better inſtructed him, <hi>Give not thy ſtrength unto Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

            </p>
            <p>So bad an example would have a malign influence upon the people, to run them
into the ſame irregular practice, the Subjects would hereby be oppreſſed by being
over charged to maintain ſo many Wives and Children united to and ſprouting
from the Royal ſtock. <hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt, and greateſt King, yet had he but one
Wiſe at one time, ſo <hi>Noah</hi> after <hi>Adam,</hi> though Heir of the World, yet had he but
one Wife; in both which inſtances much more could have been colourably plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the propagation of mankind had the practice been lawful. And as for a
Miniſter, a Biſhop, an Overſeer, a Presbyter or Elder, and Deacon, how much it
would unfit him for the wiſe, faithful, diſcharge of his function and office, how
much it would blot his Doctrine, how much blemiſh his Life, how much diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Family, how much corrupt the people, with many other evil conſequences
and poyſnous effects, he who hears them but named may ſoon diſcern them,
whether or no he be forbidden to have any other after that Wife is dead, let
them further conſider in Scripture, whoſe caſe is more concerned herein, and
who would advance this ſort of word Learning. A Diaconeſs was to be a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,

the LORD ſeeks an holy Seed, a Seed of <hi>Aelohim,</hi> a Seed of Acceptation with
him, a Seed whom he will bleſs, which in thoſe other ways would not, neither
could be ſo expected; for this cauſe therefore made he one, not ten, or twenty, or
an hundred or a thouſand, for one man at once; no more but one <hi>Adam,</hi> and one <hi>Eve</hi>
were to be Matrimonized into one fleſh: thus was the primitive Law of lawful

it be individuous, ſuch as may not be divided, or cut in pieces whilſt both

man and the woman ſhall cleave, or be glewed, but in compoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
they ſhall cleave unto, or adheringly be glewed together unto each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is one great end of their Marriage, Union and Conjunction, and
their conjugal communion and fellowſhip; which words ſeeing they do not go
before, but do follow that which Chriſt had ſaid, from the beginning of the
Creation, God made them Male and Female, for this cauſe ſhall a man leave
his Father and Mother, and ſhall cleave to his Wife, it muſt therefore of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
obtain that force which the Reaſon of the ſequel doth expreſs and require;
that therefore which went before, that God made but one woman to be a Wife,
at one and the ſame time to one man, the conſequent reaſon doth require, that
the conjunction of two only, of one man, and of one woman be underſtood;
for thus is it brought in illatively, or by way of cauſal, rational inference. It is
againſt Nature to abſcind, or to cut off one part from another, where the two
parts make one; for this is the Nature of two parts, that from the union of
them both together, the health and ſafety of the whole doth depend; it is not
a promiſcuous conjunction of many, but of two only between themſelves; ſo
that Chriſt's reaſoning is ſtrongly and clearly convincing, inferring the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
unlawfulneſs of putting away from the nearneſs of Union between the two
married perſons, only one man and one woman together. Chriſt did not make
or preſcribe any new Law in this caſe, but he doth revive thoſe material cauſes
which the Jews had wreſted and wryed, perverted, crookned quite off, from, and
contrary to the primeve Rule, and he doth reduce, and he doth call back thoſe
Marriage caſes to the firſt Inſtitution, From the beginning of the Creation, ſaith
he, it was not ſo, as you have corrupted it; and from that firſt ordination, he
skilfully proveth and ſheweth, that holy Marriage is the lawful conjunction of
but two only, one man and one woman; between two ſuch he appointed the
conjugal Union; he did not ſay the man ſhall glewedly cleave to his Wives, in
the plural, but to his Wife in the ſingular number, that particular <hi>Eve</hi> whom
he himſelf had built, and formed, and brought, and joyned to the man <hi>Adam;</hi>
that which to them was thus only ſaid, and they ſhall be in one fleſh, is by way
of additional explication declared in the New Teſtament by Chriſt, to have this
meaning, and they two ſhall be unto one fleſh; Chriſt doth refer that expreſſion
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55870:77"/>
in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> they two or both of them, were naked unto the foregoing ſentence,
and they two ſhall be unto one fleſh, and for the greater emphaſis ſake, he doth

one man and one woman. If the Jews do object, that the practice was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
otherwiſe among the Fathers, which <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf did afterwards tolerate:
Chriſt doth anſwer to this, <hi>from the beginning of the creation it was not ſo;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
examples of men ought not to preſcribe to the primitive Inſtitution by the
adored Almighties: However the God of patience did bear with ſome things for
a time, which were diſſentaneous from the firſt Inſtitution, yet now Chriſt
hath reſtored them to their primitive order; however ſomewhat was indulged
to the peoples perverſe froward manners a while, yet Chriſt doth bring men
back to the firſt declared, determined leading commanding Will of God, unto
that which firſt, and in it ſelf, in its own nature was pleaſing and acceptable to
him, and unto this all his Marriage-Offices and Caſes muſt be referred, that an
end may be put unto all ſtrifes of diſputation about them: It is emphatical, and
very ſignificant, which Chriſt doth here ſay, <hi>from the beginning,</hi> that is to ſay, then
at the firſt Creation, when <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> did accommodate his Inſtitutes,
theſe Matrimonial appointments, not to the depraved judgements, and corrupt
affections of luſtful men, but according to the very true Nature of what is juſt,
equal and right, then God made this conjugal Union and Conjunction, to be
only between two, one man and one woman; which is alſo judged to be the
meaning of thoſe words, and<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 19 5.</note> he ſaid, referring them to the Creator of <hi>Adam</hi>

yet God himſelf was he to whom the Authority and Right did belong, and he

the force of Chriſt's argument, therefore theſe two have the Reaſon of Parts;
to put them or divorce them aſunder one from another is very wicked, an heinous
crime, and beſides Nature, for this is the reaſon, the conſideration, the cauſe, the
ſtate, the order, the frame, the nature of two parts, that the whole doth depend
upon their mutual Union: He at the firſt created Male and Female, and gave but
one <hi>Eve</hi> to one <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore from the beginning he appointed Monogamy
between two married ones, by an Union undiſſolveable, but by death or Adultery,
and therefore alſo prohibited Digamy and Polygamy; there is expreſs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of two only, and of no more in this Marriage-conjunction: one man,
and two or more Wives cannot be one fleſh, for the fleſh of one is not the fleſh
of another, and the fleſh of man is divided between two or more Wives, neither
can this cloſeſt Union be between more than two; the man cannot give himſelf
alike unto more than unto one in this caſe, thoſe two who before the Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial

the caſe be now weighed in the Scripture-balance: he was written unto about
it, and he doth expreſly declare concerning married ones, that every man is to
have his own proper Wife, and every woman her own proper Husband; and
how could this be, if Polygamy were allowable and warrantable? for if every
man muſt have her, that is properly his own, and no other mans, and as exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of all other women, who are not ſo properly his own; and if every woman
muſt have him, who is properly her own, and no other woman, as ſhutting out
all other men, who are not ſo properly her own; then Marriage muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
one man and one woman, and between two ſuch only. If one man had
ten, or twenty, an hundred or a thouſand Wives (for, where will you ſet the
bounds of reſtraint, if once you allow more than one at once?) there could
not be an equal diſtribution; neither would there be enough to ſuffice for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, who cannot contain to have one, and ſo the remedy by Marriage
would not reach to all men, which yet doth belong to all, as the diſeaſe of
of proneneſs to Fornication is general to all: and the like inconvenience and
miſchief would unavoidably follow, if one woman might have ten, twenty, an
hundred, or a thouſand Husbands: Whereas, the LORD in the way of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
doth bring forth, and breed up near about an equal number of men and

underſtand me, not from <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as they are Divorces, but only a Law
by conſequenr upon a ſuppoſition: If they were reſolved to put away a Wife,
then this or that was to follow upon it; if the caſe of the blind-minded, and
hard-hearted Husbands were ſuch, that they would be and were divorced from
their Wives, when ſuch a fould matter came to paſs, then the LORD appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that if another man had married the divorced woman, or if that later
man were dead, that then ſhe was not to return to her former Husband; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe had defiled her ſelf by and with another man; the firſt great cauſe
whereof was from her firſt Husband, who thruſt her out upon this temptation:
the firſt Divorce was unjuſt, and the ſecond Marriage was unlawful, the firſt
Husband being ſtill alive, and ſin was thereby brought upon the Land, which was
puniſhable for this guilt; for, not only were the guilty perſons themſelves, the
man and the women, liable and obnoxious to judgement for this crime, but all
the inhabitants alſo, who knew it and ſuffered it, if they did not in their places
appear againſt it. This ſhameful conſequent was on purpoſe to deter them
from the other ſinful Antecedent: And therefore that expreſſion in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
before cited in the Margin, ſhould not be rendred imperatively, let him write
her a Bill of Divorcement, and give it in her hand, and ſend her out of his
houſe; as if <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> gave his Direction and Command, that this man
was in Duty, or by any lawful rightful allowance, to deal thus with her in this
caſe: But it expreſſeth,<note n="u" place="margin">Deut. 24. 1, 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
               </note> what the man had done, and would do, the three
firſt verſes of that twenty fourth Chapter, do declare the hard hearted mans
purpoſe and practice; it is the fourth Verſe that doth open the mind of our
LORD, that if the man was reſolvedly ſet upon ſuch a ſinful courſe, that then it
was not lawful for him to take her again, which doth plainly ſhew <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſlike of that illegal Divorcement, they were irregular miſcarriages, the
LORD gave no countenance to ſuch licentious practices. We do not read of any
expreſs law and direct command of <hi>Aelohim,</hi> for the jealouſly-ſuſpitious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane
Husband ſo to deal with his Wife. <hi>Aelohim,</hi> in this caſe,<note n="w" place="margin">Mal. 2, 14, 26.</note> doth hate
that word, <hi>put her away;</hi> the man cannot lawfully break that Covenant, which
the LORD was called in to witneſs that he made with the woman, when he took
her firſt in Marriage, nothing can juſtly looſe the Matrimonial Bond but death,
or a caſe of adultery, which was a<note n="x" place="margin">Lev. 20. 10. Deut. 22. 22. Job 31, 9, 11. John 8. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> capital crime, and to be puniſhed with
death by the Judges. One ſuch example of Juſtice in this Iſland were more
likely to terrifie the inhabitants thereof, and to prevent any further guilt in
principle, or in practice about this foul ſin, than ten other arguments in ſuch an
age of monſtrous bodily uncleanneſſes; of ſpeculative unbelief, and of practical
Atheiſm. Whatever ſucceſs upon the hearts of Readers, this paper Teſtimony
has or ſhall have, is with him, in whoſe hands the hearts of men are: In this I
rejoyce, that the LORD hath not left me to be aſhamed of Chriſt, nor of his

and who will judge Whoremongers and Adulterers, all whoſoever they be, who

            <p>Whether thorowout the Scriptures, where ever <hi>Adam</hi> is found in the Original
it ſhould not be ſo rendred in the Tranſlation into other Languages leaving it
to the expounder, in the help and ſupplies of the holy Spirit, to ſhew, when it
is meant properly of the The-<hi>Adam,</hi> and when collectively of more? This I
judge greatly uſeful, to be far inquired into, and ſeriouſly to be conſidered of.
It is ſcarce imaginable till proof be made of this, what variety of choice diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55870:79"/>
would ſhine forth from hence. That all the Old Teſtament thorow we can
find <hi>Adam</hi> but twenty times, or about that ſmall number, in our Engliſh Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation;
Whereas, it is expreſſed in the Original many ſcores of times, let the
vulgar Reader think and conſider, whether much of this uſeful Learning about
Man's Nature and State have not been hereby hidden from him; And let the
Judicious and experienced in the Hebrew words and phraſes ſay, whether many
controverſies in Religion about <hi>Adam</hi> and his fall, and his conveying of guilt
and corruption to his Poſterity, with much more of profitable practical Doctrines
and Duties, Graces and Privileges, would not be evidently demonſtrated hereby?
<hi>Adam</hi> was not created at the firſt <hi>Androg ynous,</hi> with two diſtinct ſeveral Faces,
and with a double body, afterwards to be divided and pulled aſunder one from
another to become two: <hi>Aelohim</hi> created<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 1. 26, 27. Eccleſ. 7. 29.</note> them, in the plural, Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,

both<note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 1. 28. &amp; 5. 2.</note> bleſſed together, and therefore at that time they had both of them a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
diſtinct being. <hi>Aelohim</hi>'s benediction which he gave to <hi>Adam,</hi> the Male and
the Female, is more large and ample in expreſſions and in things, than thoſe words
of bleſſing, which before he uttered to other Creatures, they had propagation as
other living creatures made on the fifth day, though not ſo numerous as the moſt
of them; and further they were endowed and enriched with many a good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
gift, of Spirit, Soul, and Body, beyond them. We muſt learn and know,
mind and conſider, That the Creation in the whole and in every part thereof;
together with all the Honour and Glory of that Power and Wiſdom, and other
glorious Excellencies which did ſo manifeſt themſelves therin, is wholly and
only to be aſcribed, and attributed to <hi>Aelohim,</hi> whoſe name is<note n="e" place="margin">Above 30 times in <hi>Gen. 1. &amp;</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> ſo often, as hath
been obſerved, uſed in this Hiſtory. <hi>Adam</hi> was bound actually to believe in
<hi>Aelohim,</hi> and in his Word, as ſoon as he was created: For he had<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 1. 26—31. &amp; 2. 1, 2. 3. 1 Tim. 4. 3, 4, 5.</note> a Word and
a Promiſe from Chriſt in this Hiſtory of the Creation. <hi>Adam</hi> was to believe
<hi>Aelohim's</hi> ſanctifying of appointed Meats created for his Food, to be received of
them who being believing ones, and acknowledging ones of the Truth: (to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
no more particulars now) So that Faith in the creating <hi>Meſſias</hi> has a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in created Nature: <hi>Adam</hi> had a power in created Nature, to believe in
Chriſt, and his Holineſs, and his Righteouſneſs were a perfection ſuitable and
con-natural to him. Thus the ſum of the Decalogue was imprinted in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
heart: Faith in <hi>Jehovan Aelohim</hi> is the ſubſtance of the firſt word, or command,
which was enjoyned to all the World of Mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo Faith in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy Spirit; It was always a Truth from the very firſt creating
and forming of Man, and was actually a Law and command upon Man and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that, without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, whom to pleaſe as well
as to believe in was a plain duty (accordingly <hi>Abraham</hi> believed in God, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
it to him for righteouſneſs; and all the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt be
of the ſame Faith and Practice) For he that cometh to God, muſt believe, that
he is, and that, he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him. The eleventh
Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> in ſeveral inſtances doth relate, that the
Saints and people of God under the Old Teſtament-adminiſtration, did actually
rely upon Chriſt by Faith, for which Faith they are there commended.</p>
            <p>This original concreated Holineſs and Righteouſneſs in <hi>Adam,</hi> being ſuch a
Law of Nature, as whereof the ten Words are a perfect Tranſcript and an exact
Summary, it were a matter well worth a further re-ſearch and a deeper Inquiry,
whether the Doctrinal-part as well as the Duty-part of true pure Religion be not

would be regular in his obedience, muſt alſo be found in the Faith. Theſe are
the Eſſential conſtitutive parts of an entire perfect Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.
The LORD Jeſus Chriſt confirmed the Truth of his Doctrine from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his own Law, and in aſſerting the Doctrine of the Reſurrection (which
is one great particular inſtance) he fetcheth the force of his Argument from the
firſt Word, ſaying, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God
of Jacob:</hi> God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living. To aſſent unto
revealed Truth is as neceſſary a part of our Duty as to perform commanded ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
And if it be narrowly looked into and duly pondered, it will be manifeſt
that all the Acts of our obedience do as naturally reſult from ſome Act of Faith,
as all the Acts of Faith do naturally reſolve into ſome Act of obedience: as a
general ſubjection of our whole Man to the will of this Soveraign LORD doth
bottom upon a general belief of his Truthfulneſs; So alſo are particular Acts
of this Subjection (where they are diſtinct and clear,) built upon ſome particular
Belief of that Truthfulneſs, as this veracity and goodneſs of Word Revelations
do include and teach, direct and hold forth; The more we recover and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to thoſe endowments which were concreated principles in <hi>Adam,</hi> the more
ſhall we diſcern and acknowledge the exacteſt obedience to be the higheſt equity,
and the beſt dutifulneſs to be the righteſt reaſon. Whether <hi>Adam</hi>'s Faith whilſt

for the rendring of his obediential Acts acceptable to <hi>Aelohim</hi> is one of thoſe
deep things, which it may be even the moſt learned among Believers, are not yet

on the third day, a ſort of green buddings (not ſo growing by ſowing their ſeed
or by Planting) which is more properly the Food of other Animals. This ſhould
be well conſidered, that Man may well underſtand his Grant, and may diſcern
what is fit food for him of the Creatures made on the third day, as well as thoſe
made on the fifth day: For, even<note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 1 28. 29, 30. 1 Tim. 4. 3, 4, 5. Gen. 9. 3. 4.</note> living creatures mentioned before, whether,
they were appointed not alſo to be Meat for Man (many of them, ſo they were
need in a Scriptural orderly way, their lives and bloods being firſt regularly taken
from them, and ſo prepared for meet Aliment) as well as Herbs and fruit, ſo that,
both theſe are to be taken into this grant of Food, ſome Animals being naturally
in their created eſſence clean wholſom Food, as others are naturally in their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
being unclean, unwholſom food, though otherwiſe uſeful for the good of
Man, yet not proper nutriment for him? This alſo doth call for further ſearch
after it in the Scriptures. As <hi>Aelohim</hi> would <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

to the Holy Spirit who ſealingly applyeth this. When <hi>Aelohim</hi> took a
view of<note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 1. 31.</note> all that which he had made on this ſixth day, made adornedly
really to exiſt as preparedly perfected, he beheld it as good, greatly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,
vehemently, validly good. The Univerſal particle, All, ſeems
here to be put for the number, not of multitude of kinds, ſo as to
comprehend all, and every of the ſeveral ſorts of Creatures, but of Unity,
relating to that one ſpecial eminent kind of Creature, <hi>Adam:</hi> all which,
in the ſingular Number, as appears by the Adjective of the Singular Number,
good: This being in the Singular Number not Plural Number. There was
much ſaid and done on this ſixth day, yet all this Univerſal is reſtrained to <hi>Adam</hi>
that excelling one of Creatures. Who of us knows the all of that which was
created in, and con-created with <hi>Adam?</hi> There is a great deficiency amongſt
us in this Science about Man: So little do we underſtand of our ſelves: Neither
are we likely to grow any thing conſiderably in this knowledge of our ſelves as
to our make, either our firſt created-make, or a new created-make, as long as
there is a reforting to vain Philoſophy and its Ethnick Schoolmaſters to be taught
the knowledge thereof. Although the Doctrine of <hi>Adam,</hi> of Man, as Man,
have but one peice and part of the created Works of <hi>Aelohim</hi> for its ſubject-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Man being the product of the ſixth day only, and ſo, as to days, but one
part and work of ſix, a ſmall portion of whole created Nature: Yet this Man
Science, this Anthropological Art, or the knowledge of a Man's ſelf, is one of
the great deſigns of all other uſeful knowledge, they do much aim at this, and
they have a tendency towards the promoting of this, and without this, how can
other Sciences receive an advance by Man! How is he in an hopeful way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of other ſort of Learning, who has not as yet attained to any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
growth in the knowledge of himſelf? The more we know of our ſelves
the more ſhall we know of <hi>Jehovah Aelohim,</hi> and of his Word and Works: and
then will theſe have reflexive Influence upon that, for the more that we know
of theſe, the more ſhall we know of our ſelves. And therefore let not the
Reader misjudge this to be a ſubject too low for a Miniſter of Chriſt to treat of:
<note n="w" place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5. Gal. 6. 3, 4. Lam. 3. 40. 1 Cor. 11. 28.</note> For, we are commanded and required to examine our own ſelves, to prove
our own ſelves, that, we may know our own ſelves, whether Jeſus Chriſt be in
us, unleſs we be unexperienced, unapproved ones. Man has ſuch created facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Abilities, whereby he can turn inwardly upon himſelf; he can reflect
upon himſelf. The laſt of the Hebrew conjugations is ſelf-reflexive, which
ſhould have been more and better obſerved by Tranſlators in their rendring of
the Original ſignificancy into other Languages. Man can<note n="x" place="margin">Pſ. 4. 4.</note> commune with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as he walks with himſelf, ſo he can talk alſo with himſelf, he can treat with
himſelf, and entertain himſelf. You may find Man in ſome Scriptures beſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>This <hi>Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Art, or Man Science, is very ſpreading and fruitful, very uſeful
and profitable, and it is to be conſidered, either as man is made a ſociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and ſo fitted for congregated Fellwoſhip, or as man was created, a ſeveral
<hi>Individunm,</hi> and ſo is of a diſtinct ſegregating; and accordingly the various
knowledges of <hi>Adam,</hi> of Man, do widen, and diſtribute, and diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
Into ſo many ſorts is this partition of Sciences, that a long life might to
advantages dwell upon them, and make ſuch Collections from out of the Word
about them, which if oderly diſpoſed, and freely communicated, would be one
rich Treaſure in the Common-wealth of Learning. If <hi>Adam</hi> or Man be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as in ſociety, related unto other men in a way of Humane Fellowſhip, ſo
here might paſs under diſquiſition and examination divers Arts and Sciences:
For, if we look upon <hi>Adam,</hi> as he that was in times after his firſt Creation, an
Husband, a Patient, a Maſter, a Converſer, a Negotiator, a King, a Prophet, a
Prieſt, a Church-Officer and Member; ſo here might be brought in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Art,
to know how to diſcharge the Duties, and injoy the Priviledges of a
conjugal relation; the paternal Art, what the carriage of Parents, and of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſhould be towards each other; the Magiſtral Art, what the Offices of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55870:81"/>
and of Servants are towards one another; the whole oeconomick Art<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the converſation Art, to have practical underſtanding, and prudential skill in
treating, and in converſing with others; the Art of trading in the World with
and amongſt men, ſo as to negotiate all our Affairs with Humane diſcretion:
The Art of Government, or the Science of Empire; to diſcern how to Rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
inferiours according to the Word: The Art of teaching, or the Prophets
Science, to be able in Office, for the inſtructing of others: The Adminiſtrators
Art, to be well verſed in the carrying on of all the parts of Inſtituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
after a ſpiritual manner, ſo as to find acceptation of the LORD: The Art
of right conſtituting of a Church, according to the Scripture-pattern, in all the
holy Laws, and comly Orders thereof: Of having all neceſſary Church Officers
gifted, graced, called, according to the Word-rule, of wiſe, faithful diſcharging
of all Church-Relation, of all the Duties of Goſpel-Fellowſhip, of orderly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Church-members, of regular exerciſe of Church Diſcipline. And
now, if we further conſider <hi>Adam</hi> or Man, as to his own ſingular individual
perſon, how many advantageous Arts and Sciences might here paſs under fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inquiry? The whole <hi>Adam</hi> and intire <hi>compoſitum</hi> of Man, as to ſpirituals,
doth in its comprehenſion call for much skill in ſeveral Myſterious Sciences;
as of the excelling Prerogative of man's Primitive created Holy, Happy, Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
State: Of man's miſerable condition under his fallen ſinful ſtate: Of man's
reſtaured Felicity, in the New Created Converted State: Of man's unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſummity of Happineſs in his glorified Eſtate: And as for <hi>Adam,</hi> for Man,
in his Naturals; the body of Man takes in, the Art of Cookery for nouriſhment;
the Art of Medicine for Curing; the Art of Chirurgery for Healing; the Art of
Anatomy for Diſſection; the Art Coſmetick, for Clothing, for comlineſs, for
cleanneſs, for due-bounded Decoration: The Art of Activity for all bodily, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Exerciſes: The Art of patient ſuffering: And if I would crumble this into
a multitude of particulars, reſpecting the inward and out parts of the body, how
many under Arts do theſe contain, Ear-art, Eye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

many that I could mention about the Humours, the Blood, the proper Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and Functions of every part, with a multitude of more: Get we into the
ſoul, or into the ſpirit of <hi>Adam,</hi> or of Man: Very profitable diſquiſitions might
here be made; what the ſpecifick Natures and Differences of theſe are: what
their ſeveral Offices, Functions, Facuities, Motions, and ſuch like: What the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Objects of them are: And how that theſe would take in many Arts and
Sciences: the Intellect of Man doth lead to the Art of Scripture-Logick: His will
and affections to the Art of Scripture Ethicks: His invention and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when it ſteps into Elocution, to the Art of Scripture<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Rhetorick: What
ſhall I more ſay? If the particular Arts and Sciences do ſo muitiply, and there
be ſo much in the holy Scriptures about every one of theſe, as I could, had I
time and a call thereunto, evidently demonſtrate to any Spiritual Diſcerner and
Judicious Inquirer; is it not then clear, that he who has a Purſe, and a mind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to ſo great an undertaking, might imploy scores of the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men in the World, about much of the moſt uſeful work in the World?
And now I could pity the great princely, noble, wealthy ones of this World,
who have ſo much, and yet do ſo little; who are intruſted with many Talents,
and yet do Trade ſo little with them, for the promoting of ſo choice good in the
Common-wealth of Learning. How many thouſands and Millions of pounds
are there ſinfully waſted and vainly expended about ſenſual Arts and voluptuary
Sciences to the corrupting and undoings of hundreds of Souls! One whereof
is of more true, ſolid-worth than an whole World: Which, if it were laid out,
and improved for the advancement of Scripture-Learning, would paſs both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
upon account at the laſt Judgement-day, and in the mean time forward
and ſpread ſome of the rareſt Excellencies and choiceſt Fellcities that ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Creatures; and Humine Intellects are capable of on this ſide of the heavenly
glory: But though I ſhould even break my loyns with ſighing, and blind my
eyes with Writing, yet when once will it be otherwiſe, till the LORD himſelf
do open the Eyes, and irradiate the minds, and change the hearts, and incline the
wills, and ingage the Spirits, of ſome of the great ones of the Earth to appear
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55870:82"/>
more in ſo righteous a Cauſe? At the preſent, becauſe it is a proſecuting of that
ſubject matter which I am upon, let me preſent ſomewhat to the view of men
converſant in the Art and Practice of Medicine with reſpect to man; which may,
if the LORD will bleſs it to that end, ingage them to be more in the ſtudious
reſearch into the Scriptures for the promoting and advancing of the Medicinal-Science,
which Ethnick Philoſophy can never perfect.</p>
            <p>In the general, let it be pondered upon, whether thoſe who have a name to be
great advancers of Learning, particularly of this part of Learning, the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal
Art, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>have ever laid this Science upon a ſound bottom, who affirm, that
Medicine not grounded upon Philoſophy is a weak thing: and that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Medicine has this wanting, a true and active Natural Philoſophy, upon
which the Medicine ſhould be built? That there is a defectiveneſs in this Art, as
commonly ſtudied, profeſſed and practiſed, is confeſſed by the Diſcerning and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious:
So that ſome further Maturation and perfecting of it, is much deſired:
But that ever either old Ethnick Philoſophy in Principles, or new Experimental
Philoſophy in practice, by Chriſtians can attain this compleating augment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fetching of it out of the Scriptures of Truth, that I deny. For theſe being
Philoſophizings, or vain affected Humane Reaſonings, according to outward ſenſes,
(which are very fallible, in two great caſes eſpecially, when either Objects are
at too great a diſtance, or when Objects are very ſecret and hidden, at leaſt in
their inward Springs, and Cauſes, and Combinations, ſhewing themſelves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
only by ſome darker ſymptoms and deceitful ſigns) Theſe, I ſay, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give ſo right a judgement in many caſes. There are divers diſeaſes of the
Soul, and of the Spirit in man, which do alſo influence to the diſeaſing of the
body, which mere natural Philoſophy cannot diſcover or remedy, without the
Word: And there are ſeveral Diſeaſes of the body, which for the new kinds,
the unſeen cauſes, the complex<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>combinations of them, the undiſcerned Seat and
Root of them in ſome of the inward bodily parts (with more that might be
added) are neither knowable nor curable by mere Humane Wiſdom. It is only
a Scriptural-thread, that can lead into the cauſe and cure of theſe, by a quick
and piercing judgement given by the holy Spirit.<note n="b" place="margin">Jer. 15. 18. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

there is a multiplicity of Maladies in the Soul of Man, and deep wounds in
the Spirit of Man, both which by natural cauſality do diſtemper the body; and
how can Ethnick Philoſophers, or other vain affecters of Humane Wiſdom,

the Word they neither know what the Soul of Man is, nor what his Spirit is,
nor what the ſpecifick difference is between the Soul and the Spirit in man, nor
by what <hi>Medium</hi> of contract, the Spirit and Soul in man do operate upon each

treat of the effects of the inner Man, of the unexpected changes ſuddenly befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the mind, as having an alterative affectiveneſs upon the outer Man, either to

of the affections of their Patients, without reſorting to Scripture directions
in particular Scriptures to enforce obedience, to call forth Faith, and to encourage
prayers? which the common exhortations from meer Philoſophical Ethnicks
cannot ſo do. How many inward caſes of Spiritual maladies are there, which
none of the common Medicinal Preſcriptions can remove and remedy? This

conclude many Diſeaſes to be obſtinate againſt all remedies: Whereas if the
Scriptures were ſearched into about this, much more would there be diſcovered
of a Directory; And if all elſe ſhould fail, the LORD would often effect cures
even to wonderment, were Faith acted aright upon a ſuitable Word. There was
a ſick Maid given over by a Learned Practitioner in the Medicinal Art, as gaſping
and dying, and when a Paſtor being preſent, had drawn the Phyſician aſide into
the next Room, the Phyſician told him that ſhe had two or three mortal Diſeaſes
ſo far gone upon her, that either of them would be her Death. And yet when
the Miniſter had cleared the Chamber of other by-ſtanders, himſelf and ſome

by good Angels, other times by evil Spirits,) which muſt receive a Word cure, if
ever they be rightly cured. The Holy Scriptures do expreſly mention ſeveral
particular Diſeaſes, as running Sores, flowing Iſſues, Boyls, Feavers, Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Inflammations, extreme Burnings, Botch, Emerods, Scab, Itch, Leproſie, the
falling of the Thigh or Womb, and divers others; And they ſpeak of Diſeaſes
in particular members of the Body, as in the Feet, in the Legs, in the Knees, in
the Bowels, in the Kidneys or Reins, in the Loins, in the Sinews, in the Bones, in
the Liver, in the Gall: From the ſole of the Foot unto the Head no ſoundneſs,
Wounds, Bruiſes, putrefying Sores: And when the judicious and induſtrious of
the Medicinal Art will make Scripture collections about this, they might find out
many particular Rules there, which do direct unto proper ſpecifick remedies. If
I ſhould cull out this one particular inward part of Man's body, the heart, how
many diſeaſes and diſtempers is it ſubject unto, the which no Philoſophick Art
can cure, ſuch as the Paſſion or the Palpitation of the Heart, the Wounding of
the Heart, the Breaking of the Heart, the Piercing of it, the Faintings, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatings,
the Waſtings and Miniſhings, the Throbbings and Beatings about of
the Heart, ſo that it is even forſaking of a Perſon, leaping awry and leaving its

Heart, the Troubles, the Terrours, the Tremblings, the Deſpondings of the
Heart; Its Diſſolvings and Flowings away as water, its ſinking and falling: Its
being moved as the Trees of the Wood are moved with the Wind: Its melting
as Wax, and ſoftning through fear, its making a noiſe like Pipes, its dyingneſs

Heart with deadly trouble and pain: ſuch a covering grief and ſorrow of
Heart, as is totally overwhelming and quite diſcouraging: It makes them even
quite to give over all hope. It is ſuch an overwhelming grief; and diſcouraging
ſorrow of Heart as has Obduration and obſtinacy going along with it: It fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſets out the Hearts giving over of it ſelf to its own overwhelming grief
and diſcouraging ſorrow, with terrible fear of God's giving over of ſuch to the
obduration and obſtinacy of their heart, and of their being ſhut up under all
this, when ſuch an Heart like a Buckler or Shield doth keep off any blow or
ſtroke from the LORD's Word or hand, ſhutting it ſelf up as within a Fence, ſo
that no counſels or comforts from Men can come at it. Whither can the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed
ſend to any ſo skilful in the Medicinal Art as to open the Nature, Cauſes,
and Remedies of this one diſeaſe of the Heart? What ſhall I more ſay, if I can
fill up ſo many Lines with ſuch a long Induction and large enumeration of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Heart maladies, which are ſo common in experience, and which no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
and preſcriptions, but what are Scriptural, wiſely applyed, and duly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and well improved and followed, can either prevent or remedy: Is is not
high time for ſuch as are ſerious in the Art Medicinal and are tender of the
health and lives of their Patients, and would lift up their Faces before a righteous
Judge at the laſt, when they muſt ſtand or fall for their Eternal Eſtate according
as they have walked by the Rule of the Word or not, I ſay, is it not high time
for them to ſtudy their Art and to practice it, in a Word-way? The Heart ſick
ones might be referred to apt, pertinent, proper, Scriptures ſpeaking directly to a
multitude of ſuch caſes. Shall I open a little of the maladies of the Soul in Man?
The Scriptures can inform us of the diſcouragement of the Soul: the grief of
the Soul; its bitterneſs; its outcryes; through wounding; its pouring out;
its Anguiſh, its ſore vexings; its drawing nigh to the Gulphy empty ſpace; its
afflictedneſs; its wearineſs; its being torn; its Conſumptiveneſs; its being
ſpoiled; its need of healing; its being caſt down; its making a tumultuous
ſtir, within a Man, its ſinking; its being bowed down; its having of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming
Waters to come into it; its refuſing to be comforted; its being filled
with troubles: its being caſt off; its breaking; its cleaving to the Duſt; its
melting for heavineſs: its faintings; its Impriſonments; Its being bereft of
good, its being removed far off from peace; its exceeding ſorrowfulneſs, its
troubledneſs and drying away, its bowing down, its being deſtroyed, its being
pierced thorow, its being utterly cut off, its being diſpoſſeſt or turned out of
poſſeſſion, its being devoured, its being perverted, with ſuch like evil effects of
the Soul, this breathing part in Man. And what can Philoſophick Recipes do in
theſe caſes? Whither can we go for a proper cure but to Chriſt in the Scriptures
of Truth? Shall we conſider the ſpirit of Man a little, That Candle or Lamp
of <hi>Jehovah</hi> in Man ſearching all the Inner Chambers of the Belly? Oh how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are its diſtempers! In the Word we may read of the trouble or ſhortned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Spirit: the hardning of the Spirit, its ſadneſs, its being drunk up by
poiſon, its unſteadfaſtneſs, its haſtineſs: its having a breach in it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

its haughtineſs, its unrulyneſs, its ſleepy diſtemper, its grievedneſs, its

its perverſneſs, its Pride, its erringneſs, its vexing, and more ſuch: Whither
now, to what Apothecaries Shop, to what Philoſophical Doctor, will you ſend
for a cure of theſe? you muſt come to the word, and to him in and through the

there are not only ſpiritual directions given about theſe inner diſtempers of Heart,
of Soul, and of Spirit, holy preſcriptions and Heavenly counſels, but alſo divers
apt remedies are pointed to from the con-created vertues which the LORD hath
put into ſeveral of his creatures, when thoſe who are reputed to be very
learned in this Art, are ſo far honoured and uſed by the LORD, as to be made
humble enough to be willing to be better taught, and believers enough to judge
God to be wiſer then Man, and Word-wiſdom, and Truth to excel Philoſophick
Follies and falſities: the Medicinal Art will then advance and flouriſh. There
are many original words and phraſes, which do in a more general way direct
unto health and to the recovery of it out of ſickneſſs beſides a diſtinct particular
enumeration of ſeveral diſeaſes with their cauſes and curſes, and ſeveral proper

into an holy ſeperation from unclean peoples, from Communion with ſuch they

may find out natural natural reaſons and cauſes for ſuch a diſcrimination: When
ſpiritual reaſon doth wiſely exerciſe it ſelf about this diſcovery by Scripture,
Nature, and Experience, it may diſcern clean Animals to have a proper nutritive

the unclean do more breed diſeaſes, at leaſt they are not ſo healthful, whereby the
All-wiſe Phyſician, the faithful Creator hath inſtructed his rational Creatures, and
graciouſly at once provided both for the health of Mens bodies, and for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their Souls: for Meats do diſpoſitively operate upon the mind, who
may not ſee that hath any thing of a piercing eye, that ſome Animals are more
ravenous and rapacious, others are more luxurious and wanton, or more cruel
and bloody, or more gluttonous, or more fearful, or more filthy, or more muddy,
or more cholerick and aduſt, or more exceſſively moiſt, with much more that
might be added? and do not theſe malignly influence upon thoſe who make
them their uſual food? How few are there of mankind, who do ſtudy their
own complexions, conſtitutions, temperaments, or what that is which is ſuitable
food for them? Inſomuch, as that the moſt are even going into the other World
before they know how to make one good meal? but every thing is counted
good with ſome that will fill their belly, and any thing with others that will
gratifie their diſtempered ungoverned appetite: whereas, he who hath not due
regard to his dyet, for kind, meaſure and ſeaſon, will in time overturn his
ſtrength, overthrow his health, and diſeaſe himſelf; and then the ſick do feel
the<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 9. 12.</note> need of a Phyſician or Surgeon; in which caſes the Scriptures are not ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
but would make them Medicinal Artiſts, and teach them practical skill.
I have not abilities and accompliſhments for it, neither is it my profeſſion to
undertake to ſet before the Reader an exact Treatiſe of the Medicinal Art, though
I queſtion not but that it may be found out in the Holy Scriptures, and in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Works according to thoſe Scriptures. Let the principle be admitted and
purſued; and then much more would be diſcovered. As for the conſervation
of health, the Learned in the Medicinal Art ſhould ſearch the Scriptures about
the uſe of ſome, and about the forbearing of other creatures, for Food, about
the kinds of bodily exerciſes, about the choice of Aromaticks, of Spices, of
Olys, of Wines, and many more, about the Regiment of paſſions and of affections,
with more directions that might be given; Such as the actings of ſuitable graces,
the enjoying of proper comforts, the improving of Holy Fellowſhip with <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi>
in Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and more might be added, if advice from ſo
mean a one be received in the Colledge of Phyſitians. There is a further part
of the Medicinal Art, which doth reſpect the prolongation of days and the
lengthning along of Life, of which there is much in the Scriptures, both by way

by men skilful in the Original, and acquainted with the Giver of his
Word, how that knowledge may be perfected by a Scripture-diſcovery, which
doth reſpect the body of Man? For, hereby many other uſeful Arts would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Let a more narrow reſearch alſo be made into the Soul of man; Its Eſſence
and Nature; Its Subſtance and Operations; Its Offices and Products: How
great its ſpecifick difference from the Soul of Beaſts. Let the Spirit of Man be
more ſtudied in the Word of Truth: What its proper Exiſtence is; what its
ſpecifick Difference; what its Faculties; what the Objects of thoſe Faculties,
<note n="l" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5. 23.</note> wherein differenced from the Soul, whether ſeparable from the Soul for ſome
time, yet ſo as the Body ſtill lives, what its work is; what are the peculiat ſeats
in Man, for all the Faculties of the Soul and Spirit. How many thoſe Faculties
are, what their Original, what their connaturalneſs; what all the inward parts
of Man are; what their league of amity and friendly commerce is, one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and all together with the whole <hi>compoſitum?</hi> and a multitude of other
rare parts of this great Knowledge. I wait, if the LORD give me to live to ſee,
this glorious deſign to be received, promoted, and improved by others: If ſo,
I expect, that he will give men an heart willing to contribute, what this way
may be judged uſeful by ſuch abler undertakers, who would ſeverally labour in
