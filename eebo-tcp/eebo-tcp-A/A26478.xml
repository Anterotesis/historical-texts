         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>REAT Contentions hath now been of long time about the moſt comfortable Sacrament of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Chriſt our Saviour: In the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and determination whereof, many be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned of Hereſie, and reproved as bringers up of new Doctrine, not known of old in the Church before <hi>Berengarius</hi> time, who taught in France, in the daies when <hi>William</hi> the Norman was by Conqueſt King of England, and <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Gregorius</hi> the Seventh, was Pope of Rome. But that thou mayeſt know (good Chriſtian Reader) how this is advouched more boldly then truly, in eſpecial of ſome certain men, which be more ready to maintain their old judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then of humilitie to ſubmit themſelves unto a truth: here is ſet forth unto thee a Teſtimony of very Ancient time, wherein is plainly ſhewed what was the judgment of the Learned men in this matter, in the daies of the Saxons before the Conqueſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt thou haſt here a Sermon or Homelie, for the holy day of Eaſter, written in the old Engliſh or Saxon ſpeech, which doth of ſet purpoſe, and at large, intreat of this Doctrine, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And of ſuch Sermons be yet many books to be ſeen, partly remaining in private mens hands, and taken out from Monaſteries at their diſſolution: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet reſerved in the I ibraries of Cathedral Churches, as of Worceſter, Hereford, and Exeter. From which places diverſe of theſe books have been delivered into the hands of the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father, <hi>Matthew</hi> Arch-biſhop of Canterbury, by whoſe diligent ſearch for ſuch writings of Hiſtory and other Monuments of Antiquitie, as might reveal unto us what hath been the ſtate
<pb facs="tcp:106198:3"/>
of our Church in England from time to time, theſe things that be here made known unto thee do come to light. Howbeit the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were not firſt written in the old Saxon tongue: but were Tranſlated into it, as it ſhould appear, from the Latine. For about the end of a Saxon book of LX Sermons, (which hath about the middeſt of it this Sermon againſt the bodily preſence) be added theſe words of the Tranſlator, writ in Saxon, and thus Engliſhed. <hi>He let paſs many good Goſpels which he that liſt may Tranſlate. For we dare not enlarge this book much further, leaſt it be over great, and ſo cauſe to men lothſomneſs through his bigneſs.</hi> And in another book containing ſome of the Saxon Sermons it is alſo thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Latine. <hi>In ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In which words truly there is alſo declared who was the Tranſlator, to wit, one <hi>Aelfrick.</hi> And ſo he doth confeſs of himſelf in the Preface of his Saxon Grammer, where he doth moreover give us to underſtand the number of the Sermons that he Tranſlated thus. His words be in Saxon, and thus in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. <hi>I</hi> Aelfrick <hi>was deſirous to turn into our Engliſh tongue from the art of Letters called Grammer this little book, after that I had Tranſlated the Two books, in Fourſcore Sermons.</hi> But howſoever it be now manifeſt enough by this above declared, how that theſe Sermons were Tranſlated: I think notwithſtanding, that there will hardly be found of them any Latine books being (I fear me) utterly periſhed and made out of the way ſince the Conqueſt, by ſome which could not well brooke this Doctrine. And that ſuch hath been the dealing of ſome partial Readers, may partly hereof appear. There is yet a very Ancient book of Canons of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter Library, and is for the moſt part all in Latine, but yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled in certain places, even three or four leaves together, with the old Saxon tongue: and one place of this book handleth this matter of the Sacrament: but a few lines wherein did conſiſt the chief point of the Controverſie, be raſed out by ſome Reader: yet conſider how the corruption of him who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he was, is bewrayed. This part of the Latine book was
<pb facs="tcp:106198:3"/>
taken out of two Epiſtles of <hi>Alfricks</hi> before named, and were written of him as well in the Saxon tongue, as the Latine. The Saxon Epiſtles be yet wholely to be had in the Librarie of the ſame Church, in a book written all in Saxon, and is Intituled A Book of Canons, and Shrift book. But in the Church of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, theſe Epiſtles be ſeen both in the Saxon tongue, and alſo in the Latine. By the which it ſhall be eaſie for any to reſtore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, not only the ſenſe of the place raſed in Worceſter book, but alſo the very ſame Latine Words. And the words of theſe two Epiſtles, ſo much as concern the Sacramental bread and wine, we here ſet immediately after the Sermon: Firſt in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, then the words of the ſecond, in Engliſh and Latine: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them moſt faithfully as they are to be ſeen in the books from whence they are taken. And as touching the Saxon writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they be ſet out in ſuch form of Letters, and dark ſpeech, as was then uſed, when they were written: Tranſlated alſo for our better underſtanding, into our common and uſual Engliſh ſpeech. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For this new rearing up of Monkery is <hi>Aethelwolde</hi> called in moſt Hiſtories, <hi>Pater Monachorum,</hi> the Father of Monks. Under this <hi>Aethelwolde</hi> was <hi>Aelfrick</hi> traded up in learning, as he witneſſeth of himſelf in the Latine Preface of his Saxon Grammer, where ſpeaking of his interpreting La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine

words he writeth thus. <hi>Scio multis modis verba poſſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretari, ſed ego ſimplicem interpretationem ſequor faſtidium vitandi cauſa. Si alicui tamen diſplicuerit noſtra interpretatio, dicat quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo vult. Nos contenti ſumus ſicut didicimus in Scholis venerabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis praeſulis</hi> Aethelwoldi <hi>qui multos ad bonum imbuit.</hi> I know that words may be expounded diverſs waies, but for to avoid lothſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I do follow the plain Interpretation. Which if any ſhall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like he may do as he thinketh beſt: but we are content to ſpeak, as we have learned in the Schools of the moſt worthy Biſhop <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwolde,</hi> who hath been a good Inſtructor to many, or who hath brought up many to good. This he writeth of himſelf. So up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this his education in the Schools of <hi>Aethelwolde</hi> he became af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to be an earneſt lover and a great ſetter forwards of Monkery, and therefore no leſs buſie writer and ſpeaker againſt the Matrimony of Prieſts in his time. For which reſpect he was afterward ſo regarded, that he was made by <hi>Oſwalde</hi> Biſhop of Worceſter (as reporteth <hi>John Capgrave)</hi> the Firſt Abbot of St. Albons newly reſtored, and repleniſhed with Monks, and alſo made Abbot of Malmeſbury by King <hi>Edgar,</hi> (as reporteth <hi>William of Malmeſbury)</hi> in the life of <hi>Aldelmus.</hi> And truly he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf Abbot in diverſe of his Epiſtles, although he never named of what place, as in that he writeth <hi>Egneſhamenſibus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus de conſuetudine Monachorum.</hi> To the Monks of Egneſham, of the order and manner of Monks, and in this he writeth to <hi>Wulfſtane</hi> Arch-biſhop of York, and in another againſt Prieſts Matrimony ſent to one <hi>Sigeferth,</hi> with whom was an Anker abide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which defended the Marriage of Prieſts, affirming it to be lawful. The Epiſtle is in the Saxon tongue, and in our Engliſh thus, <hi>Aelfrick Abbot doth ſend friendly ſalutation to</hi> Sigeferth. <hi>It is told me that I teach otherwiſe in my Engliſh writings, then doth thy Anker teach, which is at home with thee. For he ſaith plainly that it is a lawful thing for a Prieſt to Marry, and my writings doth ſpeak againſt this,</hi> &amp;c.

Truly this <hi>Aelfrick</hi> we here ſpeak of, was equal in time to * <hi>Elfrick</hi> Arch-biſhop of Canterbury, as may certainly<note place="margin">Who did put out ſecular Prieſts out of the Church of Canterbury, as the ſtory of that houſe ſheweth.</note> appear to him that will conſider, when <hi>Wulfſtane</hi> Arch-biſhop of York, and <hi>Wulfſine</hi> Biſhop of Scyrburn lived, unto whom <hi>Ael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick</hi> writeth the Saxon Epiſtles, from which the words concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrament hereafter following be taken.

But be it, that this <hi>Aelfrick</hi> was onely Abbot, and not Arch-biſhop of Canterbury, yet this is alſo moſt true, that beſide the praiſe of great Learning, and of being a moſt eloquent interpreter (for which <hi>William</hi> of Malmeſbury doth greatly commend him) he was alſo of ſuch credit and eſtimation, to the liking of that age in which he lived, that all his Writings, and chiefly theſe his Epiſtles, were then thought to contain ſound doctrine: and the Biſhops themſelves did judge them full of right good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, Preceptes, and Rules to govern thereby their Clergy: and therefore did moſt earneſtly requeſt to have theſe Epiſtles ſent unto them, as do well appear by Two ſhort Latine Epiſtles, ſet before the Saxon Epiſtles, whereof the one is ſent to <hi>Wulfſine</hi> Biſhop of Scyrburne, the other to <hi>Wulfſtane</hi> Arch-biſhop of York.

<pb facs="tcp:106198:6"/>
of all ſuch Lands, Books, and other Things he gave unto the Church, expreſſed in the Saxon Tongue, but in Engliſh thus:</p>
            <p>Here is ſhewed in this Book or Charter, what <hi>Leofrike</hi> Biſhop hath given unto St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Minſter at Exeter, where his Biſhops Seat is; that is, That he hath got in again, through God's help, whatſoever was taken out, &amp;c.

Next, making alſo report what Lands, with other Treaſure of his own, he gave of new to the place. He cometh at laſt to the rehearſal of his Books, whereof the laſt here named is a Canon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>book in Latine, and a Shrift-book in Engliſh, is the Book we ſpeak of, and hath in it the Latine and Saxon Epiſtles of <hi>Aelfrick.</hi> Thus as this Book of Exeter Church hath this good evidence by which it is ſhewed, that <hi>Leofrike</hi> was the giver thereof; even ſo the Book of Canons of <hi>Worceſter</hi> Church, written all in Saxon, hath in it moſt certain teſtimony that the Writer thereof was the publick Scribe of the Church, whoſe name was <hi>Wulfgeat.</hi> For thus is it recorded therein, even with the ſame hand of the Scribe wherein all the Book is written.

               </gap>, touching the publick receiving of the Epiſtles of <hi>Aelfrick,</hi> wherein (I ſay) is denied the Bodily Preſence; and alſo by the infarcing afterward of theſe Epiſtles by Biſhops into their Books of Canons, in ſtead of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to be uſed unto their Clergy, it is not hard to know not only ſo much what <hi>Aelfrick's</hi> judgment was in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, but alſo that more is, what was the common received Doctrine herein of the Church of England, as well when <hi>Aelfrick</hi> himſelf lived, as before his time, and alſo after his time, even from him to the Conqueſt. But what was the condition and ſtate of the Church when <hi>Aelfrick</hi> himſelf lived? In deed to confeſs the truth, it was in divers points of Religion full of blindneſs and ignorance; full of childiſh ſervitude to Ceremonies, as it was long before and after; and too much given to the love of Monkery, which now at this time unmeaſurably took root, and grew exceſſively. But yet to ſpeak what the Adverſaries of the Truth have judged of this time, it is moſt certain, that there is no Age of the Church of England which they have more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced, and thought more holy than this. For of what Age have they Canonized unto us more Saints, and to their liking more notable? Firſt <hi>Odo</hi> Arch-biſhop of Canterbury, who died in the beginning of King <hi>Edgar's</hi> Reign. Then King <hi>Edgar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by whom <hi>Aelfrick</hi> was made Abbot of Malmsbury. Then <hi>Edward</hi> called the Martyr, King <hi>Edgar's</hi> Baſtard-Son. Then <hi>Editha,</hi> King <hi>Edgar's</hi> Baſtard-Daughter. Alſo <hi>Dunſtane</hi> Arch-biſhop of Canterbury, of whom <hi>Aelfrick</hi> was greatly eſteemed. <hi>Aethelwold</hi> Biſhop of Wincheſter, under whom <hi>Aelfrick</hi> had his firſt bringing up. <hi>Oſwald</hi> Biſhop of Worceſter, and after Arch-biſhop of York, who made <hi>Aelfrick</hi> Abbot of St. Albons. <hi>Wulf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine</hi> Biſhop of Scyrburn, unto whom <hi>Aelfrick</hi> writeth the firſt of the Epiſtles we here ſpeak of. <hi>Elfleda</hi> a Nun of Romeſey, and <hi>Wulhilda</hi> Abbeſs of Barking, lived in the daies of King <hi>Edgar.</hi> And laſt of all <hi>Wulfritha,</hi> King <hi>Edgar's</hi> Concubine. All theſe, I ſay, with ſome other more, be Canonized for Saints of
<pb facs="tcp:106198:8"/>
this Age in which <hi>Aelfrick</hi> himſelf lived in great fame and credit. Alſo <hi>Leofrick</hi> and <hi>Wulfſine,</hi> whom we have ſhewed to have been the givers of thoſe (anon-books, wherein be ſeen <hi>Aelfricks</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, be reverenced for moſt holy Men, and Saints of their Churches. And theſe two lived Biſhops in the coming in of the Conqueror. Thus do ſome men now-a-daies, not only diſſent in doctrine from their own Church, but alſo from that Age of their Church which they have thought moſt holy, and judged a moſt excellent pattern to be followed. Wherefore what may we now think of that great conſent whereof the Romaniſts have long made vaunt, to wit, Their Doctrine to have continued many hundred years, as it were linked together with a continual chain, whereof hath been no breach at any time? Truly this their ſo great affirmation hath uttered unto us no truth, as (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader) thou mayeſt well judge by duly weighing of this which hath been ſpoken, and by the reading alſo of that which here followeth, whereunto I now leave thee.</p>
            <p>Truſting that after thou haſt well weighed this matter of ſuch manner of the being of Chriſts Body in the Sacrament, as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Teſtimony, no untruth or diſhonour ſhall need to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Chriſt's loving words pronounced at his laſt Supper among his Apoſtles; no derogation to his moſt Sacred Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; no diminiſhing of any comfort to Chriſtian mens ſouls in the uſe of his reverend Sacrament: but all things to ſtand right up, moſt agreeably both to the verity of Chriſts infallible words, and to the right nature, congruence, and efficacies of ſo holy a Sacrament; and finally moſt comfortable to the conſcience of man, for his ſpiritual uniting and incorporation with Chriſt's bleſſed Body and Bloud to immortality, and for the ſure Gage of his Reſurrection.</p>

God ſaith unto <hi>Moſes, Eat of the Lamb nothing raw, or ſodden in water, but roſted with fire.

            <p>Part of this story we have treated of in another place, part we ſhall now declare, (to wit) that which belongeth to the holy houſell.

That innocent Lamb which the old Iſraelites did then kill, had ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after ghoſtly underſtanding of Chriſts ſuffering, who unguilty ſhed his holy blood for our Redemption.

He is ſaid bread by ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Lamb, and a Lyon, and ſome where otherwiſe. He is called Bread, becauſe he is our life and Angells life. He is ſaid to be a Lamb for his innocency. A Lyon for ſtrength wherewith he overcame the ſtrong Devil. But Christ is not ſo notwithſtanding after true nature neither Bread, nor a Lamb, nor a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Why is then the holy houſell, called Chriſts

Truely the bread and wine which by the Maſs of the Prieſt is hallowed, ſhew one thing without to humane understanding, and an other thing they call within to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing minds. Without they be ſeen bread and wine both in figure and in taſt: and they be truely after their hallowing Christs body and his blood through ghoſtly myſtery. An heathen child is chriſtened, yet he altereth not his ſhape without, though he be changed within. He is brought to the font-stone ſinful through <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now we ſee two things in this one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. After true nature that water is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible water, and after ghoſtlie myſtery, hath hollowing might. So alſo if we behold that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106198:13"/>
holy houſell after bodily underſtanding, then ſee we that it is a creature corruptible and mutable: if we acknowledge therein ghoſtly might, then underſtand we that life is therein, and that it giveth immortality to them that eat it with belief. Much is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the inviſible might of the holy houſell, and the viſible ſhape of his proper nature. It is<note n="*" place="margin">No Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> naturally corruptible bread, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible wine: and is by might of Gods word truly Chriſts body, and his blood: not ſo not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding bodily, but ghoſtly. Much is<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betwixt Chriſts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament thereof.</note> betwixt the 𝄁 body Chriſt ſuffered in, and the body that is hallowed to houſell.

               <note n="*" place="margin">Not the body that ſuffered is in the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</note> fleſh of <hi>Mary,</hi> with blood, and with bone, with ſkin, and with ſinewes, in humane limbs, with a reaſonable ſoul living: and his ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body, which we call the houſell, is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of many cornes: without blood, and bone, without limb, without ſoul: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing is to be underſtood therein bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but all is ghoſtly to be underſtood. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in that houſell, which giveth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of life, that is of the ghoſtly might,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106198:13"/>
and inviſible doing. Therefore is that holy houſell called a myſterie, becauſe there is one thing in it ſeen, &amp; an other thing understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That which is there<note n="*" place="margin">2. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> ſeen, hath bodilie ſhape: and that we do there underſtand, hath ghoſtlie might.

This pledge we do keep myſticallie, untill we be come to the truth it ſelf: and then is this pledg ended. Truly it is ſo as we before have ſaid Chriſts body, and his blood: not bodilie, but ghoſtlie. And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106198:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ye ſhould not ſearch how it is done, but hold it in your belief that it is ſo done. We read in an other book called <hi>Vita patrum,</hi> that two Monkes deſired of God ſome demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration<note place="margin">Theſe tales ſeem to be infarſed, placed here upon no occaſion.</note> touching the holy houſell, and after their requeſt, as they stood to hear Maſs, they ſaw a child lying on the altar, where the Prieſt ſaid Maſs, and Gods Angel ſtood with a ſword, and abode looking untill the Priest brake the houſel. Then the Angel divided that child upon the diſh, and ſbed his blood into the Chalice. But when they did go to the houſel, then was it turned to bread and wine, and they did eat it, giving God thanks for that ſhewing. Alſo <hi>S. Gregory</hi> deſired of Chriſt, that he would ſhew to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain woman doubting about his mysterie ſome great affirmation. She went to houſell with doubting mind, and <hi>Gregory</hi> forthwith ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of God, that to them both was ſhewed that part of the houſel which the woman ſhould receive, as if there lay in a diſh a joynt of a finger all beblooded: and ſo the womans doubting was then forthwith healed. But now hear the Apoſtles words about this myſtery.

It is very good for Chriſtian men, that they go often to houſel, if thy bring with them to the Altar unguiltineſs, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of heart.

And therefore ſhall neither the one without the other be offered at the holy Maſs, that Chriſt may be with us, and we with Chriſt; the head with the limbs, and the limbs with the head. We would before have intreated of the Lamb which the old Iſraelites offered at their Eaſter time, but that we deſired firſt to declare unto you of this myſterie, and after how we ſhould receive it. That ſignifying Lamb was offered at the Eaſter. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the Epiſtle of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, that Chriſt is our Eaſter, who was offered for us, and on this day roſe from death. The Iſraelites did eat the Lambs fleſh as God commanded with unleavened bread, and wild Lettice:<note n="*" place="margin">How we ſhould come to the holy! Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſo we ſhould receive that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſel of Chriſts body and bloud without the leaven of ſin, and iniquitie. As leaven turneth the creatures from their nature: ſo doth ſin alſo change the nature of man from innocencie to uncleanneſs. The Apoſtle hath taught how we ſhould feaſt not in the leaven of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106198:17"/>
evilneſs but in the ſweet dough of puritie and truth. The hearb which they ſhould eat with the unleavened bread is called Lettice, and is bitter in taſt. So we ſhould with bitterneſs of unfained repentance purifie our mind, if we will eat Chriſts bodie. Thoſe iſraelites were not wont to eat raw fleſh, although God forbad them to eat it raw, and ſodden in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but roſted with fire. He ſhall receive the bodie of God raw, that ſhall think without reaſon that Chriſt was only man like unto us, and was not God. And he that will after mans wiſdom ſearch of the myſterie of Chriſts Incarnation, doth like unto him that doth ſeethe Lambs-fleſh in water; becauſe that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this ſame place ſignifieth mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: but we ſhould underſtand that all the myſterie of Chriſts Humanitie was ordered by the power of the Holy Ghoſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And then eat we his body roſted with fire; becauſe the Holy Ghost came in fiery likeneſs to the Apoſtles in diverſe Tongues. The Iſraelites ſhould eat the Lambs head, and the feet, and the purtenance; and nothing thereof muſt be left over night: If any thing thereof were left,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106198:17"/>
they did burn that in the fire: and they break not the bones. After ghoſtly understanding we do then eat the Lambs head, when we take hold of Chriſts Divinitie in our Belief. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain when we take hold of his Humanitie with Love, then eat we the Lambs feet: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Chriſt is the beginning and end, God before all world, and Man in the end of this world. whit be the Lambs Purtenance, but Chriſts ſecret precepts, and theſe we eat, when we receive with greedineſs the word of Life. There must nothing of the Lamb be left unto the morning, becauſe that all Gods ſayings are to be ſearched with great carefulneſs: ſo that all his precepts may be known in understanding and deed in the night of this preſent life, before that the laſt day of the univerſal reſurrection do appear. If we cannot ſearch out throughly all the myſterie of Chriſts Incarnation, then ought we to betake the reſt unto the might of the Holy Ghost with true humilitie: and not to ſearch raſhly of that deep ſecretneſs above the meaſure of our underſtanding. They did eat the Lambs fleſh with their loynes girt. In the loines is the lust of the bodie. And he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106198:18"/>
which will receive that houſel, ſhall cover that concupiſcence: and take with chaſtitie that holy receipt. They were alſo ſhod. What be ſhoes but of the hides of dead beasts. We be truly ſhod if we follow in our ſteps and deeds the life of men departed which pleaſe God with keeping of hiscommandements. They had Staves in their hands when they eat. This stafe ſignifieth a carefulneſs and a diligent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeing. And all they, that beſt know and can, ſhould take care of other men, and ſtay them up with their help. It was injoyned to the eaters that they ſhould eat the Lamb in haſte. For God abhoreth ſlouthfulneſs in his ſervants. And thoſe he loveth that ſeek the joy of everlaſting life with quickneſs, and haſt of mind. It is written: Prolong not to turn unto God, leaſt the time paſs away through thy ſlow tarrying. The eaters might not break the Lambs bones. No more might the Souldiers, that did hang Christ break his holy legs, as they did of the two Theeves that hanged on either ſide of him. And the Lord r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Howbeit we ſhould firſt in this preſent life depart from vice to holy virtue; from evil manners to good manners, if we will after this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life go to that eternal life, and after our reſurrection to Christ.

            <q>SOme Prieſts keep the houſel that is hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed on Eaſter day all the year for ſick men. But they do greatly amiſs, becauſe it waxeth hoary. And theſe will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how grievous pennance the Penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al book teacheth by this, if the houſel become hoary and rotten: or if it be loſt, or be eaten of Miſe or of beaſts by negligence. Men ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve more carefully that holy houſel, and not reſerve it too long, but hallow other of new for ſick men alwaies within a week or a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, that it be not ſo much as hoary. For ſo holy is the houſel which to day is hallowed as that which on Eaſter day was hallowed. That houſel is Christs body not bodily, but ghostly. Not the body which he ſuffered in, but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106198:19"/>
of which he ſpake, when he bleſſed bread and wine to houſel a night before his ſuffering, and ſaid by the bleſſed bread, This is my body; and again by the holy wine, This is my blood, which is ſhed for many in forgivneſs of ſins. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand now that the Lord, who could turn that bread before his ſuffering to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that wine to his blood ghostly; that the ſelf ſame Lord bleſſeth daily through the Prieſts hands bread and wine to his ghostly body, and to his ghoſtly blood.</q>
            <p>Here thou ſeeſt good Reader how <hi>Aelfrick</hi> upon finding fault with an abuſe of his time, which was that Prieſts on Eaſter day filled their houſel box, and ſo kept the bread a a whole year for ſick men, took an occaſion to ſpeak againſt the bodily preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament. So alſo in another Epiſtle ſent to <hi>Wulfſtane</hi> Arch-biſhop of York, he reprehending again this overlong reſerving of the houſel, addeth alſo words more at large againſt the ſame bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.

            <q>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:106198:20"/>
SOme Prieſts fill their box for houſel on Eaſter day, and ſo reſerve it a whole year for ſick men, as though that houſel were more holy then any other. But they do unadviſedly, becauſe it waxeth black, or altogether rotten by keeping it ſo long ſpace. And thus is he become guilty, as the book witneſseth to us. If any do keep the houſel too long, or looſe it, or Miſe or other beaſts do eat it, ſee what the Penetential book ſayeth by this. So holy is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together that houſel, which is hallowed to day, as that which is hallowed on Eaſter day. Wherefore I beſeech you to keep that holy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt with more adviſement for ſick men from Sonday to Sonday in a very clean box: or at moſt not to keep it above a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and then eat it laying other in the place. We have an example hereof in <hi>Moſes</hi> books, as God himſelf hath commanded in <hi>Moſes</hi> law. How the Prieſts ſhould ſet on every Saterday twelve loaves all new baked upon the Tabernacle: the which were called <hi>Panes praepoſitionis:</hi> and thoſe ſhould ſtand there on Gods Tabernacle, till the next Saterday, and then did the Prieſts themſelves eat them,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106198:20"/>
and ſet other in the place. Some Prieſts will not eat the houſel which they do hallow. But we will now declare unto you how the book ſpeaketh by them. <hi>Presbyter miſſam cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brans, &amp; non audens ſumere ſacrificium, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſante conſcientia ſua, Anathema eſt.</hi> The Prieſt that doth ſay Maſs and dare not eat the houſel, his conſcience accuſing him, is accurſed. It is leſs danger to receive the houſel, then to hallow it. He that doth twice hallow one Hoſt to houſel, is like unto thoſe Hereticks, who do Chriſten twice one child. Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bleſſed houſel hefore his ſuffering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He bleſſed the bread and brake, thus ſpeaking to his Apoſtles. Eat this bread it is my body. And again he bleſſed one Chalice with wine, and thus alſo ſpeaketh unto them. Drink ye all of this it is mine own blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant which is ſhed for many in forgivneſs of ſins. The Lord which halowed houſel before his ſuffering and ſaith that the bread was his own body, and that the wine was truly his blood, he haloweth daily by the hands of the Prieſts bread to his body, and wine to his blood in ghostly myſterie, as we read in books. And yet that lively bread is not bodily ſo not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106198:21"/>
not the ſelf ſame bodie that Chriſt ſuffered in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor that holy wine is the Saviours blood which was ſhed for us in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily thing, but in ghoſtlie underſtanding. Both be truly that bread his bodie, and that wine alſo his blood, as was the heavenly bread, which we call <hi>Manna,</hi> that fed forty years Gods people. And the clear water which did then run from the Stone in the wilderneſs, was truly his blood, as <hi>Paul</hi> wrot on ſome of his Epiſtles. <hi>Omnes patres noſtri eandem eſcam ſpiritualem man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducaverunt, &amp; omnes eundem potum ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualem biberunt,</hi> &amp;c. All our Fathers eat in the wilderueſs the ſame ghoſtly meat and drank the ſame ghoſtlie drink. They drank of that ghoſtlie ſtone, and that ſtone was Chriſt. The Apoſtle hath ſaid as you have heard, that they all did eat the ſame ghoſtlie meat, and they all did drink the ſame ghoſtly drink. And he ſaith not bodilie but ghoſtlie. And Chriſt was not yet born, nor his blood ſhed, when that the people of Iſrael eat that meat, and drank of that ſtone. And the ſtone was not bodilie Chriſt though he ſo ſaid. It was the ſame myſterie in the old law, and they did ghoſtlie ſignifie that ghoſtlie hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of our Saviours bodie which we conſecrate now.</q>

Howbeit we keep not here alwaies the ſame order: nor yet Tranſlate word for word, but ſenſe for ſenſe. Now becauſe very few there be that do underſtand the old Engliſh or Saxon (ſo muc h i our ſpeech changed from the uſe of that time, wherein <hi>Elfrick</hi> lived) and for that alſo it may be that ſome will doubt how skilfully, and alſo faithfully theſe words of <hi>Elfrick</hi> be Tranſlated from the Saxon tongue: we have thought good to ſet down here laſt of all the very words alſo of his Latine Epiſtle, which is recorded in books fair written of old in the Cathedral Churches of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Exeter.</hi>

AS the writings of the Fathers, even of the Firſt age of the Church, be not thought on all parts ſo perfect, that whatſoever thing hath been of them ſpoken ought to be received without all exception, (which honor truly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves both knew and alſo have confeſſed to be only due to the moſt holy and tryed word of God:) So in this Sermon here publiſhed, ſome things be ſpoken not conſonant to ſound doctrine: but rather to ſuch corruption of great ignorance and ſuperſtition, as hath taken root in the Church of long time, being overmuch cumbred with Monkery. As where it ſpeaketh of <hi>The Maſs to be profitable to the quick and dead: Of the mixture with water with wine:</hi> and whereas there is alſo made mention of Two vaine Miracles, which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeem to have been infarced, for that they ſtand in their place unaptly, and without purpoſe, and the matter without them, both before and after, doth hang in it ſelt together moſt orderly; with ſome other Superſtitious words, ſounding to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. But all theſe things that be thus of ſome reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be as it were but by the way touched: the full and whole diſcourſe of all the former part of the Sermon, and almoſt of the whole Sermon is about the underſtanding of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread and wine, how it is the body and blood of Chriſt our Saviour, by which is revealed and made known, what hath been the common taught doctrine of the Church of England on this behalf many hundred years agoe, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto the unadviſed writing of ſome now a daies. Now that this foreſaid Saxon Homely, with other Teſtimonies before alledged, do fully agree to the old ancient books (whereof ſome be written in the old Saxon, and ſome in the Latine) from whence they are taken: theſe here under written upon diligent peruſing, and comparing the ſame have found
