            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>IT may too truly be ſaid of the Miniſters of
Chriſt, that it often fares with the Births
of their Brains, as with the Fruit of their
Loyns; their Books have the ſame fate with
their Children, who though well maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and much reſpected in the life time of their
Parents; yet are afterwards expoſed to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and often to contempt; unleſs their own
merits renew the leaſe of that which none
could ever yet call inheritance. The <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous
Works</hi> of the Servants of Chriſt, will
(like helpleſs <hi>Orphans)</hi> ſuffer by the rough
hands of violence and injury, unleſs they
can redeem themſelves at more than an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
rate of worth. Wherefore this Book,
now put into thy hands, hath brought its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
money with it for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Though the <hi>Name</hi> alone of the <hi>Author</hi>
(being <hi>among the firſt Three)</hi> might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb facs="tcp:104282:3"/>
it a reputation in any Age but this, his
<hi>Works</hi> having ſaid that for him in the <hi>Gate,</hi>
which Envy it ſelf cannot gain ſay: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
it bids ſo high for the acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all, by its own worth and excellency,
that he muſt be condemned for a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſed
ſenſes</hi> in the matters of <hi>good and evil,</hi>
that ſhall not embrace it upon its own terms.</p>
            <p>The publiſhing the Labours of ſuch Men
of worth, is of an happy tendency to promote
our communion with them in the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
whom it may be we never ſaw in the <hi>Fleſh;</hi>
and it is to be reckoned among our mercies,
when the dead are made to ſpeak, that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
may be perſwaded to hear: for this
thou art indebted to the faithful pen of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Writer, whoſe indefatigable and (for
ought I yet know) unparallel'd induſtry, hath
already bleſſed the World with ſo many of
the grateful labours of this ſervant of Chriſt,
whoſe Name knows no rottenneſs.</p>

               <q>In all things I am inſtructed, both to be full, &amp;c.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>YOu may remember the laſt day we finiſhed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Chriſtian Contentment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cloſe of that Point, it was the propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſeveral Conſiderations for <hi>Chriſtian Contentment,</hi>
And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, We gave ſeveral Directions what to do,
that we might have the exerciſe of the Grace of <hi>Chriſtian
Contentment:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And among all others, that's one ſpecial thing that then
I commended, and ſtill would but pick out, To name that
concerns the power of God; and that is, The making of
a good interpretation of Gods mercies and dealings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. Have good thoughts of God, and make
good interpretations of what the dealings of God are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you. It's very hard to live comfortably and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
among friends, when one makes hard interpretations
of the words and actions of another: The onely way to keep
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104282:4"/>
ſweet contentment and comfort in Chriſtian Societies, and
to make the beſt interpretation of things as we can. And
ſo, a chief way and help to keep comfort and contentment
in our hearts, is to make good interpretations of Gods
dealing towards us.</p>
            <p>But I would not look back to any thing that I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
concerning that Argument, but leave thoſe things
that have been delivered, to the bleſſing of God upon
you; hoping that when any Temptation ariſes for Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
that ſome truths that have been delivered, may
come into your Minds: and that ſome of you may be able,
when you ſee others diſcontented, as the Wife with the
Husband, the Husband with the Wife, or one Brother
or Friend with another, to make uſe of ſomething out of
the Text for this Grace of Contentment. For though we
have been preaching a long time of it, yet it is longer a
learning then it is a teaching; you need be longer time to
learn it than I have been a preaching of it. It is not a few
weeks that will learn it, we had need be years a learning
this great Leſſon.</p>
            <p>Well, but now we are come to another leſſon that is
as hard to learn as this; and that is, How to be full. I
have learned, ſaith he, how to be content in all Eſtates;
<hi>I am inſtructed how to be full.</hi> Now this, though it be a
hard leſſon, yet becauſe theſe times are times wherein
that generally people ſuffer, and have not things ſo full
as formerly; therefore I told you, I would not be ſo large
upon this Argument as upon the other; that being more
ſuitable: and yet becauſe the truth is, we that live here,
in compariſon of our Brethren in other parts, though we
be not ſo full as we have been, yet we may be ſaid to be
full; and the leſſon will be uſeful and profitable (I hope)
to us to learn how to be full, and it's the onely way for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104282:4"/>
God to haſten our fullneſs, if we be taught how to be full
when it comes. I ſhall come to ſpeak of this Leſſon, <hi>I
am inſtructed how to be full</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either full or empty, any way. There's many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
they are neither well (as we uſe to ſay) full nor faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
If they be in affliction, then they are froward and
diſcontented; if they be in proſperity, there they are
wanton; juſt like Children, if you let them not have
what they would have, then they cry and are froward;
and if you do let them have what they would have, then
they are wanton; and ſo they are not in order any way.
There are ſome of ſuch croſs and untoward diſpoſitions,
that in whatever condition they be put into, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward.
As I remember I have read of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he ſaid
concerning <hi>Marcellus, He can neither bear good nor ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;</hi>
ſo he called it: That is, if he be conquered, he
cannot tell how to bear that; no nor he cannot tell how
to be a Conqueror. So there are ſome, having untoward
hearts, are untoward in every ſtate they are put into:
But <hi>Paul</hi> by the work of the Grace of God, he was fitted
for all eſtates; not only for affliction, but if God did will
him proſperity, he could tell how to make uſe of that.
A place ſomewhat parallel to this we have in the <hi>2 Cor. 6.
8.</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſhews the different condition that
he went through; <hi>By honour and diſhonour, by evil report
and good report.</hi> Sometimes the Apoſtles had honour,
ſometimes they had diſhonour; ſometimes people report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
well of them, and ſometimes they reported ill of them;
yet, ſaith he, we went through all, we carried on the
work of the Goſpel in all things: and ſo in the 10th. verſe,
<hi>As ſorrowful, yet alwayes rejoycing; as poor, yet making
many rich;</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whatever our condition were, yet through
the grace of God we were carried through it; and ſo as to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104282:5"/>
ſanctifie Gods name, and to further the Goſpel in it.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men are fit for one condition, but they are not fit for
another: But this was the excellency of the Grace of God
in the Apoſtle, that he was fit for any condition; God
might turn him to any thing. Now then, for the Leſſon,
of being full, that's our point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a Chriſtian is taught by God to know how to be
full.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note> He learns this Leſſon. There's many would be
glad to hear of a leſſon how they ſhould get to be full;
but to know how they ſhould ſanctifie Gods name in their
fulneſs, this they think not ſo much needful. If I could
preach a Sermon or two to you, to teach you all how you
ſhould get, how to ſupply your want, and be made full;
I make no queſtion but we ſhould have very full Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations:
for ſuch Sermons as theſe, To teach poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
how they ſhould get to be rich, to teach thoſe that are
diſgraced, how they ſhould get to be honoured; to teach
men how they ſhould get good and proſperous voyages
(and the like.) But I am teaching you a leſſon as from
God, or God rather than man, at this time; that is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and is a better leſſon; for one to know how to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God in fullneſs, then it is to know how they ſhould
get to be full. And it were a good ſign of truth of grace
for you to judge this to be the better thing: That is, I had
rather know how to honour God in what good thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
have, then to know wayes how to get more: I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know how I might behave my ſelf in the enjoyment
of thoſe good things God hath given me, then to know
how to get more of thoſe good things. God hath given
me ſome competent meaſure of eſtate, that my houſe hath
a fulneſs in it; for I have all things needful. It may be
you have not ſo much bravery as others have, but what
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104282:5"/>
do many of you want in your Houſes, you have all kind
of Houſhold-ſtuffe that is needful for you, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Diet that is needful for you. Then you are full, when
you have things needful, though your Eye be not full.
We uſe to ſay, It's better to fill a Childs Belly than his Eye.
Perhaps your fancy is not full, but your neceſſity is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;
and when the neceſſity of a Man or Woman is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
his condition may be ſaid to be full: and therefore
let not thoſe that are in a poorer condition than others,
think that this condition concerns not them. Thou haſt
not ſo much as others have, I but you have enough to
keep you in health and ſtrength, fitted for the ſervice of
God. Now that's a full condition.</p>
            <p>Now we are to be taught this Leſſon, How we ſhould
honour God in the fulneſs that God hath ſet any of us in;
and I ſhall caſt what I ſhall ſpeak of this Leſſon into theſe
ſeven Heads; yet I intend to be but very brief in them,
though they might take up as much time as the former
Leſſons have done. Theſe are the ſeven Heads:</p>
            <p>1. When may a Man be ſaid to have learned how to be
full. <hi>I am instructed,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and know how to be
full.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall ſhew you the difficulty of this Leſſon.</p>
            <p>3. The neceſſity of this Leſſon, What great need there
is that we ſhould learn how to be full.</p>
            <p>4. The Excellency of this Leſſon, What an excellent
thing it is for a Man to know how to be full. And then,</p>
            <p>5. The Myſtery of Godlineſs that there is in this Leſſon.
There is a Myſtery in this as well as in the other.</p>

            <p>7. The Application of all. Theſe are the ſeven Heads
that I ſhall caſt the matter into.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> For the firſt, When hath a Man learned how to be full?
What do you mean, when you ſay that Chriſt doth teach
his people to know how to be full? A Man hath learned
how to be full, when he hath attained to theſe ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, When a Man hath learned to ſet a due price on his
fullneſs. When he hath learned to ſet a due price and
value upon thoſe mercies that God hath been pleaſed to
grant unto him: When he can prize them, not too high nor
too low, but as they are, thoſe mercies that God grants
him. A Man doth not learn to be full, when he doth not
underſtand what the mercies are that God hath granted to
him. As no man can attain to the grace of Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
that is ſtupid under affliction, he muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
his affliction, and know his affliction, or elſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come to Chriſtian Contentment: ſo neither can We
learn how to be full, except we know what the mercies
are that God hath granted to us. If a man ſhould enjoy
many mercies, and doth not underſtand them, he is not
taught how to be full; he muſt prize the mercy that God
hath granted to him, at a due rate. As he muſt look upon
(even theſe outward mercies) as the good bleſſings of
God to him, he muſt not ſlight them; and he muſt look
upon them as coming to him from the promiſe. Godlineſs
hath the promiſe of this life, and the promiſe of the life
to come; as a fruit of the promiſe of God to him, and as
Gods goodneſs for the encouraging of him in the way <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:104282:6"/>
righteous God hath ſet him in. He muſt ſo look upon the
outward things that he doth enjoy. He muſt look upon
them as good Utenſils (as I may ſo ſpeak) as affording op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to do God ſervice in the place where God hath
ſet him: And ſo good things, in that regard he muſt prize
them according to the due value of them. A man that
ſlights Gods mercies and thinks there is little in them, he
doth not know how to be full. But now, as he muſt not
prize them at too low a rate, his Health and Eſtate, and
Comfort that he hath; neither will he prize them at too
high a rate; they are mercies, but they are but outward
mercies: they come to me from Gods goodneſs, I but it's
from Gods general Goodneſs. Though it's true, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
may look upon every mercy that he hath, as coming
from another fountain than the ungodly; but yet the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
goodneſs of God is enough to beſtow the things
themſelves: For the matter of them, they are mercies,
but they are but common mercies: Indeed I have them,
but yet they are no other, but that a Reprobate may have
as well as my ſelf. They are good things, but they are not
ſuch good things as they make any one to be good. There
are good things, that are not only given by God freely,
but they do make thoſe acceptable unto God, that God
gives them. Here's the difference between all the good
things that we are ſpeaking of now, as the fullneſs of
Eſtate, the outward Comforts of this world, and the
things of Grace: Why the things of Grace are given by
God freely, and they make thoſe that they are given unto
to be acceptable to God; they are ſuch things as makes them
to be good in Gods eye. But now, let God give never ſo
much outward things, they make one to be never a whit
the better in Gods eye. Though we ſay, Such a man is
the beſt man in the Pariſh, yet certainly, ſuch things
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104282:7"/>
makes not a man the better. Grace makes a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
the better. But now, as the fulneſs of proſperity, it
hath onely a goodneſs in it ſo far as it makes them to be
good, but grace that's good in its ſelf. But now, theſe
things are good as a man may have, and not good to
him. If they be good to him, it muſt be from ſome good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that he hath himſelf; as he ſhall uſe them: that's the
firſt thing. When a man ſhall come to know the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the fulneſs of his outward mercies, not prize them
at too high a rate, nor at too low a rate; then he learns to
be full: That's the firſt thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Then doth a man learn to know how to be
full, when he can tell how to make uſe of what he hath:
when he can tell how to proportion the uſe of that fulneſs
that God gives him. When he can tell how much will
ſerve his turn for the uſe of it, and how little; and at
what time to make uſe of ſuch and ſuch comforts of the
creature, and how much uſe to make of them: then he
hath lerned how to be full. There's many men that
when they have a fulneſs, Firſt, They know not how to
prize it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they know not the worth of it. Secondly, They
know not how to make uſe of what they ſhould, how
much or how little, or at what time they ſhould make
uſe of the good things that God doth give unto them:
ſo as they come to be exceſſive, yea defective in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of what the Lord grants to them. Some are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive,
that becauſe they have abundance of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
they ſtill are taking in of more than is any way
uſeful to them for their fulneſs: They think that they
may do what they will with their own. 'Tis not enough
(my Brethren) becauſe a man's Drink is his own, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to drink as much as he pleaſes: Or becauſe his Meat
is his own, therefore to eat as much as he will, and not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104282:7"/>
to know how to order and moderate: Or becauſe his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
is his own, therefore to ſpend it as he liſt, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
way. I remember for that, it was the anſwer of a
Philoſopher <hi>Zeno,</hi> when he did reprove an exceſſive
Feaſting: This was anſwered to him, <hi>And why do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it, he ſpends nothing but his own.</hi> The Philoſopher
could anſwer thus, <hi>Is this a good Anſwer, That you ſpend
of your own; ſuppoſe you had a Cook that had a great deal
of Salt, and he ſhould put two or three handfuls into your
Meat, for the ſeaſoning of it; and being askt why he did
ſo, he ſhould anſwer, I had Salt enough; and the Salt did
not coſt much: there was enough in the place where I had it:
or I can have more at an eaſie rate. Would this be good
Anſwer?</hi> ſaith he. So, 'tis not enough, for to ſay, that
our Eſtates are our own, and therefore we may be exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
in the uſe of the Creature. No, thou haſt not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
how to be full, till thou haſt learned how much will
ſerve thy turn for thy uſe. It may be God gives thee a
great deal of the Creature, but he intends that thou
ſhalt not make uſe of it all for thy ſelf. God gives thee ſo
much a year, it is not becauſe that thou ſhouldeſt ſpend it
all upon thy own Back and Belly. Thou haſt not learned
how to be full, till thou haſt learned how to proportion
the uſe of thy Eſtate and outward Comforts that thou
doſt enjoy, according to thy need. Then doth a man
learn, That though he be in the midſt of abundance, yet
he makes no more uſe of that he hath than is fit for him.
Though a man be at a Feaſt where there are a great many
Diſhes, is it enough for him to ſay, There was a great
deal of Cheer, and therefore for him to be a Glutton.
Then doth a man know how to be temperate, when he is
in the midſt of a great many Diſhes, and knows which is
fitteſt for his Body, and feeds moderately on them. That's
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104282:8"/>
the ſecond thing, Firſt, How to put a due valuation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mercy, and then, Secondly, How to proportion the
uſe of mercy, ſo much at ſuch a time, and ſo much at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
time. And then,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When a man can uſe the comforts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and yet ſo as he is inabled to avoid the evil of the
temptation that goes along with the Creature: As we
ſhall ſhew afterwards, there are abundance of temptations
that go along with fulneſs. Now then doth a man learn
how to be full, when he can make uſe of the Creature;
and yet ſtill ſo as to deliver himſelf from the evil of thoſe
temptations that are joyned together with the Creature.
And that's a wiſe man, a wiſe woman, that knows how to
make uſe of all the comforts that God gives unto them,
that they have any uſe of, and yet can tell how to avoid
the temptations; can be able to diſtinguiſh between the
good and the evil of temptation that doth cleave unto the
good thing. You many times ſwallow down all, all is
fiſh that comes to net; you think there is no temptation in
the fulneſs that you have, but take it down without any
conſideration of what temptation may be joyned with the
fullneſs. You are wiſer with your ſelves other wayes.
If you eat a Fiſh that is full of little bones, you will be
picking out thoſe little bones; you will not preſently
ſwallow it down in whole bitts: So you ſhould conſider,
when God gives you fullneſs, O there may be many little
bones together with it; yea, if you do not take heed, it
may be wrapt up in ſuch a skin, that may be bitterneſs to
you, unleſs you pick out ſomething. If you ſwallow it
down whole, it may be a poyſon to you. Now doth a
man or woman know how to be full, when they can tell
how to pick out the temptation; to enjoy the thing, and
yet avoid the temptation. There are ſome, becauſe they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104282:8"/>
hear there are many temptations in the enjoyment of the
comforts of the Creature, they think there is no way but
to fling away the Creature. As that <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> becauſe
he ſaw that ſo many were hurt by their wealth, he caſt
his money into the Sea, ſaying, <hi>I will drown you, least
you ſhould drown me.</hi> Now this is not to learn how to be
full, that is, becauſe I would avoid the temptation, not
to enjoy the comfort and the bleſſing; as many men and
women, through weakneſs and tenderneſs of conſcience,
being afraid that they ſhall get hurt by the uſe of the
Creatures that God doth give them: Upon that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
themſelves abundance of comfort in the Creature that
they ſhould have. Now, though God may accept of their
deſires to honour him, and of their fearfulneſs of ſinning
againſt him; but yet this argues a great deal of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
The ſtrength of a Chriſtian is to enjoy Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to take the uſe of that that God doth afford, to
take out the ſweetneſs, and yet to avoid the temptation;
to take away that that's good, and caſt away that that is
naught. As there's many kind of Meats, which you may
not eat all of them; and a child, who muſt either have all
or none, you will not give it meat that hath ſomething
mingled with it that is naught, becauſe he knows not
how to pick it out: But now, one that hath underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he knows how to pick out the good and fling away
the naught; and not to fling it all away, becauſe there's
ſomething that is naught as well as good. Now that's
the third thing, and there's very few that underſtand
this Leſſon; but they muſt ſwallow down all, without
thinking of any temptation that is annexed to the fullneſs
that they do enjoy.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Then doth a man know how to be full, when
he can have all that he doth enjoy, under his command,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104282:9"/>
and he can have the command of his own ſpirit in what
he doth enjoy. As thus, when he is not a ſlave to what
he hath, but he makes what he hath a ſlave to him.
Some men that are rich, you ſay they have ſuch poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
the truth is, their poſſeſſions have them rather,
than they their poſſeſſions; they are under their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But now, Then a man knows how to be full,
when all that he hath he makes his underling, he makes
his ſervants; he makes it to be ſerviceable to him, and
he can command any thing that he hath, according as
there is uſe of it. He will never be a ſervant to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
It's a ſordid diſpoſition for any man or woman
to be a ſervant to their ſervant; but now, to your
Eſtates you will be a ſervant, they ſhall command you;
and your Credit and you will be a ſervant. But it's a ſign
you know not how to be full. As a man doth not know
how to rule, if he will be under his ſervant; ſo he doth
not know how to be full, except he hath a command over
what he doth enjoy in the world; yea and a command over
his own ſpirit in the uſe of what he doth enjoy. That's
thus, When a man or woman can let out as much of his
heart to the Creature as is uſeful, and no more; and can
call it in again, when there is cauſe: As ordinarily peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
do not let out their ſpirits a little to joy, but they
let them out ſo as they have no command over their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
but they have loſt the command of their ſpirits:
they cannot call in their ſpirits again, to be ſerious and
humble, and to be mourning for ſin, when God calls
them to it. As now for inſtance, when you ſay you
will be merry, and go and viſit your friends, and have
good cheer; God gives you leave to do ſo; if you
know how to make uſe of this: But now, Do not you
let out your hearts ſo far, as you cannot call them in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104282:9"/>
again; you let them out ſo, that when you ſhould come
at night to go and humble your ſouls before God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
your hearts are light and vain, and you have no
command over your ſpirits at all; and perhaps the next
day you are worſe for it. Its juſt with your hearts as
with little Children; let them have but their wills a little
while, and you ſhall have no rule over them for many
dayes, many weeks after. So when you let your hearts
have liberty a little while to rejoyce in the Creature,
you have little command over your hearts for many weeks
after. Now you may be merry, Religion keeps not one
from mirth, but yet ſo as to have a command over our
ſpirits; that I can call my heart in again, when there is
occaſion. I will rejoyce in the Creature, I but I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
my chief joy for ſomething elſe; there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe that I am to rejoyce in, more than in the uſe
of the Creature. If you let out your heart ſo, when
you rejoyce in the Creature, as you make it your chief
joy, your onely joy; your joy is not right. But it is not
ſo with the heart that knows how to be full.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Then hath a man or woman learned how to be
full, when they can ſo uſe the creatures of God, as yet
they are in a readineſs to part with all their comforts, if
God will call for them. If I enjoy comfort, but in ſuch a
manner as my heart lies down before God ready prepared
to give up thoſe comforts that I do enjoy; whenever God
will have me: Then I have learned to be full. When a man
or woman ſhall have their hearts taken ſo with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as they cannot leave them, whatever comes of
them: They muſt preſerve their Eſtate, now having had
full Eſtates, and lived full handed; they cannot live mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
rather venture upon ſin or any thing in the world, to
preſerve their Eſtates. <hi>O how is it poſſible for a man as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104282:10"/>
hath had ſuch bringing up as I</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>now to be put to
ſtraits, that I can ſcarce have bread.</hi> And upon this the
hearts of men rather then they will come to part with the
comforts of the Creature, when God would have them;
they will keep them, as it were, whether God will or no.
O thou haſt not learned how to be full. If thy heart
were right in thy fulneſs, thou wouldſt take the comfort
of the Creature, when God gives them. But Lord, If
thou haſt uſe of them, any other way, here I am, do
with me what thou pleaſeſt: The Lord gives, and the
Lord takes, and bleſſed be the Name of the Lord. I'll
take them as long as thou wilt have me, and when thou
wilt ſanctifie thy Name in my want, Lord take them. We
are too eager upon the Creature when our hearts cleave to
it and we cannot be taken from it, without the rending of
our hearts. It is with many mens Spirits, as it is with the
Bee, when it comes to ſting, it thruſts its ſting ſo far in
that it cannot get it out, but leaves it there: So our hearts
are ſo riveted into the Creature, that we cannot part
with the Creature; and when God would take away the
Creature from us, it is as dear unto us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that's
the reaſon that people do ſo cry out, and complain that
they are undone, and wring their hands, if they have but
loſt any part of their Eſtates; though they have a great
part ſtill remaining: Oh how they wring their hands as if
they were undone. Oh thou didſt not learn when thou
wert full, how to be full. That man or woman that is
immoderately ſorrowful, when God takes away the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from them, did never learn how to be full; that is,
to know how to be full: when we can tell how to enjoy
them, and how to be without them. O think of this
when you are at your full Tables. Now I have al things
about me, but can I now, if God ſhould call me to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104282:10"/>
ſuffer poverty, could I be content to be laid in a Priſon
for his Name ſake? <hi>Paul</hi> he could, when he was at the
fulleſt, readily come off: O Lord, if thou wilt honour
thy ſelf by me, in a Priſon, or Poverty, or Diſgrace,
why Lord, here I am: He was ready prepared. And
know, that you have not learned how to be full, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you can find your hearts in the midſt of your fulneſs;
to be ready prepared to part with all your fulneſs for Jeſus
Chriſt. Now in the very naming of theſe things, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you all think this is hard leſſon; you think it's hard
for poor people to know how to want; that's hard, but
the truth is, it's rather the harder of the two to know how
to be full: That's the fifth thing, when a man knows how
to be full.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Then doth a man know how to be full, when
he can make all his fulneſs to be furtherance of his graces,
to act his graces, to exerciſe his graces, to draw forth his
graces: As now, when he can make the fulneſs that he
hath, to be a means to act and draw forth the grace of
Love; to love God in all his fulneſs: Not ſo much to love
the Creature, as to love God in the Creature. When he
can make his fulneſs to be a means to help his faith:
Thus, Lord, thou haſt ſaid, <hi>That godlineſs hath the
promiſe of this life and the life that is to come;</hi> why
Lord thou haſt made thy promiſe good unto me, and ſo
it ſtrengthens my faith: When a mans fulneſs can exerciſe
the grace of Charity to others: When a mans fulneſs can
exerciſe his grace of heavenly mindedneſs; as in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>O Lord, Theſe comforts that thou givest me in thy
creatures, O they are ſweet; but how ſweet is thy ſelf!
how ſweet is Jeſus Chriſt, that is the fulneſs of all this
fulneſs! And if ſo be that this life be ſo ſweet here in
this world, what haſt thou then in the heavens, to make me
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104282:11"/>
to long after heaven!</hi> Then a man hath learned how to
be full, when he knows how to exerciſe his graces by his
fulneſs; that that which deads the graces of other men,
ſhall be a means to exerciſe his graces.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, And ſo I might make that another conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
When this fulneſs doth lead him to the fountain
of his fulneſs; that is, when his grace leads him to God,
to acknowledge him in all, and to be thankful to God in
all; when it ſtirs up his thankfulneſs to God; and when it
encourages him in the duties that God doth require of
him. O I receive much wages, ſaith a gracious heart; I
receive much from God, then ſurely there muſt needs be
much work required at my hands. I receive more than
others do, and therefore it is fit that I ſhould do more
work than others do. Thus a Chriſtian learns to be full,
when it can further his graces, and carry him to God,
that is the fountain of all his fulneſs.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Then a Chriſtian learns to be full, when he
can improve and lay out all his fulneſs for God. I uſe it,
I but I do not uſe it for my ſelf ſo much as for God. When
I can conſider what are the opportunities of ſervice that
God grants unto me in this my fulneſs. Doth not God give
unto me a larger opportunity of ſervice than unto others,
O then let me improve it for publick work. Perhaps I
am made a publick man, whereas others that are poor,
that are fit for publick ſervice as well as I, in regard of
their gifts and graces, but becauſe of their Eſtate they
cannot be employed in publick work as I. Now I will
improve my fulneſs in publick work, that I may be a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
man in the place where God hath ſet me; that I may
be as full of good works as poſſibly I can; that I may be a
publick bleſſing to the place where the Lord hath caſt
me. Why then doth a man learn to be full. And then,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:104282:11"/>
Ninthly, When a man doth ſo uſe the world as
if he uſed it not. When a man enjoys his fulneſs of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things, but as things by the by; that is, ſo as his
comforts doth not depend upon them. I have comfort in
them, but it doth not depend upon them. Moſt people
do ſo enjoy their fulneſs, that the truth is they have it as
all their fulneſs; they do not uſe them as things by the by,
but as their <hi>end.</hi> Not as <hi>means</hi> to the end, but as their
end. Then a man learns to know how to be full (I ſay)
when he can uſe his fulneſs, not as his end, but means to
the end: Not as things that he doth depend upon for his
happineſs, but as things by the by. Put all theſe together
now, and here's the man that learns to be full. And thus
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I am inſtructed as well to be full and rich, as to
need. O I beſeech you, before this can come to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in the whole, apply theſe particulars to your hearts.
In the mean time, I appeal this day in the Name of God
to your Conſcience; Have you learned to be full? You
are full many of you, as to outward things; but have you
been in Chriſts School, to learn to enjoy your fulneſs in
ſuch a manner as this is. I am verily perſwaded that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of your Conſciences will cauſe miſ-giving thoughts to
be in you this day about this thing, if you do believe
that theſe are the truths of God, as I cannot imagine but
any man may be convinc'd of this; and therefore I do not
ſtand to enlarge and bring proofs for them: but every
mans conſcience will tell him, certainly I have not learned
theſe things, I have not learned to be full; that is, I have
not learned to ſanctifie the Name of God by my fulneſs.
Now give conſcience liberty to reprove you for being Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
in the School of Jeſus Chriſt; and let this humble your
ſouls before the Lord. I ſhall ſpeak more to that afterwards;
but for the preſent, know, that this is your work, to go and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104282:12"/>
be humbled before the Lord, that you have not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
what it is to ſanctifie God in the fulneſs that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.
Lord, Through thy mercy I have all my dayes
been full of outward comforts; Thou haſt been full-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards me, in the wayes of thy mercy: but Lord,
though I have had fulneſs a long time, O how far have I
been from knowing how to be full. If this be to know
it, then I have been a ſtranger to it hitherto.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, A man doth know how to abound, when he
knows how to make uſe of the Comforts he doth enjoy
of the world; ſo as not to be hindered by the afflictions
or troubles that doth attend his Comforts. In mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
and being full of comforts in this world; they
cannot but have ſome affliction and ſome troubles attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe comforts; for all Creature comforts are mingled
comforts: Now then, Then a man knows rightly how
to be full, when he enjoyes his fulneſs, ſo as though he
hath ſome affliction mixed, yet he can tell how to make
uſe of his affliction for his humiliation, and his comforts
for thankſgiving unto God at the ſame time: whereas
now abundance of people when they enjoy comfort, if
they meet with any trouble and affliction mixed with
their comfort, they are filled ſo with vexation and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and their ſpirits are ſo troubled, that they loſe all
the good of their comforts: As <hi>Haman,</hi> he did abound,
but he did not know how to abound; therefore when he
was but croſſed in one thing, that <hi>Mordecay</hi> did not
bow the Knee to him, why all the comfort of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
was taken away, and his ſpirit was filled with
rage and bitterneſs, and malice. And thus it is with many
people, that have abundance in their Families; they
are full of outward comforts, they have their Yoke-fellows,
comfortable Children; they have Eſtates, they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104282:12"/>
have their Tables furniſhed, and all things that one would
think might content the heart of a man almoſt: But now,
if any one croſs doth fall out that doth diſpleaſe them,
they are put into ſuch a vexation and fretting humour, as
they loſe all the benefit of the comforts. Do'ſt thou
know how to abound, when as thou goeſt abroad and
ſomething croſſeſt thee, or thy Servant doth ſomething
amiſs, why preſently thou art in a rage and fretting, and all
thy thankſgiving to God for all thy mercies, that's forgot.
Nothing but fretting and vexing in the Family for one
croſs, when as there are a hundred mercies that thou
ſhouldeſt bleſs God for. Thou doſt not know how to
to abound, when thou canſt not tell how to ſever the
good of mercy, from the conſideration of affliction: And
though God doth afflict thee in ſomething, yet he gives
thee abundance of occaſions to bleſs him and praiſe him.
But now, when thou canſt bleſs God for all mercies,
and be humbled for all afflictions at the ſame time; If
God doth grant me more mercies then affliction, he ſhall
have more thankſgiving from me then ſorrow, or then
trouble; Ile have more joy then I will have trouble, if
I have more mercy then I have correction. This man
knows how to abound, that can do thus then.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, laſtly, That man knows how to abound,
that in his abundance yet knows himſelf. Such a man
or woman knows how to be full, and to abound (I
ſay) that if they are full and abound, yet they know
themſelves. Its ordinary for people not to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
when once they come to abound. <hi>Saul</hi> was
little in his own eyes when he was in a mean eſtate, but
when <hi>Saul</hi> came to abound he knew not himſelf: And
ſo it hath been ordinary with people, that their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
hath taken away the very knowledge of themſelves;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104282:13"/>
they have grown wanton and fooliſh and proud, that
they have not known themſelves when they have abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But now, when a man in the midſt of abundance knows
his own meaneſs, and wretchedneſs, and ſinfulneſs, and vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
notwithſtanding his abundance; here's a man that
hath learned this leſſon of the Apoſtle, how to abound.
But this is a very difficult leſſon: If there be ſuch things as
as theſe in learning how to abound, ſurely the leſſon muſt
needs be difficult. You that are Mariners think if you have
Sea-roome enough you are ſafe; you care not then: but
it's otherwiſe in this that we are ſpeaking of, your Sea-roome
may be your undoing; and the more abundance
you have, the more difficult it will be for you to know
how to order your ſelves in your way. I gave divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why this leſſon was more difficult then the other; to
know how to be full than to be empty; which few people
in the world will think ſo, but certainly it is ſo.</p>
            <p>Now though the very naming of theſe things may ſhew
he difficulty of it, yet we ſhall come in the Second place,
to ſhew that there's a great deale of difficulty in Mens
and Womens knowing how to be full: And I name this
the rather, becauſe I would put your hearts upon exerciſe,
that you may not lightly paſs over what is ſaid, when we
ſpeak of knowing how to be full; for it is ordinary for
Men that have eſtates and outward comforts, to ſlight the
Word. Well, Let me have what will ſatisfie me, and
for this leſſon, to know how to be full, I hope we ſhall
do well enough for that. Now for this, that you may
not ſlight the leſſon; I ſhall ſhew you ſomething about
the difficulty of it.</p>
            <p>You that are Marriners, If you may have Sea-roome
enough, you care not; you think then you can do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
but though you can do well enough in your Art,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104282:13"/>
when you have Sea-roome; yet the truth is, you do the
worſt for your ſelves, when you have the greateſt Sea of
proſperity, there you do worſt of all; and it is your Sea-room
that doth undo you: I mean the abundance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
proſperity, it is that ordinarily which doth undo
men. So it is eaſier a great deal, you know, for one to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
a little Boat in the <hi>Thames,</hi> then for one to be able
to manage an <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Ship. The truth is, leſs skill
will ſerve for the ordering of a mans eſtate when it is low
and mean in the world, than when he comes to be full.
It were a mad thing for a man that can but onely row in
the <hi>Thames,</hi> to undertake the command of one of your
greateſt Ships: And ſo it is for thoſe that are mean, if God
doth not teach them how to be full, they are like to undo
themſelves by their fulneſs as well as any way. It is eaſier
for a man to manage a little eſtate that he hath, then for
him to manage great merchandizing. There is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
and skill required in fulneſs, than in other wayes;
as extremity of heat is harder to bear than cold: though
it be very cold, yet by exerciſe we may get our ſelves a
heat: but when it is extream hot weather, that's very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and it breeds diſeaſes. And ſo it is eaſier to carry
a Cup that is but half full ſteadily, than to carry a Cup
that is brim-full. And a Traveller (you know the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion)
the ſtorm and the tempeſt makes him to get his
Cloak cloſer together, and to hold it faſter: but when
the warm beams of the Sun comes and ſhines upon him,
that makes him caſt off his Cloak. You know the Fable
of the Sun and the Wind to get the Travellers Cloak,
which ſhould do it; when the Wind came bluſtering, that
could not do it; but the warm Sun beams, that made him
throw it off. So many times thoſe that can hold faſteſt in
the time of adverſity, yet in the time of proſperity they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104282:14"/>
loſe the ſeeming graces that they had before; and ſo let
all go.</p>
            <p>Now there are divers reaſons that I ſhould give you
why it is thus difficult to learn this leſſon; as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe we are moſt of us fleſh, we are more
fleſh than ſpirit of our ſelves: Now becauſe we have ſo
little ſpirit in us, therefore all thoſe things that ſhall come
for to joyn with the fleſh (I do not now ſpeak of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
but to joyn with our natural part and ſenſual part,
we having ſo little ſpirit in us, it muſt needs be dangerous
for us to manage thoſe things that joyn with our natural
part, that is fleſh, though it were not corrupt; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we have ſo little ſpirit. That is, Firſt, We have
loſt the Image of God. The beſt of us have but little of
the Image of God, others have loſt is quite; and then our
very reaſon is wounded by our fall: therefore having ſo
little ſtrength in our ſpirits, all thoſe things that come to
joyn with the fleſh, do very much endanger us; and do
indeed very much weaken our better part. Now adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that pulls from the fleſh, that takes from the fleſh;
and many times the ſpirit is much the ſtronger; but what
doth add to the ſtrength of the fleſh, doth endanger us:
as it is more dangerous to ſet a Child upon a pamper'd
Horſe, than upon a Horſe that is wearied out with work:
And ſo for us that are weak in our ſpirits, to have our fleſh
to be pampered and ſatisfied; I now ſpeak but of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
fleſh and ſenſual part, to be pampered and fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
there's a great deal of danger in that.</p>
            <p>And then farther, In proſperity there are more duties
required than in adverſity. A man that is in a mean eſtate
and condition, there are not ſo many duties required of
him; but a man that enjoys a fulneſs, there's abundance
of duties required of ſuch a man: every comfort that he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104282:14"/>
enjoys is an obligation to ſome ſpecial duty. A poor man
that works hard at his dayes labour, he hath nothing to
do but to bleſs God when he comes into his Family, and
look to his own heart; and to ſee that the ſervice of God
is in his Family: But now, take a man that is full, that
is of an eſtate in the world, God requires of him to look
abroad in the publick; and God gives him charge, Look
that my Worſhip be ſet up, look that Juſtice be executed,
I will require theſe things at your hand; look that my
Sabboths be not prophan'd, look that Godlineſs be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced,
look that Sin is diſcountenanced.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you will ſay, Every man that is rich, he is
not a Juſtice of Peace, or in place.</p>
            <p>I but by your countenance you may make friends to
this and the other; every one is tied to be a friend to
thoſe that are rich. There are a great many duties that
lie upon you, that do not lie upon thoſe that are poor.
If indeed a man that had an eſtate, had nothing elſe to
do but to ſit by the fire ſide, and have his ſervants to
bring him his proviſion; if this were all to be full, it were
eaſie for a man to know how to be full: but you muſt
know that there is much more lies upon you then ſo,
which you muſt anſwer for, and give an account of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; now this is the thing that makes the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p>And then the third thing is, The variety of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that do attend upon a full condition: O abundance
of temptations there are in a full eſtate, more than there
are in a mean eſtate. I confeſs extream poverty hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
temptations with it, very ſore and grievous temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that do attend extremity of poverty; but yet not ſo
many as do attend upon a full eſtate. As the flies come
in abundance to ſweet things, honey (and the like) ſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104282:15"/>
               <hi>Belzebub,</hi> that ſignifies the God of Flies; O the Devils
that have that name, they come in abundance, where they
ſee ſweetneſs, where they ſee is much proſperity. Rats
and Mice come to full Barns, not to empty ones; and ſo
the Vermin of temptations, as I may call them, do attend
upon full eſtates. A Tree that hath nothing on it, the
Traveller that comes by will not fling at it; but a Tree
that is full of fruit, a Traveller flings at that: ſo thoſe
that are in a mean and low condition, the Devil paſſes by
them, but he eſpecially labors at thoſe that he ſees hath
much of the world, and he hath more hopes of gaining
of them: As it's a very obſervable place concerning <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi>
do but conſider the Scripture that ſpeaks of the
condition of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Bleſſing; we may compare
two Scriptures together for it, the one is in the Book of
<hi>Geneſis,</hi> where you have <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſing of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and
the other is in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi>'s
Bleſſing was, <hi>chap.</hi> 33. 13. and of <hi>Joſeph</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of the Lord be his land, for the precious things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath:
And for the precious fruits brought forth by the Sun, and
for the precious things put forth by the Moon, and for the
chief things of the ancient Mountains; and for the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things of the laſting hills; and for the precious things of
the earth, and fulneſs thereof,</hi> &amp;c. Here's for all his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bleſſings, what a many precious things are here,
that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had, and the <hi>fulneſs</hi> thereof. But mark, of
all the Tribes, what is ſaid concerning <hi>Joſeph, Gen. 49. 22.
Joſeph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a Well;
whoſe branches run over the wall.</hi> But now mark in the
23. verſe, <hi>The Archers have ſorely grieved him and ſhot at
him, and hated him.</hi> There's none of the Tribes, where it
is ſaid, that the Archers did ſo ſhoot at, as at <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104282:15"/>
there is none of the Tribes that is bleſſed with ſo many
ſeveral pretious things as <hi>Joſeph</hi> is bleſt withal. So that
by comparing theſe two Scriptures, you ſee, that thoſe
that have moſt of the pretious things of this world, they
are like to be ſhot at moſt; and the Devil ſhoots at
them more then he doth at others.</p>
            <p>And then, as the variety of temptations is greater, ſo
the ſuitableneſs of temptations is more; the Devil can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
more in his temptations with fulneſs, than where
there is want and emptineſs; why, becauſe though there
be temptations in a poor condition, yet they are not
ſo pleaſing to a mans own nature as the temptations of a
full condition. A poor man is tempted, but what is he
tempted to, he is tempted to impatience, but that's no
pleaſing thing but a tedious thing; and he is tempted to
deſpair, but that hath no pleaſingneſs with it; and he is
tempted to take ſhifting courſes, I but there's fear in that,
leaſt he ſhould be diſcovered and ſo be puniſhed: So
that their temptations that are in poverty, are not ſo
ſuitable to their nature, as the temptations of one that is in
a full eſtate; for his eſtate is a temptation to pride, to
uncleanneſs, a temptation to intemperance: Now ſuch
things are very ſuitable to the very nature of a man, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there's a great deal more danger in the temptations
that comes by fulneſs than by want, becauſe the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of one are tedious to a mans nature; but the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the other are ſuitable to a mans nature. As it's
more dangerous to have Rats-bane lie about the houſe
for your children, than to have Alloes or Wormſeed:
Suppoſe that Alloes had a poyſon in it, it's true it may do
hurt, but it's not ſo likely as Rats-bane; becauſe though
Rats-bane hath poyſon in it, yet it hath ſweetneſs in it
too. There is poyſon ſometimes in a poor condition,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104282:16"/>
that is, there are temptations to great evils in a poor
condition; I but their temptations have a bitterneſs in
them. But the temptation of a full condition hath a
ſweetneſs in them; and therefore there's a greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in them, and more difficulty to avoid thoſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>And then further, The temptations that come from ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
they are more ſubtle; thoſe that come from want they
are not ſo ſubtle, they are more apparent; but the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
lies in fulneſs for the moſt part in lawful things, it is in
lawful things that we moſt fail in: And the temptation
comes ſo fairly, why, why may not a man take liberty to
comfort himſelf in Gods Creatures, may not a man take his
own, may not a man make uſe of his own? For the moſt part
(I ſay) all the temptations of fulneſs, or great part of
them, lies in things that ſeem to have no hurt in them;
and therefore they are very ſubtle, and a man need be
very wary of them: they are (as we ſaid before upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion)
like little bones in the Fiſh that you can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee them, and therefore there's great deal more
danger in ſwallowing of them down, then of other prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things. And ſo the temptations of a full eſtate lies
very ſecret; it's very hard to ſee them unleſs you look
very narrowly.</p>
            <p>And then further, which is a main thing; becauſe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
doth not onely afford a temptation to ſin, but few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
for all kinds of luſt; fulneſs will feed them if you
have not learned to be full. As now, If a man hath
the luſt of pride, there he hath enough to act his pride,
he will feed it to the full; and will make a proud man
to be a ſcornful man: ſo that he will ſcorn and jeer,
not onely at his Brethren, but at God, and his truth,
and Miniſters, and Religion, and all becauſe he is full;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104282:16"/>
his pride is ſo fed to the full. And fulneſs of eſtate it will
feed ſelf-love extreamly. When a man hath a kind of ſelf-ſufficiency
in himſelf, then he ſees no need that he hath
of God, nor Chriſt, nor Mercy, nor of the Word and
Promiſes. It feeds his Malice, if he hath a malicious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
againſt another man, he can undo him, and he can
ſpend ſo much to have his will; it feeds his Stubbornneſs.
If he will be unclean, he can, and who will meddle with
ſuch an one. And it will feed his Licentiouſneſs, he can
take his liberty and ride up and down from place to place.
A poor man hath as much mind perhaps to ſatisfie his
luſts, but he muſt fall to his work, or elſe his family will
ſtarve: I but a man that is full, he hath elbow-room
enough to ſerve his luſts, and he can go abroad in the
morning and ſtay till midnight; and ſpend from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the week to the end of it, and not want. O
this is mighty pleaſing to fleſh, and this feeds a mans luſts,
and makes him ſtrong. And this is the reaſon why there
are ſo few that are full, that ever the Word doth good
upon. Ordinarily the poor receive the Goſpel, ſo the
Scripture ſaith; <hi>Not many rich, not many mighty, not
many great ones.</hi> Why here's the reaſon of it, becauſe
they have ſo much matter to feed their luſts withal, that
their luſts grows too ſtrong, that it doth reſiſt the Word,
reſiſts all means that ſhould do them any good; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it's a very hard leſſon for a man to learn to know how
to be full. And that that ſhews it to be a hard leſſon, alſo
ſhews it to be a neceſſary leſſon. O Lord what caſe is
a man in then that is full, and yet for all that hath not
learned to be full. If he hath ſuch matter for his luſts,
and knows not how to order himſelf, he is like to be a
loſt man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:104282:17"/>
There is one thing more why it is ſo difficult to learn
how to abound, and that's this, Becauſe that a full eſtate
is in danger to hinder thoſe Graces that are the eſpecial
Graces of a Chriſtian. The Graces of a Chriſtian that
are the moſt peculiar and proper graces of a Chriſtian, are
in an exceeding danger by a proſperous eſtate; that if a
man doth not learn to abound, thoſe graces will eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
be hurt; and it is very difficult for a man or woman
to carry themſelves in an even courſe; ſo as when there is
(as it were) ſiege laid to thoſe graces that are the ſpecial
graces of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>As thus, The graces of a Chriſtian are Faith, Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
Humility, Patience, Tenderneſs, and ſuch kind of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as theſe are. Now a proſperous eſtate doth mightily
endanger theſe graces.</p>
            <p>As now, <hi>Faith,</hi> you know the nature of that grace is
for one to be emptied of himſelf, and to be nothing
of himſelf; and for to rely upon that that is without.
This is the grace of Faith, To be taken from our own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
from our ſelves, and from the Creature; to caſt our
ſelves upon free grace, upon the goodneſs and mercy of
God, upon the righteouſneſs of another. But now,
when men abound, and have a fulneſs in themſelves, why
'tis very natural for them to depend upon themſelves and
not upon another. A full eſtate hinders very much the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
life, which is the life of a Chriſtian. I the life
of a Chriſtian is a more depending life then the life of
<hi>Adam</hi> was: and therefore a low condition is more ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to a depending life, then a full condition.</p>
            <p>And ſo for ſelf-denial, One that is in a low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it's eaſier for ſuch a one to deny himſelf: But now,
when one comes to have much of ſelf, and to have ſelf
to be cockered (as it were) then yet to deny a mans
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104282:17"/>
ſelf, and to be nothing in his own eyes, this is a great
deal harder.</p>
            <p>And ſo for Humility, It's not ſo much for one that is
poor, and in a low condition to have his heart low, but
to have his heart low when his eſtate is high, that's the
difficulty. You know there's nothing more natural to
men, then to have their hearts riſe as their eſtates riſe;
as the comforts of the creatures riſes, ſo their hearts will
riſe; and therefore it's hard to learn this leſſon, How
to be full.</p>
            <p>And then that grace likewiſe of Tenderneſs, of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heart, a ſoft heart, that's a grace that belongs to a
Chriſtian in a ſpecial manner; that they ſhould keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
tender, ſoft ſpirited. Now though many in time
of Affliction have their hearts tender and ſoft, yet when
they come to proſper once, then their hearts are hard;
the proſperity of the world doth bake (as it were) their
hearts, and hardens their hearts. As the Sun doth harden
the Clay, ſo proſperity doth harden the hearts of men,
and takes away that tenderneſs as was wont to be (as
might be ſhewn in many examples.)</p>

            <p>I Shall now give unto you ſome further evidences of
this, that it is a very difficult leſſon to know how to
abound. The evidences are,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The ſolemn and frequent charges of God to his
people, To take heed to themſelves when they are full.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104282:18"/>
We do not find in Scripture that God doth ſo ſolemnly
and frequently charge people to take heed to themſelves
when they are low; that they don't <hi>then</hi> forſake him:
though there are ſome Commands that way, but nothing
ſo much in ſuch a ſolemn way as God doth when he ſpeaks
to thoſe that are like to be in a full condition; then ſaith
God, <hi>Look to your ſelves;</hi> as I'll give you two or three
Scriptures. The firſt is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 11. there God ſaith
what he would give unto them, They ſhould have <hi>houſes
full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells
digged, which thou diggedſt not; Vineyards and Olive-trees</hi>
which thou plantedſt not. <hi>When thou ſhalt have
eaten and be full</hi> (ſaith the Text) what then? <hi>Then beware
leſt thou forget the Lord, which brought thee forth out of the
Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>from the houſe of bondage.</hi> That's a time
when poople are leaſt careful at all, when they eat and
be full, then they think of no danger at all; I but this is
the charge of the Spirit of God, That when thou ſhalt
have eaten and be full, <hi>then</hi> beware in a more eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
O that you would remember this, you that have
full Tables; O that this Scripture were written over your
Tables, and were in your thoughts when you come to
full Diſhes; you eat and drink and are full. It would be
but a melancholy thought to ſome of you to think of this,
O I muſt beware now in a more eſpecial manner. Some
of you that have been in a poor eſtate, perhaps you were
but poor Sea-boys at firſt; but in ſome few Voyages have
raiſed up an eſtate: then this is a Text that concerns you.
Hath God given you ſuch Voyages, that now your houſe
is full; you were wont to have your houſes empty, but
ordinarily you Marriners have your houſes full of good
things that you bring from beyond Sea. Now when your
houſes are full, ſaith the Text, beware of that, that you
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104282:18"/>
forget not the Lord; but then fear him. And ſo in <hi>Deut.
8.</hi> 12. you have again this charge renewed, the Lord doth
not give it you once, but preſently again he renews this
charge; <hi>When</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou haſt eaten and art full, th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n
thou ſhalt bleſs the Lord thy God, for the good land which
he hath given thee. Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy
God, in not keeping his Commandments and his Judgments
and his Statutes, which I command thee this day; leaſt
when thou haſt eaten, and art full, and haſt built goodly
houſes, and dwelt therein; and when thy heards and thy
ſtocks multiply, and thy Silver and thy Gold is multiplied,
and all that thou haſt is multiplied: then thine heart be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.</hi> Still ſee what
charges are here, as if God ſhould ſay, I am not ſo ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
about you, while you are in the Wilderneſs, while
you are empty; but I am very ſolicitous about you, what
you will do when you are full; I am afraid then you will
forget me: Therefore you ſee how it is renewed: yea,
you have it renewed again in <hi>Deut. 11. 15. And</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>I will ſend graſs in thy field for thy cattel, that thou
mayeſt eat and be full. Take heed to your ſelves, that your
heart be not deceived, and ye turn aſide and ſerve other
Gods.</hi> Take heed you be not deceived when you are
full. There is a great deceitfulneſs in riches; ſo you
know the Scripture ſpeaks of the deceitfulneſs of Riches.
You will ſay, why when we are full, we hope we may
eat and drink, and have the pleaſure of what God gives
us. O but take heed you be not deceived. Now that
God ſhould give ſuch caution and ſolemn charges again
and again, in the 6th. 8th. and 11th. Chapters, and ſo
repeat them again and again; ſurely by this God would
have us to learn that there is a great deal of danger in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full; and therefore it is a difficult leſſon for us to
know how to be full and abound.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:104282:19"/>
Another evidence that it is ſo difficult, is this; When
do you find throughout all the Book of God, that ever
a full condition did ever turn any ſoul to God, or was
the means of it, that was not turned to God before. I
can find in Scripture that an afflicted condition hath been
bleſt ſo by God, as it hath been an occaſion to turn ſome
to God: As you know <hi>Manaſſes</hi> in his affliction he ſought
the Lord. And ſo God ſpeaks once and twice, and men
hear not; but then he opens their ears by correction:
<hi>And in their affliction they will ſeek me early:</hi> But do you
ever find it, that thoſe that did not ſeek God before,
were drawn to God by a full condition. Truly I know
no certain example of any, where the proſperous eſtate
of a man was any occaſion to his converſion: therefore
that ſhews that there is a great deal of danger in a fuller
condition.</p>
            <p>Yea further, Where do you find that any of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that were brought into a full condition, but were
rather worſe for it than better. I confeſs there is one or
two examples, that we read not that they were worſe for
their proſperity; as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel:</hi> but where
have you an example elſe, but almoſt all of them, when
they were full, they forgat God. When they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
they would learn; <hi>David</hi> had learned to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in his afflicted condition, and to get abundance of
good by his afflicted condition; O but he could not learn
ſo well to be full. And therefore you ſhall find that the
moſt excellent Pſalms that ever <hi>David</hi> penn'd, it was in
his afflicted condition: There was a fulneſs of the ſpirit
of God in him then, then in a more eſpecial manner:
And therefore I remember that it's ſaid in one place, That
<hi>Solomon</hi> did not do according to the firſt works of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>David.</hi> The firſt works of <hi>David</hi> were the works
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104282:19"/>
when <hi>David</hi> was not ſo full; but when he grew to be
full, his works were not ſo good then. And general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all the people of God were worſe in a full condition:
So <hi>Solomon,</hi> you know how his fulneſs had almoſt ſpoil'd
him; <hi>Solomon,</hi> though he had ſo much wiſdom that he
underſtood all things almoſt, yet he want<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d wiſdom to
know how to be full. There was never a man of that
greatneſs in the world (that was a meer man) that had
the wiſdome as <hi>Solomon</hi> had; and yet all his wiſdome
was not enough to teach him this leſſon, to know how
to be full.</p>
            <p>And then, This is an evidence that it's a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
thing to learn to be full; becauſe that the way of
God conſtantly hath been, even from the beginning of
the world to this day, to keep his people down low
in affliction; and eſpecially in the times of the Goſpel.
Now why is it that the Lord hath ſo ordered things in
the waves of his providence, as that the moſt part of
his Churches and his Saints, ſhould be kept under the
hatches, under afflictions. Why God could as eaſily fill
them with fulneſs of outward bleſſings, as fill them with
the Holy Ghoſt; but thoſe that God fills with the Holy
Ghoſt, yet he doth not fill them with outward bleſſings,
in his ordinary way; but the people of God have been in
afflictions. This is an evidence to us that God ſees that
it is more ſafe for them to be in a mean eſtate than in a
high, becauſe they can better learn how to be empty than
to be full. The Lord ſees it's a hard leſſon for his people
to learn how to be full, and therefore he doth but very
rarely bring them into a full condition.</p>
            <p>And daily experience teaches it too, who are thoſe
that are the moſt ſpiritual and heavenly Chriſtians, are
they thoſe that are fulleſt? We ſee it plainly otherwiſe.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104282:20"/>
O God hath a great deal more glory from poor mean
Chriſtians, and there is more ſpiritual Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and them, than there is between God and
thoſe that are in a fuller eſtate. The Eccleſiaſtical Story
is notable for this, I ſuppoſe you have heard of; That at
the time when the Church was delivered from perſecution,
and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had endowed it with great poſſeſſions,
the Story ſaith, there was a voice heard in the Air, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>This day is poyſon poured into the Church.</hi> And ſo it
fell out indeed, for the Church grew far worſe after it was
delivered from perſecution. It was in a worſe condition
by far, then it was when it was under perſecution; they
could not learn to be full, ſo as they could learn to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
and empty; then they fell to contending and
wrangling one with another, and then Hereſies began to
prevail a great deal more than they did when they were
under perſecution; and we find it ſo by our experience.
Is it not ſo, that when we are loweſt, then we are in the
beſt condition for the moſt part; for as ſoon as we have
proſperity and are full, we begin to ſpurn with the heel.
But I have ſpoken to that at other times. And thus much
for that ſecond particular, That it is a very difficult leſſon
to learn to be full.</p>
            <p>But yet it is very neceſſary, there is a kind of abſolute
neceſſity of it, a great neceſſity. Why, many wayes
there is need of this, and it would be a very ſad thing, if
you do not learn this leſſon.</p>
            <p>For, Firſt, Thoſe that are full, if they have not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
how to be full, they will be guilty of the abuſe of the
Creatures of God more than other men; the Creatures of
God that they enjoy in a fuller way than others, will be
under bondage, and will cry out againſt them: So, do
not you enjoy a great many Creatures more than others
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104282:20"/>
that are in a poor condition. But if thou haſt not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
how to uſe them for God, night and day do theſe
Creatures of God cry to heaven againſt thee: as if they
ſhould ſay, Lord, we were made for thee, and we have
a propenſity in us to be ſerviceable to thy glory; but
here's one to whom thou haſt given the poſſeſſion of us,
and he doth abuſe us, and force us from the end that
thou haſt made us for; and that we would fain be uſeful
in. Lord, we are forced to do that that is contrary to our
nature, we were never made to be ſerviceable to the
luſts of men, and yet here's a man that doth abuſe us to
his luſts: Lord why ſhould we be in bondage to ſuch
men as know not how to uſe us. You love not to be a
ſervant to one that knows not how to uſe you. The
Creatures of God they groan under the bondage they are
in, when men and women enjoy them in the fulneſs of
them, and yet abuſe them; not working them to the end
that God hath made them for: there is a cry that God
hears from his Creatures, though you hear not the voice
of it.</p>
            <p>Yea, and Secondly, If you be in a proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and have not learned to be full, then you will be
guilty of ſinning againſt mercy more than others; the
mercies of God towards you will be but an aggravation to
your ſinfulneſs; and this is a grievous condition. O Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
my Brethren, is a tender thing, and to ſin againſt
mercy is very grievous. Thoſe that are in a low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they have many mercies, but not ſo many as you;
therefore they are not guilty of ſinning againſt mercy ſo
much as you are. What a ſad thing is this, that Gods mercy,
that might do us ſo much good, ſhould be of no other
uſe to us, but meerly to aggravate our ſins at laſt. There's
no greater aggravation of ſin than that that comes from
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104282:21"/>
mercy; and therefore when the Lord would ſpeak to the
very heart of his people, ſo as to perſwade, he brings
them to that, to conſider of his mercy towards them. In
<hi>Deut. 32. 6. Do you thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people
and unwiſe.</hi> So, Doſt thou thus requite the Lord, hath
God made thy condition more comfortable than anothers?
Another he wants Bread, and fares hardly, lies hard, and
is in the cold; and lives in a poor condition, and thou
haſt all things full about thee, and yet art thou worſe?
Do'ſt thou thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh heart? And
ſo you know it was the aggravation of the ſin of <hi>David,</hi>
in <hi>2. Sam.</hi> 12. after <hi>David</hi> had committed that great ſin, the
Lord ſends the Prophet to him to convince him of his ſin;
and mark how he aggravates it <hi>ver. 7. Thus ſaith the Lord
God of Iſrael, I annointed thee King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and I
delivered thee out of the hand of</hi> Saul, <hi>and I gave thee thy
Maſters Houſe, and thy Maſters Wives into thy boſome; and
gave thee the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and of</hi> Judah, <hi>and if that
had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee
ſuch and ſuch things: Wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the
commandement of the Lord?</hi> O this was that that ſtruck
the heart of <hi>David; I have ſinned,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> And
in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 25, 26. you have a remarkable Scripture
for that, ſetting out there the mercy of God; <hi>So they did
eat and were filled, and became fat, and delighted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in thy great goodneſs; nevertheleſs they were diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
and rebelled againſt thee; and caſt thy Law behind
their backs, and ſlew thy Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> Here's the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they were filled with good things, nevertheleſs
they were diſobedient. O may not this Scripture be
made good upon many of you. The Lord hath filled
your houſes with abundance of mercy, you cannot look
into any of your Families, but you ſee mercy; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104282:21"/>
a carnal heart for all this, nevertheleſs a
Swearer, a Company-keeper, a Prophaner of Sabboths,
a Neglecter of the Worſhip of God in thy Family. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
an unclean wretch, for all thoſe mercies
that the Lord would wooe thee to obedience by. That's
the ſecond thing that ſhews the neceſſity of learning to
be full, otherwiſe we ſhall be guilty of ſinning againſt
much mercy; and likewiſe the mercy of God will ſerve
for no other end but to aggravate our ſin.</p>
            <p>And, Thirdly, If men do not learn to be full, they
will grow extream wicked. How our fulneſs doth afford
fewel for luſts, that we ſpoke to. I onely now ſpeak to
it, as to ſhew the neceſſity that we learn to be full; leſt
we come to grow moſt abominably wicked. Sin will
come to be out of meaſure ſinful, if ſo be we learn not
to be full. As a man that hath a weak diſtempered body,
and lives at a full Table, and hath a ſtrong appetite, and
yet if he doth not learn how to order his diet, he will
grow full of Diſeaſes; ſo when thy heart is weak (at
leaſt) and thou comeſt to a full Diet, and knoweſt not
how to order thy ſelf, thou art like to grow extreamly
diſeaſed; and therefore you find in Scripture, that thoſe
that were in a full condition, and yet had not grace to
know how to be full, they are deſcribed to be the moſt
wicked people that are in the world. <hi>Job 21. 14. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſay unto God, depart from us; for we deſire not
the knowledge of thy wayes.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. there you
may read at large of the proſperity of the wicked, from
the beginning and ſo on; and in <hi>Iſa. 2. 7, 8. Their land al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is full of ſilver and gold, neither is there any end of their
treaſures; their land is alſo full of horſes, neither is there
any end of their chariots;</hi> then mark in the 8th. verſe, <hi>Their
land alſo is full of Idols.</hi> Theſe two are joyned together. O
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104282:22"/>
ſo it is in many Families, this Family is full of all outward
good things, and it's a Family full of ſin; and here's a
man that hath a full Eſtate, and a man that is full of ſin,
as he is full of his Eſtate. If thou do'ſt not learn to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
thou wilt certainly abound in ſin; and therefore
it is an abſolute neceſſary leſſon for us to learn to abound.</p>
            <p>And then, Thirdly, If thou doſt not learn to abound,
thy portion will be in this life, if there doth not go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with thy abundance the grace of God to teach
thee how to abound; this will prove to be thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be a man or woman that God hath ſaid ſhall
have no other portion from him then in this world. If
the Lord gives a man an eſtate, and doth not withal
give him ſome proportionable meaſure of grace to know
how to uſe it, and abound in it, that's a man that God
ſaith, his portion ſhall be in this world; it is as much
as if God ſhould ſay from heaven concerning this man,
Here's one, whoſe portion is in this world. In the 17th.
Pſalm, at the latter end, there the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of
men who have their portion in this world; here's their
conſolation, Thou haſt a full eſtate, and doth God give
thee nothing with thy full eſtate, it is like to be thy All.
You will ſay, Is this ſo great a matter? I a thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times better thou hadſt never been born, though
thou hadſt a thouſand times more in the world then thou
haſt, if this ſhould prove to be thy portion, thy All: for
thou art made for eternity, and thoſe creatures were
not: and therefore if thou ſhould'ſt onely have hopes
in this world, thou art a wretched creature. Shall St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſay, if we have onely hopes in this life, we were
moſt miſerable of all men: O may I ſay concerning thee,
if thou haſt onely hope in this life, thou art moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
of all creatures, except the Devils themſelves.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104282:22"/>
O it's a dreadfull thing for a man or woman to have
their portion in this world: But now, thoſe have it,
that have a great deal in this world, and yet know
not how to uſe it for God. O conſider of this, you
that God hath given more portion to than others; do
you think thus in the night, Lord, thou haſt indeed made
my condition more comfortable then others, I am full
handed, and have means coming in; but Lord, what
if it ſhould prove that my portion ſhould be here. I
remember it's reported of <hi>Gregory,</hi> that was the Pope,
he did profeſs that there was no Scripture that did ſtrike
to his heart, ſo much as that Scripture; <hi>Wo to you,
here is your conſolation;</hi> fearing leaſt his portion ſhould
be here. And the truth is, that Scripture, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the 17th. Pſalm, ſhould go to the hearts of rich
men, and of thoſe that have a full eſtate in this world;
except their conſciences tell them, that through the grace
of God, they have learned in ſome meaſure to know
how to uſe it for the glory of God as for their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
You account it an ill thing for a man to have an
eſtate, and knows not how to uſe it for himſelf: As
now, If a man ſhould be born to a great inheritance,
and ſhould be a fool; you know his eſtate is begged:
why now to have an eſtate and know not how to uſe
it for God; is it not as great an evil? Is that onely an
excellency to be able to know how to uſe an eſtate and
improve it for your own advantage, and is it not as well
to improve it for God? O it's a miſerable condition
that any man is in, that is full, and knows not how
to be full; there's a man that is like to have his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this world.</p>
            <p>I but that's not all neither, If God gives you an eſtate,
and you know not how to be full; then all that thou
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104282:23"/>
haſt is curſed to thee: There is a ſecret curſe of God
goes a long with it. As now, when a man gives a thing
in an anger, ſaith he, Here take it if you will and choke
with it. Such kinde of ſpeech men have when they give
things in anger. But if you give to your Children things
out of love, you do not onely give it them, but if
there be any danger, you have a care that there be a
right uſe of the things. So now, when God gives out
to his own people, God hath a care of them after he hath
given them; I give it them, but I muſt have a care leaſt
this turn to their hurt. But now, when God gives to a
wicked man, Take them, ſaith God, if you will; but
God never minds them farther, to look after them, to
ſee whether this ſhall do them good or no; God never
minds them, but lets them take them, and ſpoil them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with them, God doth not care. Were it not a
ſign of hatred to a man, if I ſhould ſee one that is a mad
man; and give him a Sword into his hand, I may be guilty
of murther: It is as great an argument of hatred, that
God doth hate a man, when he doth give him an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and yet doth not give him a heart to make uſe
of that eſtate; he puts (as it were) a Sword into a mad
mans hand. But though I cannot do it juſtly, yet God
may do it juſtly, as a puniſhment of ſin. The curſe of
God is mixed with Wine as well as Water; and then it's
ſtronger in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 22, 23. There you may ſee how full
comforts may be curſed unto men; it is threatned as a
puniſhment of their ſin: <hi>Let their table become a ſnare
before them: and that which ſhould have been for their
welfare, let it become a trap.</hi> O this is a terrible text,
<hi>Let their table become a ſnare:</hi> It is a propheſie againſt
thoſe that gave Chriſt Gaul for his Meat, and Vinegar
when he was upon the Croſs? And ſo it is againſt all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104282:23"/>
ſuch as ſhall inſult over the people of God in their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
As men, when they are full and rich and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in the world, they will add to the affliction of Gods
people. Now this is the curſe of God upon them, that
ſhall add to the affliction of the people of God; <hi>Let their
table become a ſnare before them, and that which ſhould
have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</hi> Thou
haſt a Table well furniſhed, but how do'ſt thou know
but that it is a ſnare for thee, and a trap? We ſet traps
to catch Vermin withal, and if thou haſt a wicked heart,
God looks upon thee but as a Vermin, and doth ſet this
to be a trap to catch thee withal: Now perhaps thou
do'ſt not ſee it: Why mark the word that follows, <hi>Let
their eyes be darkened, that they ſee not.</hi> The Curſe lies
ſecret, that thou canſt <hi>not ſee;</hi> now this is part of the
Curſe. How few men do ſee a Curſe upon their Tables.
No, this (I ſay) is part of the Curſe of God upon them
that they ſhould not. O what need is there that we that
have any fulneſs of the Creature, learn to be full; leaſt
that which ſhould have been for our welfare, is turned
into a Curſe unto us.</p>
            <p>Well, But though it be curſed, yet if he may enjoy it
ſtill, a wicked man will be content.</p>
            <p>Then that's the next thing in the evil of that mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that hath not learned to be full; That God juſtly
may rend away what thou haſt in his wrath from thee:
And becauſe thou knoweſt not how to uſe it, it were juſt
with God in his wrath to rend it from thee. As you will
do, if you have ſervants, or any in the houſe, if they
have a knife in their hand, and you ſee that they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to do miſchief with it, you will ſnatch it from them:
Nay, If you know not how to uſe it, you ſhall have it
no longer. It is juſt with God to come upon thee in his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104282:24"/>
wrath, and to take away all thy outward comforts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thou do'ſt not know how to uſe them. Thou
knoweſt not how to make uſe of a Child for God, or of
an Eſtate for God; and ſo he may juſtly take it from thee,
thou not knowing how to uſe it. So God doth threaten
in <hi>Pſal. 78. 25, 31. Man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did eat Angels food,
he ſent them meat to the full;</hi> but in ver. 29. <hi>So they did
eat, and were well filled; for he gave them their own deſires.</hi>
But then it follows, <hi>They were not eſtranged from their
luſts, but while the meat was yet in their mouths, the
wrath of God came upon them.</hi> They eat to the full, and
had enough, I, but they onely ſought out of greedineſs
to ſatisfie themſelves; and the wrath of God came upon
them, while the meat was in their mouths. It provokes
the wrath of God upon men, when they have a fulneſs,
and yet have not learned to be full.</p>
            <p>And as God may juſtly rend it all away from them, ſo
when they come to an affliction, O how ſad will it be
to thoſe men that have not learned to be full; O then
there will be matter for Conſcience to gnaw upon and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the Soul withal. Afflictions willbe dreadful to thoſe
men that have had a full Eſtate and not learned to be full:
Then Conſcience will upbraid them, and ſay, O you
once had plenty, you once had the comforts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the full; O but how did you uſe them, what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
had God by them? Were they not made fuel for your
luſts, and ſerviceable to your wickedneſs? And now it
is a righteous thing with God to take theſe things from
thee; and theſe ſorrows that are now upon thee, are but
the beginning of ſorrows. O the conſcience of a man
that hath been rich, and afterwards is croſſed in his Eſtate,
if while he was rich, he was not godly; this mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
will tear him and rend him. Though now you
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104282:24"/>
enjoy fulneſs, yet you may not expect to enjoy it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.
What do you think will become of you, when
your fulneſs ſhall be taken from you? O then it will be
terrible to you.</p>
            <p>Yea and further, If a man be in a full condition, and
learns not to be full; ſuch a man will do abundance of
hurt in the place where he lives; not onely to himſelf but
to others. O the evil he may do in a Town and in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and in a Kingdom. One rich man, if God doth
not ſanctifie his heart and his eſtate, may do more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
than an hundred other wicked men. God doth
not ſo much look at the hurt that baſe Drunkards, that
go up and down, from one Alehouſe to another can do.
They may deſtroy their own ſouls, but now a man that is
a man of an eſtate in the place where God hath ſet him,
if he ſpend nights in Chambering and Wantonneſs; if he
contemn the wayes of God and Religion; O the hurt
that comes by that man, and the guiltineſs that will come
upon his Spirit that way. O how is the Goſpel hindered
by ſuch men as they, that have outward proſperous
eſtates; and yet for all that have not hearts to make uſe
of it: whereas I ſhall ſhew preſently the contrary will be
in thoſe that have learned to be full. But onely now, to
ſhew the danger of a full condition, If we have not
learned to be full; and all to put you upon this, that you
may beſeech God to learn you to be full, when God
doth give you a fulneſs; leaſt you ſhould contract the
guilt of the ſins of thouſands of others upon you.</p>
            <p>And then, If thou do'ſt not learn to be full, thy full
eſtate will endanger thy ſalvation exceedingly. <hi>It is
eaſier for a Cammel</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to go thorow the eye of
a Needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven.</hi> Now Chriſt doth not interpret at firſt what is a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104282:25"/>
rich man, but at another time he doth, <hi>thoſe that truſt
in them. Chryſostom</hi> hath this paſſage upon that to the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> He wonders how any Governor can come to
be ſaved. The fulneſs of a mans condition doth much
endanger his ſalvation, if God doth not teach him how
to be full.</p>
            <p>And then it will make death to be more terrible. O
Death, how terrible will it be to a man that hath not
learned to be full. When Death ſhall come, and now he
muſt be deprived of all, bid an everlaſting farewel to
his Houſe and Eſtate, and Lands comming in. Never
ſuch merry meetings as he was wont to have, I but now
they are gone; there's an end of thoſe dayes, he ſhall
never have them more. O then (I ſay) Death will
gnaw upon a man, and then a mans conſcience indeed
will terrifie him. If he be afflicted, they will come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to terrifie him. But when he ſees that he muſt
bid an everlaſting farewel to all thoſe things, then Death
will terrifie him to purpoſe. O conſcience will tell him,
Now art thou going to give an account before the great
God of all that thou didſt enjoy in this world. It's a ſad
meſſage that this will be to ſome that are full. You think
becauſe you have money to pay for what you eat and
drink, and do enjoy, you think you ſhall be called to
no farther account. O yes, you muſt be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for all the Creatures that you do enjoy. Now if
men can ſcarce count the mercies that they do enjoy, O
then how will you be able to give an account for them.
Well, all this is but to awaken the hearts of people that
have the comforts of this world, that they may not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
themſelves with what they enjoy; but ſeek what
they can to learn to be full.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:104282:25"/>
And the Excellency of this Leſſon of Learning to be
full, is very great.</p>
            <p>For firſt, It ſhews a great deal of ingenuity in the heart
of a man. Ingenuity in theſe two regards,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe hereby it appears that this man is not
onely for his own turn. It's a ſordid ſpirit for a man to
ſeek to ſerve his own turn upon others, and when his
turn is ſerved, never to care for any body; But now, an
ingenious ſpirit, when that hath its own turn ſerv'd, it is
as careful again to return anſwerable reſpect to thoſe
that were uſeful to him; as it was deſirous to have its
own turn ſerv'd before. So it is in thoſe that have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be full, they have ingenuity; they are as careful
to return anſwerable reſpects to God, as they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any mercy from him.</p>
            <p>And their Ingenuity is in this, That they are thankful
ſpirits. An ingenious heart is a thankful heart, and loves
to acknowledge whence he had any mercy.</p>
            <p>And then further, That's great ingenuity for one to be
moved by good, and be moved by mercy. 'Tis a ſlaviſh
ſpirit that's onely mov'd by neceſſity and force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
That's nothing for a man to be forced to do a
duty. The baſeſt Slave by a Whip will be put to do
that that is his duty, I, but for one to be wrought upon
by love and by goodneſs, this is ingenuity. Now if the
Lord hath given thee an eſtate, and thou findeſt it doth
draw thy heart to God more, and works upon thy heart,
that thou art affected by Gods mercy; O this is a ſign of
an ingenious heart.</p>
            <p>And then, what grace ſuch a man hath, is a great deal
more conſpicuous than others mens graces, and more
beautiful. As a Diamond, that is ſet in Gold, there is
a beauty in it. A Diamond ſet in a Crown of Gold,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104282:26"/>
doth ſparkle more gloriouſly, than when it is wrapt up
in a dirty Rag. So the graces of many that are poor and
mean in the world, are (as it were) wrapt up in a dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
rag; as ſometimes they wrap up their money. But
now a man that is eminent in the world, and godly too,
his graces are like Diamonds upon a Crown (as it were)
that are ſo conſpicuous before the world, that the world
takes much notice of them, and gives glory to God for
them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It's an excellency, becauſe it is ſo rare. It's
a very rare thing for a man to be inſtructed in this Leſſon
of being full. It's a ſpeech of <hi>Bernard, Not to be lifted
up, when a man is put high, that is very unuſual; now,</hi>
ſaith he, <hi>the more unuſual it is, the more glorious thing
it is.</hi> It is a very rare bleſſing of God upon a man, for
him to learn to be full. I remember the ſame learned
man <hi>Bernard,</hi> writing to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that was advanced
to great favour; he ſpeaks of the grace of God towards
him, and bleſſing God for it, his promotion did not
ſucceed his former eſtate, but was added to his former
eſtate. That's thus, The promotion of many men doth
ſucceed their former eſtate; that is, the former ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they had, and ingenuity that they ſeem'd to have;
that's gone, and the promotion doth come and ſucceed it.
But the promotion of this <hi>Eugenius</hi> was not ſo, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the former eſtate that he was in before, that is,
the former humility and heavenly-mindedneſs, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as he ſeem'd to have before, ſo he had the ſame ſtill: ſo
that his ſtate and promotion did not ſucceed, but was
added to it. I, this is an excellency indeed, when a
mans fulneſs is added to his former condition, and doth
not ſucceed it; that is, he is the ſame man now that he
was before: that's a rare bleſſing of God upon one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:104282:26"/>
Fourthly, It argues a great deal of ſtrength of grace,
for a man that is full, and knows how to be full, and to
improve it. It argues not onely grace, but ſtrength of
grace: as it argues a great deal of ſtrength in mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that they can drink a great deal of Wine, and not
be drunk. Some think that they may take liberty to
themſelves to drink Wine, ſo they do not ſtagger in the
ſtreets. But you know the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Wo to thoſe
that are ſtrong to drink Wine.</hi> It's a ſpeech of <hi>Seneca,
That moderation is a ſign of a ſtrong breaſt.</hi> Moderation
in the midſt of proſperity, is a ſign of a ſtrong heart.
It's a ſign God hath given thee ſtrength of grace, if thy
conſcience can witneſs this to thee, Well, Through
Gods mercy, though I have many weakneſſes, and fail
in all that I do, yet I can ſay, to the praiſe of God, that
my eſtate hath not eſtranged my heart from God; but
my heart doth cleave to God, and I have communion
with God in the Creatures that God ſonds me. And when
God doth give me the beſt Voyages, I find my heart in the
beſt temper, and I have more ſweet communion with
God then than at other times. Can you ſay ſo? I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to your conſciences now, whether you can ſay, as in
the preſence of God, I never found my heart in a more
heavenly ſpiritual temper, than when I have found God
bleſſing me in my labors; and I have enjoyed God in
them. O now, if thou canſt ſay ſo, be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
thou haſt learned a leſſon that is a thouſand times
worth more than all thy proſperity. This is thine excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
not that thou haſt a fuller eſtate than others, but
that God hath taught thee ſuch a leſſon as this is.</p>
            <p>And then farther, Such a one may do abundance of
good. What abundance of glory may God have from
one man that way; whereas a man that is of an eſtate,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104282:27"/>
and hath not grace withal, he is like a great <hi>Elder-Tree</hi>
in the midſt of a Garden. Such a Tree, why it ſpoils
the Flowers and doth hurt there. I but one that hath an
eſtate and is rich, and godly withal, he ſtands as a prime
Flower in the Garden, that is an ornament to it: As
commonly, in the midſt of your knots you ſet a prime
flower there, to be an ornament to all the reſt. So the
Lord will have ſome to be rich, that may be an ornament
and a ſhelter to his ſervants. O many, many hundreds of
people, will bleſs God, that ever God ſet ſuch a man in ſuch
a place; and that God did give them their eſtate. We
ſay of ſome men that they have good eſtates, I, and it's
well beſtowed on them; for they do a great deal of good
with them. But now, when they are not onely ſo, but their
hearts are to improve their eſtates for the furtherance
of the Goſpel, for the beating down of ſin, and the
countenancing of Religion, O then all the people of
God that live about them, will bleſs God, O for ſuch
a man. Had it not been for ſome few in a place that God
gave eſtates unto, that was ſtirring, what would have
become of the Goſpel; Religion would have been
trampled under feet. O will not this be a greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the day of Jeſus Chriſt, when Chriſt ſhall own
this, and ſay, <hi>I gave you an eſtate in the world, and I
acknowledge that you did make uſe of it for my Glory
and Religion. I made you an inſtrument to uphold it in
the place where you were uſed.</hi> O if Chriſt ſhould own
this, would it not be a thouſand times worth your
eſtates.</p>
            <p>And then, When you come to die, O how ſweetly
will you die; when you can ſay, <hi>O Lord remember me
for good.</hi> As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did in the cloſe of his Book,
look upon the very laſt words of <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> he was a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104282:27"/>
man that was full in outward bleſſings, and he improv'd
them to purpoſe for God; and that was the very cloſe of
all, <hi>Lord remember me for good;</hi> and ſo may'ſt thou when
thou comeſt to die. Thy conſcience ſhall not upbraid
thee, as others will; Thou comeſt to God for mercy,
What come to me for mercy? I have beſtowed mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you already, and how did you abuſe it? With what
face can you cry to me for mercy, that have abus'd it ſo?
O but when your Conſciences can tell you that you have
not abuſed Gods mercy, but his mercy in outward things
hath drawn your hearts unto him, and you have imploied
it in his ſervice: Now thou may'ſt with joy and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
ſay, <hi>Lord remember me for good.</hi> And if God
ſhould ever bring thee into afflictions in this world, it
will be ſweet and comfortable to thee, if thou haſt uſed
thy proſperity well. For that man that is willing to give
up the comfort of his proſperity to God, which he doth
enjoy; God will have a care to take away the gaul and
the bitterneſs of affliction from that man when he is under
affliction. O there's nothing more comfortable to a man in
affliction, than to conſider that he hath made uſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
for the honour &amp; glory of God. When I was in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
God had honour, and now I am in affliction, I can
comfortably fly to God for peace and comfort to my ſoul.</p>
            <p>And in this, God doth attain to his end and the end of
his Creatures. God hath his end eſpecially from theſe
men; the end of his Works of Creation and Providence.
Why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord hath made this world and filled it with
abundance of excellent things; but now, how ſhall God
attain his end: that is, To have glory from the excellent
things that he hath made in the world? Why, moſt men
takes them and abuſes them to Gods diſhonour; now
were there not ſome men that had hearts to give God the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104282:28"/>
glory of their eſtates, why God ſhould have no glory
from all his works; all his works would be as it were to
no purpoſe. But now it ſeems God hath called thee out
to give him the glory of his works; ſo that thou art the
man among ſo many that doth pay as it were to God the
rent that he requires for all the great things that he hath
done in the world; which cannot but bring in a great
deal of comfort to thee, and ſhews the excellency of it.</p>
            <p>I have now but two other things for the opening of
it before we come to the application, yet all the way
as we have gone along, we have indeavoured to apply
it; ſhewing wherein it conſiſts, the difficulty of it, and
the excellency of it: Now for the cloſe at this time, let
theſe things ſink into your hearts; I'll give you one
Scripture that you may go a way and ſeek to God to
teach you how to be full, and to learn this leſſon; It is in the
12 ver. of the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude, Theſe are ſpots in your feaſts
of charity, when they feaſt with you, feeding themſelves
without fear.</hi> There's the deſcription of wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
men. How are they deſcribed? They feaſt themſelves
without fear, that they may be fed to the full; they care
for nothing elſe. O this is a ſign of a wretched wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, to feaſt himſelf without fear. Hath God given
thee a full eſtate, and what, do'ſt thou take it without
fear. If God hath given thee an eſtate, and all outward
comforts in this world according to thy hearts deſire, it
ſtands thee upon to fear leaſt thou ſhould'ſt not improve
it for God. And O that God would ſend you away
from his preſence upon the conſideration of what you
have heard, even with trembling hearts. Lord, Thou
haſt given us theſe and theſe outward comforts; (and let
Husband ſpeak thus to the Wife, and Wife to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
when they ſee all things comming in in a plentiful
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104282:28"/>
way:) O the Lord hath given us theſe mercies more than
others, O but how if we ſhould not improve them for
God, how if we ſhould abuſe them, and if we have not
anſwerable grace to make uſe of them, what ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of us? Now having your hearts poſſeſt with the
fear of this, you will be the more like to be driven to
God in prayer; to ſeek of him that he would learn you
this leſſon, to teach you how to be full.</p>
            <p>And there is a great myſtery in this, as there is a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Godlineſs in Contentment, ſo there is a myſtery in
this; and I ſhall ſhew you further that it is done in a kind
of myſtical way. There are indeed ſome natural Rules,
whereby we may propound to men how to make uſe of
their proſperity; and it were well if all of us were wrought
upon in a natural way. But I ſhall endeavor to go further
with you than ſo, To ſhew you in a ſpiritual way how
you ſhould learn to be full, according to the Rules of the
Goſpel; To manifeſt the myſtery of Godlineſs in the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God the glory of your Eſtates and all the Comforts
that you do enjoy in this world.</p>
         </div>
         <div n="3" type="sermon">
            <head>SERMON III.</head>
            <p>WE Shall now come to what remains, There are
but three things more in this point that now
we are to finiſh.</p>
            <p>And the Firſt is, To ſhew you what a myſtery
of Godlineſs there is in a right learning how to be full.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What are the ſeveral Leſſons that are to be
learned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:104282:29"/>
And then the application of all from the point.</p>
            <p>And this is the method we obſerved in the learning
how to want. The Myſtery of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>And I told you that from the word in my Text, <hi>I am
inſtructed,</hi> ſo it is in your Books; but in the Original it
is, <hi>I am taught as in a myſtery;</hi> ſo that there is a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in both theſe. I have ſhewn you in many things
wherein the myſtery of Godlineſs lies in learning how to
be content. A godly man knows how to abound after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
manner than any other can do. Perhaps a man by
ſome ſtrength of natural prudence and wiſdom may know
how to order his Eſtate, ſo as not to be very inordinate
and wicked in the management of his outward eſtate. A
man that hath civility and natural wiſdom, may make
ſome good uſe of the bleſſings of God, that God hath
given him: But a gracious heart comes to ſanctifie the
name of God in his eſtate and outward bleſſings that
God hath given him, in another manner than natural wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
will teach a man. Grace will raiſe a mans ſpirit
higher, and that in theſe particulars,</p>
            <p>Firſt, A gracious heart learns how to be full, by often
reſigning up the eſtate that it doth poſſeſs unto God. He
learns how to enjoy his eſtate, by reſigning up all his
eſtate and comforts unto God. This is a way that a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
man underſtands little of, To know how to enjoy
his comforts by reſigning up his comforts; yet that's the
way of a gracious heart. He doth very frequently, when
he gets alone into his Cloſet, reſign up his Eſtate; <hi>Lord,
Thou haſt bleſſed me with many outward comforts, more
than thou hast done others of my brethren: Lord, I here
profeſs all to be thine, and give up all to thee; all belongs
to thee: and I deſire to enjoy no farther than I may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to thee in the place where thou haſt ſet me. Here Lord,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104282:29"/>
I give up my ſelf and all my fulneſs unto thee, take all,
diſpoſe all, lay out all for thine own praiſe and glory.</hi> And
by this means, when he hath done this, he comes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
more ſweetneſs than what he hath in any other way.
It is not in a greedy uſe of what he hath, that he comes
to enjoy his fulneſs; but by reſigning up what he hath to
God: and ſo he comes to enjoy his fulneſs in a better
manner and more comfortably than ever he did before.
This a godly heart finds by experience (as divers times
upon occaſion I have hinted to you) that the oftner any
thing comes out of Gods hand, the better and ſweeter it
is; and therefore he is willing to give up often what he
hath into the hand of God: And that's the firſt way.
But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, He learns how to be full in this way of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery;
he doth ſeek to preſerve his comforts and enrich
himſelf; by communicating what he hath: not onely by
reſigning to God, but by communicating his comforts he
ſeeks to preſerve them; and he ſeeks to enrich himſelf, by
communicating of his riches. Now this is a myſterious
way, yet the Scriptures ſhews this to be the way of a
gracious heart. A carnal heart he would enjoy his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
but how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, by keeping it to himſelf: I but a
godly heart that learns in the way of myſtery how to be
full; looks upon it as the onely way to preſerve his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
by communicating his eſtate, by doing many good
works, by making uſe of his eſtate for the publick good,
the glory of God and the good of his brethren. In <hi>Iſa.
32.</hi> you have a notable Scripture for that, that that's the
way that a godly man uſes for the preſerving of his eſtate;
<hi>ver. 8. But the liberal deviſeth liberal things.</hi> What then,
he doth not onely take the opportunity when he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to communicate of his eſtate, but ſtudies with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104282:30"/>
how he may communicate his eſtate for good. I but
he may quickly communicate all away, you will ſay, and
grow a begger himſelf. No, but mark what the Text
ſaith, <hi>And by liberal things ſhall he ſtand:</hi> That's the way
that he takes for the preſervation of what he hath: he
will truſt God with that. And indeed he comes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the comfort of his life by the communicating of the
comforts of his life. And then he ſeeks to get riches by
communicating of his riches. That Scripture you have
for this in <hi>1 Tim. 6. 17. Charge them that are rich in this
world that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain
riches, but in the living God; who giveth us richly all
things to enjoy. That they do good, that they be rich in
good works; ready to diſtribute.</hi> The more good works
he doth, the richer he makes account himſelf is. Now,
ordinarily a carnal heart, when he is call'd to do good
works, he cannot for ſhame but do ſomething; I but he
thinks he is the poorer by it. What will you get away
all my eſtate and make me a begger? Why, theſe often
Contributions draws away my eſtate, and they think
they have ſo much of their heart-blood drawn away, and
ſo they grow poorer and poorer. But a godly man he
makes account that the more good works he doth, the
richer man he grows. Why God himſelf accounts his
riches to be in the works of mercy. In <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. there
you ſhall find that the riches of God are in the works of his
mercy. <hi>That in the ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding
riches of his grace in his kindneſs towards us.</hi> Why God is
not ſaid to be rich in <hi>power</hi> ſo much as in <hi>grace;</hi> in the
works of his <hi>mercy,</hi> in the works of kindneſs. And ſo
a godly man, that hath learned by the grace of God to be
full, doth account himſelf made rich in the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what fulneſs God hath given him, for the glory of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104282:30"/>
his Name and the good of others. This is a ſecond myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
way of a godly mans learning how to be full.</p>
            <p>And then the Third way of a Godly mans learning
how to be full is this; He doth learn how to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in his eſtate, by mortifying of his affections to his
eſtate; and by moderating of his ſpirit in the joy that
he hath in his eſtate, he comes to receive the greater
joy in what he hath given to him. This you will ſay
is a riddle, for a man to have greater joy in outward
things, by moderating of his joy, and to have a greater
fulneſs in his abundance, by keeping himſelf within
bounds. This is the way of a godly man, the more he
keeps himſelf within bounds, the more comfort he hath
in his abundance; and the more he can mortifie his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to the comforts of the world, the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
hath he in theſe comforts of the world. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this may ſeem to be a great riddle and myſtery
(for ſo it is) I will give you one Scripture that will
make it out fully; and it is in <hi>Phil. 4. 4, 5. Rejoyce in
the Lord alway, and again I ſay rejoyce.</hi> Here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
puts people to rejoyce, to rejoyce in the Lord;
that is, not onely in ſpiritual things, but rejoyce in all
Gods bleſſings in a ſpiritual way. Now the men of the
world, when they are put upon it to rejoyce, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to rejoyce, they think they know nor how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
but by letting out their hearts without any bounds;
they know not how to keep any bounds. But mark
the words that follow, <hi>Let your moderation be known
unto all men.</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, And would
you rejoyce indeed truly and graciouſly and fully, I
exhort you to rejoyce, and again to rejoyce. Well
then. This is pleaſing to the heart of a man, we will give
our ſelves liberty to rejoyce, we will enlarge our ſelves
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104282:31"/>
in our joy. I but, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let your moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be known to all men</hi> though: So that in that he adds
this exhortation, Let your moderation be known to all
men, it's apparent that he means the joy in outward
things as well as in ſpiritual things: Let your moderation
be known to all, ſo that he doth not envy your rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in your eſtate. You may rejoyce in the comforts of
this world that God hath given you. But would you
have true joy, that that ſhould glad your hearts indeed,
let your moderation be known to all men, and do ſo
bound your ſelves in your joy, and let your hearts be
ſo mortified to the world, as that you may rejoyce in
God, even while you rejoyce in the outward bleſſings
that God hath given to you. And although many men
may think this to be a myſtery, and ſcarce to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
yet thoſe who are truly godly, find this by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
I appeal to you, when have you had the greateſt
comfort and joy in your eſtates and comings in, but at
that time when you have found your hearts mortified
to the world, and that you could keep your ſelves in
bounds. If a man goes abroad, and among company,
if he can keep his appetite in bounds and eat moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he hath more comfort in his meat and drink than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
man hath that eats exceſſively. A man that eats
and drinks moderately, he preſerves his health, and by
preſerving his health he hath more ſweetneſs in his meat
and drink in a conſtant way, than thoſe that eat and
drink immoderately; and when a man hath been abroad
among company, and let out his heart profuſely in way
of laughter and merriment, and all upon the merry
pin; why in the midſt of this laughter his heart is even
ſad, and when he comes home, he comes home with a
dead ſpirit. He is like <hi>Nabal,</hi> you know that when he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104282:31"/>
was feaſting, his heart was merry; but as ſoon as his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs
was gone from him, his heart died like a ſtone.
Many Company-keepers that give liberty to themſelves in
jollity and mirth, why the next day their hearts are even
as dead as a ſtone; and there's a great deal of guilt upon
their ſpirits, and their conſciences fly in their faces; ſo
that they have not ſo much joy in their ſpirits as thoſe
that can keep within bounds. Thoſe that can go in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
way and meet with their neighbours, and rejoyce one
with another; they when they come home, can bleſs God
for this their refreſhing that they have had; and the next
morning their hearts are in a ſweet and joyful frame. The
more we keep our ſelves in bounds in the uſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the more comfort have we in the uſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
That's the third way of a gracious hearts learning
how to abound. He learns how to enjoy the world, by
mortifying his heart to it, and by keeping himſelf
within bounds in the uſe of the Creature.</p>
            <p>And then the Fourth way of myſtery of the Godlies
learning how to abound, it is this; He learns how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
by getting all that he hath to be ſanctified by the
Word and Prayer. It was one way of knowing how to
want, by having our afflictions ſanctified to us; and ſo it
is the way to know how to abound. Now this is a way
that carnal hearts have little skill in, they think they
know how to abound by their natural wiſdom; I but
the way that a gracious heart hath for abounding, is this;
<hi>God hath proſpered me in my way and courſe in any
kind; now let me go to God and exerciſe Faith in his
Word, and ſeek unto him in prayer, that I may have a
ſanctified uſe of all theſe things then that God hath grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me.</hi> In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 4, 5. Every Creature of God is
good, and nothing to be refuſed, if it be received with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104282:32"/>
thankſgiving; <hi>for it is ſanctified by the Word of God and
Prayer.</hi> A little to open this Scripture, That the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſanctified by prayer, that I ſuppoſe is eaſie for you
to underſtand; that is, when I have any good in any
Creature, then I am to ſeek to God by prayer for a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
uſe of it unto me. But how is it ſanctified by the
Word? Now that that the Apoſtle doth intend here in
ſanctifying by the Word, is this, that he would ſhew to
us, That a godly man hath another kind of intereſt in
the Creature than another man hath; ſaith he, All things
are good, but how ſhall they be good to me? How
ſhall I know that they are good to me? That muſt be
by the Word (ſaith he) I cannot know that they are
good to me, that I have a ſanctified uſe of them, that
is, that all the comforts I have, I do enjoy them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to eternal life; for then a thing is ſanctified, when
it is conſecrated (as it were) and made holy: that is, when
it is made uſeful to the higheſt and laſt end. As a place
is ſanctified, when it is ſeparated from other things for
God; ſo when the bleſſing of God is upon my eſtate, to
make it to be to his glory and my laſt good, then it is
ſanctified. Now how comes this? This is by the Word of
God; for we by our fall have loſt all our intereſt in the
creature unto our outward comfort. Now God indeed
out of his bounty doth give to ſome men abundance here
in this world, I he gives them thoſe things that are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
good; I but how ſhall they come to be good to
him; that muſt be by the <hi>Word</hi> ſaith he, that is, God
by the Word of his Goſpel, the Covenant that he hath
made with his poor ſervants in Chriſt revealed in his
Word; it is that that gives the godly man a ſanctified
uſe of what he hath. If he hath it in a natural way, it
may prove a curſe to him; if he hath it onely by Gods
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104282:32"/>
general providence, by the command of God in his
works of providence, that is no ſanctified uſe. But
now, if a man comes to enjoy what he hath by the word
of the promiſe, by the word of the Goſpel, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals
Chriſt unto us, and our renewed intereſt unto all
we do enjoy by Jeſus Chriſt. This is the <hi>Word</hi> that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies
all to us. Moſt men look upon what they enjoy,
onely but in a way of general providence. Now a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heart looks upon what he enjoys by the word of
the Promiſe, the word of the Covenant, that gives him a
ſanctified uſe; and through the power of this word, he
comes to know how to be full: and uſe all his abundance
in a right way: ſo that the way he takes for the making
uſe of his fulneſs, it is, when God bleſſes him, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to exerciſe faith in the Word, in the Promiſe; to look
into the Covenant. Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the
things of this life, and of that which is to come. And
ſo he comes to make uſe of the promiſe, and improve
it by faith; and ſo comes to have a ſanctified uſe and
improvement of all the good things that he doth enjoy
in this world. Is not this a myſtery to moſt rich men.
Doth it put them upon prayer more than before, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the exerciſe of Faith in the Word more than before.
One that is godly, never prayes more than when God
doth proſper him in this world. It is uſual for men to
pray much in times of affliction. <hi>In their affliction they
will ſeek me early.</hi> I but that's a ſign of a carnal heart.
But now, a godly man, when God proſpers him, he ſees
cauſe to pray moſt then. I it is for poor people to live
by faith, that have nothing in the world. You will think
it's fit for them to believe and truſt in God. I but a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man uſes the more faith, when he hath the moſt in the
world. That's a good way in the myſtery of knowing
how to be full.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:104282:33"/>
And then a Fifth way in the myſtery of knowing how
to be full, is this. A godly heart by his fulneſs growes
to increaſe his humility, growes ſenſible of his unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
by his fulneſs. Now this is a way of myſtery too,
It is a good thing for a man to have humility together
<hi>with</hi> his fulneſs, but to have humility <hi>by</hi> his fulneſs,
this is a very great myſtery; it's a rare thing to ſee
humble proſperity; but to ſee a man humble by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity,
this is rare indeed. Affliction will humble men,
that's true, every one can underſtand that; but how
proſperity ſhould humble men, that's very hard to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.
I'll give you a clear Scripture for this, how
proſperity will humble a gracious heart; it's in the <hi>2 Sam.
7.</hi> 18. The Lord there had told <hi>David</hi> of great things
that he would do for him, and ſpake to him of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
that he had put upon him, and that he would ſtill
put upon him, and he would continue his Houſe to be a
great Houſe, and honourable, like the great men of the
earth. Mark, one would have thought that the heart of
<hi>David</hi> ſhould have been raiſed up, when God told him
not onely the great things that he had done, but the great
things he would do. This would have pufft up a carnal
heart. But then mark, in the 18 verſe, <hi>Then went King</hi>
David <hi>in, and ſat before the Lord, and he ſaid who am
I, O Lord God, and what is my houſe, that thou haſt
brought me hitherto; and this was yet a ſmall thing in thy
ſight, O Lord God; but thou haſt ſpoken alſo of thy ſervants
houſe for a great while to come; and is this the manner of
men, O Lord God; and what can</hi> David <hi>ſay more unto
tbee; for thou Lord God knoweſt thy ſervant for thy words
ſake; and according to thine own heart haſt thou done all
theſe great things, to make thy ſervants know them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou art great O Lord God.</hi> He doth not bleſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104282:33"/>
O God hath made me great; but, wherefore <hi>thou</hi>
art great; and <hi>what am I,</hi> and <hi>what is my houſe,</hi> and it
is <hi>according to thine own heart;</hi> and not according to any
thing in me, ſaith <hi>David.</hi> The larger God was in telling
of him the great things he had, and ſhould have, the
more humble was the heart of <hi>David.</hi> O this is a good
ſign of true humility, when you find your comings in to
be more then heretofore, as if you have had a great voyage,
many hundreds coming in of clear gain: then for you
to get alone, as it's ſaid that <hi>David</hi> did go then and ſat
down before the Lord. Go and ſet thy ſelfe before the
Lord, and fall humbling thy ſoul; <hi>O Lord, who am I that
thou ſhould'ſt deal thus graciouſly with me, that thou ſhould'ſt
make ſuch a difference between me and others.</hi> When your
rents come in it may be quarterly more then others; why
think with your ſelves, <hi>Lord, What is it that hath made the
difference between me and others? Others have their 18
pence a day for the providing for their families, and
thou giveſt me hundreds together. O Lord, what am I, that
it ſhould be thus with me more than with others!</hi> O if
it were thus, it were right indeed; and yet this is the
way of a godly mans learning how to be full. His ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
teaches him humility, and by being taught humility
by his fulneſs, he comes to know how to be full for the
glory of God and the good of his Church.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Another myſtery there is in a godly mans
learning how to be full, is, He accounts it better to loſe for,
and return to God; than to gain for, and keep to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
A godly heart when he hath a fulneſs, he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in it according as God will have him, in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bleſſings that he hath; I but he rejoyceth more in
this, that he hath ſomething to venture and loſe for
God, than that he hath gain for himſelf. One man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104282:34"/>
that he hath an eſtate to live merrily withal, and
bravely in the world; the other man rejoyces that he
hath an eſtate that he may venture for God, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
any thing to God, he doth account a greater
priviledge to him than receiving from God. This is a
way of myſtery too; and of this there was ſomething ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
likewiſe in the way of Contentment; and therefore
I ſhall but name it now.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, and then the laſt way is this, A godly man
learns to abound, by abounding in holineſs: The more
he abounds in worldly riches, the more he ſeeks to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in holineſs and in the duties of Gods Worſhip.
Now this is a myſtery to the men of the world, they
think indeed, poor men that have not ſo much to do in
the world, they may be often in the Worſhip of God,
and hear Sermons, and meditate (and the like.) But for
them that have ſo many things to take them off, they
think it cannot be expected from them: Whereas godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
will teach men to abound in their many buſineſſes
and outward proſperity that they have, and the great
things of the world, by adding a proportionable abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the performance both of the Worſhip of God and
in holineſs. They think that becauſe they have ſo many
things to draw them aſide, that they cannot be ſo holy
as others: but now, godlineſs will teach them to be
more holy, according to the proportion of their eſtate:
As eminent above others, ſo they will labour that their
holineſs ſhall be eminent above others. O this were an
excellent thing indeed, if all rich men ſhould never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
themſelves in this barely, that they have more than
others, but look to what a degree God hath made them
higher then others in their eſtates; that they ſhould
indeavour and never be ſatisfied till they attain to it,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104282:34"/>
till they be in the like degree above others in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Why now for men to do this, is a myſterious
thing, and where this is, certainly thoſe are well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the myſtery of godlineſs. Thus you ſee that
a gracious heart learns how to abound, not in a meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
way, by natural wiſdom, but in a way of myſtery
of godlineſs.</p>
            <p>But then there are divers Leſſons that he learns by
learning this Leſſon: As I told you in knowing how to be
content, one need learn a great many Leſſons before he
get to be inſtructed in the Art of Contentment in Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
ſo in abounding in the ſame manner: As now,</p>
            <p>Firſt, (I'll but name theſe things) He muſt learn the
Leſſon of the Principle from whence all he hath comes,
the fountain from whence all his good comes; be thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſtructed in that. Why I do enjoy theſe and theſe
outward comforts; from whence have I theſe? Why
God hath bleſſed my endeavors and skill, that God hath
given me more than others. I but it is the bleſſing of God
in all beyond my skill. Such and ſuch friends have left
me ſo much means; I but the fountain is on high, from
whence all the outward good that I have comes. This in
general is acknowledged, but the learning of it indeed
in a gracious manner will work mightily upon the heart;
the underſtanding of the fountain of all my outward good
as well as ſpiritual good.</p>
            <p>Yea, And this Fountain, it is not onely God the Firſt
Being, the Creator of all, in his providence, but it is
God in Chriſt: For we are to know that the very preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the world is through the mediation of Jeſus
Chriſt; the world would fall about our ears elſe: and all
the good things in the creature are preſerved by the
power of Chriſt now. And ſo a gracious heart looks
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104282:35"/>
upon the fountain of all, not onely as God the Creator
of all; but God through Chriſt the Mediator, that doth
preſerve the world: the world would otherwiſe fall into
confuſion. And ſo all the good that I have, it comes
from the work of Gods wiſdom and goodneſs, ordering
things through Chriſt unto me.</p>
            <p>And then, the leſſon of our unworthineſs, that's to
be learned throughly; your unworthineſs of the leaſt
crum of bread, the leaſt drop of water for the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of you. This would teach you how to be content
in want, (that we ſpake to before) and it will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
teach you how to abound, when you can learn
your own baſeneſs and vileneſs before the Lord. And
I now ſpeak it, not to learn it by your proſperity, that
was before in the myſtery of it, but to learn it any
way; by conſidering your ſinfulneſs, and your inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to uſe what you have; and conſidering how little
ſervice you have done for God: learn to know your
ſelves, that was the leſſon in learning to want, to
know our ſelves; but above all men, rich men had need
to learn to know themſelves.</p>
            <p>And then, To learn the vanity of the Creature and
the uncertainty of it; that helps you how to want, and ſo
it will help you to abound too. It's true, I have theſe
things, but what are theſe things to the portion of an
Immortal Soul; is there not a vanity in all theſe things
in the world? They make no ſuch great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and others, but they are ſuch things as
often I have heard may ſtand with the hatred of
God, ſuch things as a Reprobate may have for his
portion: That meditation will make men willing to be
content in the want of them. I abound now in theſe
things, why what great reaſon is there that I ſhould
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104282:35"/>
have my heart lifted up thereby, here's many now in
the world that are lower then I, and there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
in Hell that had more than I. O this will be a
meanes to moderate thy heart, and help thee to know
how to abound, when thou conſidereſt of the vanity
of the things of the world, and of the uncertainty of
them; I have them now, how quickly may they be
gone; my houſe bravely furniſht, how quickly may God
ſend a Fire. O conſider the uncertainty of all you have,
and this will teach you how to make uſe of what you
have in a looſe way: <hi>Charge men that are rich in this
world, that they be not high minded, nor truſt in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
riches.</hi> Or if God ſhould not take away your
riches, why let God but turn ſome humour in your
bodies, and bring ſome pain or diſeaſe; and what will
all your riches do you good? Let God but touch me
in my brain, I ſhall not know how to make uſe of
my eſtate; or touch me in my body, a little in the
kidnies, or pain in the bowels; what's all the world then.
O conſider of the vanity and of the uncertainty of all
things; the learning of that leſſon is a great help in
knowing how to abound.</p>
            <p>And then, The learning that all theſe things are but
Talents, God gives me them to trade withal, and I
am but a Steward (put them together) I am but Gods
Steward, and God puts me to trade for him in all
that I do: This will teach men how to abound. When
you imploy Factors, if they be faithful, the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of this, This is my Maſters goods, and I am
but a Steward, and I am to give account, and muſt
keep my books even: The conſideration of this will
call off his thoughts from other things, and make him
look to his books to keep them even. O if you would
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104282:36"/>
but learn this leſſon, that all outward comforts are
Talents that are given you to husband for God, and
you are his Stewards; it would make you to keep the
books even: Every day you would be caſting over the
books: Are things even between God and me? What
doth God aim at, why I ſhould have a proſperous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
and others not? By ſearching to know Gods end,
a mans conſcience will preſently tell him, Surely God
did not aim at this, that I ſhould have more ſatisfaction
to my fleſh; there is ſome thing elſe that God did aim
at: Let me learn to know Gods end.</p>
            <p>And then, Learn this leſſon, and it would be a
great help to you for the learning how to abound:
That is, That God doth but very ſeldom truſt, his
own people with theſe Outward Comforts (that we
have ſpoken to in the opening of it) but now I bring it
in as a leſſon that is to be learned, and ſhew you how
that will help you how to abound: I ſpoke of it by
way of evidence that it is a difficult thing for us to
learn how to abound. Now this leſſon will put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this, To learn to be ſo much the more watchful over
our ſelves.</p>
            <p>And then, Let not me bleſs my ſelf in my abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
            <p>And then, Let me deſire proportionable meaſure of grace
to what I have, leaſt what I have turn to my hurt
rather than for my good. Such and many other leſſons
might be named for the helping of us to abound; but
the truth is, there's nothing almoſt will help us to know
how to want, but it will likewiſe help us to abound;
and therefore I do but name theſe things.</p>
            <p>We come now as briefly as we can to wind up all in a
word of Application. You have had theſe ſix particulars
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104282:36"/>
opened to you, When a man knowes how to abound;
And the difficulty of it; And the neceſſity of it; And
the excellency of it; And the myſtery of it; And the
leſſons to be learned.</p>
            <p>Now then my Brethren,<note place="margin">Appl.</note> from all that hath been
ſaid, it ſerves to rebuke thoſe men who take care
onely how they may get fulneſs in the world; and
never are ſatisfied there: but to know how they may
uſe this for God, and how to manage their fulneſs,
it's ſcarce in all their thoughts. I appeal to you this
morning, as in the Name of God, Have theſe things
been in your thoughts that have been ſpoken to you?
I dare not lay it ſo, that every particular ſhould be
in your thoughts; but in the general hath it been in
your thoughts and care, as much to know how you
ſhould abound, as to get your abundance. God knows
it is otherwiſe, and your conſciences may tell you, that
that's your care how you may improve and get abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
but how to abound, that hath been but little
known: But by what hath been ſaid out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Lord hath rebuked you for one that hath a
carnal heart, a ſenſual and an earthly heart; for one
that's little acquainted with the wayes of God, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things: O that thou would'ſt charge thy own
ſoul in thy retired thoughts and meditations; and that
God would make what hath been ſaid out of this to
ſtick upon thy heart.</p>
            <p>And then, Secondly, Hence we are taught what an
excellent thing Religion is, that it helps every way. It
helps us how to want, it helps us how to abound. If
we be in a low eſtate, there comes in a help; if we be
in a high eſtate, there comes in a help. O Religion is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104282:37"/>
of admirable uſe, Grace and Godlineſs is of other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of uſe then the world thinks for. And as it is of
uſe to all, ſo it is above all to rich men. O that rich
men would believe this, That they have the greateſt
need of Grace. O that rich men by this would learn
to be in love with Godlineſs, and with thoſe means that
might work Grace upon them; becauſe there's nothing
can do them ſo much good as Religion. O if Grace be
anſwerable to their Eſtates, then they are happy men
indeed. If the Lord pleaſe to add his upper Spring to
the neather Springs, then they are happy Creatures. God
gives you abundance in the neather Springs, but doth he
give you the upper Springs too? O have thy thoughts
working thus, <hi>The Lord hath given me enough for this
world, to carry me thorow this Pilgrimage of mine; O
but had I grace added to all that I have, then I ſhould be
a happy man indeed.</hi> O learn to know the excellency
of Grace, and what need you have of it above other
men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hence upon what we hear, me thinks all our
deſires ſhould be moderated in reſpect of this world;
and you poor people, you ſhould not be ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for want of abundance: for you ſee there's a great
deal of difficulty in learning how to abound: And when
our ſpirits are ſet upon the things of this world, let us
curb them in this; <hi>I ſee there's a great deal of difficulty
in knowing how to uſe things, and therefore let me be more
moderate in my deſires after abundance.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You that have rich friends any of you, you
ſee what need you have here to pray for them. It was
the ſpeech of a holy man once, when he met an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his, that he had not ſeen a long time before, and
it ſeems he had a great eſtate befallen him; as ſoon as he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104282:37"/>
met him, <hi>O Sir</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I had never need to pray for
you ſo much as now.</hi> His friend ſtood amazed at it, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that he had heard of ſome great evil that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
him. He gives him this anſwer, <hi>I hear you have a
great eſtate befallen to you.</hi> Certainly there's no men in
the world, that have ſo much need of Prayer, as thoſe
that are high in eſtate.</p>
            <p>And then, You who do abound, be you exhorted to
what you have heard, and now to ſet upon the work,
<hi>To learn how to abound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Learn this one Leſſon farther (that ſhould have been
ſpoken) <hi>Learn throughly your dependance upon God in all
your abundance; To ſee as much need of God in the midſt
of your abundance, as in the greateſt depth of affliction.</hi> That's
one thing that is of very great uſe. A man hath attain'd
to a good meaſure of Grace when he comes to this, that
he ſees he hath as much need of mercy from God in his
abundance, as in the loweſt afflicted eſtate in the world.
Many men and women they think that they have need of
God in their affliction; then they depend upon God. I
but you ſhould depend upon God as much if you had
all the world to poſſeſs, as the pooreſt beggar in the
world. This you may either put into the myſtery that
there is in it, or into the Leſſons; for indeed it is a
myſtery to the men of the world: and therefore Chriſt
teaches not onely poor people to come and ſay, <hi>Lord
give us this day our daily bread;</hi> but the richeſt men in
the world is to pray ſo: the greateſt Prince and Monarch
in the World is every day to come to God, to the Gates
of Mercy, to beg his bread. Now if rich men would
be ſo ſenſible of their condition, that, they depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God for the enjoyment of what they have every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
have as much need of mercy as the pooreſt wretch
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104282:38"/>
that lives upon the Face of the Earth: This would be
a mighty help for them to learn how to Abound. I
beſeech you, examine whether this be ſo in you or no?
When you have been poor, and afflicted, then you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
you had need of Mercy: I, but now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do you find that your Life is as much a Life of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon God now, as ever it was? If God ſhould
take away all you have, then you would think, O, I
muſt live altogether the Life of Dependance; but
certainly, you ſhould now live the Life of Dependance,
as if you knew not where to have your Dinner or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
<hi>Man lives not by Bread only,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>or by
Meat; but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth
of God: he lives by it.</hi> There is much in this that I am
ſpeaking: But a little for the further putting of you
on in this, that you may learn this Leſſon of Aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:</p>
            <p>Conſider but this, What a great Mercy of God it is
to you, that your great Work that you are put now
upon, it is how to improve Mercy; whereas the work
of other Men, it is how to get Mercy: Other Men, all
their Care and Thoughts is, how they ſhould get Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries;
and now that that God calls you to, it is to
Improve what you have. The Life of many Men and
Women, is this, Nothing elſe but to Improve Mercy,
not to bear Affliction much, or to ſeek to get; but
the whole Courſe of their Life is to be ſpent in Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Mercy. Think but of this one thing, and it will
make you Thankful; when you are in your Families,
What have I to do in the Morning when I riſe? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but to Improve the Mercy that God gives me:
Mercy meets with me when I riſe; Mercy goes forth
with me; Mercy comes in with me, and I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104282:38"/>
to do from the Beginning of the Year, to the End
of the Year, but to make uſe of Mercy: Why this is
the Lives of many to receive in Mercy, and make
uſe of it for God: O the comfortable Life that thou
haſt! Therefore ſeeing that God puts thee upon ſuch
a Notable and Excellent Imployment thou hadſt need
be Faithful. Thy work is a great deal better, and
more Comfortable than the works of others; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
often Examine thy Heart. And, O that I could but
prevail thus far with Men and Women, that have great
Eſtates, that there ſhould never a Day paſs but they
would call themſelves to Examination! Have I learned
to be full? Do I enjoy my fulneſs for God, yea or no?
Do not let the Reckoning between God and thy Soul,
run too long, but keep thy Book even every day with
God, and then thou ſhalt have abundance of Comfort in
thy Fulneſs.</p>
            <p>And ſet before you the Example of thoſe that have
Miſcarried in their Fulneſs, and that will be a very good
help unto you. Such and ſuch Men have Miſcarried,
Lord help me that I may not Miſcarry, as they have done:
Yea, thy moſt eminent Servants have Miſcarried, the Lord
help me that I may not Miſcary.</p>
            <p>And for the Cloſe of all, O you that God hath given
theſe Mercies to; Bleſs Him for His Bleſſings: but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Bleſs Him that He hath Bleſſed His Bleſſings to
you. When we receive a Bleſſing, we ſhould Bleſs God;
I, but when God hath Bleſt this Bleſſing, then our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Him ſhould be Double and Trebble too. O
think thus with thy ſelf, What all this and Heaven too!
ſuch convenient Habitations, and compaſſed round
about with Mercy whereſoever you are! All this, and
Heaven, Houſe and Eſtate, and Friends, and Health of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104282:39"/>
Body, and every Thing that I want: O the greateſt
thing that I want, is a thankful Heart, for if I had but
that, then I were happy indeed. Now for a Man to
have all things in a Fulneſs, and only Scantineſs in
Thankfulneſs; every thing is full, but only the Heart is
empty. The Heart of the Wicked is little worth. Thy
Houſe is full, and thy Eſtate, but what's thy Heart in
the mean time? But now, If God gives thee ſo much
Mercy in the World, and all this but the beginning of
Heaven to thee: O then, how ſweet is thy Life made to
thee by God! And all things that are the means of Undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of others, are the means to help thee to Honour God.
O by this the Mercies of God are raiſed indeed: Bleſs
God for ſo great a Bleſſing, it is not an ordinary thing.</p>
            <p>Only one thing more for the Cloſe of all in my Text,
and that is the joyning of both theſe things together,
That I learn how to be content, and how to be full. There
ſhould have been that Note.<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> And that is,</p>
            <p>That Grace wil! help Men to carry themſelves evenly
with God, and graciouſly with God in variety of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
Let the Condition be up and down, this way,
and then another, yet Grace helps a Man to lie ſquare
any way, like a Dye; caſt it which way you will it lies
ſquare: So put a gracious Heart into any Condition,
Full or Empty, yet Grace will help him in any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whatſoever, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the <hi>Corinthians:
Through Honour and Diſhonour, by Evil report and Good
report, by the Armour of Righteouſneſs, on the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
and on the Left.</hi> We find Uſe of our Weapons on
the Right hand, and on the Left, the Armour of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
helps not only on the Left-hand to Fence off
the evil of Adverſity, but on the Right-hand, to Fence
off the Evil of Proſperity: Here's a Chriſtian Souldier,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104282:39"/>
that can make uſe of the Armor of Righteouſneſs, both
on the Right-hand and on the Left.</p>
            <p>I had thought to have given ſome grounds, Why it is
that Grace will help any way; as a Watch in a Mans
Pocket, if it be a good Watch, though a Man ſit upon
it, and it is tumbled up and down, yet the Wheels they
keep a conſtant ſteady motion. So it is with the heart of
a man, if there be Grace within, and the wheels work
aright, yet Grace makes the Heart ſtedfaſt within, let the
condition be never ſo various; to be toſt up and down,
this way, or that way; yet the heart keeps the ſame. The
Motto of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> may be the Motto of every
gracious heart, <hi>Alwayes the ſame.</hi> So in a conſtant way,
either in proſperity or adverſity, ſtill he continues in an
evenneſs with God. If God caſts him upon his Sick Bed
there he rejoyces in God and bleſſes God, and you will
find ſavory and ſpiritual things come from him then; and
if God deliver him, and you find him in proſperity, there
his heart is heavenly ſtill, and gracious and ſpiritual, and
raiſed above the Creatures; which way ſoever he be
put.</p>
            <p>I cannot give you the grounds, I'll onely compare a
Scripture or two together (and ſo conclude all) to ſee
the evenneſs of the heart of a godly man in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
let them be what they will. In <hi>Pſal. 57. To the
chief Muſician</hi> Al-taſchith, Mictam <hi>of</hi> David, <hi>when he
fled from</hi> Saul <hi>in the Cave.</hi> That's the Title of the Pſalm.
<hi>A Pſalm that</hi> David <hi>made in his very great affliction,
when he fled from</hi> Saul <hi>for his life in the Cave.</hi> See what
he ſaith, and comparing that ſame with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60. where
it is, <hi>To the chief Muſician upon</hi> Shuſhan-Eduth, Mictam
<hi>of</hi> David; <hi>to teach, when he ſtrove with</hi> Aram Naha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aim,
<hi>and with</hi> Aram Zobah, <hi>when</hi> Joab, <hi>returned and ſmote of</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:104282:40"/>
Edom <hi>in the Valley of Salt, Twelve thouſand. David</hi>
was low when he fled from <hi>Saul</hi> in the Cave, there <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
had not the Kingdom; well but afterwards <hi>David</hi>
was high and had the Kingdom, <hi>Joab</hi> was his Officer, and
ſmote of <hi>Edom</hi> in the Valley of Salt Twelve thouſand:
Now you would think that this different condition of
<hi>David,</hi> ſhould have made a different work in his Spirit;
yet you ſhall find a great part of that <hi>Pſalm</hi> to be the
very ſame: In the <hi>57th. Pſalm, ver. 7. My heart is fixed,
O God, my heart is fixed; I will ſing and give praiſe;
awake up my Glory, awake Pſaltery and Harp, I my ſelf
will awake early, I will praiſe the Lord among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
I will ſing unto Thee among the Nations,</hi> &amp;c. Why,
you ſhall find likewiſe, that <hi>David</hi> in the 60<hi>th. Pſalm,</hi>
he hath much of this, of bleſſing God as well in his
Proſperous ſtate in which he was, as in his Afflicted
eſtate. Let us compare this with the 108<hi>th. Pſalm, ver. 5.
Be thou Exalted, O God.</hi> There <hi>David</hi> was in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
eſtate: And here's the ſame Expreſſion; <hi>O God,
my heart is fixed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will ſing and give praiſe
with my Glory. Awake Pſaltery and Harp, I my ſelf
will awake early: I will praiſe Thee, O Lord, among the
People, and I will ſing Praiſes unto Thee among the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
&amp;c. Juſt he goes on in the very ſame words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now the</hi> 60th. Pſalm, <hi>is to be compared with the</hi>
108th. <hi>where it is,</hi> God hath ſpoken in his Holineſs, I will
rejoyce: I will divide <hi>Shechem,</hi> and mete out the Valley
of <hi>Succoth: Gilead</hi> is mine, <hi>Ephraim</hi> alſo is the ſtrength
of my Head, <hi>Judah</hi> is my Law-giver, <hi>&amp;c. Now in the
108 Pſalm,</hi> God hath ſpoken in his Holineſs, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
I will divide <hi>Shechem, &amp;c. This is the Note from
hence (and ſo we have done.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>David</hi> in his various Conditions, though at ſome
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104282:40"/>
times more Proſperous than others, yet ſtill you find him
in the ſame Spirit, and almoſt the very ſame words. Be
he <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the Cave, or when <hi>Joab</hi> had overcome, or be he
afterwards how he will, in a higher Condition; for the
108<hi>th. Pſalm</hi> was made in a time after this: Yet <hi>Davids</hi>
heart is the ſame, Praiſing God, Bleſſing God, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in his Word, Truſting in his Word: Now that's
the Note.</p>
            <p>You ſhould obſerve; Whether you can make uſe of the
ſame Scripture in one Condition, as in another: Thoſe
Scriptures that are comfortable to you in one Condition,
make uſe of them in another. And whether you can
Praiſe God in one Condition, in the ſame way as in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Why Grace doth ſo ſatisfie and ſtrengthen the
Heart, as the things that are without in the World, makes
very little alteration: There is very little alteration,
that External things can make in a Gracious heart. When
a Man or Woman is ſo, that a Proſperous condition
puffs him up, or Adverſity makes him dejected, it's
a ſign of very little Grace, or no Grace. But thus much
for this Text.</p>

            <p>THeſe Words are the Expreſſion of a Gracious,
Humble, Submiſſive Heart, to Gods Diſpoſe.
The Words of <hi>Ely</hi> the Prieſt, who when the
Hand of God was revealed againſt his Family,
he here falls down before Him, and ſaith, <hi>It is the Lord,
let Him do what ſeemeth Him good.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>It is the Lord:</hi> Whatever the means be, that ſuch and

hard to me, but they may ſeem otherwiſe to God; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
things ſeem to me, however dark they look, yet
to God, things may ſeem after another manner; and
therefore let things be done rather as they ſeem to God,
than as they ſeem to me.</p>
            <p>We have in the Words before you, theſe Four Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal
Points.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The firſt is, That a Gracious Heart looks much to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104282:41"/>
God in every Affliction that doth befal it: <hi>It is the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſight of God in an Affliction, is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
That that cauſes a gracious Heart humbly to fall down,
and to ſubmit: <hi>It is the Lord, let Him do what ſeemeth
Him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That things ſeem oftentimes far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
to us, than they do to God; God looks upon things
otherwiſe than we do: <hi>Then let Him do what ſeemeth
Him good.</hi> Not what ſeemeth good to me, nor what
ſeems good to others, but unto God.</p>
            <p>Then fourthly, That this is a very Commendable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
and Acceptable work, upon the firſt Manifeſtation of
any Diſpleaſure of God, preſently to yield and ſubmit
without any more adoe: Not after a great deal of rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
and ſtir, then to yield; but to yield preſently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
upon the firſt Manifeſtation againſt his Family, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
falls down, and ſaith, <hi>It is the Lord, let Him do
what ſeemeth Him good.</hi> Theſe are the four Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the Text, and I ſhall deſire to go through them
all, and ſpeak to mine own Heart and yours in them:
It is the Second that is the chief and main, there we
ſhall pitch moſt.</p>
            <p>But briefly of the Firſt:</p>
            <p>That a gracious Heart in all Afflictions, looks up <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
to God: <hi>It is the Lord.</hi> Not this Cauſe, and the other
Cauſe, or this Accident, or the other thing, that takes
up his Thoughts ſo much, but God in it. The truth is,
a Heart that is truly Gracious, loves to Converſe with
God in every thing. If it be a Mercy, preſently the
Heart gets through the Creatures, by which God beſtows
a Mercy, and looks up to the God of that Mercy: And
ſo if it be Afflictions, the Heart that is Gracious, having
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104282:42"/>
ſome of the Divine Nature in it, preſently works it's
ſelf up to God, in the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>Micah, ver.</hi> 9. there's a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Scripture for this: Saith the Prophet there, <hi>The Lords
Voice crieth unto the City, and the Man of Wiſdom ſhall
ſee thy Name; hear ye the Rod, and who hath appointed
it.</hi> The Man of Wiſdom ſhall ſee thy Name: The Name
of God is written upon his Rod, and where there is a
Man of Wiſdom, he ſees the Name of God that is there
written. It's a ſpecial part of the Wiſdom of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
to be able to ſee Gods Name, and to read Gods
Name written upon his Rod: The Men of the World
have not the skill to read the Name of God written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Rod; but it's a priviledge of the Saints, that they
ſee Gods Name written there. It is a ſpecial part of the
Worſhip that is due to God, the Acknowledgment of
God in all his Adminiſtrations. That's Worſhip, when
we acknowledge God in all his Providences towards us,
<hi>In all thy wayes acknowledge Him;</hi> and in all <hi>His</hi> Wayes
he muſt be acknowledged: As we muſt acknowledge
God in all <hi>our</hi> wayes, ſo we muſt acknowledge God in
all <hi>His</hi> Wayes, and thereby we come to Worſhip Him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It's a means to compoſe the Heart, to
ſtrike the Heart with awful Fears and Reverence of God,
when we look at Him in our Afflictions, and beyond
the Creature. It is a Way to make us ſearch and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our Hearts, what there is between God and us;
when once we take notice it's God that doth it, this
preſently puts the Heart upon a Scrutiny; What is there
between God and my Soul? What is there between God
and my Family?</p>
            <p>And then it is a ſpecial means to put the Soul on to
ſeek God for Help, for Aſſiſtance, for Bleſſing, for a
Sanctified Uſe of what ever Affliction is upon it. There's
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104282:42"/>
a great deal of good in ſeeing the Lord in an Affliction,
in ſeeing that we have to deal with Him; but the ſpecial
good is, that that we ſhall come to in the ſecond Point:
The working of the humble ſubmiſſion of the Heart to
God. Only for the preſent, let this Rebuke ſuch who
are of Carnal and Atheiſtical ſpirits, That whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals
them, look no higher than the Creatures by which
God works. It's an Argument that they have little to
do with God, that they know not what it is to Converſe
with God, that will cry out of their Afflictions: <hi>They
howl upon their Beds,</hi> as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith in the <hi>7th.</hi>
of <hi>Hoſea, But they ſeek not to Me, or turn not to Me.</hi> And
ſuch as have ſlight and vain hearts in the time of their
Afflictions, it's a very ill thing that; for Men to think
to take Courage to themſelves, ſo as not at all to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the Hand of God. God expects we ſhould be
ſo, though we ſhould not have diſhonoured Hearts, yet
we ſhould have precious Hearts. For when one have
to deal with God in any thing, we had need be ſerious,
the Preſence of God ſhould work our Hearts to Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:
And therefore ſlightneſs and vanity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the day of Affliction, it is very unbeſeeming.
Thou doeſt not ſanctifie the Name of God in that Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration
of His towards thee, who haſt<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> vain and
ſlight Spirit in the Day of thine Affliction? And ſurely
that's an Argument that thou never ſaweſt God in His
Mercy, when thou doeſt not ſee him in thine Afflictions:
but that thou didſt enjoy Gods Mercy but in a Brutiſh
way, when thou doeſt behave thy ſelf under thine Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in a Brutiſh way. But this ſhall ſuffice for the firſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, and that's the main: That the ſight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
of the Hand of the Lord, is that that hath a great deal
of Power in it, to work the Heart that is Gracious, to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104282:43"/>
an humble ſubmiſſion to Him. <hi>It is the Lord, let Him
do what ſeemeth Him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That that's here ſpoken of <hi>Ely,</hi> we may find mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by divers of the Servants of God in Scripture: I'll
give you but only two Scriptures for it, and thoſe are
concerning <hi>David.</hi> In this Book of <hi>Sam. 15. 25. If I
ſhall flnd favour in the Eyes of the Lord, he will bring me
again, and ſhew me both it,</hi> (that is) <hi>the Ark and the
City, and his Habitation; but if he ſhould ſay, I have no
delight in thee, behold, here am I, let him do to me, as
ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> So you ſee how <hi>David,</hi> he looks
up to God here: If I find favour in the Eyes of the Lord,
he will bring me again; and if he ſay, I have no delight
in thee, behold, here I am, let Him do what ſeemeth
good unto him. And in the <hi>39th. Pſal. ver. 9. I was
dumb, I opened not my Mouth, becauſe thou diddeſt it.</hi> It
was the ſight of the Lord in it, that made him Dumb,
and not open his Mouth: And you know what He did
in the caſe of <hi>Shimei,</hi> when He Curſt him, <hi>The Lord hath
bid him,</hi> ſaith he. Now this Point is very large, I ſhall
briefly propound unto you, the ſeveral Conſiderations
from the Hand of God in an Affliction, for to quiet
the Heart, and to help the Heart to ſanctifie his Name.</p>
            <p>As firſt <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>us, <hi>It is the Lord:</hi> It is he that is infinitely
above me, above us all, and therefore He muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to. It is the Great and Bleſſed God, that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
above Angels, and above all Creatures that hath
done it; and therefore He muſt be ſubmitted to. It may
may be you could not tell how to bear a Box on the Ear
from an Inferiour, or an Equal, or from one a little
above you: But if ſo be a <hi>King</hi> ſhould be near and
ſtrike you, you could bear that; you would not be
ſo ready to riſe againſt him, as againſt an Inferiour mans
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104282:43"/>
ſtriking of you. Why, <hi>'Tis the Lord,</hi> that is Infinitely
above us; that is the Infinite, Glorious, and Bleſſed
God. He muſt be ſubmitted to.</p>
            <p>Yea, ſecondly, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> that hath the abſolute
Right to us, and all that we have; more than we have
to our ſelves, or any thing that we enjoy. <hi>It is the
Lord,</hi> that hath the abſolute Authority over us, to do
with us what He will; you have not ſo much authority
over a Worm under your feet, as God hath over you,
and over all your Comforts; you have not ſo much
right to kill a Fly, as the Lord hath to take away your
Lives: He hath more Right a thouſand thouſand times
over your Lives, Familie, Comforts, and all you have,
than you have over the meaneſt Creature, He hath the
abſolute Right over you all. If any thing be done amiſs
in a Family, and the Servants be falling out one with
another, and one ſaith you did thus and thus, and the
other ſaith you did it, and ſo are wrangling one with
another; now if the Maſter comes, and ſaith, Why?
It was I that did it: He makes account that this ſhould ſtill
them all, becauſe it was he that had right to do it. Why,
<hi>It is the Lord,</hi> and therefore it is not for us to ſtand
Fretting againſt any means: For it is the Great, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Lord, that hath the abſolute Power and Dominion
over us.</p>
            <p>And then, Thirdly, It is the Lord we have ſinn'd
againſt, and hath us at infinite Advantages that way:
It is the Lord that we are liable unto. While we are
here in this World, and carry about with us ſo much ſin, we
cannot have any ſerious Thoughts of God, but we muſt
needs have Thoughts how we have ſinn'd againſt this
God, and what advantages this God hath us at, in reſpect
of our ſins. Oh! <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> that we have offended
and ſinn'd againſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:104282:44"/>
Fourthly, Hence it follows, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is He; that if He hath brought a little Affliction,
He may bring abundantly more if He pleaſes. It is He,
whoſe Power as it is not ſhortned in a way of Help, ſo
not in a way of Affliction: Hath He afflicted in one kind,
He might in a hundred, if he pleaſed? Hath He afflicted
thee in thy <hi>Eſtate,</hi> He might have afflicted thee in thy <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</hi>
Hath He afflicted thee in thy <hi>Body,</hi> He might have affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
thee in thy <hi>Soul?</hi> Hath He afflicted thee in thy Soul
<hi>here,</hi> He might have ſent thee down to <hi>Hell eternally?</hi>
Is it upon any within thy Dwelling-place, it might have
been upon thy ſelf? It is the Lord that hath us under
His feet. And if He bring the leaſt evil, He might have
brought as much as He pleaſed: He might have afflicted
us abundantly more than He hath done. And this is a
mighty humbling Conſideration to quiet the Heart, under
the Hand of God.</p>
            <p>And then, Fifthly, <hi>It is the Lord.</hi> Why, it is the
Lord that hath done all the Good that ever we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed:
It is He that hath done all Good to us. You
have an Affliction, but have you no Mercies? Do you
enjoy no Good? Why, from whence was it, was it not
from the Lord? <hi>Shall I receive Good from the Hand of
the Lord, and not Evil,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job.</hi> Why, even the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
Beaſts will bear ſtrokes from them that feeds them.
The very Bears will ſuffer the Bearherd that brings them
Meat, to ſtrike them; they will not ſuffer a ſtranger ſo
much, but thoſe that bring them Meat: They receive
good from them, and therefore they will ſubmit to them.
Now we receive infinite Good from God, daily Good,
and that's a very uſeful Meditation for us to conſider of,
in times of Affliction: There's this Good, or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Good taken from me, but what <hi>do</hi> I enjoy, or what
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104282:44"/>
               <hi>have</hi> I enjoyed? It's a uſual thing in Afflictions; to keep
the ſight of God from us: As the putting a thing but as
big as a Two-pence upon the Eye, it will keep the ſight
of all the Heavens from us; and ſo a little Afflictions
many times keeps the ſight of all the Good that we do
enjoy from us. But when we conſider it is the Lord,
the infinite Fountain of all Good, this is a mighty quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>It is the Lord:</hi> He is Juſt and Righteous in
all his Proceedings, there's nothing but Righteouſneſs
in Him in all His Wayes: <hi>In very Faithfulneſs,</hi> ſaith
David, <hi>haſt thou afflicted me.</hi> It may be ſome affliction
may come from Men, and we may think they deal Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly
and Unjuſtly; but it is the Lord, and there
is nothing but Righteouſneſs in all His Wayes. If we
ſhould think, Why, theſe afflictions, they fall upon me,
and ſuch and ſuch, they eſcape. You muſt not reaſon
ſo, It is the Lord, and therefore it is Righteous. You
think it might be better thus and thus, but it is the Lord,
that is Juſt and Righteous in all His Proceedings, and in
all His Wayes. Yea,</p>
            <p>Seventhly, As Righteous, ſo infinitely Wiſe: He is
Infinitely Wiſe, and ſo knows how to Order things in
the beſt way that may be; He knows what's fitteſt both
for us, and for His own Glory: We are poor weak Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but it's the Lord that ſees Infinitely beyond us.</p>
            <p>Eightly, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> that hath alwayes very Holy
ends; in all His Dealings He hath Holy ends, and Aims
at Great and Holy things, though perhaps we know
them not; and therefore He is to do whatſoever He will.
We uſe to ſay of a Man, if we ſee him to be a Wiſe and
Underſtanding man, yea, a Juſt man, and to be a man that
doth all things alwayes from good Principles, and for good
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104282:45"/>
Ends, let him alone, though we do not underſtand what
he is doing, yet let him alone, he knows what he doth:
<hi>It is the Lord,</hi> let Him alone in His work, let Him do
what ſeemeth Him good.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> and He is able to bring good
out of the greateſt evils, to bring light out of darkneſs;
yea, to bring the greateſt good out of the greateſt evils.
I verily believe, that many of the People of God have
found it ſo, That the greateſt Bleſſings that ever they
have had ſince they were born, have been Uſhered
in by the greateſt Afflictions. Certainly, as the Lord
would not ſuffer ſin in the World, were it not for His
Infinite Power, to bring about Good from the ſins of men;
ſo neither would He ſuffer Afflictions in the World to
His Saints, but that He knows He hath Power enough to
bring good to them, even out of their greateſt Afflictions.
<hi>It is the Lord,</hi> that hath this Power. One would be loath
to truſt ones ſelf with one in any Danger, that cannot
tell how to bring him out again: You would be loath
to ſee your Child held over the Water by another little
Child, or over a Fire; but if a ſtrong Man hath your
Child in his Arms, and holds it over the Water, and
you know him to be your loving Friend, it troubles
you not at all: Why? Becauſe you know he hath
ſtrength enough to keep your Child from the Danger.
Why, <hi>It's the Lord,</hi> that though He holds his Children
over Fire or Water, and brings them into Fear and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions;
yet He hath Power enough not only to preſerve
them, but to bring a great deal of Good out of all, and
therefore let Him do what ſeemeth Him good.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> therefore ſubmit to Him,
for His Counſel muſt ſtand, and His Work muſt go on,
there's no ſtriving with the Almighty: Are we greater
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104282:45"/>
than He? No: Inſtead of ſtriving, let there be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
and yielding.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Yea, and further, <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
He is worthy that His Deſigns ſhould be brought
about, though we ſhould be ruined: There is ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Excellency in this God (as I ſay) He is worthy to
have his own Deſigns brought about, and his own Will
fulfilled, though it be to our Ruins: Doth God think
man ſo excellent a Creature, as that He ſhall give thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of other Creatures for to help him, with the loſs
of their own Lives? And ſhall not we think the Lord
to be Infinitely worthy, if He have uſe of our Lives, or
Liberties, or Names, or any thing; that He ſhould not
have all, to bring about his Deſigns withal? O, he is
worthy, and therefore <hi>let Him do what ſeemeth Him good.</hi>
If ſo be he will raiſe up any building of his in our
ruins, we ſhould be willing to be ſerviceable to God in
it; we ſhould be willing to lie down and let all that we
have go, that may be any way ſerviceable to God in his
deſigns; for the Lord is worthy.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations may be very uſeful to help you
in the day of Affliction, to meditate of God; and ſo to
work your hearts to an humble ſubmiſſion: but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if you add this one more.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, When you do not onely ſee him to be <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,
the Lord;</hi> but if you can ſee that you have any intereſt
in him, as that he is the Lord <hi>your God;</hi> this is of mighty
power to quiet the heart: as if he be your God, why
then he is in Covenant with you, and if he be in Covenant
with you, then he hath engaged all his Wiſdom, and all his
Power, and all his Mercy, for to be working eternally for
your good; and that's more than a meer conſideration that
it is the Lord; and that he is above us, and juſt and holy,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104282:46"/>
and that it is in vain not to ſubmit unto Him. But it is the
Lord that is in Covenant with me, and in that Covenant
he hath engaged all his Power and Wiſdom, and Mercy
and Goodneſs for me. Did we but underſtand what the
Covenant of God in Jeſus Chriſt was, that he hath taken
his Servants into; O then this thought, It is the Lord in
Covenant with me, would be enough to enable us to
reſign up our ſelves wholly to his diſpoſe.</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, Yea, 'Tis the Lord that is our Father.
You know what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Shall I not drink the Cup
that my Father giveth me to drink.</hi> That was the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Chriſt: O that this were in all our thoughts at
all times, when any thing, though it be never ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
befals us, <hi>Shall I not drink the Cup that my Father
giveth me to drink?</hi> Whatſoever it be, if it comes out of
a Fathers hand, why let <hi>Him</hi> do what ſeemeth him good.
You know when Chriſt came to the Diſciples walking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the waters, and the Diſciples were afraid; <hi>Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
'tis I;</hi> ſaith Chriſt. They were troubled at it,
and thought that one came as an Enemy to do them hurt;
but <hi>be not afraid, 'tis I;</hi> ſaith Chriſt. So my Brethren,
we ſhould look in all afflictions to ſee who it is that comes;
we apprehend an Enemy coming, but now thoſe that
are godly, they may look upon him that comes as God,
<hi>Be not afraid,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>it is I;</hi> It's I that am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
to you in my Son. Upon this the ſoul may with
abundance of ſweetneſs and comfort, go to God in
Prayer, and open it ſelf to God; having an intereſt in
him. You know, If a great Dog ſhould come with full
mouth upon one, why indeed, if ſo be that he that comes
to a houſe be a thief, he hath cauſe to fear; but if he
be a Child, he can call to his Father, the Maſter of the
houſe, Take off your Dog. So when afflictions come
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104282:46"/>
to the wicked, they come with open devouring mouth,
and they have cauſe to be afraid; but thoſe that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in God, may go with freedom unto God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and cry to the Lord to take off the dog, the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to keep it that it ſhould do them no hurt at leaſt.
<hi>It is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I but you will ſay, That though it be the Lord,
yet it's this indeed that rather makes my affliction the
greater; to conſider it comes from God: The thought
that it's God in it ſtrikes terror; becauſe I am conſcious of
ſin againſt God. It is an affliction that comes for my ſin,
and therefore I ſee the diſpleaſure of God in it; and this
makes it more grievous. I would rather bear any thing
from a creature, than to bear the diſpleaſure of God in
a creature; that's that that is the greateſt ſtick of all, and
therefore every time I think it is the Lord, it rather
adds to mine affliction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, Firſt, It's true, many men
that think that all is well between God and them in the
time of their health and proſperity, yet when afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
comes, God appears to them, and they look upon
God as an Enemy; this is dreadful: It's a fearful thing
when God is a terror to a man in the day of Calamity.
You know what <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith <hi>Jer. 17. 17. Be not thou a
terror to me, O Lord, for thou art my hope in the day of
evil.</hi> If the ſoul may have God to be the hope of it in
the day of evil, there's no evil terrible; but if God be
a terror then too, and write bitter things againſt the ſoul
in the time of affliction, that's dreadful.</p>
            <p>But yet ſuppoſe thou ſeeſt God, even as an Enemy
coming againſt thee; yet the conſideration that it is the
Lord, ſhould make thee ſubmit at leaſt: For it is time
for thee then to ſubmit, if ſo be that God as an Enemy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104282:47"/>
appears againſt thee: It's time for thee to make haſte to
make thy peace with God, yea, and thou haſt the more
cauſe to bleſs God, that he hath not deſtroyed thee. What,
doſt thou apprehend God as an Enemy? O then, it's
infinite Mercy thou art not deſtroyed. Certainly, if
He be an Enemy to thee now, He was an Enemy before;
only we are ready to judge according to preſent Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration.
But this is certain, If God be an Enemy
now, He was an Enemy all the time thou hadſt thy
Health, and waſt in thy uttermoſt Proſperity; it's time
for thee then to fall down, and make peace. And what
infinite cauſe haſt thou to wonder, that thou art not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deſtroyed, and therefore reaſon to ſubmit unto
Him.</p>
            <p>But yet it is a weakneſs in the Saints, and a temptation,
often to judge of Gods dealings thus, and to think that
every time God appears againſt them, as if he were in
hatred: As the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in their Murmuring
Diſcontented Mood, <hi>He brought us out of</hi> Egypt <hi>into
this Wilderneſs, becauſe He hated us;</hi> ſay they. O, this
was wicked, and diſpleaſed God exceedingly. As we
are not to judge of Gods Love by outward Proſperity,
ſo not of His Hatred by outward Afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But though I dare not think that God comes
in a way of Hatred and Enmity, yet there's a great deal
of Diſpleaſure for my ſin; and it's that that makes it
grievous to me.</p>
            <p>And mark, Even this that was threatned to <hi>Ely,</hi> it was
threatned for his ſin, and yet he falls down and ſubmits,
and ſaith, <hi>It is the Lord, let Him do what ſeemeth Him
good.</hi> Yea, and we find the Servants of God, when
they apprehended God appearing againſt their ſin, that
Conſideration did quiet them ſo much the more: In
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104282:47"/>
               <hi>Mich. 7. 9. I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have ſinned againſt Him:</hi> (Becauſe.) And that
fore-named place concerning <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 15. 26.
where you have ſuch a Wonderful Gracious and Humble
Submiſſion unto the Diſpoſe of God; where he ſaith,
<hi>If He hath no pleaſure in me, let Him do what ſeemeth
Him good.</hi> Why <hi>David</hi> was under almoſt as ſore an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
as a man could be under, and it was for his ſin
too: Yea, it was for a <hi>great</hi> ſin, it was for his ſin of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,
and his ſin of Murder, that he was ſain to flie
for his Life, even before his own Son. It was as ſore and
hard an Affliction, and there was as much of the ſting of
the guilt of ſin in it, as any Affliction of any of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, that ever we read of: And yet how hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
he ſubmits, <hi>If he ſaith I have no delight in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
here I am, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, there is a vain Conceit abroad in the
World, as if God chaſtiſed not his People for ſin at all: Yet
certainly, the People of God, that walk cloſe with God,
they find there is a Chaſtiſement, and a Fatherly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
though not the Revenge of a Judge. And
certainly, there can be no Argument taken from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
ſatisfaction of Chriſt, to prove that there is no
Chaſtiſement for ſin; for Chriſt did ſatisfie as fully for
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> that were under the Law: They had the
ſatisfaction of Chriſt perfect as well as you. Would it
have been (do you think) a good Argument then, That
if God Chaſtiſed for ſin, he did not do juſtly, becauſe
Chriſt ſatisfied Gods Juſtice: Why did not Chriſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Gods Juſtice then? It was not a good Argument then,
certainly it is not ſo now: And for the New Teſtament,
<hi>You are Chaſtiſed of the Lord, that you might not be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
with the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32. But I'll give
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104282:48"/>
you one other Scripture, and that is is the Epiſtle of
<hi>James 5. 14, 15. Is any ſick among you, let him call for
the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>The Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord
ſhall raiſe him up; and if he have committed ſins, they
ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> Here the Apoſtle writes to the
Saints, and ſpeaks of Godly People, and ſpeaks of them
indefinitely: If <hi>any</hi> of them, if the moſt Godly in all
the Church were ſick, why, ſaith he, let him ſend for
the Elders and let them Pray; and if he hath committed
ſins, then they ſhall be forgiven him. So that <hi>any</hi> of the
Saints may be in ſuch a condition, as they may be Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and Afflicted for their ſin; <hi>If they have ſinned,
then they ſhall be forgiven.</hi> To make this Suppoſition,
and yet that this ſhall be a Truth, That it's impoſſible
for any Godly People to be Afflicted for their ſin, were
a Contradiction: For to ſay thus, If any Godly Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be ſick, let them take this Courſe, let them ſend for
the Elders, and let them pray; and if they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ſin, it ſhall be forgiven them. And yet the other
to ſtand true, That no Godly People can be Afflicted
for their ſin: Certainly, theſe two cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
            <p>You will ſay, If they have committed ſin, it ſhall be
forgiven: Was it not forgiven before?</p>
            <p>True, they are forgiven in reſpect of Gods eternal
Wrath, or in reſpect of the Guilt that binds them over
to the ſatisfying of Revenging Juſtice: They are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that, but they are not ſo forgiven, but that they
need a <hi>Fatherly</hi> forgiveneſs ſtill. Chriſt hath taken away
already at firſt the Revenge of a Judge, but He hath
not taken away all Fatherly Diſpleaſure by his ſatisfying;
For that's not at all to ſatisfie Juſtice: But God doth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104282:48"/>
reſerve this to himſelf, to deal with them as a Father.
Indeed, through Chriſts ſatisfying, God will never deal
with his People as a Judge to Revenge; but this doth
not put them out of his way of dealing with them as a
Father, and they have need of Fatherly forgiveneſs ſtill.
And this is that that Chriſt teaches every one to pray;
<hi>Forgive us our ſins, forgive us our Treſpaſſes.</hi> Some
other Pleas and Objections may be made, but I ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haſten to the Uſe of the Point.</p>
            <p>Is the ſight of God that, that ſhould cauſe us humbly
to ſubmit? O let what hath been ſaid in theſe ſeveral
Conſiderations, ſerve to rebuke our Impatiency, our
Fretting, and ſinking Diſcouragements. Who art thou?
And what art thou, that thou ſhouldeſt keep a ſtir un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
any hand of God? Do not ſay, It is ſo great, and
if it were any other Affliction, I would bear it; it is not
for thee to chooſe thy Rod: And thou canſt not ſpeak
more of thy Affliction, than <hi>David</hi> might have done of
his: And therefore whatever thy thoughts may be, be
humbled before God, that thou haſt had any kind of
Murmuring, or Impatience under the Hand of God,
any ſtirrings that way: Who art thou, that thou muſt
not be dealt withal, ſo as God hath dealt with others of
his Saints before, or as he doth deal with any others now?
There's a notable Scripture; O that it might have but ſuch
an effect as it had on <hi>Job!</hi> Compare theſe two in the
Book of <hi>Job, Job 38. 2. Who is this that darkneth Counſel
by words without Knowledge.</hi> The Lord ſaith thus to <hi>Job:</hi>
Who is this whoſe heart doth fret and is ſo impatient,
who is it? Mark now afterwards, if you read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from this place till you come to <hi>Chap.</hi> 42. you ſhall
find that God is Manifeſting himſelf there, and Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf in his Glory and Righteouſneſs to <hi>Job:</hi> Now
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104282:49"/>
in the <hi>3d. verſe, Job</hi> takes up the very words to himſelf,
that God had before ſpoken: Saith <hi>Job, Who is he that
hideth Counſel without Knowledge? Therefore have I uttered
that I underſtood not, things too wonderful for me, which
I knew not.</hi> God he ſaith, Who is this that uttereth
words without knowledge? And then he ſhews himſelf;
Look upon me, is it not I that have done it? Then <hi>Job</hi>
ſaw that it was God that did it. <hi>I have meddled with
things that I underſtood not, I have troubled my ſelf like
a Fool in things that I did not underſtand:</hi> O fooliſh
wretched heart that I have! And then afterwards he ſaith,
<hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear, but now
mine Eye ſeeth thee; wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I'll never
be Impatient more, I'll never have any riſings of heart
more againſt any of thy dealings towards me: For,
Lord, now I <hi>ſee</hi> that I <hi>heard</hi> of thee; before I could
have ſaid, All things come by the Providence of God:
I could have ſaid ſo, I, but now mine Eyes ſee thee, I
have the ſight of that Glorious, Infinite Majeſty of thine,
that art ſo infinitely Great, Bleſſed, and Holy; and
therefore now I abhor my ſelf in Duſt and Aſhes: Let
become of me what will, I have learned for ever to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
that Holy Name of thine, <hi>It is the Lord, let Him do
what ſeemeth Him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore by way of Exhortation:<note place="margin">Exhort.</note> O my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I beſeech you apply theſe things unto your ſelves:
In ſome of your Thoughts (it ſeems) I have been as
Dead,<note place="margin">His houſe being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited, it was thought he was Dead.</note> hear then ſomewhat that I am this day to ſay to
you; as you know <hi>Dives</hi> ſaid, <hi>If one come from the
Dead, they will hear him.</hi> Here what I have to ſay to
you from this Point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> O let this ſinck into your hearts, as if one
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104282:49"/>
ſhould come from the Dead to ſpeak it to you, namely
this, That God is ſo infinitely worthy of Honour from
you, that you ſhould be at a point, whether you Honour
him either in the enjoyment of Mercy, or ſuffering of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
it's no great matter: The Honour of God ſhould
be ſo dear to you, and you ſhould ſo much love him,
your hearts ſhould be ſo much with God, as you ſhould
leave it wholly to himſelf, which way he would be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by you. Surely, though we think we have a
Love to God, and we would Honour him, yet our Love
to God, and deſire to Honour him, is very little; If ſo
be that we do not wholly reſign up our ſelves to him,
to do in us and by us as he will: then indeed, is the
heart right. And this is Honouring God as a God, when
there is a full yielding up of the heart, and when it is in
a manner indifferent what way God will take. Then your
hearts are come to a right frame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſecond thing that I would ſay to you,
is this, That there is ſo great evil in ſin (and O that God
would make it take as great an Impreſſion upon you, as
if one from the Dead ſpake it) as the leaſt ſtopping one
in the way of ſin, the leaſt abating the power of ſin hath
ſo much good in it, as it's enough to countervail the
greateſt evil in the greateſt Afflictions in the World. O
this Principle would be of mighty uſe in the hearts of
People, when any Affliction doth befal them or their
Family; but doth God by this (at leaſt) ſtop me in
any way of ſin? Doth not God by this, ſome way, or
other, help me againſt ſome ſin? O then, the <hi>Affliction</hi>
is well paid for. I have now a greater good abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than the evil of the <hi>Affliction</hi> comes to; There was a
little bitter, but here's a great deal more ſweet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is more good in any Exerciſe of any
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104282:50"/>
Grace, than there is evil in the bearing of any <hi>Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
If God doth bring an <hi>Affliction</hi> but for the Exerciſe
of any Grace, or for the ſtirring up thy heart but to
look towards him, there may be more good in that,
then there is evil in any <hi>Affliction.</hi> Perhaps thou art go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and down muddling in the World, and thy
Thoughts were but little upon him before; why if by
<hi>Afflictions</hi> thou comeſt but to look after God, his is a
greater good than the evil of the <hi>Affliction</hi> comes to.
But if God Bleſſes thee ſo as thou comeſt to Exerciſe
Grace in it, Humility, Patience, Self-denial, Faith; O
here thine <hi>Affliction</hi> is abundantly made up: Oh! la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
therefore upon the Conſideration of this, that <hi>It
is the Lord,</hi> to ſubmit humbly to him; this is acceptable
to God. Suppoſe you have two Children that were ſick,
it may be one he riggles and keeps a ſtir, and will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that you give him; but now you have another Child
lies, and he is ſick too, and he ſaith, Father, Mother,
I'll do what you will have me, I'll take what you will
give me, do but tell me what you would have done, I'll
preſently do it; though it be never ſo grievous and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I'll take it. Now would it not make your hearts
relent towards ſuch a Child, that ſhould be ſo yieldable,
will lie this way, or that way, take this thing, or that
thing, and all becauſe it comes from a Father: If the
Child ſhould ſay to you, It's true, I am Sick and Ill, but
I know you love me, and know what's better for me
than I do, and therefore I'll take it: Would not this be
very acceptable? O this it is which the Lord accepts,
when his Children do behave themſelves ſo under his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
Hand.</p>
            <p>And my Brethren, This further helps againſt a great
many Temptations: When <hi>Job</hi> did but ſay this, <hi>The
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104282:50"/>
Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, let Him do what
ſeemeth Him good.</hi> The Devil ſaw his hopes gone, then
his hopes of doing that hurt and miſchief that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
was gone. O the heart is in a ſafe condition, that
is thus ſubmiſſive unto God: Others that have Fretting
Impatient hearts, are ſubject to abundance of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but the danger of Temptation is over, when thy
heart comes to this.</p>
            <p>And this will make the Affliction very eaſie unto thee,
when thou bringeſt thy heart to this: It may be others
may think that's very ſore and hard with thee, I, but
thou findeſt it very eaſie, abundance of ſweetneſs comes
in with this: Yea, I appeal to the Experience of the
Saints, that knows but what this means; Whether ever
had you more Comfort in all your Lives, than at that
time when you have been moſt Afflicted, and yet brought
your hearts to this Temper and Diſpoſition. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
learn to work theſe things upon your hearts. It's
an eaſie matter for Men and Women to ſpeak theſe things,
but to have the effectual working of theſe things upon
the heart, that's not ſo eaſie: To ſanctifie Gods Name
in the Fire. Carnal hearts, they have many poor things
to help themſelves in their Afflictions: They ſay this,
It is my ill Fortune this befel me; and another ſaith
this, This befals all Men, one or other, it's common:
Others ſay thus, We muſt, we cannot help it, and we
muſt ſubmit to it. Another thinks thus, Why, I hope,
it will be over. Theſe are poor Reaſonings to work
upon the heart, in the day of Affliction: But now a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heart ſhould get up higher above all theſe; <hi>It is
the Lord,</hi> and there look into the Counſels of God, and
ſeek to know the Mind of God, and to ſanctifie the
Name of God. O, Grace (my Brethren) hath many
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104282:51"/>
Excellencies in it; but among other things, this is not
the leaſt, That it hath ſuch a mighty Power to help Men
in the day of their Affliction; a mighty Power to ſweeten
the heart, and to take away the ſting and evil of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
and to carry the Soul on comfortably in the
time of all Dangers and Trials. O labour to have
this wrought upon your hearts! For by this you will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
much Beauty in Grace, much Excellency in Grace;
it will be a means to Convince all that are about you.
All thoſe that profeſs Godlineſs, ſhould labour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themſelves ſo as to do that that others cannot do
in the time of Affliction: They ſhould then ſhew what
Grace can do. As <hi>David</hi> in another Caſe, ſaid to the
King of <hi>Achiſh, Thou ſhalt ſee what thy Servant can do.</hi>
So now in the time of Affliction, a gracious heart ſhould
put it to this; Come let's ſee what Grace can do. And
certainly, this will be the way for removing of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſooner, when the heart is brought thus to yield unto
the Lord: Wherefore that you may bring your hearts
to this in the day of your Affliction, labour in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Courſe of your Life, to Converſe much with God.
Thoſe that walk with God (according to the Text that
you know I am upon) and Converſe much with God in
the day of their Health, why their hearts will in a
kind of Natural-way, work up to God in the time of
Affliction; then the Thoughts of God will be as ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to thee, as Fire is to Fire: Fire aſcends up to Fire,
becauſe of the ſuitableneſs of the Fire that is here, to
that that is above. Why ſo the heart will work up to
God in a kind of Natural-way, becauſe God is ſo ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the heart, the heart having ſo much Converſe with
God in the day of Proſperity.</p>
            <p>And labour throughly to Convince your hearts of this
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104282:51"/>
thing, That there is no Good in any Creature, but only
in the Reference that it hath to God: There is no Good
in Health, in Liberty, in your Names, in your Lives,
in your Eſtates, any further than they have ſome Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to God, the infinite firſt Good, the chief and high
Good. It's an eaſie matter in a way of Reaſon, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
any one that this is a Truth. But now to have this
Principle indeed wrought upon your heart, not only to
ſay ſo in a way of Arguing, but I account in my Soul
of no good in any thing further, than it hath reference
to God. As now, I have for the preſent Health of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
Where doth the good of the Health of my Body
lie? It is, That while I have Health, I have Ability to
ſerve God, and be uſeful in the place where God hath
ſet me. I have an Eſtate, Wherein lies the good of it?
It lies in this, That by this I may be Inſtrumental for God,
more than others. If I Live, Wherein lies the good of
Life? Why that I may be uſeful to the Church, in the
way wherein God hath ſet me. Now when the heart is
principled in this, then if God takes away my Health
then it ſeems God hath no further uſe of my Health for
the preſent, but would rather Honour Himſelf in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way upon me; why now there is no good in my
Health. And if God take away my Eſtate, then he would
rather Honour Himſelf in the exerciſe of my Humility,
and of my Patience. If God takes away my Life, then
God will rather have His Honour from my Soul, to joyn
with Angels and Saints, in Honouring of Him that way,
rather than in Imploying of me any further in this World.
Such a Principle as this is, would mightily help the heart
in the day of Affliction.</p>
            <p>Certainly our Happineſs doth not depend upon what
we have here in this World: The reaſon why the heart
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104282:52"/>
is ſo troubled in the time of Affliction, it is becauſe of
this, That Men and Women look upon their Happineſs
to conſiſt in the enjoyment of theſe things: O no, thou
Diſhonoureſt the Name of Chriſt, and thy holy Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
to think that thy Happineſs ſhould depend upon
ſuch poor things as theſe are. Surely, Jeſus Chriſt hath
not come to ſhed His Blood, and to purchaſe Happineſs
for the Saints; and when all comes too, it ſhould be ſo
poor as to depend upon all the uncertainty that we have
in this World: No, no, thy Happineſs lies hihger, Thy Life
is hid with Chriſt in God. If a man hath a Jewel
worth many Thouſands, and his Houſe ſhould be on Fire,
why though he loſes the Lumber and Stuff in the Houſe,
yet if he be ſure the Jewel is ſafe, he is quiet. Now the
Saints they may be ſure that they are ſafe for Eternity,
and therefore it is not much what other things be. Oh
conſider of theſe things, and work them upon your hearts.
That's the Second Point.</p>
            <p>But a word or two of the other,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> that is: That that
which ſeems ill to us, may ſeem good to God. <hi>It is
the Lord, let Him do what ſeemeth Him good.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
for the preſent it did not ſeem very good to <hi>Ely:</hi>
If that <hi>Ely</hi>'s judgement had been askt of thoſe things,
<hi>Ely</hi> would have ſaid, that they had been very ſad. I,
but as I remember, <hi>Luther</hi> once ſaid, when he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
and Rail'd upon at <hi>Noremberg,</hi> ſaith he, There's
one thing Concluded at <hi>Noremberg,</hi> and another thing
Concluded in <hi>Heaven:</hi> In <hi>Heaven</hi> there's not the ſame
Judgment of my Cauſe, as at <hi>Noremberg.</hi> And ſo it may
be ſaid concerning Affliction, There's one thing many
times Concluded in my Wretched, Weak, Fooliſh, and
Unbelieveing Heart; and another thing in Heaven:
One thing concluded in the world, and in mens rumours;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104282:52"/>
and another thing in Heaven. It's ſome comfort to a man
though he hears rumours abroad in the world, if then he
can have his own heart to contradict them. If he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to think but this, Well that that's ſpoken in
the World is one thing, and that that I find in my heart
is another; <hi>that's</hi> comfortable: But this is greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<hi>Thou art my portion, ſaith my Soul;</hi> ſaith the
Church in the Book of the <hi>Lamentations;</hi> as if ſhe ſhould
ſay, Well, the temptation ſaith that God hath left me, the
Devil ſaith thus; I but thou art my portion, <hi>ſaith my
Soul:</hi> That was comfortable. If ſo be that God ſpeaks
peace, it's more than if our own Souls ſpeaks peace:
<hi>Thou ſhalt chooſe our inheritance:</hi> Thy choice is better
then our own. If we had alwayes what's good in our
own Eyes, wo were to us, we were undone. You
would not think it, but certainly it is as heavy a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as can befal one in this world; that God ſhould
ſay, <hi>You ſhall do and you ſhall have what is good in your
own eyes.</hi> Suppoſe that God ſhould ſay but this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concerning every one of you, Well, you ſhall henc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
have whatſoever is good in your own Eyes.
why you would think that you might go away and be
glad of this; Glad, you had cauſe of going away with
ringing of Hands, and howling and crying, if God ſhould
ſay thus, concerning any of you. O no, it's better that
our Lives, Liberties, Eſtates, Comforts, Happineſs,
and all be in Gods Hands than our own, to be diſpoſed
of ſo as ſeemeth good in Gods Eyes, rather than to be
diſpoſed of ſo as ſeemeth good in our own Eyes. I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believe that many of you may be able to look back
to the providences of God towards you, and to ſay,
That ſuppoſe God had Twenty years ago ſaid to me, I'll
give you leave to diſpoſe of your ſelves as you would:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104282:53"/>
O many may be able to ſay, They certainly could never
have diſpoſed ſo well of themſelves as God hath: And
they would be loath to go back again to the Twenty
years paſt, though they ſhould begin and have liberty to
diſpoſe of themſelves as they pleaſe: In <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. ſaith
the Apoſtle there, <hi>No Affliction for the preſent ſeemeth
Joyous to us but Grievous, but afterwards,</hi> ſaith the Text,
<hi>it works thus and thus.</hi> I, but things do ſeem to God as
they are preſent alwayes, but they do not ſeem ſo to us
till afterwards. After the Affliction is over then they
ſeem good to us, but they ſeem good to God at
the very preſent. We judge things by the outward
appearance, but God judges things according to what
they are. Things ſeem to us according as they either
make for or againſt our outward good, we are led ſo
much by ſenſe: But they ſeem to God according as they
are for or againſt his Glory and the laſt good of all. They
ſeem good or ill to us according as they are for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſome particular good; if they ſtrike at ſuch a
particular we judge by particulars: But now, God he
judges things by the proportion they have to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
to all things at once. It's that that makes us to
give very wrong Judgment of things when we look
but to particulars, and do not compare one with another,
and raiſe a Judgment upon things all things conſidered.
So God doth, God doth not ſo much look at things
how they are in reference to this or the other good;
but how things are in reference to all together in the
general. We know ſome things may croſs ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
but they may be uſeful to another. Now that
thats good in the general doth ſeem good to God,
though it may go croſs to ſome particular.</p>
            <p>And then further, We look at things but juſt as they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104282:53"/>
appear preſent to us, but now God looks upon things as
they ſhall be a great while hence: God is working that
that we ſhall not underſtand perhaps in our lives; or
working in his Adminiſtrations towards us, ſome thing
that he intends ſhall come to paſs a great while hence,
ſo that if they come to paſs in our Lives, yet we ſhall not
have the fruit of them for many years. God He looks
a great way off.</p>
            <p>Wherefore learn by this, Not to be too Sudden, nor ſo
Peremptory, in the judging of Gods Adminiſtrations:
Why? Why becauſe whatever they may ſeem to you,
they may ſeem otherwiſe to God; ſtay till you know
Gods Judgment about them. As you, if you have any
Wiſdom, when you hear of ſtrange Rumours, if you know
that there be any that knows the thing better than you,
you will not give a judgment upon it; till you have the
judgment of ſuch and ſuch, that you know may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it better than your ſelf. So in the Wayes of God
towards us, Let not us preſently give a Judgment upon
thoſe things, but let us ſtay firſt till we have the Mind
of God. O let's learn to reſign up our Judgments to
Gods, and let Him Judge.</p>
            <p>Neither let us trouble our ſelves about other mens
Judgments. As things ſeem otherwiſe to God than to us,
ſo they ſeem otherwiſe to God than to other men. As
we ſhould not truſt too much to the judgments of our
own hearts, ſo we ſhould not be ſo much troubled
at other mens Judgments. For whatever they think,
ſtill it is otherwiſe in Gods account. Men, they will
ſay, 'tis for this Cauſe, and the other Cauſe, and the
like; but it's otherwiſe concluded in Heaven. And
that's the Third Point.</p>
            <p>The laſt ſhould have been this, That 'tis not enough
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104282:54"/>
for Chriſtians after a great deal of ado, to ſubmit to
God; that is, after the Affliction hath been upon them a
great while, and when they ſee they cannot help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
then to begin to have thoughts of yielding to
God. It's well that they do it at laſt: O, but it's more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
a great deal, if we do it at firſt. At what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
God ſtrikes, preſently for the heart to come in and
yield. As it is a moſt excellent thing to yield to Gods Word
when God firſt ſpeaks, upon the leaſt intimation of Gods
Will; O this is acceptable unto God. For thoſe that
are young ones, the firſt time they come to hear the
Word; or if not the firſt time they come to hear it, yet
the firſt time God ſpeaks to their hearts; the very firſt
word that ſpeaks, preſently for them to yield, it's a moſt
excellent thing. So in the time of Affliction, for the
heart to bow and ſubmit preſently to God: O this is an
Argument of much cleanneſs that there is in the heart,
that the heart is very clean, that there is not much Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
there; for then there would be a ſtanding out
againſt God, and it would manifeſt it ſelf in time of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
As we know where there is Corruption in the
Body it will manifeſt it ſelf, if it come to endure Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
ſo it is with the Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it argues much Grace, as little Corruption. So
there is ſtrength of Grace that can make the Heart bow
preſently to God. When Grace reigns in the Heart;
when Grace can ſay Come, and the Soul comes; Go, and
it goes; when Grace can ſay, This is the Adminiſtration
of God towards you; and now you muſt work thus,
and preſently the Soul doth it. It ſhould not be enough
to us, that we hope that we have that Grace, which
poſſibly may bring us to Heaven at laſt: but we ſhould
labour to have that Grace that may reign in the Heart
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104282:54"/>
now, and bring all into a due Order. As in a Family,
when the Governors are Wiſe, you ſhall have them, if
there be but the leaſt Diſturbance, ſpeak but a word,
and all is quiet: And you ſhall have other Families, that
where the Reins of Government are looſe, if there be
but a little Diſturbance, it grows more and more, and
to ſuch a height, that it's tedious for one that hath a
quiet Spirit, to be in the Family: and ſo it is in the
Heart, though the beſt hath ſome Diſturbance. But now
where Grace Rules and Governs, it ſtills all preſently,
without any great ado: But now in other men, though
they have ſome Grace, yet if the Heart begins to be in a
Diſturbance, it's a long time before it can be quieted.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, I have gone through theſe Points brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and you will ſay, 'Tis a harder thing to do this, than
to ſpeak it. It's true, it is, yet ſome of the Saints have
done it: They have through the Mercy of God, been
brought to theſe things that have been ſpoken, and it's
poſſible to be done: Some have attained it, and there is
ſtrength enough in Chriſt, for the weakeſt to attain
it: And He delights as much to Communicate His ſtrength
in helping of His poor Servants in the times of Affliction,
as at any time.</p>
            <p>Conſider what hath been ſaid in theſe ſeveral Truths,
and lay them up againſt the Day of your Affliction,
that you may ſay, <hi>It is the Lord, let Him do what
ſeemeth Him good.</hi>

            <p>THis bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> had in the Courſe of his
Life, many things befel him that ſeem to be very
Croſs, much Oppoſition, great were his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
even unto Bonds: And much hard Uſage
he had, not only from open Enemies, but from falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
whoſe Spirits were full of Envy againſt him:
And who can ſtand before Envy? They were vexed to
ſee how his Miniſtery prevailed in the Hearts of People;
to ſee what great Eſteem he had, how precious his Name
was among the Saints: They knew not what courſe
to take to Darken him, and therefore among others,
ſome of them would ſet upon Preaching Chriſt as well
as he, and ſee what they could do that way; they would
be as forward as he. Well, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> all this makes
for my Good, and I rejoyce in it, ſo be it I may be any
occaſion that Chriſt may be Preached, whether of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
or Envy: I am glad Chriſt is made known by this,
and this ſhall turn (ſaith he) to my Salvation, to the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104282:55"/>
Glory that I expect from Chriſt, and with Chriſt: That
ſhall be furthered by it, ſo long (ſaith he) as Chriſt is
Honoured, I ſhall never be aſhamed: No matter what
becomes of my Body, of my Life, ſo that Chriſt may
be Magnified in my Body, whether it be by Life, or by
Death: <hi>For to me to Live is Chriſt, and to Die is Gain.</hi>
And this is the Coherence of the Words.</p>
            <p>Here then we have a Man of brave Reſolution, of a
truly Noble raiſed Spirit; while other men are Grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
here in the World, in ſeeking Contentment unto the

Death. <hi>To me to Live is Chriſt, to Die is Gain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To me to Live is Chriſt.</hi> You have it in your <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
only ſo <hi>(To Live, and to Die:)</hi> But thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

               </gap>. So
that if you would have it Tranſlated according to the
Propriety and Elegancy of the <hi>Greek,</hi> it is thus: <hi>To me the
thing that is to Live is Chriſt, and the thing that is Death
is Gain.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, That thing that you call
<hi>Life,</hi> is nothing but Chriſt: If Chriſt may be Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in me, if I may be of any Service for Him any way,
then I am content to Live; but if ſo be that He may be
no more Served by me here, let me Die, and I ſhall loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by that neither: For that ſame thing you call Death,
the thing that People keep ſuch a ſtir about, and are ſo
ſcar'd withal, <hi>That to Die;</hi> it's nothing to me, but that
which will be Gain. So that the words, they ſpeak out
the frame of Gracious Heart, bleſſing it ſelf in Jeſus
Chriſt, both in Life and Death: <hi>To me to Live:</hi>
I'll not make any curious Definition, nor raiſe
more Points than I ſhall go through at this time,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104282:56"/>
and the Points will be nothing but the opening of the
Text in both Parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> That a true Godly man accounts Chriſt to be
his Life. And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To a Godly man, Death is Gain.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, <hi>To me to Live is Chriſt:</hi> That ſame thing
that you call life, It's Chriſt, all is wrapt up in him: I
account nothing Life but Jeſus Chriſt. As for my natural
Life, that's no way conſiderable; but ſo far as Chriſt is
in it, Chriſt is the life of the Saints. It's more indeed
then if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is my life <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the thing
that is to live is Chriſt; It's a greater Elegancy than to ſay
Chriſt is my life.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is the life of the Saints: Firſt in this, That they
are by him freed from a Legal death. Every man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is under the Curſe of the Law, he is a dead man,
as we ſay of a man that is condemn'd, he is a dead man;
dead by the Law. But now the Saints in Chriſt, are dead
to the Law. <hi>Gall.</hi> 2. 19. But they live to God, they
are freed from that Legal death, and ſo Chriſt brings life to
them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt is the principle of Spiritual Life in
them. It's Chriſt that brings me to the Fountain of Life,
that unites my Soul again to God; and puts me in a
principle of Life, to inable me to live to God, and to
injoy communion with him; I in my ſelf am as a dead
Carkaſs without Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>To me to live is Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is the preſerver of this life of mine.
Notwithſtanding all the corrupt and ſilthy and dead
ſtuff that is in me, yet Jeſus Chriſt preſerves this life in
me.</p>
            <p>And then in the Fourth place, which I take to be the
chiefe meaning of what the Apoſtle intends; <hi>To me to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104282:56"/>
live is Chriſt,</hi> that is, the great comfort of my Life, that's
Chriſt. A man doth not live except he hath Comfort
in his Life: For ſo the Scripture calls Life, when a man
hath Comfort, Joy, and Contentment in his Life, <hi>Pſal.
38. 19. But mine Enemies are lively;</hi> ſo you have it in
your Books: Mine Enemies are <hi>living,</hi> ſo you may
Tranſlate it; the meaning is this, Mine Enemies are Jolly,
and Jocond in their wayes: And ſo it follows, <hi>And they
are ſtrong:</hi> They are Jolly and Jocond in their wayes; and
they that hate me wrongfully, are multiplied. There's
a like phraſe in <hi>Eccleſ. 6. 8. For what hath the Wiſe more
than the Fool, what hath the Poor that knoweth to walk
before the Living:</hi> That is, before the Rich men that
have all Comforts in their Lives, to Live bravely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their hearts deſire. What's the Wiſe more
than the Fool? All things comes alike to them, and
there's no great difference in their Lives. And what
<hi>hath,</hi> (the word <hi>hath</hi> is not in the Original) but what a
Poor that knoweth to walk before the Living. If a
Poor man hath but Health of Body, and hath but Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to work, and Wiſdom to carry himſelf, and order
his Affairs; why he can walk before Rich men, and can
live a Comfortable life before them. <hi>Before the Living,</hi>
that is, before the Rich that have all things to Live
bravely in the World. So that's the meaning of <hi>Life</hi> in
Scripture, not only in oppoſition to <hi>Death,</hi> but to Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and Trouble. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>To me to live
is Chriſt:</hi> Will you take <hi>Life</hi> in this ſenſe, that is, for
a Comfortable, a Contented, a Joyful life? Why I have
it ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> Where had <hi>Paul</hi> ſuch a Joyful and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
life? For alas, look upon him in the Courſe of his
Life, and he ſuffered almoſt as much as ever man did;
ſometimes he wanted Bread, and he wanted Clothes to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104282:57"/>
cover the Nakedneſs of his Body, and whipt like a
Rogue, and yet he accounted himſelf to live a brave
life notwithſtanding all this: But where lay all this?
In Chriſt. I find it all made up in Chriſt, whatſoever I
want in the Creature, whatever is caſt upon me, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Scorn and Impriſonment; whatever it be that here
I ſuffer, yet I find it all made up in Chriſt, and in Him I
have as comfortable a life, as a mans Heart can deſire.
That's his meaning by this ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, in Chriſt,
becauſe I am Imployed in the Service of Jeſus Chriſt:
And I bleſs God that Chriſt hath Honour by me, that I
do the Work of Chriſt, and ſo, <hi>To me to live is Chriſt.</hi>
That's the Fourth thing.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>To me to live is Chriſt,</hi> that is, Chriſt is the
end of my Life: So you have the Five particulars. 1. I
am by Chriſt freed from a Legal Death, being Dead by
the Law. 2. Chriſt is the Principle of my Spiritual Life.
3. The Preſerver of it. 4. The Comfort and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my Life. 5. The end of my Life: <hi>Thus to me to
live is Chriſt.</hi> But becauſe theſe two laſt are the two
chief that I verily believe are intended here by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
I will a little open them more than the former. Now
to ſhew how Chriſt is the Comfort and Contentment of a
Chriſtians Life, that I'll ſhew unto you in ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:
Though he hath not Comfort as others have,
though he hath not ſuch a Table, and ſuch Comings in
as others have, yet he hath a life more comfortable than
others.</p>
            <p>As Firſt, The very Contemplation of Jeſus Chriſt, it
is incomparably Sweet and Comfortable to a Gracious
heart. For what doth a Godly man ſee in Chriſt? In
Chriſt I ſee the Brightneſs of the Glory of the Father, I
ſee the Character of the Ingraven Image of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104282:57"/>
in Him: When I look upon the World it's comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
it's comfortable to the Eye to behold the Light:
But there I ſee but the Foot-ſteps of God, but in Chriſt
I ſee the Face of God; the Face of the Living and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Firſt-Being of all things: That I behold in Him, and
this is <hi>Life</hi> to me. <hi>It's Eternal Life to know thee, O Lord,
and thy Son, whom thou haſt ſent into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. O the ſweet Influences of the Grace of God that I
feel, out of His Fulneſs do I receive, and Grace for
Grace; I have the flowings of the Water of Life into
my Soul daily, and therefore Chriſt is to live to me.</p>
            <p>3. I have the Love of God ſhed abroad into my Soul.
O the Beams of the Love of the Eternal God, that are
ſhed abroad in my Soul by Chriſt, and thoſe Beams of
Gods Love, they are Life to me.</p>
            <p>4. In Him I have an Intereſt in all the Treaſures of the
Riches of the Grace of the Infinite God, they are all
mine, they are all made over to me in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>5. And then fifthly, In Him I have bleſſed Reſt and
Satisfaction to my Soul for my Eternal Eſtate; I am ſold
for Eternity in Him.</p>
            <p>6. And then in Him I have the Joy of the Holy Ghoſt
ſhed abroad into my Heart, and it is the comfort of my
Soul to ſee Him Honoured any way, more than to enjoy
any good to my ſelf.</p>
            <p>7. In Him, O the Communion that I have with Him,
is more than Life; thoſe lettings out of my Heart to
Him, and thoſe lettings out of His Heart again to my
Soul: What is it? It's more than a Thouſand Lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me.</p>
            <p>8. In Him I have the Conveyance of all the Good that
God the Father Conveys to the Hearts of His Saints, in
order to Eternal Life; and therefore, O the Comfort
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104282:58"/>
and Contentment my Soul hath thereupon.</p>
            <p>And then, He is the end of my Life: To what purpoſe
do I live, if it were not in order to Him? For He is the
firſt that God did aim at in all his Works, <hi>Ab extra,</hi> and
therefore Chriſt is called the <hi>Firſt-begotten</hi> of all: He
was the firſt in Gods Intention, yea, the Scripture ſaith
in <hi>Epheſ. 3. 19. All things are by Him, and for Him.</hi> Now
if Chriſt be the End of all the Works of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
God in all that ever He aim'd at in His Councils
from Eternity, He did aim at the ſetting up of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Chriſt, and at His own Honour in Him and by
Him: Therefore ſurely, He is my Life, He is that I aim
at, He is the End of my Life.</p>
            <p>And all the Glory that God the Father hath from all
His Creatures, it is through Him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 21. Then
while I live to Him, I ſerve the greateſt Deſigns that
God the Father hath: I am uſeful unto God in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Deſigns that ever He had from Eternity, or ever ſhall
have; and therefore for me to live is Chriſt. Thus you
have the opening of what the Apoſtle ſaith. Now then
by way of Application for this,</p>
            <p>In the firſt place,<note place="margin">Appl.</note> Learn to Examine your Hearts from
this, what your Life is: Examine in this thing, what is
your Life? Whether you can ſay as the Apoſtle here did,
<hi>To me to live is Chriſt?</hi> What do you account your Lives
to be? It would be a very near Point, if God would
but help you to underſtand it, and ſeriouſly to weigh it.
I ſay, What do you account your Lives to conſiſt in?
Why ſome Men think, O for me to live, it's to get an
Eſtate, that's my Life. Another thinks, to me to live,
why it is, to have Company, to be Merry, to Eat and
Drink, that is Life to me. Another, to live, why it's
to be great in the World, to be accounted ſome Body,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104282:58"/>
to get Honour, to get Places: The Lives of Men conſiſt
in ſuch things as theſe are, Moſt Men account it to be
their Lives, to enjoy the Contentments of the World;
ſo be it they can have ſo much coming in as they may
pleaſe the Fleſh, and ſatisfie the Luſts of the Fleſh; there's
a brave Life. Who do you account to be the Men that
live the brave Lives in the World? O that you would
Anſwer as in the Preſence of God now: Whether do
you account the Men that have all the Contentives to
the Fleſh, that poſſibly may be, as Honour, Repute,
and Eſteem, and live at Eaſe, and can Ride up and
down, and have Attendance about them, and brave in
their Clothes, to live the brave Lives? Or whether thoſe
Men that are ſerviceable to the Great Ends of God, in
ſetting forth the Honour of Jeſus Chriſt? Which are the
Men that God accounts moſt Happy? Would you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
a Man that were very Mean and Low in the World,
and Deſpiſed by the World, yet if he be Serviceable to
Chriſt in the World, and enjoy Chriſt himſelf in the
World, to be a more Happy man in this Life? Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that he ſhould be a more Happy man in the Life to
come, but in this Life, then he that lives the braveſt
Life, in all the Jollity and Contentment here in this
World? Certainly, the diſpoſition of your Hearts in
this thing, doth much diſcover what they are in reference
unto God. That's the Firſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here ſee what the Excellency of a Chriſtian
is: O the Excellency of a Saint in God! Why? Becauſe
he lives ſuch a Life as he doth; he lives a Supernatural
Life, he lives a Divine Life, he lives an Eternal Life:
The Lives of the Saints are ſuch as depend not upon any
thing in the World. Let the World go which way it will,
yet they have a Life, and a Livelihood too: They have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104282:59"/>
whereupon to live. How do Men account this to be a
great Happineſs, Let there be as hard Times as can be,
I hope I have enough to live on, ſaith a Man. If there
ſhould come Famine, or Troubles, yet I have a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
I have enough to live on. The Saints they have
enough to Live on, come what Times will; for to them
to live is Chriſt: You know Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpel,
<hi>That his Fleſh is Meat indeed, and his Blood is Drink
indeed; and he that Eats his Fleſh, and Drinks his Blood,
hath Eternal Life.</hi> That is, he that lives upon Him by
Faith, and draws forth the Virtue that is in Him by
Faith, he lives. It doth not beſeem therefore Chriſtians,
to be Whining and Complaining in the World, while
they want ſome outward contentment, for their preſent
Bodily lives: For, <hi>Your lives conſiſts not in abundance.</hi>
Though it's true, God for a while doth preſerve mens
Natural lives by the Creature: I, but it's but a Natural
life, it's not the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that's but a by thing. But the
thing that is <hi>to live,</hi> that's in Chriſt; and depends whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon Him: It ſhould be therefore indifferent to a
Godly Man or Woman, how things be with them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of this preſent life: For, <hi>To them to live is Chriſt.</hi>
Surely, it's the moſt Noble and Glorious life that can
be, when Chriſt is the Principle of it. Sometimes ſome
have thought that poſſibly there may be other Worlds
than we have here, and other kind of Creatures than
them we have here; and ſome Mens thoughts will be
Roving: Why cannot the Infinite Power of God make
Thouſands of Worlds beſides this, only they are not
Revealed to us? And perhaps in thoſe Worlds, the
meaneſt Creature there may be as far above the Sun, as
the Sun is here above a piece of Dirt. But ſuppoſe
there were never ſo many Worlds, and ſuch glorious
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104282:59"/>
Creatures that God had made: If God ſhould ſay, Well,
I by Mine Infinite Power have made this World, and I
will make a Thouſand Worlds more, and I will make
every Creature in thoſe to be ſo high in Glory above the
Sun that you have now, as the Sun is beyond a piece of
Dirt; yet in thoſe Worlds there would be no Creature
could Live a more Glorious life than the Saints do. It's
true, in Heaven, for the Degree it's more Glorious,
but for the Kind of that Life, none of thoſe Creatures
could live a Higher, and a more Noble life than a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian:
Why, <hi>For to him to live is Chriſt.</hi> It's Chriſt that
is his Life: And if God would make never ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
things, he could not make any thing more Excellent
than Chriſt is: Therefore ſo long as Chriſt is the Life
of a Chriſtian, it's the moſt Noble and Excellent thing
of all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Then, O let Chriſt be as dear to us as our Lives!
Let His Honour be maintained by us as our Lives! Let us
work for Him as we ſee a Man work for his life: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we do for Chriſt, let us do it for Him as for our life,
with all our ſtrength: For, for us to live (if we be
Chriſtians) it is Chriſt. It's Chriſt that is the Element
of Life, and therefore whither ſhould our lives work
but only unto Him, and for Him. That's the moſt bleſſed
life that hath Chriſt moſt in it: We ſhould not account
that we do live, but when we do ſomething for Chriſt.
I remember it's ſaid of the Emperor <hi>Titus,</hi> he would
ſay, when he had not done ſome good to ſome of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
<hi>I have not Reign'd to day.</hi> Why? Becauſe he had
done no Body any good Turn. And ſo we ſhould even
ſay, we have not liv'd to day, except that we have done
ſomewhat for Chriſt: For, <hi>For us to live is Chriſt.</hi> And
if to us to live be Chriſt here, O what will it be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104282:60"/>
then! For it is but a very little of Chriſt that we do
enjoy here.</p>
            <p>That's the next Uſe. When Chriſt who is our Life,
ſhall come to be Revealed, when we ſhall come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Fulneſs of all the Good that there is in Chriſt,
what will Chriſt be then unto us?</p>
            <p>And laſtly, From hence we may ſee the Reaſon why
the Saints can deny themſelves ſo much in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
condition, in that that the Men of the World make
account their Lives conſiſt in, as their Eſtates, and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and Liberty, and Eſteem: The People of God, they
can deny themſelves in ſuch things as theſe are. They
can Die daily unto the World: Why? Becauſe they have
another Life. Indeed, a Man that hath no other life but
that that conſiſts in Abundance, in his Eſtate, Pleaſures,
Liberties and Delights, he knows not how to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in them; but now a Man that hath another Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this, he can deny himſelf in theſe things, <hi>2 Cor.
14.</hi> 11. See what the Apoſtle ſaith there concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>For we,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who live, are alwayes delivered
unto Death for Jeſus ſake, that the Life alſo of Jeſus might
be made manifeſt in our Mortal Fleſh:</hi> Even this Mortal
Fleſh that muſt Die ere long, in ſuffering for Chriſt here,
it doth manifeſt the Life of Chriſt. And is it not a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
good to us, to have our Mortal Fleſh to manifeſt the
Life of Chriſt, than to have our Mortal Fleſh to live
here a Natural life? We would be loath to have this
fleſh of our Bodies to be dead fleſh: While we are
willing to ſuffer for Chriſt, this fleſh of ours doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
the very Life of Jeſus Chriſt: Therefore the Saints
are dead to the World, but they are alive to Jeſus Chriſt.
But thus much for this firſt Part: <hi>To me to live is Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:104282:60"/>
               <head>And to die is Gain.</head>
               <p>To whom Chriſt is to live, to them Death is gain.
The more we enjoy Chriſt, and live to Chriſt here, the
more gainful will death be to us, and the more ſhall we
be able to look upon death as Gain. And here we have
a Scripture (if we had no other) ſufficient to prove the
Immortallity of the Soul: How could death be Gain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Apoſtle, if ſo be that the Soul ſhould die together
with the Body? Indeed, Chriſt would be Gain for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Life hereafter, that is, at the Day of Judgment,
there Chriſt would be Gain. And thoſe that do deny
the Immortallity of the Soul, yet they are not ſo vile
as ſome take them: To think that Man ſhould Die like
a Beaſt, and there's an end of him; and that there ſhall
be no Reſurrection. No: But thoſe that do deny the
Immortallity of the Soul, they ſay, That though the
Soul dies with the Body, yet at the Day of Judgment,
both Soul and Body ſhall riſe again and live for ever.
But all they deny, is this, That the Soul between Death
and the Day of Judgment, ſhall live: They think, that
the Soul between Death and the Day of Judgment, ſhall
die, and then by the Almighty Power of God, they
ſhall be both raiſed again: That's their Opinion. But,
though it be not ſo bad as ſome would make it, yet an
Opinion falſe. For this Text ſhews that <hi>Paul</hi> was in a
ſtraight, he knew not whether to live or die; but that
was the concluſion, that it was better for him to die; for
then he ſhould be with Chriſt. He could not mean that
when he was dead, he ſhould be with Chriſt when the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Reſurrection comes: but he muſt needs mean that he
ſhould be with Chriſt immediately after his death, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104282:61"/>
another manner of communion with Jeſus Chriſt, than
he did here while he was living. And it is upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that he ſaith, <hi>It is gain for him to die.</hi> Why <hi>Paul</hi>
enjoyed much communion with Jeſus Chriſt here; and
though he had ſome ſin in him, yet conſidering the Grace
he had, and the Service he did for Chriſt; certainly it
were better for him to live, than to be in a condition
where he ſhould enjoy nothing of Chriſt, and do no
Service for Chriſt. But the Apoſtle lookt upon the
State of death before the day of Judgment, to be a
better Eſtate than that he had while he lived. Though,
ſaith he, I have the Grace of Chriſt, and I do Service
for Him, yet there is a better condition between Death
and Judgment: If my Soul were gone from my Body,
it would be in a better Eſtate than now it is: <hi>To me to
die is gain,</hi> and ſo you have it in <hi>2 Cor.</hi> where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaks of his departing out of the Body, in <hi>Chap. 5.
Therefore we are alwayes confident, knowing that whilſt
we are at Home in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord.
We are confident,</hi> in verſe 8. <hi>I ſay, and willing rather to be
abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> So
that 'tis apparent, that upon the Souls abſence from the
Body, it is preſent with the Lord. Now if the Soul
did die as the Body doth, it were not preſent with the
Lord; no, not ſo much as when it is in the Body. But
now the Apoſtle ſaith, That when it is out of the Body,
then it's preſent with the Lord; and when it is in the
Body, it is abſent from the Lord. And ſo it is upon this
Ground eſpecially that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That to him to
die was Gain:</hi> Becauſe he ſhould be abſent from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but preſent with Chriſt, which is beſt of all. To
be with Chriſt, it is more than to have Chriſt with us.
The difference lies here: For us to be with Chriſt, it is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104282:61"/>
for us to be brought to Chriſt, where He is like Himſelf
in all His Glory and Excellency; and for us to enjoy Him
in a proportionable way. But now for Chriſt to be <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,
God with us,</hi> it is for Chriſt to come down as
it were to us; and to manifeſt ſo much of Himſelf as is
ſutable to our condition: Therefore Chriſt humbles
Himſelf to come to be with us. For there He is a
Man of Sorrows, He is with us ſutable to our Mean and
Low condition; but when we come to be with Him, we
are there ſutable to His High and Glorious condition:
There lies the difference. Mark, The Apoſtle doth not
here ſay, <hi>To me to die is Gain:</hi> Upon this Ground, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I ſhall be delivered from my Troubles. As a great
many are ready to think, it were well for me to be Dead.
If they be but a little diſcountented, their outward Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
makes them willing to go out of the World: Yea,
and if their Bodies be weakly, and their Stomachs gone,
and cannot Eat as others do, or Sleep as others do; or
are very Poor, and Live in a mean Condition, they are
weary of this World. Now to think death Gain upon
ſuch a poor Ground as theſe, is not according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>Paul: Paul</hi> ſuffered as much as many of you do,
for outward things in this World, and yet he did not
deſire to die: O then, I ſhall be Afflicted no more, be
Perſecuted no more in the World; no, but when I die I
ſhall be with Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall enjoy Communion
with Him; and it's this that makes me look upon Death
with comfort, and in this reſpect it's Gain. Though <hi>Paul</hi>
had enjoyed all the World at will, yet he would have
accounted Death to have been Gain to him. And
though <hi>Paul</hi> was a Man of great Eſteem among the Saints,
(though Perſecuted by others) yet death was Gain to
him. Yea, though <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyed all Ordinances, yet
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104282:62"/>
Chriſt was Gain to him. And though he did a great deal
of Service for Chriſt, (as I verily believe there was never
any Man ſince the World was made, did more Service
for Jeſus Chriſt than <hi>Paul</hi> did) and yet death was Gain
to him; he ſhould get much by it: Why many things
might make the death of <hi>Paul</hi> Gainful. I remember
the laſt time I ſpake to you, I ſpoke about an Argument
of the Victory over Death, that we have by Chriſt; I
will not ſpeak now of what then I ſpake to, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Confine my ſelf; for otherwiſe the Argument might
be very large, to ſhew the Gain of death to Believers:
But I'll confine my ſelf to the very thing that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaks of here in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> That he ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore now I'll ſpeak of the Gain of being with
Chriſt. Now I confeſs there are many things that might
be opened: The Communion of the Soul departed with
Jeſus Chriſt,</p>
               <p>As Firſt, It ſhall be immediate, the Souls of the Saints
while they are in the Body, they have Communion with
Chriſt; but it is Mediately, by other things, by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and Means, whereby Chriſt conveys Himſelf to
them; but there they ſhall have Communion with Chriſt
Immediately, only Chriſt and the Soul together. Now the
more Immediate the Communion is with Chriſt, it is the
more pure: Here we have ſome Communion with Chriſt,
but a great deal of Sin mixt together with it. That that
is immediately from the Fountain is more pure, that that
comes in the Streams hath Dirt mixed with it. So that
that we ſhall have with Chriſt immediately ſhall be pure,
we ſhall have Communion with Him and nothing elſe:
We ſhall have no mixtures at all of any evil in our own
Spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:104282:62"/>
And then Secondly, Immediate communion with
Chriſt, it is more Sweet: As the more Pure, ſo the more
Sweet. As now, the Wine that comes immediately from
the Grape, it hath more Spirits, and is more delightful
than that that is poured from Veſſel to Veſſel. That which
we have here from Chriſt, it is that that is poured from
Veſſel to Veſſel; but that which Souls departed have from
Chriſt is immediate, and ſo comes more Sweet. As if
the Child ſuck Milk from the Breaſt, it is more ſweet to
the Child than the Milk in a Spoon. That that we have
from Chriſt here, is Milk as it were from the Spoon; but
that that Souls have that are departed, they ſuck from
Chriſt immediately, and ſo comes to be more ſweet.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And more eſpecially, we account that that
comes Immediately, to have more Love in it. As that
that a Friend gives by his own hand, is better and more
comfortable to us. So that that comes from God Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
it's a great deal more ſweet: As now here
while we Live in the World, the more immediate a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is, the more ſweet it is to a gracious Heart. Indeed,
a Mercy that comes by ſecond Cauſes, it's comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
becauſe God Over-rules all the Cauſes; but when it
can ſee God immediately in a Mercy, the more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the Hand of God is here: Though God doth not
work ſo Immediately here as He will do afterwards; but
the more Immediate God is here, the more ſweet it is.
And therefore in a Judgment, the more Immediate the
Hand of God is, the more Terrible, as in the Plague.
So in a Mercy, though every Mercy is ſweet, yet the
more Immediate God is in a Mercy, the more ſweet it
is. And then, O how ſweet is all the Good that the
Saints have immediately from Chriſt, therefore it's Gain
to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:104282:63"/>
And then, Fourthly, It's more ſtrong. The firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
is more Powerfull than: a ſecond; and the firſt
Guſhings out are more ſtrong. The Beams of the Sun
when they are firſt Reflected, than if you take a Glaſs
and Reflect them again and again. And ſo that that
comes Guſhing out (as it were) of the very Heart of
God, it's more ſtrong a great deal; and there is greater
Impreſſions upon the Heart by it, than that that comes
by ſecond Cauſes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That that comes Immediate, it comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Labour. The Soul draws it from Chriſt, and is not
put to ſo much Pain and Labour as now we are put to.
If we would have Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, we
muſt ſtir up our ſelves to the Humbling of our Hearts,
to the Acting of our Faith, to Exerciſe our Graces,
and put the Body to it. If you would have any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Chriſt in Prayer, it muſt put you to ſome
Labour: And: ſo in the Word and Sacraments: And the
Labour of a Chriſtian is very great. But when we come
to have Immediate communion with Chriſt, it will be
the flowings in of Chriſt to the Soul, without any La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
at all.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It ſhall be more full, when we come to be Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the very Fountain it ſelf; there it will be more
full than the Stream. Certainly, there is that Good and
Excellency in Chriſt, that is too much for any <hi>Creature</hi>
in the World to convey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, take all the <hi>Creatures</hi>
in the World, and Ordinances, they are too ſcant to
be able to convey the Good that is in Chriſt; yea, that
Good that Chriſt takes delight to communicate to the
Souls of His People. And that's the Reaſon that here
we have but a little. Why? Becauſe the Conduits are
ſo Narrow and Small, that there can be but a little let
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104282:63"/>
out through thoſe Conduits; but when the Soul is with
Chriſt immediately, then it hath the Fulneſs of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
out of Gods Mercy: There will be an Eminency
of every ſort of Good to every poor Chriſtian. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<hi>Jerom,</hi> ſpeaking of that Text, <hi>Chriſt being All
in all:</hi> He makes this Interpretation of it, ſaith he, Chriſt
is here but ſome to ſome; but not all to all. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſaith he, Here ſome Men have ſome Eminency
of ſome particular Grace conveid to them, and ſome
other Eminency of ſome particular Grace. As <hi>Moſes</hi>
had an Eminency of Meekneſs, <hi>Abraham</hi> an Eminency
of Faith, <hi>Job</hi> an Eminency of Patience, and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
an Eminency of Wiſdom, but, ſaith he, Where
was there ever a Man Eminent in all Graces? But then
(ſaith he) <hi>Chriſt ſhall be All in all:</hi> That is, Chriſt ſhall
convey all Grace to all His Saints, that all the Saints ſhall
have an Eminency and Fulneſs in all Grace whatſoever.
This will be an Excellent thing. Surely it's Gain then
to Die, for a gracious Heart, where Chriſt ſhall be thus
All in all to them, to convey this Fulneſs of Good in all
things unto them. Thoſe Saints that are the Meaneſt
now, whoſe Souls have the leaſt degree of true Grace,
they ſhall have an Eminency of all Grace. Wouldſt not
thou think thy ſelf happy, if thou hadſt as much Faith
as <hi>Abraham,</hi> as much Meekneſs as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as much
Patience as <hi>Job,</hi> and as much Inſight into the Miſteries of
the Goſpel as <hi>Paul?</hi> Now, hadſt thou as much as all the
Saints ever had, were not that Gain? Why now as ſoon as
thy Soul is departed from the Body, thou ſhalt have an
Eminency in all Graces, as much as all the Saints ever
had, ſince the beginning of the World. Therefore
ſurely, it's Gain to die for a Godly Man.</p>
               <p>7ly, Further, It's Gain in this reſpect, When they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104282:64"/>
immediately, they ſhall receive all United in one,
and all together: They ſhall have ſuch Influence from
Chriſt, as hath all Good united in one Beam of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
and ſo receive it all together. As now, a Man
may take the Quinteſence of ſeveral Herbs; there's this
Herb hath this Virtue, another another, and a third a
third; but now if you Still all theſe Herbs together,
you will have the Virtue and Quinteſence of all in one
Drop. So Chriſt here ſcatters His Excellencies, one in
one Creature, another in another; but when we come
to enjoy Him immediately, then we ſhall have all in
one, becauſe all His Excellencies whatſoever is united
in one in Him.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Further, all our Good ſhall be in continal Act.
Here we have a great deal of Good in the Habit, but
now when we come to have this Immediate communion
with Chriſt, there all our Graces ſhall be Acted continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
The Sun, you know, how it doth Act the Earth;
whatſoever there is in the Earth, it draws it forth and
makes it flouriſh. So the Preſence of the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
Oh how Gloriouſly will it Act all our Graces!
In <hi>Numb.</hi> 17. 7. We read of <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, it Bloſſom'd:
And the Text ſaith, <hi>It Bloſſom'd before the Lord.</hi> When
the Souls of the Saints ſhall be before the Lord, and be
in the Preſence of the Lord Chriſt: O they ſhall Bloſſom
and Flouriſh, and all their Graces ſhall Flouriſh in a moſt
Glorious manner.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, And then laſtly, We ſhall enjoy what is in
Chriſt without any Intermiſſion: What's the reaſon of
any Intermiſſion here? But ſomething that comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Chriſt and our Souls. But now when there ſhall
be nothing between Chriſt and the Soul, then there will
be no Intermiſſion. That Sweetneſs and Comfort thou
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104282:64"/>
haſt in communion with Chriſt at any time, thou ſhalt have
it at all times: And how good is that? O ſaith many a Soul,
could I have but the communion with Chriſt at all times,
as I have at ſome times: O that would be comfortable!
Now when the Soul hath Immediate communion with
Chriſt, it ſhall have it at all times. What's the reaſon of
Ecclipſes? It is the Interpoſition between the Moon and
the Sun, or ſome Interpoſition between the Sun and us.
So our Ecclipſes of the Light that we have from Chriſt,
it is ſome Interpoſition: Take away the Interpoſition,
and then there will be no Intermiſſion. Now put all
theſe together, and is it not Gain to Die, and to be with
Chriſt. Now by way of Uſe:</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>It is Gain thus to be with Chriſt.</head>
               <p>Hence then,<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> If it be Gain for one that doth ſo much
Service for Chriſt as <hi>Paul</hi> did, ſurely than thoſe that are
Believers, and are made little Uſe of in any Service for
Chriſt, they will get by their Death. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Man
that one would wonder how the Churches could ſpare
him, he did ſo much for Chriſt; and yet <hi>Paul</hi> would get
by Death. If thou beeſt a Believer, thou ſhalt have
thy Immediate communion with Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> had.
Alas, here while thou Liveſt, thou haſt but little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
between Chriſt and thee, and doeſt Him but
little Service in the World: Then why ſhould you ſo
much deſire to Live in the World, that have nothing to
Countervail the Trouble that you have, and the Sin that is
committed in the World? O, ſurely, it will be gain for you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hence it follows, That it is a Self-denial to
a Believer, to be willing to Live here in the World.
You will ſay, If it be ſo much Gain, why ſhould any be
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104282:65"/>
ſo deſirous to Live? It's this, firſt, Nature will have its
work, though in their Judgments they are convinc't,
that it's better to be with Chriſt; yet the Body will be
working, and the Affections will follow the Body very
much. Further, Though they be convinc't that it is
Gain, yet God lays a Tie upon them, to preſerve their
Lives as long as they can here in this World, in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God: They do deſire to avoid Dangers, and
Preſerve their Lives. It is not for them to be where it
is beſt for them to be, but to be where God would have
them to be; and therefore God doth charge them to ſeek
to Preſerve their Lives, and to go on till He Himſelf
ſhall Diſſolve the Body and Soul. It's God that is the
Lord of our Life, and as God gave us our Lives, ſo it is
He that muſt take them away, and not any Body elſe.
But yet, I ſay, there is ſome Self-denial in it: We muſt
look upon our ſelves here, as in a very Low and Mean
condition, in compariſon of what we hope to be within
a while after. Therefore obſerve this one Note, Thoſe
that do believe the Gain of Death, they had need La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
what they can, to countervail the Forbearance of
the Gain, by ſomewhat or other. If a Man hath a great
Gain, and it comes not in his preſent Poſſeſſion, he
thinks, What ſhall I have for my Forbearance? You will
ſay, What is it that any Believer can have in lieu of his
Forbearance of that Gain? Truly, the moſt Excellent
thing is this, that he may do Chriſt Service while he
Lives. Now then, Is that the main thing? O learn from
hence, to be of as much uſe in your Lives, as poſſibly
you can, for you have nothing elſe (to ſpeak of) in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of that great Gain. Why, Lord, I expect to
enjoy Thee for ever before long, but thou art pleaſed
to Prolong my Life here for a while; in the mean time
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104282:65"/>
I meet with many Temptations and Troubles, and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and much Sin I have: But yet, Lord, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
it's my deſire to Honour Thee, and Serve Thee; and
through Thy Mercy, I am ſome way or other Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Thee, in the Place where Thou haſt ſet me; and,
Lord, this is the thing contents me, while I am abſent
from Thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hence we ſee the great Difference that there
is between the death of a Believer, and the death of a
Wicked Man. I ſhewed you, I remember in the death
of an Ungodly Man, when the ſiery Serpent comes with his
Sting, and takes him in his Natural Eſtate, Death is not
Gain to ſuch a one: O, no; death takes away all his
Gain: But now, death is the greateſt Gain to the Saints.
That's an excellent Scripture you have in <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 3. the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end, <hi>Whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Appollos, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the
World, or Life, or Death, or Things preſent, or Things
to come, all is yours.</hi> In Chriſt, Death comes to be
made yours: Death is part of the Poſſeſſion of the
Saints: O the difference between the death of the Saints,
and the death of Wicked and Ungodly Men! Do but
put two Men, a Wicked Man, and a Godly Man, lying
both together upon their Death-Beds, (you muſt take
a wicked Man that hath an enlightned Conſcience) he lies
beholding the Wrath of the Infinite God, ready to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him up, and his Conſcience tearing and rending of
him, and ſo the black diſmal bottomleſs Gulf, ready to
ſwallow him; ſee the fiery Serpent ſent from an Angry
God, twiſting himſelf about his Middle, with a Sting
at his Heart, ready to take away his Life, that he might
not Live any longer to Diſhonour his God; he lies cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
himſelf for his Wickedneſs and Folly, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that he hath Liv'd in, and wiſhing that he had never
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104282:66"/>
been Born. Now the Godly Man, he lies bleſſing of
the Name of God for His Goodneſs; and in that, God
did ſhew to him in the time of his Life, the things that
concern his Eternal Peace: He bleſſes God that ever he
knew Him, that ever he knew His Wayes: He bleſſes
God, that the time of his departure is ſo near, and he
ſees Jeſus Chriſt ready to receive him, and the Angels at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
about him: O the bleſſed day when I ſhall
go to Enjoy an Immediate, Full, and Eternal Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Jeſus Chriſt, that is beſt of all. And there
he lies Encouraging all that comes to ſee him, to know
Chriſt and God betimes. O here's the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the death of the Godly, and the death of the
Wicked: One is the greateſt Terror, and the other is the
greateſt Gain.</p>
               <p>And, my Brethren, let theſe Things that I have now
Spoken to you, let them prepare you for <hi>Death,</hi> and
welcome <hi>Death</hi> whenſoever it comes. Do not think
of what you muſt Leave in the World, but what you
are going to: It is to go to Chriſt, that is beſt of all.
And manifeſt the Power of thoſe Things, lay them up
againſt ſuch a time.</p>
               <p>And let all that hath been ſaid, Teach you to be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to Prize Chriſt and the Goſpel: Here's that will
Recompence all Troubles and Afflictions you meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
in the Wayes of God, to be able upon your <hi>Death-Bed,</hi>
to ſay with <hi>Paul: To me to Die is Gain.</hi> It will
Recompence whatever Pains you take in the Wayes of
Religion.</p>
               <p>And I appeal to you: Do you think that there was
ever any ſince the World began, that was Sorry upon
their <hi>Death-Bed,</hi> that they had taken too much Pains
in the Wayes of God? There have been Thouſands
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104282:66"/>
that have Curſed themſelves for the neglecting of the
day of Grace and Salvation, but never ſorry for taking
ſo much Pains. O no! When thou comeſt upon thy
<hi>Death-Bed</hi> thou wilt have need of all, and thou wilt
bleſs God for any pains that thou haſt taken for Chriſt.
Lay then this Sentence unto thy Heart, it will Teach thee
to Live, and to Die: And, Certainly, he muſt needs
Live Joyfully whoſe <hi>Life is Chriſt:</hi> And he muſt needs
Die comfortably, whoſe <hi>Death is Gain.</hi>

            <p>THeſe Words are part of Chriſts Direction unto the
Seventy Diſciples, that He ſent forth to Preach
the Goſpel. As <hi>Exod. 15. laſt.</hi> We Read of
Twelve Wells of Water, and Threeſcore and
Ten Palm Trees, where <hi>Iſrael</hi> Encamped after their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> for their Refreſhing. So
Chriſt ſends forth His Twelve Apoſtles, and Seventy
Diſciples, for the Refreſhing of the World, with the
glad Tidings of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>There were Seventy. I find many Interpreters keep
much ado about the Number, <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Jerom,</hi> with
others: They ſay, this Number hath Reference unto the
Seventy ſeveral Languages of the World. For, they
ſay, That at the Confuſion of Languages at <hi>Babel,</hi> there
were Seventy; and ſo according in Proportion unto
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104282:67"/>
them, Chriſt ſends forth theſe Seventy. Theſe are but
Surmiſes, and many other ſuch Gueſſes there are; but
particular Reaſon for the Number, we have not Expreſt
in Scripture, neither have we their Names. We have
the Apoſtles Names, the Twelve, but not theſe Seventy.
Some God is Pleaſed to make Men of Names, Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the World, and leave their Names as Honourable:
Others the Lord Imploys in great Works and Services,
but their Names are Buried. It is enough for theſe,
that Chriſt tells them in the <hi>20th. verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,
That their Names are Written in the Book of Life.</hi> Let
God Imploy us in His Work, and Write our Names in
the Book of Life, it is no matter for to Name us in this
World. There are many remarkable things in Chriſts
ſending out of theſe Seventy.</p>
            <p>As Firſt, He ſends them forth by two, and two; ſo
you have it in <hi>ver.</hi> 1. of the <hi>Chap.</hi> to the end that they
might be a mutual Support, Comfort, Encouragement,
Aſſiſtance one to another; which is the Duty of all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
that God by His Providence ſhall Joyn together
in any Service.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt tells them, the great Work that they
were ſent about: <hi>The Harveſt truly is great,</hi> ſaith He,
<hi>and the Labourers are but few.</hi> I ſend you out into a
Harveſt, which is a great Labour, a uſeful Labour, a
joyful Work, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 3. Joy in the time of Harveſt,
is the greateſt Joy in the World: It is a Harveſt that you
are ſent into, and it is a very great one, and therefore
you have Encouragement becauſe there is ſo much Work
to do. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. latter end, There it is ſaid that Chriſt
look'd upon the Multitude with Compaſſion, and ſaid,
<hi>The Harveſt is great, but the Labourers but few.</hi> When
Miniſters look upon great Congregations, Multitudes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104282:68"/>
of People, and eſpecially ſuch as come readily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
to hear the Word of God, he ſhould not look
upon them without compaſſion; as looking upon them
as a great Harveſt, as much Work to be done there.
Yea, in <hi>John</hi> 4. 34. After the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> and
others were Converted, as the firſt Fruits; Chriſt tells
the Diſciples of the Regions, that they were white unto
Harveſt: As if He ſhould ſay, There are Multitudes
here in this Place, that are very ready to Entertain the
Goſpel.</p>
            <p>A great Encouragement indeed it is, when the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of God ſhall ſee People ſo readily to attend upon
the Word, as they ſhall look upon the Regions as white
unto Harveſt, that they are in a Preparation to receive
the Word. <hi>The Harveſt is great;</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
are but few, pray ye therefore the Lord of the
Harveſt, that he will ſend forth Labourers into his
Harveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were Threeſcore and Ten ſent out together,
and yet they were few, and they muſt Pray for more.
It is the Duty of all People, eſpecially of Miniſters, to
Pray to God, that He will ſend forth more Painful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And then, Thirdly, Chriſt tells them what Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they are like to meet withal in their Work:</hi> Go your
wayes, <hi>ſaith He, in ver.</hi> 3. Behold I ſend you forth as
Lambs among Wolves; you are to be as I am, of Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Diſpoſitions, Innocent among People where you Live.
But know before-hand, leſt you be Diſcouraged with thoſe
Difficulties you are like to meet wtthal; you ſhall not only
meet with Dogs that will Bark at you, nor with Foxes that
ſeek Cunningly to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndermine you, but with Wolves that
will ſeek violently to Deſtroy you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:104282:68"/>
And you ſhall find it in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. That He ſends out
His Apoſtles, and He tells them the like: And indeed,
it did ſo fall out. For there was not any one of the
Twelve Apoſtles, but did Die a Violent death; was
putto death by the Rage of Ungodly Men, except <hi>John.</hi> It
were eaſie to ſhew you partly out of Eccleſiaſtical Stories,
how every one except <hi>John,</hi> was put to death; ſome Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſome Ston'd, ſome Crucified, and ſome by the Sword:
One way or other, the Twelve were put to death, that
were the greateſt Inſtruments of doing God Service,
that ever were in the World; and yet this Recompence
they all had from this wicked World, ſave only one (I ſay)
and yet the Scripture tells us that he was Baniſht. And
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Stories tell us, that he was caſt into Scald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lead; but withal they tell us, that he was Delivered
by a Miracle out of it: So that he wanted not his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
too. That's the Third thing.</p>
            <p>And then the Fourth thing that there is in Chriſts
Direction unto theſe, it is this: He tells them, That all
their Living that they are like to have, it is to be had by
their Work: They are to be maintain'd for their Work,
and they ſhould take no further care, <hi>For the Labourer is
worthy of his Hire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, Fifthly, Which ſeems to be more ſtrange,
Chriſt doth bid them, <hi>That they ſhould Salute no Man by
the way.</hi> Why would Chriſt have His Diſciples to be
Uncivil, not ſo much to Salute Men in a civil way?
That, ſurely, cannot be the meaning: But it was to
ſignifie, that they were to tend the great Work that they
were ſent about, with all Diligence, and to take heed
that nothing did Interrupt them. They were not to ſtay
upon any Complemental Salutations, Viſitations, that
ſpends a great deal of Time oftentimes; they had not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104282:69"/>
ſo much Time as other Men. Men, indeed, who
have little to do, they ſpend their day, as your
great Gentry, and others, ſpend a great part of their
Time in Complemental Salutations, and Viſitations: <hi>I
but,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>do not you ſpend any time that
way; Imploy all your time in the Work you are ſent about.</hi>
Men that have great Buſineſſes to do, they can ſpare no
time for Salutations: So ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples,
<hi>Your Errand is of great Conſequence, you are to be Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors
of Reconciliation between God and Man; be not
hindred any wayes that uſually Men are hindred in their
Work.</hi> And therefore People ſhould not expect ſuch
things from Miniſters, in any Complemental Viſitation
of that kind; but they are to know, that the Work of
Miniſters ſhould take up their whole Heart and Time:
This ſeems to have ſome Reference unto the Direction
of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> unto his Servant, when he was to
go to Heal the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Son, which you have in
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Kings 4. 29. Gird up thy Loyns ſaith the Prophets, and
take my Staff in thine hand and go thy way: If thou meet
any Man, ſalute him not; and if any Man ſalute thee,
anſwer him not again.</hi> That is, Go in haſte to the
Child, and let nothing hinder thee: So this is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this, <hi>Salute no Man by the way.</hi> Not that they
ſhould be Uncivil, or Uncourteous, but that they ſhould
take heed that no ſuch thing hinders them, and take up
their time as uſually doth other Mens.</p>
            <p>And then having given them that Direction, now
comes the Direction in my Text, that I have read unto
you: <hi>And into whatſoever Houſe you enter, firſt ſay, Peace
be to this Houſe.</hi> That is, do not force your ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any People, do not come in a forceable way into any
Houſe, but with their Leave; <hi>And firſt ſay, Peace be to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104282:69"/>
this Houſe.</hi> This was the ordinary Salutation of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
Peace be to you: Peace be to this place.</hi> For they
comprehended all Good by the name of Peace. Now,
though the Diſciples were not to Salute any by the way,
yet thoſe they came to Preach to, they were to Salute
them with this Salutation, <hi>Peace be to this Houſe:</hi> Which
was but to ſhew unto them the Gentleneſs, and the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingneſs
of their Spirits; they were to make this appear
to People that they were ſent to Preach unto, that they
were Men of Soft, Loving, Sweet, Gentle Spirits, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they come with this Salutation, <hi>Peace be to this
Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is not only a Salutation, but as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi>
it was a Benediction. They in the Name of
God, were to Bleſs the place where they came, and ſay,
<hi>Peace be to this place,</hi> as a Benediction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It was to give them a Taſte of the great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
they come to the Houſe for, it was to tell them of
the Meſſage, that they came from Chriſt unto them about,
and that was, to bring Peace unto them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here's a Diſcription of the Entertainers of
this Peace, <hi>If the Son of Peace be there:</hi> The Son of
Peace, that is,</p>
            <p>If there be any, Firſt, that are ordained by God, to
have the Benefit of this Peace that you bring to them,
then let your Peace abide. So the Scripture uſes this
phraſe, <hi>Son of a thing,</hi> to ſhew one appointed to it:
As, <hi>The Son of Perdition;</hi> ſo, <hi>The Son of Peace:</hi> That is,
one appointed by God, to enjoy the Benefit of this
Peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Son of Peace:</hi> That is, One that will
attend unto Peace, will manifeſt himſelf to be a Child
of Peace indeed, by attending diligently upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104282:70"/>
of Peace that you do bring unto him. And ſo
you have it, as I remember, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 15. where
the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>Child of the Bride-Chamber:</hi>
Now the words in the <hi>Greek</hi> are, <hi>The Sons of the Bride-Chamber:</hi>
That is, thoſe that do attend upon the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Bride-Chamber. So the Sons of Peace, that
is, thoſe that are willing to attend upon this great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Peace, that is to be delivered to them.</p>
            <p>And then Thirdly, <hi>The Sons of Peace:</hi> That is, ſuch as
will be Obedient unto the Peace of the Goſpel. So in
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. As thoſe that will not Obey, are called the
Children of Diſobedience: So thoſe that Obey, may be
called the Sons, or the Children of Peace. So then,
the meaning is this, If a Son of Peace be there, that is,
If one appointed to Eternal peace; if one that will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon your Goſpel of Peace; if one that will be
Obedient unto thoſe Conditions of Peace that you are
to bring: if ſuch a one be there,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then,</hi> Let your Peace abide upon him.</p>
            <p>There's the Bleſſing of thoſe that are thus the Sons of
Peace, they ſhall have all the Good that there is in that
bleſſed Peace of the Goſpel that you bring; they ſhall
not only have the Benefit of it for the preſent, but they
ſhall have it <hi>abide</hi> upon them: They ſhall be exceeding
Gainers, <hi>Your Peace ſhall abide upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>If not:</hi> If there be any that are not appointed
to it, or that attend not upon it, that are not Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
unto it, <hi>Then your Peace ſhall turn to you again.</hi>
What's that?</p>
            <p>That is, Firſt, This is by way of Encouragement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Diſciples. And, Secondly, By way of Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
unto thoſe that ſhall Reject the Offers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:104282:70"/>
Firſt, To the Diſciples, Two wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Though their Miniſtry ſhould not do good to
Souls, yet they ſhould not be Loſers, but the Bleſſing
of the Peace ſhall return into their own Boſoms. Look
what Good they endeavoured to do to the People they
Preached unto, if they did not receive it, then this
Good ſhould return upon their own Hearts, they ſhould
get by it themſelves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Which I think to be as much intended as
the former, and that's this: Your Miniſtry, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
of your Peace: For ſo this Peace is, <hi>It ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to you.</hi> That is, It ſhall be of as much Vigour,
Strength, Power, and Efficacy to be carried to others,
as it was at the firſt. They may think thus, If we do go
and Preach to a People and ſhall be Rejected, then our
Miniſtry is like to be vile: For if one ſhall Reject us,
it's like another will. It is ſo indeed, in matters of the
World; if a worldly Buſineſs receive any Foil in one,
it's more like to receive a Foil in another. But, ſaith
Chriſt, be not you troubled about this; but if you
ſhould Preach to any People where you ſhould have any
to Reject your Miniſtry, it ſhould return to you again;
it ſhall have as much Efficacy and Power, as if it never
had been rejected when you go to carry it to another
People. Whatſoever Diſreſpect is caſt upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
or upon their Miniſtry, yet as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<hi>The Word of God is not bound,</hi> Though we are bound,
though the Miniſtry prevails not in one People, yet it
retains the power of it, as much as if it had never been
Rejected.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe that do Reject it, let them know:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That they ſhall have no Bleſſing of that Peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let them know that it ſhall not continue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104282:71"/>
long among them: No, not in the Miniſtry of it, but
that God will deal very quick with them; for if they
will not receive it, it ſhall return to you again. And
thus you have both the Scope, and the Dependance, and
the meaning of theſe words read unto you. Now then,
there are many Obſervations of Excellent Note unto us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As from Ver.</hi> 5. Into whatſoever Houſe ye enter, firſt
ſay, Peace be to this Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. Firſt, That the Miniſters of the Goſpel
ought to be Men of Gentle, and Fair, Loving Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Firſt ſay, <hi>Peace be to this Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. That Miniſters of the Goſpel, ought to
Bleſs the People among whom they come, ſay, <hi>Peace be
to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. The great Errand and Buſineſs a Miniſter
comes about to a People, it is to bring <hi>Peace to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. That a Miniſter hath Warrant and Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion
to offer peace to any place whereſoever he comes,
let them be what they will be; he hath a Commiſſion
from Chriſt, to offer peace to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 5. That the firſt thing a Miniſter is to do in his
Preaching, it is to offer <hi>Peace;</hi> firſt ſay <hi>Peace</hi> before any
thing elſe. And theſe are the Five Notes of Obſervation
from <hi>Ver.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Now then from Ver. 6. <hi>And if the Son of Peace be
there.</hi> From hence there's this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. Firſt, Note, That when God ſends the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the Goſpel unto a place, it is very probable
that there are ſome appointed for the good of it; that
there will be ſome <hi>Sons of Peace</hi> there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. That thoſe that do entertain the Goſpel,
they are <hi>(The) Sons of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:104282:71"/>
               <hi>Obſer.</hi> 3. Whoſoever are <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have all the Bleſſing of the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Goſpel to reſt
upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſer.</hi> 4. Yet ſometimes where God ſends the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the Word, it is rejected: <hi>If not,</hi> and Gods
Miniſters muſt expect it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſer.</hi> 5. Whereſoever it is Rejected, thoſe certainly
are Deprived of the Benefit of the Goſpel: <hi>If not, it
ſhall return to you again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 6. That thoſe that are Faithful Miniſters, ſhall
not loſe their Labour, though they ſhould not Convert
Souls to God, <hi>It ſhall return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 7. And then laſtly, Thoſe that ſhall reject the
Goſpel, are not like to enjoy it long; God will deal
with them very quick: <hi>If not, your Peace ſhall return
to you again, and there's an end of them;</hi> ſaith God. Theſe
are the ſeveral Notes of Obſervation, out of this Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Chriſt to the Diſciples for their Preaching.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And into whatſoever Houſe ye enter, firſt ſay, Peace be
to that Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, You ſee how Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould
come to a place, with gentleneſs, and chearfulneſs,
and manifeſt a ſweetneſs of Spirit, in coming to any
place; and ſo to gaine upon people that way. In <hi>Lev.
24 2. The Lamps in the Temple were to be of pure Oyle
Olive,</hi> beaten, to note that the Lights that God ſets
up in his Church ſhould be of peaceable and gentle
Spirits, of ſweet Spirits; You know that the <hi>Olive</hi> it
is the emblem of peace and ſweetneſs. So in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 4.
The Two Witneſſes there, which eſpecially are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Goſpel; they are ſaid to be the Two <hi>Olive
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104282:72"/>
Branches.</hi> Thoſe who Chriſt ſends, eſpecially to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to himſelf and unto his Truth, they are to be <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
Branches,</hi> Men of peaceable, and gentle, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſpoſitions. So we find that the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith
concerning himſelf, <hi>1 Theſ. 2. 7. But we were gentle
among you, even as a nurſe cheriſheth her children.</hi> So
in <hi>2 Tim. 2. 24. The ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive;
but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient; in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if God perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
will give a general repentance to the acknowledging
of the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this muſt be firſt, Becauſe that God in whoſe
Name they come, is the God of Peace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt whoſe Embaſſadors they are, is the
Prince of Peace. And,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Spirit of God, by whoſe aſſiſtance they
Preach, is ſet out by the Dove, that they ſay hath no
Gall; it was wont to be ſaid of <hi>Beza,</hi> that he was a
man without any Gall.</p>
            <p>And the Goſpel that is their Meſſage, that's a Goſpel
of Peace, and the end that they are to aime at in their
Miniſtry it is to bring peace to mens Souls. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
ſometimes there is a neceſſity for Miniſters to
preach things that are hard unto people; things that
they think to be very hard and grievous unto them;
though their main ſcope be the Goſpel of Peace; yet there
are many things that belong to their Commiſſion that
ſeem to be very hard to people, As the opening of
their loſt and miſerable condition by Nature, and the
like, and to threaten ſometimes in the Name of God:
Now therefore, That they might convince people that
they aim onely at good unto them in this; therefore
they muſt be of as loving, and gentle, and quiet, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104282:72"/>
patient Spirits as poſſible may be, eſpecially in their
own cauſe, and that's the tryal. You ſometimes prehaps
hear a Miniſter preach hard things, and you think they
come with much harſhneſs to you, and your hearts are
ready to riſe againſt them: But examine whether in all
their dealings elſe, and in things concerning themſelves,
whether they be not of loving and gentle Spirits, and
full of Bowels of Compaſſion. And they muſt be of
ſuch diſpoſitions, that they might win upon people
and draw their hearts, as in <hi>Hoſ. 11. 4. I drew them
with Cords of a Man, and with the Bands of love.</hi> And
indeed this is one ſpecial reaſon why God ſends Men
to be the Miniſters of the Goſpel rather then Angels,
that there might not be any terror ſtrook into the hearts
of people. If Angels ſhould appear they would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
dreadful and terrible; but God doth rather
chooſe Man to be a Miniſter, that ſo he might ſute
himſelf to the diſpoſitions of Men, and draw with the
Cords of Man: And what's that? That's with the Bands
of love. Mans Nature will rather be drawn then dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>And my Brethren, As it ought to be in Miniſters
to be of ſuch diſpoſitions, ſo you that are the people
ſhould ſhew your ſelves to be of the like diſpoſitions
towards them again; of Sweet, and Loving, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and Fair Diſpoſitions towards them; not of rugged
and ridged tempers. We read of the building of the
Temple, that there was not one whit of Iron us'd in it;
which is obſervable. We do not read (I ſay) of Iron
that was brought to the Building; they made their
Pinns of Wood and other things, and Plates of Gold
and Silver, but brought no Iron. God when he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to build a Church, and call a People home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104282:73"/>
he will call ſuch as are of gentle Spirits, or make
them ſuch. God doth either refuſe ſuch ridged Spirits,
or elſe he doth change their natures: that's the Firſt
Note. <hi>Say, Peace be to this Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second is this,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> That Miniſters ought to bleſs
their People; for ſo theſe words are to be conſidered
not onely as to manifeſt their diſpoſitions, to give them
a taſte of their Spirits; but as a Benediction to them.
Peace be to this place. We in the Name of the Lord
Bleſs you with Peace. And this is more than to pray
for them; Miniſters are to pray for People; <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d,
ſaith Samuel, That I ſhould ſin againſt the Lord
in ceaſing to pray for you:</hi> But Miniſters ſhould do
more, They are in the Name of the Lord to Bleſs
them. Prayer it is a Speaking unto God; but
Bleſſing, it is to Speak from God to Man, and that
with ſome kind of Authority. Therefore we find in
Scripture, that <hi>The Leſſer is Bleſſed of the Greater.</hi> And
That the Miniſters were appointed to Bleſs the People,
in the Old Law, <hi>Numb. 6. 23. Speak unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>and to
his Sons, ſaying, On this wiſe ye ſhall bleſs the Children
of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying unto them, The Lord bleſs thee, and keep
thee; the Lord make His Face to ſhine upon thee, and be
Gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up His Countenance upon
thee, and give thee Peace.</hi> Here was Bleſſing in the Old
Law. And they retain'd ſome part of it, in coming
to any place, when they ſaid, <hi>Peace be to this Place.</hi> We
read of Men of great Eſteem among the People of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> that were wont to Bleſs thoſe that they came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
As you find that of <hi>Boaz,</hi> in <hi>Ruth 2. 4. He Prays for
them, and they Bleſs him.</hi> Here was a ſweet Salutation
of a Man, that did ſet other Men on work: <hi>Boaz came
into the Field, and ſaid unto the Keepers, The Lord be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104282:73"/>
with you: And they anſwered him, The Lord bleſs thee.</hi>
Many Men when they go among their Work-men, they
go with Raging and Curſing, if things be not done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Mind. Now what an unſeemly thing
is this, among thoſe who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians?
But on the other ſide, this is Gracious-like, to come
among their Servants and Work-men, and thus to Bleſs
them, <hi>The Lord be with you:</hi> And they to pray for them,
<hi>And the Lord bleſs thee.</hi> And ſo we read of pure Parents to
Bleſs their Children. And it hath been the Uſe of the
Church, to Bleſs the People. Therefore in all Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
where you meet with the Exerciſes of Religion,
you uſe to have a Bleſſing before you go; and you are
not to flight it: And except God call you out by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Occaſion, you are to abide and ſtay the Bleſſing.
We read of ſome that were appointed by God to ſtand
upon Mount <hi>Geriſim,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. and their work was
only to bleſs, to Bleſs the People; and there were ſome
who ſtood upon Mount <hi>Ebal,</hi> and they were to Curſe.
But now, Mark, If we ſearch who they are that are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to Bleſs, you ſhall find them to be more Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
than thoſe that were appointed to Curſe: For
thoſe that were appointed to Curſe, there was <hi>Reuben,</hi>
he had loſt his Birth-right, and <hi>Gad,</hi> and <hi>Aſhur,</hi> and
<hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Napthali,</hi> they were Children of the Hand-Maid;
they were not begotten in the way of Marriage,
but only by the Hand-Maid, or by a Concubine: Moſt
of theſe that were to ſtand upon Mount <hi>Ebal</hi> for Curſing,
they were of the meaner ſort of the Tribes. This notes
thus much, That Bleſſing is the chief work that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſhould Rejoyce and Delight in. Therefore though
they do ſometimes pronounce the Threats of God againſt
you, to awaken Secure, Drowſie Sinners, which is their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104282:74"/>
work likewiſe; yet certainly, there is nothing more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
unto the Heart of a Godly Miniſter, than to be
alwayes Bleſſing of his People, and to be bringing of
the Meſſage of Bleſſing unto them: And if this be ſo,
then certainly, the Miniſters of the Goſpel, they are a
great Bleſſing in the World. And you that are People,
you ſhould Encourage your Miniſters to Bleſs you,
and to Bleſs God for you; your Carriage towards
them ſhould be ſuch, as they may with Chearfulneſs
in the Name of God, Bleſs you; and they may in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
when they are between God and themſelves,
Bleſs God for you. O when as the Miniſter ſhall
firſt look upon the People, and Bleſs them in the Name
of God, and Bleſs God for them; and the People ſhall
look again upon the Miniſter, and pray to God for a
Bleſſing upon him, and Bleſs God that ever they knew
him: I ſay, happy is the Miniſter that thus Bleſſes, and
Bleſſes God for a People; and happy likewiſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that do thus pray for a Bleſſing upon, and Bleſs God
for a Miniſter. But more Bleſſed is that God, that ſhall
joyn ſuch Miniſters and People together: And that's the
Second Note. That Miniſters are to bleſs People when
they come among them.</p>
            <p>But,<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> Thirdly, Miniſters are to bring the Meſſage of
Peace to a People. The great Errand that a Miniſter of
the Goſpel comes about, it is to bring Peace; it is to
be a Meſſenger of Peace unto you: And indeed, the
Miniſtry of the Goſpel, doth many times bring outward
Peace unto a People. When was there ever a Kingdom
upon the Face of the Earth, that hath had longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of outward Peace, than <hi>England</hi> hath had? And
the Reaſon why our outward Peace is taken from the
Kingdom for the preſent, it is becauſe the Miniſtry of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104282:74"/>
the Goſpel hath been Rejected; and the Sword comes
to Avenge the Covenant of the Lord, it comes to Avenge
the Rejection of the Goſpel of Peace; and if we reject
the Goſpel of peace, God ſaith, we ſhall not have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace for our <hi>State:</hi> If we will not imbrace peace
for our Souls, we ſhall not have outward peace for our
Bodies. But though the Miniſtry of the Word bring
you outward peace many times, yet the main thing it
is to bring is Spiritual peace, <hi>Peace be to you.</hi> As if the
Apoſtles ſhould ſay, We are come unto you from the
Great God of gods, to be the Embaſſadors of peace for
your Souls, to Preach unto you the Doctrine of Peace
between God and you: This is the great Errand that we
come about; <hi>Peace be to you.</hi> And ſaith the Apoſtle,
To us is committed the Word of Reconciliation: That's
the great thing that is committed to Miniſters to Preach
to a People, the Word of Peace. The Work that they
are ſent about, it is to Treat between God and man, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Terms of peace: It is, I ſay, to Treat with your
Souls for peace, that you might come to have peace with
God, that a Bleſſed peace might be made between God
and you: This is the great Errand that they come about,
and whatſoever they Preach to you elſe, if it be to ſhew
you what your miſerable Condition is; yet it is in order
to this ſtill, To bring peace to your Souls. And indeed,
all Faithful Miniſters are careful of this, to ſhew at the
very firſt, what their Scope is; it is to bring them to Life
and Salvation: (But that in the next point:) But this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ought to be their Scope, whatſoever is Preached,
it muſt Aim at the great Treaty between God and their
Souls for Reconciliation. Our Scope, when we come to
Preach unto you, it is not ſo much to Civiliſe you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
againſt Notorious crying Sins, Drunkards, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104282:75"/>
Whore-Maſters, and Thieves, and Blaſphemers; though
according as we meet with theſe things in the Road, we
are to ſpeak againſt them. But ſuppoſe we ſhould cry
out againſt theſe ſins, this were good, and we had cauſe
to bleſs God for it: I, but we had not done our Work,
the great Work that we are to do, it is to Treat with
your Souls about peace with God; to ſhew you how the
Enmity that is between your Souls and God naturally,
is to be taken away; that ſo there may be a bleſſed Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
between God and you. This is the great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, unto a People; and
if this be the Errand of it, Then, what an Honourable
Work is this to ſet Man about? And the truth is, it is
in ſome regard a more Honourable Work, than ever An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
were ſent about: God doth not ſend the Angels
about this Work, to Treat with Mankind about Terms
of Peace with God. They are made Miniſtring Spirits,
for the good of Gods Elect, and are made by God to be
Executioners againſt Wicked men: But we never Read
that God hath committed the Word of Reconciliation
to Angels, God hath not appointed them to be the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Peace to People; therefore it is the moſt Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Work that ever Creature was ſet about, to come to
a place, and ſay, <hi>Peace be to this place, in the Name of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And being it is ſuch a Work as this, O how Deteſtable
and Vile, and Curſed, is Lazineſs or Idleneſs, in any
one that ſhould profeſs himſelf a Miniſter of the Goſpel!
What? Come about ſuch a Work as this, to be an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
of Reconciliation from the Great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth? O, he ſhould have his Heart and
Thoughts taken up about this! Night and Day he ſhould
be Studying how he ſhould Manage this great Work,
that God ſends him about to poor People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:104282:75"/>
And, O how acceptable ſhould the Miniſtry of the
Goſpel be unto you: You need not fear any hurt it will
do: It is but to Treat with your Souls about peace with
God, there's all that is intended in this Miniſtry. Do
not fear it, though things ſometimes are ſpoken that you
apprehend to be Terrible to you; yet all tend to this end,
To bring peace unto you. Therefore as the Prophet, in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 7. ſaith, <hi>How beautiful upon the Mountains are the
Feet of him that bringeth good Tidings, that publiſheth
peace.</hi> O his very Feet ſhould be beautiful in your Eyes,
This Scripture the Apoſtle doth quote, in <hi>Rom. 10. 15.
How ſhall they Preach except they be ſent? As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
How beautiful are the Feet of them that Preach the
Goſpel of Peace:</hi> Here it is, <hi>That bring good Tidings.</hi> So
indeed, the great Work of the Goſpel, it is nothing
elſe but a good Meſſage, good Tidings; and ſo our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
word is to the ſame effect, good News, good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.
And certainly, did People but underſtand what
the Scope of Chriſt were, to carry things about ſo in the
wayes of His Providence, to bring Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to Preach peace to their Souls: It could not be, but
they ſhould open their very hearts unto them. We read
of <hi>Noah,</hi> when he ſent forth his Dove, after the Ark had
been a long time upon the Waters, the Dove brings an
Olive Branch to the Ark; and <hi>Noah</hi> puts forth his hand
and takes in the Dove. The Miniſters of the Goſpel are
as this Dove, and they come with an Olive Leaf in their
Mouths; and they do not get it from the Wilderneſs, but
they take it from Paradice; they bring it from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
from thoſe Bleſſed things of the Goſpel, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the Word, and bring it to your Souls. Now
therefore you ſhould open your hearts, and take in the
bleſſed Meſſage of Peace and Reconciliation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:104282:76"/>
And then further, If ſo be that this be the great Work
of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, what a vile World is this
that can hardly bear with the Miniſters, nor Miniſtry of
the Goſpel, but accounts them to be great Diſturbers
of the places where they Live? So they did to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apoſtles: <hi>Eliſha, Art not thou the troubler of</hi>
Iſrael? And ſo of <hi>Paul, He was ſaid to be a Peſtilent fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</hi>
The Apoſtles were ſaid to turn the World up ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down.
And ſo <hi>Luther,</hi> he was ſaid to be the very Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of Rebellion; ſo he was called by Ungodly men.
It is not a New thing for the World to have ſuch an
Eſteem of Miniſters of the Goſpel: And what do they
do? It is only Preaching peace to the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>But, Laſtly, If this be ſo, That the Errand is to bring
Peace to your Souls: Then hence you Learn what you
are to come for, when you come to hear Sermons; you
hear that at ſuch a time there is ſuch a Sermon, or a new
Man there is come among you, and you come to hear
what he can ſay; or you hear that in ſuch or ſuch a place,
there is a very witty Man, and of Excellent parts; and
you come to hear what he can ſay: But alaſs, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
your own Souls all this while: You ſhould come
with a Diſpoſition of Spirit, I am now going to hear
the Doctrine of Peace between God and my Soul, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon the Miniſtry of Reconciliation this day. And
though the very word be not ſpoken of Peace, yet the
Word, that doth tend to the making peace between God
and my Soul. And indeed, when you feel the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel working of your Hearts into peace with
God, then hath it had the true genuine proper Effect
upon your Hearts, that God hath appointed it for. But
if you only ſhall ſit under the Miniſtry of the Word, and
it may be only Gain ſome further knowledge in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104282:76"/>
the things of Religion, that you never knew before, or be
inabled to Diſcourſe of ſomething in Divinity, more than
you could before: What's this to the Fruit of the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel? No: But can you ſay, Bleſſed be God, the
Lord hath made known to my Soul, what my Eſtate was
by Nature: The Lord hath opened to me, the Doctrine
of Reconciliation: The Lord hath ſhewn to my Soul, how
I am to make peace with God, and that in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of way than ever I thought of: I come now to ſee it to
be another manner of Miſtery of Godlineſs, than ever
I imagined before. Can you ſay ſo now? Hath the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
had this end of it upon your Hearts? O then, it hath
had the Effect that the Lord doth ſend it for. And
thus much for the Third Note of Obſervation, That the
Work of Miniſters is to bring Peace, the Meſſage of
Peace to People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. The Fourth Point is this, That the Miniſters
of the Goſpel are to offer Peace unto <hi>every</hi> one: For ſo
you have it, <hi>Into whatſoever Houſe ye enter, ſay Peace
be to it:</hi> Offer terms of Peace to it. If you come to a
place where there are the moſt Notorious ſinners of all,
yet offer peace to them: Though they be the moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
and Ungodly people that ſhould Live, yet offer
peace to them: Though they be Old ſinners that have
Liv'd a long time in moſt vile ſins, yet offer peace to
them: <hi>Into whatſoever Houſe you come,</hi> you have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to offer peace in the Name of God, even to them.
For, my Brethren, the Merit of Chriſt, it is of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
value, that we may (if we knew what the meaning
of that is) comfortably offer peace to the moſt Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
vile ſinners, that do Live upon the Face of the
Earth. We read of Chriſt, that He would have His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to go and Preach in the High-wayes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104282:77"/>
Saith Chriſt unto His Servants, <hi>Go your wayes into the
High-way, and as many as you ſhall find, bid to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
Into the High-wayes;</hi> to Note thoſe that were
the moſt Unlikely, the moſt Vile and Wicked, <hi>Go unto
them, and bid them to the Marriage.</hi> And in the laſt of
<hi>Mat. 15. Go</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>into all the World, and Preach
the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> They might ſay, Lord,
perhaps we ſhall meet with ſome that are moſt Notorious
Villains, and Blaſphemers, and Prophane and Ungodly
Creatures: Muſt we Preach the Goſpel to them? I, <hi>Go
and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> Into any place
whatſoever you come, you ſhall offer <hi>Peace unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I, but you will ſay, This may harden many in their
prophaneneſs,</p>
            <p>If God would have His Miniſters offer Peace to the
moſt prophane People that are:</p>
            <p>Then may ſome prophane one ſay, I hope we ſhall do
well enough then.</p>
            <p>To that, I anſwer, The Lord will venture this. The
Lord is ſo deſirous of Magnifying His Grace, to offer it
to thoſe that belong to His Election, as that He will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Hardning of other men: <hi>If they will be Hardned,</hi>
ſaith God, <hi>let them be Hardened.</hi> And ſo, Though a
Miniſter ought to be as Careful as he can to prevent all
Stumbling Blocks, yet, certainly, he is to Venter the
Hardning of many Hundreds, rather than not to Preach
the Goſpel of God to any one Soul: He ſhould more
regard the Offering of the Goſpel of Peace, in hope that
there are ſome few that belong to Gods Election, than
to fear the Hardning of many Hundreds. And if you
ſhould be Hardned by the offer of the Goſpel of Peace,
there could be no greater Brand of your Rejection, and
that will make it appear, that you are no ſuch <hi>Son of
Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:104282:77"/>
I, but then may ſome ſay, that are more Civil and
Fair, What if God ſend the Goſpel to the moſt prophane,
ſurely there is no queſtion but God will have mercy
upon us; for He doth appoint His Miniſters to offer the
Goſpel of peace to the worſt?</p>
            <p>I, but know what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That the Publicans and
Harlots did enter into the Kingdom of God, rather than
the Scribes and Phariſees.</hi> God offers to the worſt, yea,
many times makes it more effectual to the worſt, than
He doth to ſome that are more Fair and Civil in their
Converſations, becauſe, indeed, they do not ſee the need
that they have of Peace. I ſuppoſe you would think it
to be one of the moſt Hard and Harſh things in the
World, if you ſhould be told, that all of you naturally
were Enemies to God; and yet there is nothing more plain
in the Scripture than this. Now becauſe it is ſo hard to
convince Civil men of this, therefore they are not ſo ſoon
wrought upon as prophane ones are.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then, my Brethren, if this be ſo, it is an
Encouragement: Firſt to Miniſters, when they come to
any place, never to be troubled whatſoever people they
be, if he come to Preach to them, and offer the Goſpel
of Peace to them; for who knows, but thoſe that are
the Worſt and Vileſt ones, may come in and embrace
the Goſpel of Peace; may be Veſſels of Mercy,
and may hereafter ſtand and admire at the Riches of
Gods Goodneſs; and may live Eternally to Bleſs His
Name, for this bleſſed Peace that is made between their
Souls and Himſelf.</p>
            <p>And, Secondly, All you that do hear this Point, ſtand
for the preſent and admire at Gods Goodneſs, that ever
this ſhould be ſo, that ever you ſhould hear ſuch a Truth
as this is; that Chriſt would have His Miniſters offer
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104282:78"/>
Terms of Peace to the Worſt in the World. I ſay, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
at this Goodneſs of Chriſt, and eſpecially you that
are prophane ones, ſtand and wonder at the Goodneſs
of God; whereas He might have Curſt thee, and ſent
thee long ſince down to thine own place; yet He doth
give His Miniſters charge to offer peace to thy Soul.
Think thus, The Lord in this hath done more to me,
than He hath done to all thoſe Thouſand Millions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
that ſinn'd againſt Him. Thoſe that were once glorious
Angels, and did ſin againſt God, the Lord took Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
againſt them for their firſt ſin, and upon that caſt
them down into Chains of eternal Darkneſs; and did
reſolve that He would never ſo much as enter into a Plea
about any Condition of Peace with them to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This was the Way of God towards the Angels that
did ſin againſt Him, that are now Devils. O you that
think the Lord to be a God of Mercy altogether, do: but
conſider of this, and conſider to Tremble before Him, that
God ſhould take Advantage againſt Millions of Angels;
for ſo they were. For we read in Scripture, that Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Devils were in one man, and they were once
Angels, and they did but commit one ſin againſt God,
and the Lord would not Plea with them about Terms of
Peace. But mark now, The ſame God that was ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
againſt Angels, that were His own Creatures, as
well as thou, and were more glorious Creatures, and
committed but one ſin, yet would never enter into any
Terms of peace with them; this God is not only wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to Treat with thy Soul, to be at peace with thee;
but He ſends forth His Meſſengers unto thee to Treat in
His Name, and doth give them command, that when
they come to thee they ſhould offer Terms of peace to thy
Soul. Admire at this thou that haſt not been guilty
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104282:78"/>
of one ſin but of Thouſands; thou that haſt Liv'd like a
Monſter in the place where thou haſt Liv'd, and haſt
liv'd in Rebellion againſt the Lord; yet He doth give
Command to His Miniſters to offer peace to thee. I ſay,
ſtand and admire at this when thou goeſt Home, lay it
to thy Heart: O that the Great God ſhould ſo Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to me, rather than to Angels! He doth ſo this day,
and in His Name, I ſay, according to the Text: Peace
be to every Soul that ſhall yet come in and return, yet
come and repent; whatſoever they have been: whether
thou mayſt live to have any further offer of peace or no,
the Lord knows. It is an Offer that thou haſt this day,
Look to thy ſelf, come in, for there are many things in
the Text, that might put you on: <hi>For if there be not a
Son of Peace, this Peace will turn back again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 5. But the laſt Point of all is this, That Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the Goſpel are, when they come to a place,
to ſay, <hi>Firſt, Peace be to this place.</hi> It ſhould be the firſt
Meſſage that they ſhould declare; they ſhould begin
with this: And there is a great deal of Emphaſis in this
word, <hi>Firſt ſay.</hi> Firſt, So we read of <hi>John</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
his firſt Sermon was this, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand.</hi> And likewiſe, the Firſt Sermon
of Chriſt, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 16, 17. And again, the Apoſtles,
you ſhall read of them, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is at hand.</hi> The Firſt Sermon of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, of
Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles, was this, <hi>Repent, for the
Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> And the Firſt Sermon
that the Seventy Diſciples was to Preach, was Peace.
And in this the Lord deals with ſinners, according to
the Order He gave, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 10. The Lord required
that the Firſt thing the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould do,
when they came againſt a City, it was to proclaim peace.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:104282:79"/>
And we read of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Firſt thing that he did,
was to ſet up a Lamp, and his White Colours, and to
Proclaim, That whoſoever did come in before that Lamp
was out, ſhould have his Life and Peace. So when the
Lord ſends Miniſters of the Goſpel to any place, he ſets
up a Lamp in that place, and the Firſt thing that He
would have done, it is to Proclaim to all People to come
in, that ſo they might have Peace: And it is to be done
in the Firſt place.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Bowels of Gods Compaſſions are
very ſtrong, and Gods Mercy lies at His Heart upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
and therefore that is moſt ready, and He is moſt
ready to vent it: That's the moſt proper Work of God,
that He doth delight to Vent His Mercy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 24.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe that when the Offer of Peace is,
that hath a great deal of power to work upon the hearts of
People: Now the Lord therefore would have that done at
Firſt, that is like moſt to prevail. We know that People
at Firſt when a Miniſter comes amongſt them, they are ſet
upon Novelties; now it is good to take advantage of
that their Humour, and when they are hearkning after
Novelty, that they ſhould come to have ſome principal
Doctrine of Salvation to be ſecretly Inſtill'd into them,
that they ſhould Drink in that before they are aware.
So the Lord uſes to work upon Mens Self-love: Every
Creature loves it ſelf, and therefore the Lord ſees that
it is a good advantage to work upon Mens ſelf-love,
to offer terms of Peace. And the truth is, that is it
that gains the Heart of a Sinner: And God will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the World, and Devil, and Fleſh: <hi>What do they
offer any thing that may delight you,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I will
out-bid them all?</hi> Chriſt out-bids the World, and Devil,
in offering unto ſinners a greater Good than World, or
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104282:79"/>
Devil can poſſibly bring unto them. And indeed, this
offer of Peace doth out-bid the World; that is, doth
proffer a greater Good to a ſinner, than World or Devil
can poſſibly proffer to them. Nay then, ſaith the Soul,
if I ſee that I may have a greater good by Repenting and
Believing, than by going on in my ſin, I will go that
way; I will rather attend upon the Word: for I hear of
great things that are there, about Reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and man. Now this is the way to take the
Hearts of men, and it is the way to break them of their
ſtoutneſs and ſtubbornneſs: For certainly, every man
naturally, hath a very ſtout and ſtubborn Heart againſt
God. Therefore if <hi>Firſt</hi> he be oppoſed, he will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to riſe againſt God, and againſt His Truths, and
againſt His Servants. Therefore it is good to come <hi>Firſt</hi>
with thoſe things that their Hearts may cloſe with all,
that ſo they may be in a more preparation, that they
may hearken to what the Lord ſhall reveal after, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
unto them.</p>
            <p>But, you will ſay, If it be thus, Why is it then that
Miniſters do Preach ſo much of our miſerable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in which we are?</p>
            <p>The anſwer is, It's true, at Firſt there ſhould be a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of peace; and I make no queſtion, but you have had
it ſo here: But now it's true, before the full Doctrine of
Reconciliation with God is to be opened unto you, there
is ſomething to be opened unto you, about your miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtate by Nature; for it is impoſſible to open the
Doctrine of Peace and Reconciliation, without the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that: And that may well be Juſtified. That
though the Firſt thing ſhould be to ſay, <hi>Peace;</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this can be opened at large unto People, they muſt
come to know what their Natural ſtate is. There is
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:104282:80"/>
ſome that would at Firſt and at Laſt ſay, <hi>Peace;</hi> and would
have nothing elſe Preached, and crys out againſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any thing of the Law of God; which is meerly
through their Ignorance, in not rightly underſtanding
the Nature of the thing. For though at Firſt, we are
to open this Peace, yet when we come to open it, this
hath that in the very Bowels of it, that will ſhew the
moſt woful Condition of man by Nature, that poſſibly
can be. As for Inſtance, Peace between God and us:
Why, what are we Enemies? Is there an Enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and us? Yes, that comes here: We cannot
open the meaning of this Peace, but if we come once
to open it, we muſt of neceſſity fall upon the Doctrine
of Mans ſtate by Nature; and ſhew what a Breach ſin
hath made between God and the Soul: And what infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
need there is of ſuch a Redeemer, that we could
no other way be redeemed, but that we muſt have ſuch
a Saviour, that muſt be both God and Man. Now when
we come to open the Nature of this, it muſt needs ſhew
you what your miſerable Condition is by Nature.</p>
            <p>But a word or two for the Application of this:</p>
            <p>God doth appoint His Miniſters at Firſt to come to
you, and to make the proffer of Peace unto your Souls;
then it ſhould teach you preſently to be willing to come
and cloſe with that Meſſage. Gods Heart is ſofull of Mercy
towards you, as at the very Firſt He will have this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to you; then your hearts ſhould likewiſe come in
as well to God, and at the very Firſt come in and cloſe
with that bleſſed Offer of Grace and Mercy. O, it is
a great Encouragement to a Miniſter, when People come
in at the very Firſt offer. We have a notable Scripture
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104282:80"/>
for this, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 44. Mark, <hi>As ſoon as they hear of
Me, they ſhall obey Me.</hi> That's indeed a bleſſed thing,
that when a People comes to hear of Chriſt, and of the
Doctrine of Reconciliation, that as ſoon as they hear
of it, they ſhall come in preſently and Obey; that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
ſhall find his Firſt Labours to be Fruitful and Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.
I could tell you of one, as in <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 12. the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
And ſo I could ſay, That I knew one Twenty
Years ago, or more, that at the very Firſt day of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Doctrine of the Goſpel of that Truth unto a
People, at the Firſt day God pleaſed to bring in a Soul,
and continue him to this very day; and make him a
Godly, Gracious, and Holy man, that was a deſperate
and prophane wicked Wretch before. O that it might
pleaſe God to Incourage the Hearts of His Miniſters ſo,
that at their Firſt coming to People, they might find ſome
Fruit of their Labours: For one that is Faithful, and
comes among a People, he looks after his Miniſtry, and
conſiders what he doth, and what Effect that hath, and
ſo doth give account to God of what Effect that hath
upon the Hearts of People. And, O what an Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
is this, and how Honourable to a People, if
a Miniſter of God ſhall give up this account, and ſay,
Lord, as ſoon as ever thou didſt ſend me among ſuch a
People, they did begin to hearken after the Doctrine of
Peace, and began to Conſider what it was that was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
And they were exceedingly Hopeful by their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and by other wayes they have given exceeding
good hope, that they have received the Doctrine of
Peace, that Thou didſt ſend me about. And thoſe, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
are moſt to be Honoured, that do Firſt come
in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it's true, if men come in at the laſt Hour,
there is a poſſibility to get to Heaven: but thoſe that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104282:81"/>
come in at the Firſt, they are the moſt acceptable to
God, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7. beginning, <hi>My ſoul deſired the firſt ripe fruit.</hi>
So the Soul of God doth this day long after the Firſt
Fruits of every Miniſter, that comes among you: O, He
looks into this Congregation, to ſee where ſhall be the
Firſt Fruits of the Miniſtry of ſuch a one, and of ſuch a
one that comes among you, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. It is ſpoken
to the Honour of <hi>Epenetus, That he was the Firſt fruits of</hi>
Achaia <hi>unto Chriſt.</hi> O <hi>Epenetus,</hi> he is one that God did
Honour, for <hi>He was the Firſt fruits of</hi> Achaia <hi>unto
Chriſt.</hi> And it is the Honour of <hi>England,</hi> that it was
the Firſt Kingdom that profeſt Chriſtian Religion by the
Authority of the Publick Magiſtrate; and God hath ſome
ſpecial regard to <hi>England,</hi> to this very day, I make no
Queſtion, for that: And ſo in any place when God comes
to them, and offers the Conditions of Peace; I ſay,
they that come Firſt in upon this Firſt offer, will be moſt
acceptable unto God. Therefore do not defer, and
think I may come in at laſt; and before I die, time
enough: But if God be ſo timely with thy Soul, that
He would have His Miniſters ſo begin with thee, do
thou Anſwer to God, and begin with this God betimes,
and eſpecially you that are young ones, do not you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it. O when God ſhall come to thy Soul, and ſay,
<hi>Peace be to thee;</hi> I ſay, take heed of rejecting the Firſt
offer. For you that are young, what though you may
be guilty of much Vanity and Folly other wayes, yet
it may be you have not been guilty to this very day,
of rejecting the offer of the Goſpel: O take heed of
Contracting that guilt upon you! Know if you do, it
will make you a great deal harder, and that guilt will
be a great deal worſe, than of all your other ſins beſides;
therefore come in betimes, as we read in <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 17.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104282:81"/>
There comes a young man running to Chriſt, and ſaith,
<hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do to Inherit Eternal Life?</hi>
He was a young Rich man, a Gentleman, one that had
great Poſſeſſions; and the Text ſaith, he came running
to Chriſt. O that God would perſwade young ones,
and thoſe of Quality, ſeeing the Lord is pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with their Souls, that they would haſten, and come
running to Chriſt, to know what are the Terms of
Peace and Reconciliation; as it is ſaid concerning <hi>John</hi>
Baptiſt, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. The Text ſaith, <hi>And from the
dayes of</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt until now, the Kingdom of
Heaven, ſuffered violence, and the Violent take it by force.</hi>
The meaning is this, Becauſe that this great Doctrine
of, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> was
not Preached before <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt: He was the Firſt that
came to Preach this in the plainneſs of it in a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
way. Now ſaith the Text, <hi>And from the dayes of</hi>
John <hi>the Baptiſt until now, doth the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſuffer violence.</hi> O the Hearts of People were mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtirred, ever ſince the dayes of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt; and
why? Becauſe that he Preached, that <hi>The Kingdom of
Heaven is at hand.</hi> Now that conſiſts of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi>
and the Doctrine of Reconciliation between ſinners,
and the Bleſſed God; that indeed is the ſpecial part of
the Kingdom of Heaven. Now he Preaching this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, ſaith the Text, from that day the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven ſuffered Violence; and every one comes
to know, Lord what ſhall I do, that I may enter into
this Kingdom. O what a Bleſſed thing is it for Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
when the Lord ſhall ſend thoſe amongſt them,
to bring Peace between God and their Souls: That it
may ſaid, from ſuch a Day, from ſuch a Time, that the
Lord did ſend ſuch among them that opened this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:104282:82"/>
of Peace, <hi>That the Kingdom of Heaven hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
Violence.</hi> There hath many poor Souls come in
and ſaid, O Men and Brethren, What ſhall I do to be
ſaved. And Bleſſed are they upon whom the Tender
of the Goſpel ſhall have this Effect. Now if there be
any Sons of Peace here that ſhall entertain this, here's
the Bleſſing that is to be upon them: That the Peace of
the Goſpel ſhall reſt upon them, upon that Pariſh, upon
that Houſe, upon that Soul.</p>

            <p>That when God doth ſend the Miniſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to any place, there is hopes that there is ſome Sons
of Peace there.</p>
            <p>There may be hope to Miniſters and others, that they
ſhall find ſome that will entertain their Goſpel: In <hi>Acts
18. 9, 10. Then ſpake the Lord to</hi> Paul <hi>in the night, by a
Viſion, Be not afraid, but ſpeak, and hold not thy peace:
For I am with thee, and no man ſhall ſet on thee to hurt
thee: For I have much People in this City.</hi> When God
ſent <hi>Paul</hi> to Preach, there was a great deal of Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Well, ſaith God, for all that Oppoſition, you ſhall
Preach in this place: Why? <hi>For I have much People in
this City.</hi> So that when God by His Providence, ſhall
order the Word to come to any place, there is a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Argument at leaſt, that God hath People in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
In <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. Where you have Chriſt ſending of the
Apoſtles to Preach, He bids them in <hi>ver. 5. Go not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the way of the Gentiles, and into the Cities of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,
enter ye not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: <hi>But go rather to the
loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> As if Chriſt ſhould ſay,
As for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> I have yet
none to Call there; the time is to come for the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
to be Called: I would not therefore have you go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I would not have you loſe your Labour: <hi>But go
unto the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> There are
many of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that are as loſt Sheep, that
are wandering from God, and their own Happineſs: I
would have you go thither, ſaith Chriſt; thereby Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that there were ſome to be Call'd there, rather than in
the other place. The Miniſtry of the Goſpel, it is the
great Gift of Jeſus Chriſt, that He gave when He
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104282:83"/>
Aſcended on high: And to what end did He give it?
Mark, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12. to what end it is: <hi>And He gave
ſome Apoſtles: And ſome Prophets: And ſome Evangeliſts:
And ſome Paſtours and Teachers: For the perfecting of the
Saints:</hi> (So it is Tranſlated in your Books:) But the
Word in the Original is, <hi>For the Joynting of the Saints;</hi>
the putting of them into Joynt: At firſt, to put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt, (and then that they may grow up) <hi>For the Work
of the Miniſtry, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi>
For the Building up of the Body of Chriſt. And this
Text is quoted out of that Propheſie that we have in <hi>Pſal.
68. 18. Thou haſt aſcended on High, Thou haſt led Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
Captive, Thou haſt received Gifts for men,</hi> &amp;c. Here's
a Propheſie of Chriſt clearly: And the Apoſtle doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it in <hi>Epheſ. 4. Chriſt received Gifts for men,</hi> here it
is: And there it is, That He hath <hi>Diſpenſed Gifts to
Men.</hi> And mark, <hi>Yea, for the Rebellious alſo.</hi> Thoſe
Men that are the moſt Rebellious, yet Chriſt hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Gifts for them: What Gifts? The Miniſtry of the
Goſpel is the great Gift, that God the Father hath given
to Chriſt, and Jeſus Chriſt hath given it unto His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and ſends them among the Rebellious. And to
what end? That the Lord God might dwell among them.
So that by this it appears till God ſend the Miniſtry of
the Word among a People, the Lord God doth not dwell
there; for it is, <hi>That the Lord God might dwell among
them.</hi> They are without God in the World, but when
that comes unto a place, then the Lord God comes to
Dwell among them. So that then, you ſee the Point
clear by Scripture, when the Lord ſends the Miniſtry of
the Goſpel, there is ſome hope that there is ſome good
intended for ſome in that place.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſons are theſe,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> 1. Becauſe Chriſt ſends His
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104282:84"/>
Miniſters, according as His Father ſent Him. Now thus
we have it in <hi>John 20. 21. Then ſaid Jeſus to them
again, Peace be unto you; as my Father hath ſent me, even
ſo ſend I you.</hi> Mark, As God the Father ſends Chriſt,
ſo Chriſt ſends Miniſters. Well, How doth God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſend Chriſt? Compare this Scripture with <hi>John
3.</hi> 17. Thus God the Father ſends His Son, He doth
not ſend His Son into the World that He might Condemn
the World: That is not Gods primary End to Condemn
the World, but that that God doth Aim at, in ſending
His Son into the World, it is, that by Him the World
may be ſaved. Now then compare this Scripture with
that other; ſaith Chriſt, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend
I you.</hi> Now my Father ſent Me into the World, not to
Condemn the World, though by accident the World
ſhall be Condemned, the rather becauſe of Chriſts come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among them, and they refuſing Him: But this is the
Scope of my Fathers ſending of Me into the World, that
by Me the World may be Saved; and ſo do I ſend you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I ſend you to Places, not to Condemn them; not to Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
their Sin and their Condemnation: That is not
my primary Intention, though this may fall out; but I
ſend you to a place, that through your Miniſtry, Souls
in that place may come to be Saved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. A ſecond Reaſon is, from the Promiſe of
Chriſt unto His Miniſters, when they go to any place to
Preach. In the laſt words of the Goſpel by Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
Chriſt ſends them to Preach; and ſaith He, <hi>Lo,
I am with you alwayes, even unto the end of the World;
I am with you to Aſſiſt you, and to Bleſs you whitherſoever
you go, even to the end of the World.</hi> That is, with you,
and with all that ſhall ſucceed you to Preach this Goſpel
in any place, unto the end of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:104282:84"/>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Further, We know that the Goſpel, it is the
Arm of God, <hi>Iſa. 53. 1. Who hath believed our Report,
and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed.</hi> And
<hi>Rom. 1. 16. It is the Power of God unto Salvation.</hi> And
if God Arm, and Gods Power unto Salvation come
among a People, there is hopes that there is an Intention
of ſome Good unto ſome of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. The Preaching of the Goſpel: It brings the
Day of Grace and of Salvation, to any place whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it comes; and ſo long as that doth continue to any
place, ſo long the day of Grace and Salvation continues
to the place. This you have clearly, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 6. begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>We then as Workers together with Him, beſeech you
alſo, that ye receive not the Grace of God in vain. For
He ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the
day of Salvation have I ſuccoured thee: Behold, NOW
is the accepted time, behold, NOW is the day of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now:</hi> When was that <hi>Now?</hi> That was, when the
Apoſtles came and Preached among them, the Doctrine
of Reconciliation: <hi>Now is the accepted time, Now is the
day of Salvation.</hi> Now if you come in, you may be
accepted: Now is the time, that if you be appointed
to be Sav'd, you muſt come in now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. And this Scripture doth put me upon a Fifth
Reaſon of the Point, and that is: That when the Goſpel
comes to be Preached to a place, it doth not only make
an Accepted time, and a day of Salvation: But it is the
Fruit of the Prayer of Jeſus Chriſt, even of that
Prayer that Chriſt hath made to God the Father,
that He would in ſuch a time ſend the Miniſtry of the
Goſpel, to be clearly and powerfully Taught in that
place. And if you ask me where the place is that doth
prove it, it is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 8. You have there almoſt the very
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104282:85"/>
ſome words that you have here: <hi>Thus,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>In
an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
have I helped thee.</hi> Now this is clearly meant of
Chriſt, if you look both unto the Coherence of the
words, with what hath been before, and that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
after: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>I will preſerve thee, and give
thee for a Covenant of the People, to Eſtabliſh the Earth,
to cauſe to Inherit the deſolate Heritages.</hi> Now ſaith God
concerning Chriſt: Thus, ſaith the Lord, <hi>In an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
time have I heard thee.</hi> What is that acceptable
time? It is that which the Apoſtle doth Interpret to be,
<hi>A day of Salvation.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of an accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Time, and of a day of Salvation; and ſaith he,
<hi>Now it is.</hi> Now while we are Preaching the glad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the Goſpel unto you. And here, ſaith the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt, <hi>The Lord hath heard thee in an acceptable time,
and in a day of Salvation.</hi> That is, When as Jeſus Chriſt
did Pray to God the Father, for His Church that ſhould
be; that God would ſend the Miniſtry of the Goſpel,
unto thoſe whom the Father had given unto Him from
all Eternity: I ſay, Jeſus Chriſt did Pray unto the Father
for them. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I have heard thy Prayer, and
I have granted what thou Prayeſt for.</hi> And this hearing
of thy Prayer, it is an acceptable Time, and it is a day
of Salvation. Thou haſt a day of Salvation according
to thy prayer; and this very day the Apoſtle doth
Interpret of ſending the Goſpel unto any place: So that
where the Goſpel comes, it is not to be lookt upon as a
thing that comes meerly by Accident, or by an ordinary
Providence of God, as other things; but it is that that
comes unto a place by Virtue of the Prayer of Jeſus
Chriſt, of the Interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that particular Place, or Town, or Pariſh.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104282:85"/>
And this is the Reaſon why the Lord leaves ſome places
deſtitute of Help, in Ignorance and Darkneſs, that they
ſcarce ever come to hear of Jeſus Chriſt: And others
that it may be are in themſelves as unworthy as the other;
they come to have the great things of the Goſpel open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them: The reaſon of the difference is, Jeſus Chriſt
hath Interceeded before the Father for the one, and not
for the other; and one is the Fruit of the Prayer of
Jeſus Chriſt, and the other Chriſt hath let go, becauſe
they do not ſo belong unto Him: He hath not thoſe
among them, that are to be made the <hi>Sons of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Yet further, When the Goſpel comes to a
place, there is hope of Good, becauſe that the Goſpel
hath in it ſelf ſo much power. I ſay, it is not only as
an Ordinance to convey the Word of God. But though
Mans Words and Miniſtry hath little in it, yet the Truths
of the Goſpel, they have in them a mighty Strength;
there are ſuch wonderful things that the Goſpel doth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
whereſoever it comes, that one would wonder that
the Hearts of all People ſhould not be taken with it.
Yea, there are ſuch things that are made known in the
Goſpel, that one would think might break the Heart of
any Devil in Hell. That if God ſhould ſend the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
unto the Devils (if they were not gone Irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly)
one would think that what is made known in the
Goſpel, might break the heart of a Devil. O that God
ſhould be Reconcil'd to Man! To ſend His own Son to
Die for baſe Worms, upon whom the Lord might have
Glorified His Infinite Juſtice upon to all Eternity. There
is that in the Goſpel, that it is to Admiration, that all
People do not come in unto it. What doth Chriſt ſay,
<hi>If the Son of Peace.</hi> It is a wonder that all do not come
in to Imbrace the Bleſſed Goſpel. The Patience of God
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104282:86"/>
doth Lead to Repentance; Then what might the Grace
of God do, that is held out in the Goſpel? The Lord doth
reveal ſuch Arguments to draw People, that to ſpeak af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of Men, we may conceive: That if the
Lord ſhould have Studied and Contriv'd with His own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Wiſdom, what ſtrong Arguments He would uſe to
work upon the Hearts of the Children of Men; one would
not have imagined how an Infinite Wiſdom, ſhould have
found out ſuch to perſwade Men to come in. One may ſay
of the Arguments of the Goſpel, as the Maſter of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
ſaid, when he had Let out his Vineyard to Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and ſent for Fruit; one Servant was beaten, and
the other was miſuſed: <hi>But at laſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will ſend
my Son, for ſurely they will reverence my Son.</hi> Why now,
this may be ſaid of other Arguments. To compare
thoſe things that are in the Goſpel, with all other things
that can be Preached unto People: Indeed a Miniſter of
God may come with many ſtrong Arguments, to draw
the Hearts of People from their ſin, and to draw them
unto Repentance. But now, this Argument will not do
it, nor the other Argument will not do it; they ſtand
out this and that Argument: I, but ſaith the Lord, I will
ſend the Miniſtry of my Goſpel among them, I'll reveal
my Son unto them. Certainly, they will Reverence this
Argument, and their Hearts will be taken with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
That's another Reaſon why there is great
hopes, when the Miniſtry of the Goſpel comes, that there
ſhould be ſome Sons of Peace found there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. Further, Another is this, Becauſe it is the
Way of God with a People, when He ſends them the
Goſpel in the Power of it, and the Clearneſs of it: I ſay,
the Way of God then, is not ſo much to have regard to
any of their ſins, that ever were Committed before that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104282:86"/>
time, but now to go as it were upon a new Score: I do
not ſay, but if they ſhould periſh, then they muſt periſh
for their old ſins too: But I mean thus, That when the
Lord ſends the Miniſtry of the Goſpel to a place, the
Lord now doth not ſo much look at any ſin that they liv'd
in before, in the dayes of their Ignorance; there is none
of thoſe ſins now that ſhall Damn them, upon condition
that they now do Imbrace the Goſpel that is offered to
them: Therefore there is a great deal of hope, that there
may be ſome Sons of Peace: For the Riches of Gods
Mercy hath not yet had the Glory; the Turn as it were of
it towards this People, that yet have not had the Goſpel
in the Clearneſs, and in the Power of it brought amongſt
them. Now God looks thus upon a People, that He
ſends His Goſpel unto. It's true, they have liv'd in Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
in Darkneſs, in Prophaneneſs, in Sabboth-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in Ungodlineſs: Alas, they did not know what the
Councels of my Will were, concerning the Eternal ſtate
of their Souls, which is revealed in that Goſpel of Mine.
They knew no better things that to Eat and Drink, and
make proviſion for the Fleſh, therefore for all that time
of their Ignorance, I will not regard, I will Wink at it.
But now God Calls for Repentance: So you find it in
<hi>Acts 17. 30. And the times of this Ignorance God Winked
at, but now God Calleth all men every where to Repent.</hi> As
if the Lord ſhould ſay, As for the times of your Ignorance,
though you were very Prophane, very Superſtitious, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Ungodly, yet I am content to Wink at it; but now
I am content to go, as it were, upon a new Score. Now
come in and Repent, and your Souls ſhall live. Now, my
Brethren, when Mercy comes to have a Turn towards a
People, who knows what may be done. As thus, Now
ſuppoſe that a Man hath lain Sick a long time, and his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104282:87"/>
Sickneſs increaſes upon him, and it is very dangerous:
If you ſhould come to ſuch a Man, and ſay, What means
have you uſed? What Phiſicians have you had? Now
it appears that he hath not uſed ſuch a Medicine that is
Soveraign for ſuch a Diſeaſe, it hath not been tried; now
if that Medicine hath not been uſed, you will have a
great deal of hope concerning the Life of your Friend,
until it be tried, and you ſee it doth no good, that it
makes no alteration upon the body of your Friend. So
it is here, People that have liv'd Prophanely, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlily,
and their Hearts have not been brought to God.
I, but what hath God revealed his Grace in Chriſt unto
their Souls? Have they known the Bleſſed things of the
Goſpel? If not, there may be a great deal of hope:
For when Gods Mercy ſhall come to have its Turn upon
this People, it's very like there are many, whom God
intends Everlaſting good unto. But now to wind up this
Point in a word of Application.</p>
            <p>If this be ſo,<note place="margin">Appl.</note> O do not fruſtrate Hope! There are
hopes that God intends Mercy to a People, when He
ſends the Goſpel to be Preached to them at any time;
though they may ſay, we have had it Preached to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
Yet if He ſends it a-freſh, it ſeems that Mercy muſt
have the ſecond Turn to this People. I ſay now, do not
fruſtrate Hope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Hope of God Himſelf.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, The Hope of God, why, God knows
whether it will work upon People, yea or no; and that
cannot be Fruſtrated.</p>
            <p>But for the Anſwer to that, We are to know, that God
is pleaſed in Scripture, to Speak after the manner of Men,
and God Himſelf doth Speak after this manner, as if He
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:104282:87"/>
had ſome good hopes that People would be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when He ſends His Miniſters among them. As that
place which I named before, <hi>I will ſend my Son, ſurely
they will reverence him:</hi> I hope that will prevail. And
a ſuitable place we have of Gods expreſſing himſelf after
this manner, in <hi>Jer. 36. 2, 3. Take thee a Roll of a Book,
and Write therein all the Words that I have ſpoken unto thee
againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and againſt</hi> Judah, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>It may be</hi> (ſaith
God) <hi>that the Houſe of Judah will hear all the evil that
I purpoſe unto them.</hi> Go your way and preach ſaith God
unto the Prophet, it may be they will hear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
every Man from his evil way. This was not now
the Miniſtery of the Goſpel but of Threatings; and yet
God ſpeaks with ſome expectation, as if ſo be he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that they ſhould; it may be they will, ſaith God. And
ſo in <hi>Zeph. 3. 7. I ſaid, ſurely thou wilt fear me, thou
wilt receive Inſtruction, ſo their dwelling ſhould not be cut
off; howſoever I puniſhed them, but they roſe early, and
corrupted all their doings:</hi> God was fruſtrated in his
Expectation; <hi>yet I ſaid, ſurely thou wilt fear me.</hi> Thus
the Lord, though he knows all his works from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
yet he ſpeaks after the manner of Men; and ſaith,
ſurely ſuch and ſuch means may do good upon ſuch
and ſuch people: O therefore, let not the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lord be fruſtrated; and let not the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Miniſters of the Goſpel be fruſtrated. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
when they come to any place, they are to come
with their hearts filled with hope, that there are Sons
of Peace in that place; and there is nothing that can
incourage a faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel to ſpend
his time in Studying, and Opening of the Myſteries of
Grace more then this; that he comes with his Heart
filled with hope, that there are ſome Sons of Peace
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104282:88"/>
in that place. O do not fruſtrate this expectation.
It is a vile thing for the Miniſters of the Goſpel to
come to any place, but to gain Sons of Peace: And
indeed upon this expectation the heart of a faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
who underſtands what the meaning of Peace with
God is, cannot but be drawn forth towards a People;
why he comes with this expectation, and he looks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Miniſtery to ſee what becomes of it. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do not fruſtrate the Expectations of your Miniſters
in this: Do not give them occaſion to make their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
that they have ſpent their Strength in vain.</p>
            <p>Yea, and further, As it is the Expectation of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
that Preach, ſo it is the Expectation of all the
Saints of God. None of Gods People that know a
place that hath Liv'd in Darkneſs and Blindneſs before,
but if they ſee the Lord by His Providence, carrying the
Miniſtry of the Goſpel with Power in that place, they
think thus with themſelves, Whom is it that the Lord
intends good unto? Surely the Lord hath a Mercy to ſuch
a People. And they will wait to ſee who it is that God
will pitch upon.</p>
            <p>O likewiſe, Do not fruſtrate the Expectation that the
Angels themſelves, in <hi>1 Cor.</hi> 11. a place, I ſuppoſe you
know, where the Women are to be Covered, becauſe of
the Angels: It doth appear by that Text, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are in Congregations, when a Congregation is met
together to hear the Word of God Preached, and for
other Accounts, there the Angels are Met; And I make
no queſtion, but this place is as full of Angels as of Men,
and they are here preſent, and do look upon our Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and wait for the time when God will be pleaſed
to Work upon the Hearts of ſome or other. O to what
Family, to what particular Soul doth God intend good
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104282:88"/>
unto. O that we might know it, that we might have
Joy in Heaven: For ſo the Scripture tells us, That at
the Converſion of ſinners, there is Joy in Heaven, and
ſurely they wait for it. O that we might ſee the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the Goſpel work effectually upon Souls, that ſo
we might joy for it.</p>
            <p>And now let every particular Soul reaſon thus with it
ſelf: What is it ſo, that there is hope that there may be
ſome <hi>Sons of Peace;</hi> why may it not be I, though vile,
though a very wretched Creature? Yet I hear that the
time of Ignorance God winks at, only now He calls
to Repent: If I feel God beginning to jogg my Heart
now, I may be the Man or Woman, that the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
from all Eternity. For we are to know, that
which God doth now in time, is no other than He did
determine from Eternity: And I ſay, if you feel your
Hearts ſtirred, and wrought upon by the Miniſtry of
the Goſpel, you may know that God did intend you in
particular. And Chriſt, when He did Pray to God the
Father for this acceptable time, that you were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
intended in that Prayer of His; and you are not
excluded to be ſaved any more than any, and therefore
it may fall upon you. Perhaps in a Family, it may fall
upon the poor Servant, or Child, and the others may be
left: But ſome or other it is like, it will fall upon.</p>
            <p>And, my Brethren, If this be ſo, if there be hopes
when the Goſpel comes to be Preached, that there are
<hi>Sons of Peace</hi> in that place, it is a moſt Curſed thing for
any to ſtand to oppoſe the Goſpel, when it comes to any
place. It is very ſeldom but ſome or other will be Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Crying out againſt it: But take heed what thou
doſt, Wilt thou ſtand againſt God, to croſs God in
ſuch a bleſſed End as this is? It may be the Lord hath
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104282:89"/>
ſome Souls in that place, He intends Eternal good unto:
And wilt thou ſtand out againſt that, and croſs God?
But eſpecially take heed you do not oppoſe the Goſpel,
in any place where there is not only a remote hopes, but
it comes to be Nearer and Fuller than it was before, and
there is ſome real Manifeſtation that God intends Good
unto ſome: O take heed of thy Oppoſition of it there.
This was the Reaſon that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo mightily provok'd,
when <hi>Elimas</hi> came to reſiſt his Miniſtry; of which you
may read in <hi>Acts 13. There was one</hi> Sergius Paulus, <hi>which
ſent for</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>and deſired to hear the Word
of God.</hi> Now this <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> was a Chief Man in
the place where <hi>Paul</hi> Preached, he was the Deputy, and
there was good hopes that God would Convert his Soul.
<hi>And</hi> Elimas <hi>the Sorcerer, he ſtood and oppoſed, and ſought
to turn away the Deputy from the Faith.</hi> Now when <hi>Paul</hi>
was in ſo good a hope that he ſhould gain not only a Soul,
but a publick Man, that might do a great deal of good:
O the Spirit of <hi>Paul</hi> was mightily provok'd! He looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Elimas,</hi> and ſets his Eyes upon him (the Text ſaith) and
and ſaid: <hi>O full of all Subtilty, and all Miſchief, thou
Child of the Devil, thou Enemy of all Righteouſneſs, wilt
thou not ceaſe to pervert the Right Wayes of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi>
was a Man of a very Quiet and Meek Spirit, and yet
mark how full of Paſſion he was at this time: O this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd
the Spirit of <hi>Paul,</hi> he was not able to bear it. We
never read that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo troubled when they Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
him, when they put him into Priſon: But as if
<hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay, Do with me what you will, put me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Priſon, do what you will with my Carcaſs; but do
not fruſtrate my Expectation in Gaining a Chief Man,
that may do a great deal of Service for God. When he
was but in fear that he ſhould be fruſtrated of his hope,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104282:89"/>
he was not able to bear it. And certainly, nothing can
go ſo near to the Heart of any Faithful Miniſter, as that
there ſhould be any to ſtand to fruſtrate his hope of
Gaining of Souls. Perhaps in a Family, if one or two
doth but go to hear the Word, the others will be Scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Jeering; and one Neighbour will be Scorning
at another, and all to fruſtrate the Hopes of God, of
His Miniſters, and of the Saints and Angels. But know,
when thou do'ſt any thing to oppoſe the Miniſtry of the
Goſpel, thou do'ſt ſet thy ſelf what in thee lies, both to
fruſtrate the Hopes of God and His Miniſters, and His
Saints and Angels; and thou wilt find this to be a
hard work, thou do'ſt but Kick againſt the Pricks. And
thus much for this Point, we come now unto the next.</p>
            <p>That good Hearers of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Doct. 2</note> are called the Sons
of Peace: <hi>If the Son of Peace be there.</hi> They are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called, <hi>The Children of the Kingdom,</hi> as in <hi>Mat.
13.</hi> there they have that Title given unto them. Thoſe
that are good Hearers of the Word, in the Parable that
you have about the Seed.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that Imbrace the Goſpel, and are the good
Hearers of it, they are the <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> and that in a
Five-fold regard:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe they are ſuch as are ordained to Peace,
as the Son of Perdition, one that is appointed to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are thoſe that do attend upon the
Goſpel of Peace, as in <hi>Mark 2. 19. The Children of the
Bride-Chamber,</hi> thoſe that do attend upon the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe they are Obedient unto the Goſpel:
As the Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> are Sons of Wickedneſs; ſo the
Sons of Peace, ſuch as yield Obedience unto the Goſpel
of Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:104282:90"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Sons of Peace, becauſe they are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Becauſe they are ſuch as ſhall Inherit the Peace
of the Goſpel, therefore <hi>Sons of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is ſomewhat that every one of theſe may afford
unto us, but I take the firſt Three are principally meant;
therefore of the other I ſhall ſpeak of but a little by the
way.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is, Becauſe they are appointed unto that
Benefit of the Goſpel of Peace: So that from thence the
Point is this:</p>
            <p>That all thoſe that are good Hearers,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel that comes to any
place, they are ſuch as are appointed from all Eternity
to enjoy the Peace of the Goſpel. <hi>Judas</hi> was not more
a Son of Perdition, than ſuch a one is a Son of Peace.
That is, There was no more Evidence that <hi>Judas</hi> was
appointed to Eternal perdition, than there is certain Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that ſuch a one is appointed from all Eternity to
enjoy the Benefit of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give you theſe two Scriptures for it, the firſt is
in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. latter end, <hi>And the Lord added to the Church,</hi>
(that is, Converted to Himſelf, made His Goſpel effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual)
<hi>daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved;</hi> ſuch as were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be Saved. And another Scripture there is,
which ſaith, <hi>That all thoſe which were ordained to Eternal
Life, believed.</hi> But above all, I will give you this one
Scripture, in <hi>1 Theſ.</hi> it is a moſt excellent Text for this
purpoſe, and a mighty Encouraging Text to all thoſe,
that ſhall be found good Hearers of the Goſpel: <hi>Chap. 1.
4, 5. Knowing, Brethren beloved, your Election of God.</hi>
We know that you are thoſe whom God hath Eternally
Elected: How do you know that? Were you in the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104282:90"/>
Counſel of God, in Gods Treaſury, to know what His
Thoughts were: How can you tell the Election of
God? Mark, The Words following doth give you the
Reaſon for what He ſaith, knowing your Election of
God: <hi>For our Goſpel came not unto you in Word only,
but alſo in Power.</hi> Indeed when the Goſpel comes to a
place, if it comes in Word only unto a Congregation,
they come indeed to hear, and flock to hear what a
Man can ſay; This is no Argument of a Mans Election:
but when it comes not only in Word but in Power, when
you begin to feel the Power of the Word upon your
Hearts. Though you come, it may be, at firſt out of
Curioſity and Novelty, and took notice of nothing
that would be done; but when you came there, the
Goſpel took hold upon your Spirits, and over-powered
your Hearts. Now by that you may know, that you
are one that are appointed unto the Benefit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of Peace, that you are Elected of God. Thoſe
Souls that feel the Power of the Goſpel upon them, may
know certainly that they were Elected from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
As if God ſhould Speak from Heaven, and ſay,
Such a Man or Woman, they are Elected from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
we may now as well doubt of that Voice, as we
may doubt of a Man or Woman, that hath the power
of the Goſpel upon their Hearts: So that is appears by
this Text, that where there are good Hearers of the
Goſpel, they are the <hi>Sons of Peace;</hi> that is, appointed
for all Eternity to have the benefit of Peace. And there
are theſe particulars in this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They may know that the Lord had Thoughts
upon them in particular, before the World was; yea,
that the Lord, when He ſaw the great Lump of Mankind
before Him, He ſet apart theſe for the Praiſe of His
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104282:91"/>
Grace in Chriſt for ever: Left others, and ſet apart
theſe.</p>
            <p>Yea, They may know, that there were Tranſactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Father and the Son, about their Souls in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
from all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Yea, you may further know, That God the Father
did give them unto His Son from Everlaſting: For ſo
Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That thoſe come to Him, whom the Father
hath given Him.</hi> There are a certain Number, that
God the Father hath given to Jeſus Chriſt, to Redeem
from all Eternity; and ſaid to Him, <hi>Son, take theſe Souls,
and do you undertake for them:</hi> And He hath made Anſwer,
<hi>Father, I do undertake to Satisfie Thy Wrath and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
for them.</hi> Now were it not a bleſſed thing to
know, that when there were ſuch Tranſactions between
the Father and the Son, that thou wert mentioned in
particular, that God the Father did give thee by Name
to His Son. Certainly, if thou beeſt an Entertainer of
the Goſpel, thou mayeſt be certain of this thing.</p>
            <p>Further, Thou mayſt know this; As God the Father
did give thee to His Son, ſo He did make a Promiſe to
ſave thee. There was a Covenant between the Father
and the Son for thy Salvation, according to that Text
in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. That Scripture ſpeaks of a Promiſe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life before the World began: How could there
be a Promiſe before the World began? To whom could
it be made? When there is a Promiſe made, there muſt
be ſome body to receive it? Surely it was: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
was between the Father and the Son, from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
concerning thy Soul in particular.</p>
            <p>Yea, and further, Thou may'ſt know, That when God
did ſend His Son to take Mans Nature upon Him, He
ſent Him into the World, to have a care of thy Soul, as
well as any others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:104282:91"/>
Yea, and further, That when God did from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
appoint, that at ſuch a time and place, ſuch means
ſhould be for good; that He did likewiſe Aim at thee.
And indeed, many may ſee the Work of God wonderful
this way. Thus thoſe that are good Hearers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
they are the <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> in this Firſt regard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are appointed by God, unto the Benefit of
the Peace of the Goſpel, from all Eternity. And it
may be a mighty Encouragement unto thoſe, who do
begin to feel the Goſpel to be powerful upon their
Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other is, <hi>A Son of Peace,</hi> that doth
attend upon the Goſpel. That is, when the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel doth come, he doth make it his care to
make preparation for it; he doth come to hear the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
as a matter of great Moment; and when he doth
come to hear, he doth bend his whole Soul to attend
to what is heard, and he dares not give liberty to the
wandering of his Thoughts: And he doth charge his
Memory with ſuch and ſuch truths, to think of theſe
whatſoever he doth forget. And here's now a <hi>Son of
Peace;</hi> as the Children of the Bride-Chamber, they are
ſuch as do attend there: So he, <hi>A Son of Peace,</hi> attends
upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. Now by this Second,
thou mayſt know the Firſt; thou mayſt know whither
thou beeſt a Son: That is, whither thou beeſt one that
from all Eternity, wert ſet apart by God the Father, to
obtain the Peace and Benefits of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Son of the Goſpel, is to be as an
Obedient Child: To come with a Reſolution, when
he comes to hear the Word, Whatſoever the Lord
ſhall this day make known of his Mind unto me, the
Lord knows, that I would fain yield unto it. I come
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104282:92"/>
with this Reſolution, every time I come to hear the
Miniſtry of the Goſpel: This is now a <hi>Son of Peace,</hi>
that comes with ſuch a Heart, reſolved to be Obedient
unto it.</p>
            <p>2. He doth open his Underſtanding, and is eaſily
Convinc'd of thoſe Truths, that he doth hear Revealed
in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, he doth not ſtand Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of them.</p>
            <p>3. He doth open his Heart, to accept of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Covenant; when the Lord Reveals the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Covenant of Life and Peace, the Soul doth
open it ſelf, to admit of the Conditions of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Lord Speak, thy Servant hears: Reveal what
Thou wilt, my Soul is here ready and willing, to accept
of the Covenant whatever it be.</p>
            <p>Further, He doth give up himſelf to be Moulded by
the Goſpel, according to that Phraſe, in <hi>Rom. 6. 17.
The Doctrine into which ye were delivered.</hi> So it is in
the Original, that is, There is a delivering of the Soul
up to the Miniſtry of the Word, as the Mettle is to the
Mould, to be Faſhioned by it. So here, a <hi>Son of Peace</hi>
doth give up his Soul to be Moulded by the Word;
whatſoever he was before, yet here he is now ready to
give up his Soul to be Faſhioned, to be Framed by the
Word. Here's a <hi>Son of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, He doth in his Converſation, Act what he
doth hear in the Miniſtry of the Word; and he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to Live according to the glorious Goſpel that
he doth hear, and he doth Labour to become the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
So that one may know in ſuch a ones Family, and
in ſuch a ones Life, a mighty deal of Alteration.</p>
            <p>And again, Such a one as is Begotten by it, is not
only Obedient, but indeed, there is the work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104282:92"/>
wrought, and therefore he may be called a Son,
ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I have Begotten you by the Goſpel.</hi>
And ſo, by the Word of Truth, you are Begotten.
Abundance of Scriptures might be for this: Thoſe that
the Goſpel works Savingly upon, the Goſpel doth not
only ſtir their Hearts, but put a new Life into them.
They live by new Principles, by new Rules; they find
a mighty Power in the Goſpel to Beget them again: And
ſuch as theſe are, are Sons, becauſe they are Heirs of the
Goſpel, Children of the Kingdom. But that we ſhall
have more uſe of in the other place, when we ſpeak of
the Bleſſing of the Goſpel that ſhall be upon them.</p>
            <p>Now to Apply theſe in a few words.<note place="margin">Appl.</note> The good Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Goſpel, are the <hi>Sons of Peace.</hi> O what a
bleſſed thing it is, to be the <hi>Sons of Peace!</hi> Better to be
the Son of Peace, than a Monarch, than of the greateſt of
the World; better to be this Son of Peace, than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
all the World. If the Lord ſhould give thee the
Inheritance of all the World, He doth not do ſo much for
thee, as when He makes thee to be a <hi>Son of Peace.</hi> It
may be many of you were Born very mean, and you are
like to Inherit but little of this World; but if the Lord
work upon your Hearts in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel,
that which comes by this, makes you bleſſed Creatures
for ever: For by this means, you come to be the Sons of the
Living God: You come to be the Children of Life, and
Co-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt. O how Induſtrious ſhould
Miniſters of the Goſpel be, to Beget ſuch Sons of Peace to
God. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. he tells the <hi>Galatians</hi> there,
that he did Labour and Travel in Birth, till Chriſt was
formed in them: <hi>My little Children of whom I Travel in
Birth again, until Chriſt be formed in you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> A Faithful
Miniſter of the Goſpel doth even Travel in Birth, that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104282:93"/>
he might beget <hi>Sons of Peace</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt. And, O
the Bleſſedneſs of this Work, for God to ſet Men on
Earth to this Work, to Beget Sons of Peace. If we
ſhould Beget you to be Children of the Bond-woman,
it were ſomewhat; that is, to ſtrike fear into your Hears
by the Terror of the Law: I, but to Beget you to be
Children of Peace, and of the Free-woman; this is a
great deal more. This is ſuch a Work, as it is that which
doth ſatisfies the Soul of Jeſus Chriſt when He ſees it: It
ſatisfie His Soul for all His Sufferings: As in <hi>Iſa. 53.
10, 11. Yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe Him:</hi> That is,
It pleaſed God the Father, to bruiſe Jeſus Chriſt. For
this is an Evangelical Chapter. <hi>When thou ſhalt make
His Soul an Offering for ſin.</hi> Mark, <hi>He ſhall ſee His
Seed, He ſhall prolong His dayes; and the Pleaſure of
the Lord ſhall proſper in His hand:</hi> He ſhall ſee ſome
Children Born unto Him, ſome <hi>Sons of Peace.</hi> But,
Mark, <hi>He ſhall ſee of the Travel of His Soul, and ſhall
be ſatisfied.</hi> So that when there is a Son of Peace, he
is the Fruit of the Travel of the Soul of Jeſus Chriſt;
and he is the Fruit at the Second hand, of the Travel of
the Souls of Gods Miniſters, their Souls Travel, as you
heard before in <hi>Paul,</hi> but that not ſo much. He is the
Fruit of the Travel of the Soul of Jeſus Chriſt; the
Soul of Chriſt Travels with this Birth, and this Work
of God upon the Heart of ſuch a one, it is the Fruit of
this Travel of the Soul of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And Mark further, <hi>And He ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> As if
the Holy Ghoſt here ſhould ſay, Let but Jeſus Chriſt
ſee a Soul brought in to Himſelf, let Him but ſee any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
to be the <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
for all the Blood that I have ſhed, for all my Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
I have been willing to come from the Boſom
of my Father, to take your Nature upon me, and I did
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104282:93"/>
endure the Withdrawings of my Father, when I cried,
<hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> I was
made a Man of Sorrows, and my Father did Bruiſe me,
and my Soul was made an Offering for ſin. But now,
What will ſatisfie the Soul of Jeſus Chriſt for all this?
Saith he, Let me ſee the Travel of my Soul, let me ſee
the Miniſtry of the Goſpel to work upon ſome Soul, to
make them to be <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> I have then what I have
Travelled for, I am ſatisfied; I think this is even worth
my Suffering, I account my Sufferings well Anſwered; I
account my Blood well laid down, that I might gain
theſe Souls unto my ſelf. O what an Encouragement is
here unto Souls to Imbrace the Goſpel, to be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Peace. And how ſhould you ſeek unto God,
for your Children and Friends. O that God would
make His Goſpel effectual to Beget them to be <hi>Sons of
Peace.</hi> You that are tender Mothers, you ſhould look
upon your Children, and think thus: It may be the
Lord hath ſome Thoughts of good unto this Child;
and when they come to hear the Word, you ſhould pray
earneſtly for them, that the Lord would Speak a Word
to their Souls: And you ſhould take as much Pains, and
as earneſtly Pray, that the Second Birth may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
as you did for the Firſt Birth. So it was with
<hi>Auſtins</hi> Mother, he ſaith, She did take as much pains,
and ſhed as many Tears for the Converſion of his Soul,
as ſhe did at his Firſt Birth; and ſo ſhe obtain'd her
Labour. I put this to you that are Mothers, you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of your Children: Have you Laboured as much
for the Second Birth of your Children, as your Labour
was when you did Bear them in your Wombs? It was
ſo with that gracious Mother for her Son. You have
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104282:94"/>
Sons, it may be, that are rather Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> now
you ſhould Strive with God in Prayer, and Labour
to the uttermoſt of your Power, that they may be
wrought upon by the Goſpel, to be made the <hi>Sons of
Peace</hi> by it.</p>

            <p>We Proceed,</p>
            <p>NOw follows the Bleſſing upon thoſe that ſhall be
Entertainers of the Goſpel, that are the Sons
of Peace, <hi>Your Peace ſhall be upon them.</hi> That is,
They ſhall have all the good of the Goſpel to be theirs:
That's the meaning. For it was wont among the <hi>Jews</hi>
to be the Expreſſion of all kind of Good: <hi>Peace be to
you.</hi> By the Name of Peace, they did expreſs all good.
<hi>So that your Peace ſhall abide upon them:</hi> That is, All the
good of the Goſpel, that you carry to them ſhall be
theirs: So then, from theſe words, from the Bleſſing
that is upon the right Entertainers of the Goſpel, here
you have theſe Four Points;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That thoſe that Entertain the Goſpel, ſhall have
the Peace of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this is a great Mercy from God, and
the Portion of the Sons of Peace, not only to have
ſome ſudden Apprehenſions of the Excellency of the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104282:94"/>
Goſpel; but to have the Good and the Bleſſing of the
Goſpel to abide upon them, to reſt upon them: That's
the Second. And then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That thoſe that do Entertain the Goſpel, do
bring a Bleſſing upon the places where they Live. For
ſo, if you obſerve it, and look into the Words, you
ſhall find that it is not ſaid, And if the Son of Peace be
there, your Peace ſhall reſt <hi>upon him:</hi> But if the Son
of Peace be there; that is, in the Houſe into which
you come, your Peace ſhall reſt <hi>upon it:</hi> Upon the
Houſe, upon the Place where the Son of Peace is. (So
that that's the Third Point, where there is any that do Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Goſpel, ſuch a one doth bring a Bleſſing to the
Place and the Family where he Lives.)</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Conſideration of the great good that
a Miniſter of God ſhall bring unto a Place, in caſe he be
Entertain'd, is a mighty Encouragement to them in their
Miniſtry. Saith Chriſt,</hi> Go your way and Preach, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you may meet with ſome Difficulties; but this is your
Errand that you are ſent withal, to Preach the Peace of
the Goſpel. And this is the great good that you ſhall bring
to all thoſe that ſhall entertain your Meſſage: That if
they be the Sons of peace, and entertain you, you ſhall be the
Inſtrument to bring all the good of the Goſpel upon them.
<hi>Theſe are the Four Doctrinal Points clearly in this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi>
Your peace ſhall reſt upon them. <hi>It is the Second of
theſe that I ſhall ſtick moſt on; the Firſt, I confeſs, is a
large Point, that's this:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That whoſoever Entertains the Goſpel, ſhall have the
Bleſſing of the Goſpel upon them, the peace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<hi>Your peace ſhall be upon them.</hi> That which is here
promiſed, you have promiſed almoſt in the ſame words
in the ſame caſe, <hi>Mat. 10. 13. And if the Houſe be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104282:95"/>
worthy, let your peace come upon it.</hi> If it be worthy.
And in <hi>Gal. 6. 16. As many as walk according to this
Rule, peace be upon him, and upon the Iſrael of God:</hi>
That is, he that ſubmits to the Rule of the Goſpel, he
ſhall have the peace of the Goſpel: The words in the
<hi>Greek</hi> are, <hi>To this Canon:</hi> The Canon of the Goſpel,
he ſhall have the peace of the Goſpel. As if Chriſt
ſhould ſay, If there be any good in the Goſpel, if I have
purchaſed any good by my Blood; they ſhall have that
Good, and that Bleſſing. Now to Open what the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
and Bleſſing of the Peace of the Goſpel is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
would be a large Argument: And becauſe I have
elſe-where Opened the Doctrine of Reconciliation, the
Doctrine of the Peace of the Goſpel; I ſhall for the
preſent, here paſs very briefly over it, and give you a
little of the Subſtance of it, and then paſs as ſoon as I
can to the Second Point, where we ſhall ſpend the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of the time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Peace ſhall be upon it:</hi> What's that? You ſhall have
the Peace of the Goſpel. O this is an ineſtimable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
indeed! For the Peace of the Goſpel. It is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Peace with God Himſelf: Whereas if they did
underſtand themſelves and know God, they would know
that they are Enemies unto God, and that the Wrath
of the Eternal God is out againſt them: But if they come
but to entertain your Meſſage, they ſhall be Reconciled
unto this Infinite God; the Wrath of the Infinite God
ſhall be turn'd quite away from them, ſo as they ſhall
never be in danger of any one Spark of the Wrath of
God to come out againſt them, there ſhall be this Peace:
Whereas before they were in ſuch a Condition, as if
they knew themſelves and God, the Preſence of God
would be terrible unto them. But if they entertain
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104282:95"/>
your Meſſage, they ſhall come to be able to look upon
that God that was an Infinite provoked Deity, as a
Friend; they ſhall look upon His Face with joy, they
ſhall have free acceſs unto His Preſence, as Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the preſence of their Father: Whereas before they
had cauſe to fear every moment ſome dreadful fruit of the
Wrath of God, to purſue and ſink them. But now, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
Judgments of God ſhall be abroad in the World,
they ſhall be in a ſecure Condition; they ſhall be free from
all, they ſhall be built upon the Rock; when Tempeſts
and Storms ſhall be abroad to Sink others, they ſhall not
be ſtirred, for they ſhall have peace with God.</p>
            <p>Your Peace, that is, even peace with all Creatures; they
ſhall have the bleſſing of that peace too: Whereas before,
all the Creatures of God were as the Hoſts of God, His
Armies ready prepared to Avenge the Quarrel of God
upon them: Every Creature as it were crying unto God,
Lord ſend me, Lord ſend me, that I may ſtrike this Sinner,
that I may ſtrike this Blaſphemer, this unclean Wretch,
and this prophane Wretch; and if God would but give
Commiſſion to any one Creature, it would preſently be
their Deſtruction: But upon their entertaining of your
Meſſage, there ſhall be Peace between them and all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
ſo as no Creature in all the World, ſhall ever be
able to do them hurt. Though they ſhall Live in the
midſt of an evil World, yet this ſhall be their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
That all good Creatures ſhall be made uſeful to
them for good, and there is no evil Creature ſhall ever
be able to do the leaſt evil to them.</p>
            <p>And again, They ſhall have a peace of Conſcience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
before their Conſciences were ready to flie in their
faces. And they, indeed, ſought many wayes and means to
quiet their Conſciences, but could never get any true
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104282:96"/>
quiet of Conſcience. But upon their entertainment of your
Meſſage, their Conſciences ſhall be pacified in the Blood
of the Meſſiah; therefore bid them be of good comfort,
their Conſciences ſhall be able to anſwer all Accuſations
that can be laid againſt them. For ſo the Scripture tells
us of the Anſwer of a good Conſcience, <hi>1 Pet.</hi> 3. 21.
Thus, Let the Devil, let Temptation, charge upon one
that is reconcil'd to God what they can, <hi>A good Conſcience
through the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is able to anſwer
all Accuſations and Temptations. This ſhall be the Peace
that ſhall be upon them.</p>
            <p>And, Fourthly, The Word of God ſhall be at Peace
with them. They ſhall have Intereſt in all the Promiſes
that are in the Word of God, the whole Word ſhall ſpeak
nothing but good unto them: Whereas before, the Word
of God was full of Terror, and came againſt them as
their Enemy; but now all that is in the Word, ſhall be
Peace unto them, <hi>If the Son of Peace be there.</hi> This is
the Peace that you ſhall bring upon them, Peace with
God, and with the Creatures, and with their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and with the Word. And then, O the Bleſſing
that is upon all the Entertainers of the Goſpel. O the
happy Condition that the Entertainers of the Goſpel are
in. This, my Brethren, is the Reaſon why there are
ſome that do prize the Goſpel, and their Hearts are ſo
much upon it. Do not blame them, they find this good
in it, They find the Bleſſing of the Goſpel upon them:
And therefore though you feel not the ſweetneſs and
good that there is in it, and ſo neglect it; their Souls
feel it, and they bleſs themſelves in their God, and bleſs
the Lord that ever they heard of the Goſpel. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
There are many Thouſands this day in Heaven, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
God that ever they heard of the Goſpel, becauſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104282:96"/>
of the Bleſſings that they do partake of, by and through
the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, I, but there are many that are
the Sons of Peace, and the Entertainers of the Goſpel,
and yet they do not feel the Bleſſing of this Peace; they
are as much troubled as any are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, They have certainly that
which is the Matter for Peace, and their trouble comes for
want of Underſtanding it: Others have Matter for Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and their peace comes for want of the knowledg
of what Matter for Terror there is. It's true, they have
not for the preſent the full ſenſe of this Bleſſing of peace,
though they have that which will bring it at laſt. As for
Inſtance, When the bluſtering Tempeſtuous Winds do
ceaſe, the Waves of the Sea do not preſently ceaſe from
their tumultuous Working, and Roaring, and Noiſe,
and yet that which was the Cauſe of their Working, that's
gone. So here, Thoſe who Entertain the Goſpel, they
preſently upon the Entertaining of it, have the Tempeſt
over; there is no more Tempeſt of the Wrath of God
againſt them, but yet there may be ſome Trouble in their
Spirits; but it will be allaid within a while, becauſe that
which is the Reaſon of their Trouble, that certainly is
over: And therefore a ſtrong Argument here you have to
Entertain this bleſſed Goſpel, that is ſent among you.
When you hear it Preached, you hear what it brings to
you; it brings all the Good that Chriſt hath purchaſed
with His Blood: This it offers to you. And can the
World offer to you as much as this comes to? Can there
be any thing to draw your Hearts away from it, that
ſhall be Equal with this Good? Certainly, This is the
Peace that is Infinitely above all Earthly things. What
would not we do to purchaſe a good and ſure
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104282:97"/>
Peace here in the Kingdom? If we account a firm and
ſure peace to be ſo ſweet, would not we be willing to
lay down our Lives? Certainly, That Man or Woman
cannot be accounted to be a good Member of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
that ſhould not be willing to lay down
their Lives in ſuch times as theſe, to purchaſe a ſure and
firm peace. But now, here the Goſpel preaches to you
another manner of Bleſſing, than this outward Peace:
The Goſpel holds forth unto you, that peace that was
purchaſed to you by the Blood of the Son of God: It
was ſuch a Peace that Chriſt thought his own Blood not
too dear to lay down for the purchaſe of this peace of
the Goſpel. It is that Peace that paſſes all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a Soul peace, an Everlaſting peace; and therefore
you ſhould come to hear the Goſpel, as the great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God that is appointed by Him, to bring this
Glorious peace unto your Souls. Do not come meerly
to hear what a Man can ſay, or to hear the Gifts and
Abilities of a Man, or to get a few new Notions, and
the like: But when you come to attend upon the Goſpel,
come, I ſay, unto it as the great Ordinance that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, to bring peace to the Souls of thoſe,
that He doth intend Eternal good unto: And this is to
come in a right way and manner, to the Preaching of the
Goſpel. This, I ſay, is to have a right underſtanding
of what Good there is in the Goſpel. And if any of
your Souls have had a peace before you have come to a
right underſtanding of the Goſpel, know that all that
peace is Naught, it will Undo you, you will never have
any good by it. You have had peace in your own Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
a great while, and you bleſs God that you are not
troubled: How came you by that peace which you
have had for theſe many years? You have gone on qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104282:97"/>
and the Terms between God and your Souls, have
not troubled you. But I this day, in the Name of God
demand of you, How came you to have this Peace?
How came God and your Souls to be Friends? This I
can tell you, That there was a time that every one of
you were Enemies to God. If God hath Revealed any
Truth in this Book, this is a certain Truth, That every
one in this place, was an Enemy to God. Now then,
how you have made up your peace, your had need look
to it. Certainly, it muſt come by the Goſpel, or elſe it is
a Deluſion: If ſo be that the Treaties between God and
your Souls, were not the Treaties of the Goſpel; that is,
the Goſpel Revealing the great Counſels of God unto
you about this, and the Terms upon which He would
be Reconciled; and then your Souls ſending up your
Anſwer to God, how you would be willing to accept
of thoſe Conditions, that are propounded in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
I put this to your Souls, What Treaties hath there
been between God and you? Have you found the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the Goſpel to be powerful upon you, and to
bring this Peace into you? If it hath not come in this way,
I ſay it is but a Deluſion, and the great Work of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
between God and your Souls, is to make up at
this day.</p>
            <p>But thus much for this Firſt Point.</p>
            <p>But Secondly,<note place="margin">Doct. 2</note> 
               <hi>Your Peace ſhall reſt upon it. Shall reſt,</hi>
that is, Whoſoever Entertains it, they ſhall not only
have ſome ſudden Apprehenſions of thoſe Excellent
things that you bring unto them, they ſhall not only have
ſome flaſhie Comforts in thoſe things, and feel ſome preſent
Sweetneſs in them; but the good and the Bleſſing of that
bleſſed Doctrine of peace, it ſhall <hi>abide</hi> with them all the
days of their lives, and to all Eternity. That's the meaning,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104282:98"/>
               <hi>Your Peace ſhall reſt upon them.</hi> So that this is our Point
now, That ſuch as do Entertain the Goſpel. Now what
the Entertainment is, that is, what it is to be a Son of
Peace: That was a great part of our Work, the laſt
Lords Day. But if you be ſuch Sons of Peace as was
Opened to you, I ſay, the Lord will not only grant you
preſent Apprehenſions of the Glorious things of the
Goſpel, and ſome preſent Sweetneſs, but He will Cauſe
the Bleſſing of it, and the good things of it to abide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Spirits, to continue there for your Eternal good.
Many upon the firſt Hearing of the Meſſage of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
upon the firſt Opening of that Bleſſed Doctrine,
have their Hearts taken, and begin preſently to be ſtirr'd
and affected; but we find by Experience, that many
times all is but a meer flaſh, it all vaniſhes again. The
good of the Goſpel they did apprehend, doth not abide
upon them: As the ſtony ground, in <hi>Mat. 13. 20, 21.
But he that received the Seed into ſtony places, the ſame is
he that heareth the Word, and anon with joy receiveth it:
Yet hath he not root in himſelf, but endureth for a while.</hi>
He doth but continue a while, he received it in a little
way, and that with joy: He hath ſome preſent taſte of
the Sweetneſs of the Word, he takes it in with joy; but
it doth not reſt upon him, it doth not abide in him:
The Seed doth not lie there ſo long as to Fructifie, as to
bring forth Fruit, but comes to nothing; as the Ears of
Corn upon the Houſe top, they quickly are blaſted and
come to nothing: Thus it is with many Hearers. There
were ſome that were the High-way ground, and they
were your ordinary Ignorant and prophane People; the
Word took no Impreſſion upon them, but it was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken away by the Fowls of the Air. But there were
others that did ſeem to be affected with the Word of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104282:98"/>
the Goſpel, to have it enter a little into their hearts,
their Spirits were taken with ſudden Joy. O it is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Goſpel that we hear, this is a bleſſed Miniſtry indeed
that we enjoy: But mark, it was but for a while. The
Seed of the Word, it did but abide a little while, it did
not reſt in them. So in <hi>Luke</hi> 14. There upon the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chriſt, the Text ſaith in <hi>ver. 15. That when one
of them that ſat at Meat with him heard theſe things, he
ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is he that ſhall eat Bread in the
Kingdom of God.</hi> When Chriſt had been Preaching
unto them about the things of the Kingdom of God,
Mark, There were ſome of His Auditors, that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with His Preaching. O bleſſed is he that ſhall have
Communion with theſe things. And yet you may obſerve
by the very Words that follow after, the Parable that
Chriſt uſes, that even thoſe that were thus affected and
taken, were ſuch as prized their Oxen and Farms, and
other things above the Goſpel, and have that Doom
pronounc'd upon them, That thoſe men that were bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
ſhould not taſte of the Supper. And ſo in <hi>John
5.</hi> 35. It is ſpoken concerning <hi>John, He was a burning
and a ſhining Light, and ye were willing for a ſeaſon, to
rejoyce in his Light.</hi> Mark, <hi>John</hi> was an admirable
Preacher, he came as the Fore-runner of Chriſt, and
Preached, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.
John</hi> did open the Kingdom of Heaven unto his Hearers,
and they were mightily taken with him: But now, Mark,
what the Text ſaith, <hi>For a little time they did rejoyce in
the Light, but they did not continue.</hi> And in <hi>John</hi> 8.
There you have a notable place, concerning Chriſts
Preaching unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Chriſt did Preach ſo, as
did take their Heart in ſome meaſure, the Text ſaith,
that ſome of them did believe, in <hi>ver. 13. As He ſpake
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104282:99"/>
thoſe words, many believed on Him.</hi> But, Mark, what
Chriſt ſaith, in <hi>ver. 31. Then ſaid Jeſus to thoſe Jews
which believed on Him, If ye continue in my Word, then
are ye My Diſciples indeed.</hi> Mark, Chriſt would not
own them to be His Diſciples, though their Hearts were
taken with what He Preached, but upon theſe Terms,
<hi>If you continue in my Word:</hi> Which is all one, <hi>If the
Word abide in you, and you abide in the Word, then are
you my Diſciples.</hi> I beſeech you obſerve it: Chriſt doth
not own a Man or Woman to be His Diſciple, meerly
becauſe of ſome ſudden flaſhes of Affection, becauſe
they are taken with the Word; and perhaps are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by the Word, and ſtirred for a time: I ſay, Chriſt
doth not own them to be Diſciples, except that His
Word abide in them, and they abide in the Word. And
in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. you have a moſt excellent Text for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
The Apoſtle ſhews there, that the <hi>Galatians</hi> were
mightily taken with the Miniſtry of the Goſpel at firſt
when <hi>Paul</hi> came among them, but it ſeems in great part
it Vaniſhed from them, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. ſaith <hi>Paul, Where is then
the Bleſſedneſs you ſpake of? For I bear you record, that
if it had been poſſible, you would have plucked out your
own Eyes, and have given them to me.</hi> The meaning is
this, When the Goſpel came at firſt to be Preached
among them, generally they cried out: O this Bleſſed
Goſpel! O the Bleſſedneſs! O theſe bleſſed Truths that
is come among us, ſuch Truths as we were not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
withal: O they are bleſſed Truths indeed. Mark,
They were thus taken with the Truths of the Goſpel,
when they were firſt Preached: But now, ſaith <hi>Paul,
Where is the Bleſſedneſs ye ſpake of?</hi> Your Hearts are not
now ſo taken with the Goſpel, as they were at firſt;
now you ſeem to be taken off from it: <hi>Where is the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104282:99"/>
you ſpake of?</hi> I make no Queſtion, but many
Miniſters in many Congregations, have Cauſe to make
Uſe of theſe words of the Apoſtle, when God ſent them
at firſt: The Hearts of People were taken with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the Goſpel, but within a while they are off again.
And well may their Miniſters ſay, Where is the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs
you ſpake of? The Peace of the Goſpel, it doth
not abide upon them, but one thing or other takes it off
from them. So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. There you read of ſome, that
yet were not Sav'd by the Goſpel, or were not in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
(at leaſt for the preſent) to be Sav'd; yet they
had a taſte of the Heavenly Gift: They did not only
hear the Word and underſtand it, but they <hi>Had a taſte
of the good Word of God.</hi> O they ſaid, It was the good
Word of God. And, Mark, <hi>Of the Powers of the World
to come:</hi> That is, of thoſe powerful Truths, of thoſe
Truths that do concern the World to come, that were
powerful Truths. For ſo, certainly, my Brethren, the
Truths that do concern the World to come, as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Truths; they have a mighty deal of Power to work
upon the Heart. And theſe had, not only the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions,
but a taſte of the Powers of the World to
come; and yet it appears that they had not thoſe things
that did accompany Salvation. Many other Scriptures
might be ſhewed, that there are many that are Affected
with the Goſpel, yea, they are Convinc'd, and they
have ſome taſte of it; and their Spirits taken, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
perſwaded (with him that we read of) almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to become a Chriſtian; and yet for all this, this
Mercy that is here promiſed to the Sons of Peace, is not
their Portion: the peace of the Goſpel doth not reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Spirits. It is a Bleſſing beyond that which any
Hypocrite in the World hath, to have this peace of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104282:100"/>
the Goſpel, to reſt and abide upon his Spirit. That is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, To be ſet up as a conſtant Light before the Soul,
not to come as a meer flaſh of Lightning, ſuddenly come,
and ſuddenly gone; but then it may be ſaid to reſt when
the Lord ſets up thoſe glorious Truths of the Goſpel,
as a conſtant Light before the Soul.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, When as the Lord works thoſe Truths
by Meditation upon the Heart, the Lord cauſes thoſe
Truths to follow the Thoughts of the Mind, and ſo to
work them upon the Heart; yea, into the Heart of the
Thoughts of the Mind, when the Lord gives a conſtant
real Taſte of thoſe Truths, and Savour of them; that
though they be not alwayes Hearing of them, yet the
Savour and Reliſh, doth abide in a conſtant way upon
their Hearts, when the Lord cauſes thoſe Truths of the
Goſpel to ſpread all over the Faculties of their Souls:
that it is, as the Holy Ghoſt compares it in Scripture to
<hi>Leven: The Kingdom of God is like unto Leven, which
in a little time doth Leven the whole Lump.</hi> So when
the Lord cauſes the Truths of the Goſpel not only
to be in the Mind, in the Underſtanding, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
but to get into the Heart; to get into the
Affections, and as it were to Leven (in a good ſenſe)
the whole Soul by the Sweetneſs, and the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the Excellency of thoſe Truths. Yea, when
the Lord ſhall cauſe thoſe Truths to be dearly Rooted in
the Heart, to take ſuch Root as Temptations, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements,
any Provocations without, ſhall never be
able to take out thoſe Truths which are upon the Heart.
When the Lord ſhall cauſe them to ſtick ſo faſt, to ſinck
ſo deep into the Heart, let there come what will to take
off the Heart from them, or take them out of the Heart,
yet they ſhall never be able to take them out of the
Heart. As a Martyr ſaid, ſaith he, You may take my
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104282:100"/>
Heart out of my Body, but you ſhall never take the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of theſe things out of my Heart. O the Bleſſing,
and the Truths of the Goſpel did ſo reſt upon his Soul,
and they had gotten ſo near into his Heart, that nothing
in the World could take it off. Many People that are a
little ſtirr'd upon the Hearing of the Goſpel, and they
think it is good, and the Truths are Bleſſed Truths, and
they had good Reſolutions; but perhaps when they
come Home from Hearing of the Word, they ſhall have
a Fellow-ſervant Jearing of them, or the Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Speaking againſt them; or the Huſband the Wife,
or the Wife the Huſband, and ſo perhaps they come to
loſe all thoſe Truths which formerly they were ſo taken
with: But thoſe that are the <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> they have
the Peace of the Goſpel reſting upon them, as hath been
Opened to you; and this is a very great Bleſſing of
God. O this is a Mercy indeed, for the Lord to grant
the Truths of the Goſpel, and the Good of it thus to
reſt upon the Heart; that the Heart doth keep it as a
Treaſure within it, it is a great Mercy.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is a ſpecial Fruit of the Covenant of
Grace; according to that Text in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. where God
promiſes as the Fruit of the Covenant, that he will Write
His Law in their Inwards parts. Now, certainly, by
the <hi>Law,</hi> it is not meant the Letter of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:
But when He ſaith, <hi>I will Write my Law,</hi>
that is, <hi>My Will: The great Counſels of my Will.</hi> And
the ſaving Truths of God are there meant by the Law.
For when <hi>David</hi> Expreſſes his love to the Law, he means
alſo the Soul-ſaving Truths, that are Revealed in the
Word of God; and certainly there, becauſe it was in
the time under the Law, the Language of the Holy
Ghoſt was ſuitable to the Time. But certainly, It is
meant in a more eſpecial manner, the Truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104282:101"/>
That look as the Law was Written in <hi>Adams</hi> Heart
at firſt, ſo now thoſe that are received into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
have the Law of the Goſpel, and the Truths of
that Written in their Hearts: That is, When ever they
ſhall come to hear the Truths of the Goſpel Opened to
them, they ſhall find as it were a Counterpain of the
bleſſed Truths of the Goſpel in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>Yea, further, To have the Word of the Goſpel in
the Heart, and for the Heart to keep it. It is a very
great and cloſe Mercy, a greater Mercy than to have
Chriſt to be Born of the Body of a Woman, in <hi>Luke
11. 27. And it came to paſs as He ſpake theſe things, a
certain Woman lift up her voice, and ſaid unto Him, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is the Womb that Bare thee, and the Paps which thou
haſt Sucked. But He ſaid, Yea, rather bleſſed are they
which hear the Word of God, and keep it.</hi> Thoſe that
when they have heard the Word of the Goſpel, and
ſhall keep it in their Hearts, and not let it Vaniſh away
from them, but keep it, I ſay, in their Power and Life
upon their Hearts, they are rather Bleſſed, than the Womb
was Bleſſed that Bare Jeſus Chriſt, or than the Paps were
Bleſſed that gave Jeſus Chriſt Suck. I ſuppoſe there is
no Woman here but would account her ſelf a bleſſed
Woman, if her Womb had Porn Jeſus Chriſt, and if
her Paps had given Jeſus Chriſt Suck: Now here is a
greater Bleſſedneſs than this, for a Woman to hear the
Word of the Goſpel Preached unto her, and to have
this Word of the Goſpel to reſt in her Heart, and for
her to keep it in her heart, in the Power and Life, and
Efficacy of it; this Woman now hath a greater Bleſſing,
than if ſhe had Born Jeſus Chriſt in her Womb. Surely,
it is a great Bleſſing to have the bleſſed things of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
to be kept in the Soul after the hearing of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:104282:101"/>
And further, A great Mercy, becauſe there is ſuch a
wonderful Power in the good things of the Goſpel, and
therefore it muſt needs be a great Mercy to have thoſe
things abide upon the Heart: They have ſuch a mighty
power to work good upon the Heart, a mighty Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
power they have, to Convince any Soul in the
World. Let a Man or Woman be never ſo Wicked or
Prophane, yet there are ſuch bleſſed Truth in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
that is enough to Convince his Soul, I ſay, though
it be never ſo vile, and to take his Heart: And we have
little Cauſe to fear the working upon the Hearts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
only, if we could but procure this, that thoſe things
that we Speak, might but abide upon their Hearts. If
we were but ſure, that what we Deliver in the Name of
God, would but abide upon their Spirits, we need not fear
the working upon any Soul Living, let them be never ſo
Vile; there is ſuch a mighty Power and Efficacy in thoſe
bleſſed things of the Goſpel, when they come to be Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
            <p>And ſo there is a mighty Comforting power, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the Soul with ſuch Conſolation, as is Infinitely
above all Conſolation, that ever it was Acquainted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
before.</p>
            <p>There is a mighty Power to reſiſt any Temptation.
If the Truths of God were but kept in the Soul, we
might make little of all Temptations in the World: The
Devil could have little hope to prevail with any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
if the Word of the Goſpel did but abide upon
the Heart of a Man or Woman that doth hear it. This
is the advantage that the Devil hath at any time, when
one hath been hearing of the Word, if he knows that
the Word is paſt from them, and it doth not abide; then
he can come with Temptations, and makes no queſtion
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104282:102"/>
of prevailing. But if the Devil knows that thoſe Truths
do abide and reſt upon the Soul, the Devil can have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hope to prevail: <hi>The Peace of God ſhall keep your
Hearts?</hi> Fro Reſi, <hi>ſhall Guard your Hearts.</hi> It ſhall be
as a Troop of Horſe, to keep you from Temptations,
from the power and ſtrength of Temptations. You
complain, and ſay, O that you would do better, but
Temptations are ſo ſtrong, that they prevail upon you.
Why are Temptations ſo ſtrong? It is becauſe thy Soul
is not acquainted with the Bleſſed and Glorious things
of the Goſpel; and the Power and Life of them doth
not abide upon thy Spirit.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe, the Truths of the Goſpel: O they have
a mighty deal of Power to cleanſe your Hearts, <hi>1 Pet.
2.</hi> 20. There you have mentioned the Power of the
Knowledg of the Goſpel, when it abides in one that
might be an Hypocrite, and therefore not of that Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſie
that the true ſaving Knowledg is. Yet Obſerve,
what is ſaid there, <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of the World, through the Knowledge of the Lord
and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now then, If that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
have ſuch a cleanſing Power, O what Power then
hath the true ſaving Power of the great things of the
Goſpel, and the Glorious things of it, to Cleanſe the
Heart.</p>
            <p>Yea, If thoſe Truths do abide upon the Spirits, they
have a Transforming power, they have a power to
change the Heart into the ſame likeneſs: According to
that Scripture, <hi>2 Cor. 3. 18. But we all, with open face
beholding as in a Glaſs, the Glory of the Lord, are changed
into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord.</hi> Now this Goſpel of the Lord, is nothing
elſe but the good things of the Goſpel: We behold
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104282:102"/>
them, and that as with open Face, as we do behold the
Goſpel of the Lord. And what then? <hi>We are changed
into the ſame Image.</hi> Oh! this is a Bleſſed abiding, it
is a Bleſſed thing for the things of the Goſpel to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Soul. Why? Becauſe they have ſuch a Power
in them to Change the Heart, to Transform the Heart
into the very Image of them, and the Truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
have the cleareſt Image of God upon them; the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God is Imprinted upon the Truths of the Goſpel.
Now that theſe ſhould reſt upon the Spirit, it muſt needs
be a great Mercy.</p>
            <p>Another is this, It is that which makes them indeed
to be Saving: All thoſe Bleſſed things of the Goſpel
that are Revealed, they never come to be Saving, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they come to reſt upon the Soul; to be got into the
Heart, and there to dwell and reſt. Mark that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in <hi>James 1. 21. Wherefore lay a part all Filthineſs,
and Superſtuity of Naughtineſs, and receive with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the Ingraffed Word, which is able to ſave your Souls.</hi>
Mark, Receive with Meekneſs the Word: But how?
The Ingraffed Word, which is able to ſave your Souls.
The Word of God can never ſave your Souls, till it
comes to be an Ingraffed Word. Now theſe things I
premiſe, to ſhew you the Excellency of this, that ſo I
might have the more ground for an Exhortation by and
by: To labour to keep the Word of God, I mean thoſe
Truths of the Goſpel, that at any times comes to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to you.</p>
            <p>Now by way of Application,<note place="margin">Appl.</note> as brief as may be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the Firſt place, Hence we ſee cauſe, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the Goſpel eſpecially, ſee cauſe bitterly to
Lament the want of this in their Auditory ordinarily.
It's true, There are few that are faithful Preachers of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104282:103"/>
the Goſpel, but they do find that God doth at ſometime or
other Convice Men, and ſomewhat ſtir their Hearts: O,
but this is that that they have cauſe bitterly to complain
of, that thoſe things that they deliver to them, that are
the Precious and Glorious things of Jeſus Chriſt, yet
though they ſtir them a little for the while, yet they do
not reſt upon them. It was a Complaint of <hi>Chriſoſtom,</hi>
ſaith he, We Miniſters are in a worſe Condition, than
any Work-men whatſoever: Take a Carpenter, he
comes and works, and leaves his Work over-night, and
comes the next day and finds it where it was as he left
it; his Work is no more forward, neither backward.
Oh! But it is not ſo with us Preachers, for we come and
work upon the Hearts of People, and we bring it into a
reaſonable good forwardneſs, and we leave it one Night
and come the next day; but woe to us, we find it not where
we leave it: We work upon their Hearts one Lords Day,
and it may be they go away with ſome Reſolutions, that
they will break off their evil way, and they will attend
to the Miniſtry of the Word; but before the next Lords
Day, they are quite off again: They are got again into
ſome wicked Company or other, and they begin to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
their Hearts againſt thoſe Bleſſed Truths; ſo that our
Condition is worſe than any Work-mans whatſoever.
But though it be a ſad Condition for the Miniſters of the
Goſpel, yet know it is a ſadder Condition for your
ſelves: You that heretofore have heard thoſe Bleſſed
things of the Goſpel, and your Hearts have been taken
with them, have they reſted upon you? I put this to
you in the Name of God, I ſay, Hath the Peace of the
Goſpel reſted upon your Hearts? It may be, ſome of
you may know Two or Three years ago, God began to
work upon you, you began to have ſome Enlightning of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104282:103"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Kingdom of God; and you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſay, Bleſſed are thoſe that ſhall be partakers of
thoſe things, but have theſe reſted upon you. Hath not
the Miniſtry of the Goſpel been to ſome of you like a
Ship, that when it is Sailing in the Water, it makes a
great Impreſſion for the preſent, but let the Ship be
gone and the Water is as ſmooth as ever it was? So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times, when the Miniſter comes and open the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Truths of the Goſpel, they make a mighty Dent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Hearts of their Auditors; but within a little
while their Hearts are like the Water: no man can ſee
that ever there was an Impreſſion of any Truth upon
their Hearts. Now know that this is a very ſad thing
to have the Goſpel begin to Affect the Heart, but not
to Reſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Conſider, How vile is thy heart, it is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of ſtrong corruption that is in thy heart that
the things of the Goſpel cannot ſtick there.</p>
            <p>And Conſider, How vild it is, that wicked thoughts,
vile baſe, unworthy, unclean, filthy thoughts can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
upon you. If the Devil dart in temptations they
will abide and reſt, why when he darts them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-night,
he can find them in the morning; perhaps if
you have ſome vain or unclean thoughts, you can role
them up and down in your mind for half a night to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
perhaps day after day, and night after night,
baſe and filthy thoughts are rol'd up and down in
your Spirits; theſe things can abide. Now what ſhall
vile, filthy, ungodly thoughts reſt in your hearts and
ſhall not the Bleſſed and Glorious Truths of Jeſus Chriſt
and the things of the Kingdom of God reſt upon your
hearts?</p>
            <p>Yea, Conſider further, That it is a moſt dangerous
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104282:104"/>
thing for an eſſay of mercy to paſs away and to do
no good, for mercy to come and as it were make a
trial upon the heart, and then leave it and no good
done; this is a ſad condition: It is not ſo dangerous
while Men and Women are in ſuch an eſtate as the
mercy of God hath not made an eſſay as it were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. But now, When the Grace of the Goſpel
ſhall come to make an eſſay upon the heart, to make
as it were a tryal upon the heart and to have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
this is a dangerous thing; for an offer of Gods
Grace to be rejected is very ſad, to looſe one oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of Gods Mercy is a very ſad thing; how doſt
thou know that ever they will come upon thy heart
with that power that once they did, and therefore
thy condition is very ſad.</p>
            <p>And know further, That when the Lord begins to
reveal to thee the things of the Goſpel, and thou putteſt
them off; thoſe flaſhes of affection and conviction that
thou haſt had will prove to be matter of terror of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
another day.</p>
            <p>Some poor Soul may ſay, Then Lord what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of me, God knows this is my condition; I come
many times to hear the word and I meet with thoſe truths
that do mightily take my heart for the preſent, but the
Lord knows all vaniſhes again: I think I could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
every thing that the Miniſter ſpeaks while I am hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, but they go out again; I hear that this is
the Bleſſing of God upon the Sons of Peace, that the
Truths of the Goſpel ſhould abide upon their hearts and
reſt there; O they do not reſt with me: Now and then
they come to me, but they do not reſt with me.</p>
            <p>Now for the Anſwer to this, Perhaps they may not
reſt in thy memory, but yet if the Fruit and effect of them
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:104282:104"/>
doth reſt in thy heart, thou haſt the Goſpel reſting in
thy heart. As thus, Why perhaps the Water may paſs
through a Veſſel, go quite through it and not ſtay;
I, but yet there is ſo much Fruit of the paſſage of it
thorow, as to keep the Veſſel ſweet: Though you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
take up any Water from it, but it is all gone; yet
I ſay it keeps the Veſſel ſweet: So I may ſay to thoſe
that have the weakeſt memories, and yet the Lord hath
wrought any degree of Grace, though thy memory be
ſo weak that thou canſt not remember (I ſpeak this to
thoſe that have weak memories naturally) and there is
nothing that their Souls do more deſire then this; O
that they might keep thoſe things that they hear, they
would think themſelves the moſt happy Creatures in the
world; if thoſe truths that ſometimes they hear might
reſt upon them: I ſpeak to thoſe. Is it ſo with thy heart?
Then though thou canſt not remember, yet if thoſe truths
keep thy heart ſweet, they keep thy heart from filthy
luſts that they do not abide in thy heart, thy heart is
kept ſavory by them; if there be this effect abiding
upon thy heart to keep it ſavory and ſweet, this Peace
of the Goſpel may reſt with thee though thou canſt not
remember particulars. A Man or Woman perhaps they
cannot remember what Meat they ate a little while ſince,
but they find themſelves nouriſhed by that Meat. So for
the word of God, that is the food of thy Soul, though
thou canſt not remember and give an account of ſuch
and ſuch things thou do'ſt hear in the word, but yet do'ſt
thou find that thou art nouriſhed by it; I ſay, the good
things of the Goſpel then do reſt upon thy Soul.</p>
            <p>Then if this be ſo great a Bleſſing, O that I could but
convince you this day to go away with your hearts ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with this Bleſſing; O that all of you were convinc'd
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104282:105"/>
this day. We hear that it is not enough for us to have
ſudden apprehenſions, when we hear the Bleſſed things
of the Goſpel; but that that is indeed the bleſſing of God
upon a Son of Peace, it is to have the good things of the
Goſpel abide and reſt upon them. O then, that it might
be ſo with us! O that the Lord would help us, that
whatſoever we hear, we may not only be taken with the
hearing of it, but that it might reſt upon our Hearts. I
ſhall propound ſome Rules unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> When you come, you muſt endeavour to bring
ſoft Hearts, and tender Spirits: What Truths you do
know, you muſt work upon your Hearts before you
come, to labour to ſoften your Hearts. We know that the
Truths of God are compared in Scripture to Nails, that
are faſtened by the Miniſters of God in the Aſſemblies,
<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 11. Now when you come to faſten a Nail or a
Goad, if the thing be a Stone, you cannot faſten it: A
Work-man if he would drive a Nail into a Wall, if he
meet with a Flint, the Nail cannot enter, but there muſt
be ſome thing that muſt yield to make it reſt: So you muſt
labour to bring yielding and ſoft Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When you come to hear, come ſo as to make
account that now you come to attend upon God, and
that while any Truth of the Goſpel is Revealing to you,
God is coming nigh unto your Souls, in thoſe things that
concern your Eternal good. If the Hearts of People
did attend upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel thus, that
is, We are here, O Lord, in thy Preſence now, to hear
what Thou haſt to Reveal unto us; and we believe that
in this thine Ordinance, when Thou art making known
any Truth of the Goſpel to us, Thou art coming nigh
to our Souls in a matter that Concerns our Eternal good.
If you did attend thus, certainly every Truth would
get into your Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:104282:105"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When you find the Truth beginning to work
upon your Hearts, then Dart up ſome Ejaculations in
your own Thoughts: Lord, ſet home this. So you
may do, and not hinder your hearing: Lord, Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneſt
to ſtir my Heart, O Lord, keep my Heart in
this frame. As we read of <hi>David,</hi> when as he ſaw the
People in a good Frame, <hi>1 Chron.</hi> 29. 18. ſaith he, <hi>O
Lord God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and of</hi> Iſrael <hi>our Fathers,
keep this for ever in the Imagination of the Thoughts of
the Heart of thy People.</hi> And the truth is, We would
willingly Dart up ſuch a Prayer to God, if we knew
how God did begin to ſtir you? But you know how God
is communing with your Hearts, when you hear us ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to you, therefore do you your ſelves Dart up ſuch
an Ejaculation to God: O Lord God, keep this Truth
in the Thoughts of my Heart for ever.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Rule is this, You muſt not truſt your own
Hearts, never truſt to ſudden Affections and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This Text is moſt excellent for this purpoſe, Mark
how <hi>David</hi> Prays, <hi>Keep this in the Thoughts of the Heart
of thy People, and prepare their Hearts unto Thee.</hi> Why
were they not prepared to God? Their Hearts were
mightily up for God, and yet it appears that <hi>David</hi>
would not take this ſcarce for a Preparation, but the
Lord muſt ſtill work further and further. So when thou
feeleſt thy Heart a little ſtirr'd, do not think that the
work is preſently done, but pray to God to prepare thy
Heart, and that He would go on with that Bleſſed work
of His.</p>
            <p>And then another Rule is this, Labour after thou art
gone, to work the Truths upon thy Heart by Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that ſo they may abide. Would you have a Salve
that ſhould do good to an Affected Member? It is not
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104282:106"/>
only the laying of the Salve upon the Body, but to rub
it that it may get in and ſupple the part. So when the
Lord comes to preſent the Bleſſed Truths of the Goſpel
to you, you muſt labour to rub them upon your Hearts
by Meditation.</p>
            <p>Another Rule is, Turn all that you hear into Prayer:
That is, When you have heard any truth that hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and affected your Souls, get alone into your Cloſets,
and before you go about any other Buſineſs, fall down
before the Lord, and turn that which you have heard
into Prayer; it were a good Rule for your Direction,
and you will find an admirable benefit by this, you will
find this to help your Memory much. Do but hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
obſerve this Rule that now is tendered unto you
as from the Lord, work the matter that you hear upon
your Hearts by Prayer.</p>
            <p>And further, Take heed of Temptations, keep a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Watch over your Hearts, take heed that ſome
Temptations do not come ſecretly to ſteal away that
bleſſed Truth that you have heard: For the Devil will
labour, as I told you, the place is full of Angels, and ſo
it is full of Devils too: The Devil is watching who it
is that is ſtirred with the hearing of the Goſpel, and he
preſently is labouring to draw out all the Power and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy:
Therefore watch againſt Temptations.</p>
            <p>Another Rule will be this, Often call your Hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an account, oftentimes be communing with your own
Hearts in this manner: O my Soul, was there not ſuch
a time that thou wert ſtirr'd and affected, when thou
did'ſt hear ſuch and ſuch things? Why what is become
of all thy Stirrings, and of all thoſe Reſolutions and
Truths, that thou haſt heard? O my Soul, where are
they? What haſt thou done with them? O, it would
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104282:106"/>
be of admirable Uſe, if you would take an account of
your hearts.</p>
            <p>But when Men and Women are ſtirr'd ſometimes, and
go away and never call their Hearts to an account what
is become of them; no marvel though the things of the
Goſpel do not abide, but vaniſh all, and are as Water
ſpilt upon the Ground.</p>
            <p>And further, Take heed of ſecret ſins: Thou haſt no
power to purge thy Heart, but thou may'ſt in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
abandon the Acts of ſin. That Man or Woman
that lives in a Secret ſin, I ſay, that Secret ſin will either
Eat out the Truths that he hath heard, or the Truth
will Eat out that ſin. Thou comeſt to hear the Word,
and haſt many Bleſſed things Revealed to thee, I ſay,
they will either Eat out thy Secret ſin, or thy Secret
ſin will Eat out them: And which of the two do'ſt thou
think, thou hadſt beſt be rid of?</p>
            <p>And if thou wouldſt have them abide, turn all into
Practice; that is, fall a Doing: Do not content thy
ſelf with Affections and Reſolutions, but fall a Doing;
and that doth mightily ſettle the Truth, when it comes
once to be Practiſed. As now in a Temptation, the
Temptation is not ſettled until the Devil hath got ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
done according to the Temptation; and when
ſomething is done, then the Temptation ſettles. So
concerning the Truths of the Goſpel, a Man it may
be hath ſome Reſolutions and Deſires, but till there be
ſomewhat done, ſome Duties ſet upon, ſome Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in thy Way and Life, the Truth doth not ſettle;
but the doing ſomewhat according to what thou do'ſt
hear, that doth mightily ſettle the Truth upon thy Soul.
O think thus, There is ſuch and ſuch a thing made
known to me; O, it may do my Soul good for ever:
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:104282:107"/>
And if you did but keep thoſe things that you hear,
they would do your Souls good; they would do your
Souls good in time of Affliction: If the Truths of the
Goſpel did reſt upon your Hearts, they would Comfort
you then. So it was with <hi>David, I had periſhed in mine
Affliction, but thy Word did Comfort me.</hi> So if you would
lay up that which you hear, when you come upon your
Sick-beds, or in any Trouble, it would mightily help
you and comfort you. O theſe Truths of the Goſpel,
would be very good Companions when you are in your
Journey, or in your Buſineſs, they would Commune
with your Hearts: And, O what Comfort would they
be unto your Souls? So we read in <hi>Prov. 6. 21. Bind
them continually upon thine Heart.</hi> So I may ſay, What
Truths of the Goſpel you hear, bind them continually
upon thy Heart, and about thy Neck; when thou goeſt
it ſhall Lead thee, when thou ſleepeſt it ſhall Keep thee,
and when thou awakeſt it ſhall Talk with thee: When
you awake in the Night ſeaſon, you Toſs up and down
upon your Beds, and know not what to think upon;
but had you kept the Truths of the Goſpel, they would
Talk with you, yea, you might Converſe with Jeſus
Chriſt even as you lie in your Beds.</p>
            <p>And if they did reſt in your Hearts, then when Death
did come they would be Comfortable, then they will
be ſweet one day. Ask a Dying Soul, what Peace with
God is worth? How many have lain upon their Sick
and Death-Beds, and then remembred, O the ſweet
Truths that once I heard, I would give a Thouſand
Worlds I had them again. O that they did but come
now at this time to my Heart, with as great a power as
they did at ſuch a time. Now that you might have thoſe
Bleſſed things of the Goſpel to Comfort your Hearts,
keep them now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:104282:107"/>
And beſides, They will be a Means to make you to
be very uſeful to others. What's the Reaſon why Men
and Women, when they go to Viſit their Sick Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they are ſo Barren in their Conference, they ſay,
How do you? And God comfort you; and ſo: I, but
what have you of the Doctrine of Reconciliation with
God, and the way of Attonement with God? What
have you to help their troubled Conſciences, and to
pacifie them? Can you bring unto them any Truths you
have heard? You have Liv'd under the Miniſtry of the
Goſpel a long time, what is become of them? If you
had been a Child of Peace, then you would have been
able to have carried theſe things unto your Sick Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and to have done a great deal of good unto them.
But alas, You go with a barren Heart, and carry nothing
at all: And why? Becauſe the Truths of the Goſpel
have not abode with you. O how full ſhould our Hearts
be with Jeſus Chriſt, if but one Truth, every Sermon we
heard, did reſt in our Hearts.</p>
            <p>And take but this one Meditation along with you, the
Bleſſed things of the Peace of the Goſpel are ſuch, as if
ever I be Sav'd, I muſt be Praiſing of the Name of God
for unto all Eternity. Now ſhall I not Labour that they
ſhould reſt upon my Heart here, ſeeing they muſt be the
Matter that I muſt Bleſs the Name of God everlaſtingly
for.</p>
            <p>And thus (though I have paſt ſome things over) you
have had the Subſtance of what I intended to Speak of:
And that is, That thoſe that are the <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> have
this Bleſſing upon them: They have not only the ſudden
apprehenſions and flaſhes of Affection, in being moved
with the Glorious things of the Goſpel, but all the good
things of the Goſpel abides and reſt upon them.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe Third Note from the Bleſſing that here the
Entertainers of the Goſpel ſhall have,<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> is this:
That where there is but any one in a Place, or
in a Family, that ſhall Entertain the Goſpel, the
whole Family ſhall be the better for that one. And the
Note is Raiſed from this Particle, <hi>It: Your Peace ſhall
reſt upon it.</hi> He doth not ſay, Your Peace ſhall reſt
upon him only, though that's true, It ſhall reſt upon
him principally: But he ſaith, <hi>Your Peace ſhall reſt upon
it:</hi> That is, If a Son of Peace be in the Family, your
Peace ſhall reſt upon the Family; that is, there ſhall be
ſome good come unto the Family, by reaſon of any one
Son of Peace that's there: If there be but one that doth
Entertain the Goſpel, the Family may come to have a
Bleſſing by that. If it be but a poor Servant, or poor
Child that ſhall receive the Goſpel, there may come a
great deal of good to the Family, by ſuch a Servant; but
if it be a Governour of the Family, then the Bleſſing
will be more. For we find in the Goſpel often, where
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104282:108"/>
the Governour of the Family Believed, it is ſaid, that the
whole Houſhold did believe and were Baptized: And
we find often in the Goſpel of Believing Families, and
indeed there is a greater Bleſſing of God upon a Family,
where the Governours are Believers, than we are aware
of: A Bleſſing, I ſay, upon the Family: That let there
be any Governour, or any that is a Son of Peace, the
Family is the better for it; God many times will ſpare
them the rather, becauſe of them. In <hi>Iſa. 65. 8. Thus
ſaith the Lord, as the new Wine is found in the Cluſter,
and one ſaith, Deſtroy it not, for a Bleſſing is in it: So
will I do for my Servants ſake, that I may not Deſtroy
them all.</hi> Many times in a place where there are a great
many Ungodly ones, yet if there be but a few that are
Godly, as the new Wine in the Cluſter, the Lord ſaith,
<hi>Deſtroy it not, for a Bleſſing is in it.</hi> There are ſome good
Grapes there, though a great many Rotten ones; and a
Bleſſing is in it, and therefore Deſtroy it not: So ſaith
God many times of a Family, where there are ſome good
ones, <hi>Deſtroy it not,</hi> ſaith God, for a Bleſſing is in this
Family. It is very obſervable, that which we read
concerning the Houſe of <hi>Jeroboam, 1 Kings</hi> 14. 10.
compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 13. In <hi>ver.</hi> 10. There the Lord
Threatens, that He will bring Evil upon the Houſe of
<hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and will Cut off from <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> &amp;c. Well,
but this muſt not come preſently, the Lord would not
preſently bring the Evil upon them; but He would ſtay
till He had taken away one out of the Family, <hi>ver. 12, 13.
Ariſe thou therefore, get thee to thine own Houſe; and
when thy feet enter into the City, the Child ſhall die. And
all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall Mourn for him and Bury him: For he only
of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>ſhall come to the Grave, becauſe in him is
found ſome good thing towards the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104282:109"/>
the Houſe of</hi> Jeroboam. Mark, How God takes notice
of any in a wicked Family: If there be but any one,
a Child, that hath ſome good thing in it; becauſe but
<hi>ſome good thing,</hi> the Lord takes ſpecial Notice of
ſuch a one in the Family. Therefore, though his Houſe
ſhould be Deſtroyed, yet this Child muſt be taken
away firſt, <hi>Becauſe in him there is found ſome good thing
towards the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael. Mark, It is but <hi>ſome
good thing,</hi> and towards <hi>the Lord God of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>a
Child;</hi> but this was in the Houſe of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> Let
there be but a Child that hath ſome good thing in a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Family, the Lord takes ſpecial Notice of it, and
there may come a Bleſſing upon the Family, even for the
ſake of ſuch a one.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon of it is,<note place="margin">Reaſ.</note> Becauſe if there be any in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
that Entertains the Goſpel, there the Lord hath
the Glory of His Name, that He doth moſt rejoyce in.
It cannot but pleaſe the Lord to have the Glory of His
Name to be owned in a Family, and held forth: And
if there be but any one in a Family that ſhall Entertain
the Goſpel, who knows what good ſuch a one may do.
If there be one in a Family to hold forth Chriſt, here is
a Way and Means to draw others, to the Love of Chriſt.
If God Convert the Huſband, he may draw the Wife;
or if God Convert the Wife, ſhe may draw the Huſband,
<hi>1 Cor. 7. 16. For what knoweſt thou, O Wife, whether
thou ſhalt ſave thy Husband? Or how knoweſt thou, O
Man, whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Wife?</hi> It is ſpoken in
the Caſe of Unbelievers, where one was an Unbeliever,
and the other God had Converted: And in that Caſe,
the Queſtion was, Whether they were to ſtay one with
another, one being an Infidel, and the other a Believer?
Yea, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>For what knoweſt thou, O Wife,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104282:109"/>
whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Husband? Or thou, O Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
whether thou ſhalt ſave thy Wife?</hi> And ſo, I ſay,
What knoweſt thou, O Child, whether thou mayeſt
ſave thy Brother, or Siſter? Or thou, O Servant, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou mayeſt ſave thy Fellow-Servant? And if thou
be ſo, then how vile are they that ſhall Malign and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
Scorn and Contemn, any in a Family, when God
doth begin to work any good upon them? We know it
is ordinary, That if the Lord begins to ſtrike one Soul
in a Family, the Child, or the Servant, with ſome Work
of His Spirit, that they begin to Inquire after the things
of God, and to Entertain the things of the Goſpel, his
Brother will ſcorn him, or Siſter, or Fellow-Servant
will deride him: Perhaps his Maſter that Lov'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
will now Hate him, and be ready upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to ſhew Diſpleaſure againſt him. Yea, perhaps the
very Father, out of whoſe Loyns the poor Child comes,
will deride him: What ſhall we have of you now? O,
you are grown ſo Preciſe, that now you will be Spoil'd,
and good for nothing: And ſo perhaps the Mother, out
of whoſe Womb it came, will now Hate it. But, O
thou wretched Parent, thou ſhouldeſt rather Bleſs God,
that God begins to work in thy Family, that He begins
to work upon one that came out of thy Loyns; for
thou do'ſt not know, but that this Child may do thy
Soul goood. Thou wert the means for the Natural life
of it, who knows but God intends to make this Child
to be a means for thy Eternal Life. And ſo wretched
Maſter and Miſtreſs in a Family, that ſhall leſs regard a
Servant when God begins to work upon their Hearts,
than you did before. And you, whom God is pleaſed
to begin to Reveal the Bleſſed things of the Goſpel to,
and to give your Hearts to Entertain them, and yet you
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104282:110"/>
Live in wicked Families; Do you Labour to be Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
to the Family: Improve what God hath given you,
for the good of the Family. And do you Walk ſo, as
to manifeſt the Power of the Goſpel, that your Souls
doth Entertain, that you may Live convincingly in the
Family where you Live? And though they do Hate and
Scorn you for the preſent, yet with your humble Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they may be forced to ſay, Verily God is Working
upon this Servant, and God is Working upon this Child.
It ſhould be the Care of Children, or Servants, or Wives,
or Huſbands, that live among ſuch as are Wicked,
when God begins to Work upon them, they muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
careful to hold forth the Glory, and Beauty of the
Goſpel in their Lives, to Convince thoſe that they Live
withal. And you that are in ſuch a Family, if God doth
begin to ſtir any in the Family, do you Improve them
to the uttermoſt you can: And howſoever you may think
there is little in it, yet when God begins to ſtir the Heart
of one, Salvation may be come to the Houſe; and
the Lord doth expect that you ſhould Improve that
Work of His upon your own Hearts, or otherwiſe your
Conſciences will Terrifie you another day. O, I ſaw God
working upon my Fellow-Servant, or Brother, or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
but I neglected it, otherwiſe my Soul might have
had good. And ſo much for that Note: <hi>If the Son of
Peace be there, your Peace ſhall reſt upon it:</hi> That is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Family.</p>
            <p>The laſt Note is, <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and into whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Houſe, or City you enter, do thus and thus: And if
the Son of Peace be there, your Peace ſhall reſt upon it.</hi>
That is, You ſhall be made an Inſtrument of good unto
them, ſo as to bring the glorious Peace of the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them. From whence the Note is this:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:104282:110"/>
That it is a great Encouragement to the Miniſters of
the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> to think what abundance of good they may
do, if God ſhall be but pleaſed to Bleſs their Miniſtry.
Chriſt did foretel both His Diſciples and Apoſtles, that
they were like to have hard Work of it, in the Carrying
of His Name abroad in the World: But for their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
He tells them this; <hi>Go your way and
Preach, and if there be any Son of Peace, your Peace ſhall
reſt upon it.</hi> As if He ſhould ſay, You ſhall be made a
glorious Inſtrument of doing good unto them, and let
this be your Encouragement: And, indeed, it is a great
Encouragement for any Miniſter of God, to Venture his
very Life, and to do or Suffer any thing in the World;
though but upon this Suppoſition, That if God ſhall
be pleaſed but to Bleſs my Miniſtry, then the Lord ſhall
make me an Inſtrument to bring Peace to that place,
even Peace between God and their Souls; to be the Means
to Convey all the good unto them, that Jeſus Chriſt
hath Purchaſed by His Blood. This ſeem'd to be the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
that God gave to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 36.
And that was in another kind, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was to go and
reveal the Threats of God; but Mark what his Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
was, in <hi>ver. 3. It may be that the Houſe of</hi> Judah
<hi>will hear all the evil which I purpoſe to do unto them, that
they may return every man from his evil way, that I may
forgive their Iniquity and their Sin.</hi> Saith the Lord to
<hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Go about this Work, though it be a hard
Work, and let this be your Encouragement: <hi>It may be:</hi>
Though but upon <hi>a may be; The Houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>will
hear all the evil which I purpoſe to do unto them, that they
may return every man from his evil way, that I may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
their Iniquity and their Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this were <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Encouragement, ſurely a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:104282:111"/>
greater Encouragement it is for a Miniſter to go and
Preach the Goſpel upon a meer <hi>May be,</hi> that there are
ſome that ſhall Entertain the Goſpel. And we find
it was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Encouragement, in divers Scriptures as I
might ſhew you, but that's moſt Notable, in <hi>2 Tim.
1. 10. But is now made manifeſt by the appearing of our
Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath Aboliſhed Death, and
hath brought Life and Immortality to Light through the
Goſpel: Whereunto I am appointed a Preacher, and an
Apoſtle, and a Teacher of the Gentiles.</hi> Mark, ſaith He,
The Goſpel reveals Jeſus Chriſt, who hath Aboliſhed
Death, and hath brought Life and Immortality to light:
And, ſaith he, God hath appointed me to be a Teacher
of this, <hi>For the which Cauſe, I alſo ſuffer theſe things.</hi>
I am content to go on in this Work of the Goſpel what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
I ſuffer. What, Is this the Errand that I am ſent
about, to go and Preach the Goſpel, that brings Life
and Immortality to light? Let me Suffer what can be,
I am content to go on in this Work: O, It is a glorious
Errand that I am ſent about! If it pleaſe God I ſpeed
but upon one Soul, O, it were worth my Life. So the
excellent Fruit that ſhould come upon the Entertainment
of the Goſpel, is here given to theſe Diſciples for their
Encouragement in the Miniſtry. Now what is it that
ſhould Encourage the Heart of a Miniſter in his Work,
more than theſe Three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he ſhall be an Inſtrument to glorifie God.
Secondly, An Inſtrument to do good to Souls. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
He ſhall have a Crown of Glory ſo much the more.
Theſe Three things are the greateſt Encouragements in
the World, to any gracious Heart.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That he ſhall be an Inſtrument of the Glory of
God. For one to live to be Inſtrumental of the Glory of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:104282:111"/>
God muſt needs make his Life comfortable, whatſoever
he ſuffer. Now there can be no ſuch Glory that any
Creature can be made a greater Inſtrument of, than the
Glory that God hath from Souls that are Sav'd by Jeſus
Chriſt. It is the higheſt Glory that God hath from all
His Creatures, that there ſhould be ſome Souls that
ſhould underſtand Jeſus Chriſt, that ſhould admire at Him,
ſhould glorifie God in Jeſus Chriſt. It is the higheſt
Glory that God doth Injoy in Heaven, next unto the
Glory that He hath in Himſelf, and in His Son; that is,
in the Trinity: But for the Glory that He hath, <hi>Ab ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
from His Creatures, that is the higheſt Glory that
ever God had, or ſhall have. Now for the Lord to
make a Man to be an Inſtrument of this, To bring ſome
Souls to be Eternally Glorifying God for Jeſus Chriſt:
O, It is worth all a Mans Strength, though he ſhould ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
his Life Seven Years; yet if there be but One or Two
Souls brought by his Miniſtry, that ſhall Injoy the good
things in Chriſt, this is well worth the Labour and
Pains. For, indeed, in this the Lord doth honour Men
more than Angels: The Lord hath not put the Angels
in Heaven, upon ſuch an Honourable work as this, to
be the Embaſſadors of God and Chriſt, for Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
The Lord hath not committed the Word of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
to Angels, to go and Preach that in an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way: They are not Deputed by Chriſt, to be as His
Officers. We never read of any ſuch thing in the Word
of God, though they be ſometimes Appointed to be
Miniſtring Spirits for the good of Gods Elect, to Help
them, to Comfort them, to Avenge them of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
but we never read that the Word of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was Committed to them, and to the Miniſters of the
Goſpel: And therefore there is no ſuch Glory that they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:104282:112"/>
can bring to God, as the Lord is Pleaſed to make Man
to be an Inſtrument of. In this the Lord doth Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
Man more than the Angels, that he ſhall be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be the great Ordinance under Jeſus Chriſt,
for the bringing of Souls unto Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo the
bringing of them to Magnifie the Infinite Riches of the
Grace of God in Chriſt, to all Eternity. Now, Is not
this worth any ones Labour and Life? O what Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
is this, whatſoever one ſuffers in it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Can there be next unto this, a greater En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
than to be an Inſtrument of good to our
Brethren, of good to Mankind? Thoſe are the moſt
happy Men in the World, that are the moſt Uſeful for
Mankind, that the Lord ſhall be Pleaſed to make Uſe
of, for the good of Mankind; and therefore it ſhould
Teach all to be as Serviceable as they can to others.
For the Happineſs and the true Comfort of a Mans Life,
it doth not depend in this, That he can get an Eſtate,
and go Brave and Fine, and Eat and Drink of the beſt;
but it is in this, That the Lord will make him uſeful in
his place, an Inſtrument of good to others. It is a very
Comfortable thing for any, that are Chief in a place
where they Live, that the Lord makes them Inſtruments
of the Civil good of the places where they are: Of the
good of the People for their Bodies, to keep them in
Peace and Order: But to be Appointed by God to be
an Inſtrument of Soul-good, of Eternal good; this is
a higher Priviledge that God doth grant in His Mercy
to ſome. And it might be a mighty Encouragement, the
Conſidering of this. What ſaith Saint <hi>James,</hi> ſpeaking
to Chriſtians to Encourage them to Labour to do good
to their Brethren: <hi>Brethren, If any of you do erre from
the Truth, and one Convert him, Let him know that he
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:104282:112"/>
which Converteth a ſinner from the Errour of his Way,
ſhall ſave a Soul from Death, and ſhall hide a multitude of
ſins.</hi> Let him know, ſaith he, that he that Converteth a
ſinner from the Errour of his Way, <hi>Let him know:</hi> What
ſhall he know? That he ſhall ſave a Soul from Death,
and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins. Though it may be,
he takes a great deal of Pains, and ſuffers much in it;
yet for his Encouragement, <hi>Let him know that he ſhall
ſave a Soul, and hide a multitude of ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, If the other ſhould not be a ſufficient Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
yet for his own good; many times there is
much Self in the hearts of the beſt Miniſters. Now
there is theſe Two things that cannot but follow, if the
Lord Bleſs their Miniſtry, to bring the Peace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to any Soul.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Such a Soul will Bleſs God for him. Now for
a man to be ſo in the Hearts of the Saints of God, as
that he ſhould have them Bleſs the Lord for him, and
Bleſs the time that ever he ſaw him: <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord,
and Bleſſed be thou;</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Abigail,</hi> when it did
but hinder him in one ſin by her Counſel. But now, If ſo
be the Lord doth Bleſs the Miniſtry of the Goſpel to
any, ſo that the Peace of Jeſus Chriſt comes to the Soul,
there is not the hinderance of <hi>one</hi> ſin, but of <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes;</hi>
and there is the obtaining of the Pardon of all
ſins: And therefore how much more Cauſe have they
to ſay, Bleſſed be God, and Bleſſed be thou, and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be thy Counſel, and Bleſſed be thy Miniſtry: Here's
a great Encouragement in this, They through whoſe
Miniſtry Souls comes to be Bleſſed, they will Bleſs them,
and Bleſs God for them.</p>
            <p>And further, At the great Day of Jeſus Chriſt, they
ſhall have abundance of Joy in thoſe that God made
them Inſtrumental of good unto. In <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. you have
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:104282:113"/>
a Notable Text for that, ſaith the Apoſtle, in way of
Exhortation to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> to hold forth the Word
of Life, in <hi>ver. 16. Holding forth the Word of Life, that
I may rejoyce in the Day of Chriſt; that I have not run in
vain, neither laboured in vain:</hi> Saith he, If you do
thus and thus, and ſhew forth the Power of the Grace
of God, that God hath been pleaſed to Bleſs my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.
If you do ſo, why then I ſhall rejoyce. O, do
you ſhew forth the Power and Efficacy of the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel, of that Miniſtry of mine upon you:
Why? That I may rejoyce in the Day of Chriſt, that
I have not Run in vain, neither Laboured in vain: So
that where the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is Bleſſed to any
People, there thoſe Miniſters being Faithful themſelves,
ſhall rejoyce in the Day of Jeſus Chriſt, that they have
not Run in vain.</p>
            <p>Therefore to Wind this up, It ſhould be one ſtrong
Motive to People, to Imbrace the Miniſtry of the Goſpel,
even for the Encouragement of thoſe whom the Lord
doth ſend among them, that they may be willing to
draw forth their Hearts, and to venture their Lives
among them. As, certainly, not one Man of Forty,
of a Hundred ſcarce, that ſhould Preach to ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
as this, but muſt expect a Venturing of his
Life in it: But lot this Meſſage be but Entertain'd, it
will be thought to be throughly Recompenced. For
it will be a Joy to thoſe that do Venture themſelves
among you: It will be a Joy in the Day of Jeſus Chriſt,
that they have not Run in vain. But we leave that
Point, and come to the laſt Part of the Text.</p>
            <p>If the Son of Peace be there, your Peace ſhall reſt upon
it: <hi>But what if not?</hi> If not, it ſhall turn to you again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:104282:113"/>
O, that this ſhould be heard, <hi>If not:</hi> This is a ſad
Suppoſition indeed, <hi>If not.</hi> What ſhall the Lord ſend
Embaſſadors of Peace? The Lord from Heaven ſend to
His poor Creatures the Miniſtry of His Goſpel, and
offer Peace between their Souls and Himſelf, Purchaſed
by the Blood of His Son: And ſhall it be ſaid, <hi>If not?</hi>
If there be any that will not Imbrace it? Is it poſſible
that Jeſus Chriſt, whereſoever He comes, ſhould not be
Entertain'd? Truly, this very Suppoſition that there
ſhould be a Poſſibility for any Soul to whom Chriſt is
Revealed, ever to reject; doth Argue the extream
ſinfulneſs of the Hearts of Men. O, Woe to us that
ſuch a thing ſhould be ſuppoſed as poſſible, <hi>If not:</hi> That
Chriſt ſhould come to any place and ſhould not be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd:
What, that the Miniſtry of the Goſpel ſhould
come and be Rejected, when as it is nothing elſe but the
bringing of the Meſſage of Peace to a People, between
God and them. They may think, perhaps, that it comes
to trouble them: But the Truth is, The Errand of all
the Miniſters of the Goſpel among People, it is no
other in the Concluſion, and in the Iſſue, but to bring
Eternal Peace to their Souls: And ſhall this be Rejected?
Sometimes it is ſo. Now in this we have theſe Three
things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, A ſad Suppoſition, that ſometimes the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel comes where it is rejected by ſome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Encouragement of Miniſters in this
Caſe: Chriſt doth not only Encourage them in caſe their
Miniſtry prevails, that then they ſhall be Inſtruments of
ſo much good to Souls; but He doth Encourage them
in caſe it doth not prevail. As if the Diſciples ſhould
ſay, I indeed, If our Miniſtry prevails that we may bring
Peace to Souls, we have enough: But what if not? <hi>It
ſhall return to you again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:104282:114"/>
And then, Thirdly, A dreadful Denunciation againſt
all thoſe that do not Entertain the Goſpel: And that is,
That they ſhall have no Benefit of the Peace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:
That the Miniſtry of the Goſpel ſhall be taken from
them, and that God will be very Quick in His dealings
with them.</p>
            <p>Now then at this time for the Firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, If not:</hi> This ſad Suppoſition. From hence the
Point of Doctrine, or Note of Obſervation, is this:</p>
            <p>That the Goſpel doth ſometimes go to places,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
of the Goſpel is ſometimes ſent to places where it
is rejected by Men: As before, <hi>If the Son of Peace,</hi> that
ſuppoſes that where God doth ſend the Goſpel, there
are ſome Sons of Peace. So, <hi>If not;</hi> here's a Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, may be ſent to a
place, and yet there may be ſome that will reject this
bleſſed Miniſtery. You know what is ſaid of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
And well then may it be ſaid of them he ſends to
Preach: <hi>When Chriſt Himſelf came to his own</hi> John 1. <hi>his
own received him not: His own,</hi> Thoſe that he had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
right in, the People of the Jews; even ſuch as
were the only people that did profeſs the true God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the Earth: I beſeech you obſerve it, When
Jeſus Chriſt came into the World, there was but a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of people upon the face of the Earth, that did ſo
much as profeſs the worſhip of the true God, but the
generallity of all the world, except a little Country of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
that was a matter of Fourſcore Miles one way, and
but a very little another way; except that little Country,
there was none upon the face of the Earth but worſhipped
the Devil; went according to the Immaginations of their
own hearts, did not ſo much as acknowledge God in
his worſhip; onely I ſay, there was a little handful of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:104282:114"/>
people in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and Chriſt came to them, they were his own; you would
think ſurely if Chriſt comes to them, ſeeing all the
World elſe are Idolaters, they will entertain him. No,
when Chriſt came Himſelf, the Bleſſed Son of God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our nature upon him, who was the Brightneſs of the
Glory of his Father; yet his own did not receive him.
And we find it ſaid directly, that Chriſt in his Miniſtery,
in <hi>Luke</hi> 2. ſhould be for a Stumbling-block to many,
in <hi>ver. 34. And</hi> Simeon <hi>bleſſed them, and ſaid unto</hi>
Mary <hi>his Mother, Behold, this Child is ſet for the Fall
and Riſing again of many in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and for a Sign which
ſhall be ſpoken againſt.</hi> You have little cauſe therefore
to be Diſcouraged, becauſe you are ſpoken againſt.
And we find that Chriſt Himſelf Preaching what poor
Entertainment He had, no Marvel then, if this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
be concerning His Diſciples: <hi>If not.</hi> It may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be, that ſome will not receive your Miniſtry? Do
but obſerve what Entertainment Chriſt Himſelf had
ſometimes, when He went to Preach Himſelf, in <hi>Luke
4.</hi> 29. You have there the Hiſtory of a moſt Excellent
Sermon, that Jeſus Chriſt Preached; and when He had
done His Sermon, do but ſee what requital He had, as
ſoon as He had done, the Text ſaith, <hi>And all they in
the Synagogue when they heard theſe things, were filled
with wrath, and roſe up, and thruſt him out of the City,
and led him unto the brow of the Hill (whereon their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was built) that they might caſt him down headlong.</hi>
They ſought to break his neck as ſoon as he had done,
ſo that you ſee how he came to his own and his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him not. And in <hi>Luke 16. 14:</hi> there you ſhall ſee
his Entertainment; upon another Sermon, the Text ſaith,
<hi>And the Phariſees alſo who were Covetous, heard all theſe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:104282:115"/>
things:</hi> And what then? <hi>And they derided Him.</hi> The
<hi>Greek</hi> word is, <hi>They blew their. Noſes at Him:</hi> They
Snuffled in their Noſes at Him: They Scorned Him, as
we expreſs Scorn and Contempt, by Blowing the Noſe.
This is the Propriety of the Word that in your <hi>Engliſh</hi> is
Tranſlated, <hi>They derided Him.</hi> And who were theſe?
The <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that were the moſt ſeeming Righteous
Men that did live; and the greateſt Scholars, and thoſe
that Liv'd the moſt Honeſtly among Men. And why
did they deride Him? But only becauſe they were Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous.
You ſhall have, not only Covetous Men, but
any who live in a way of ſin, if the Miniſtry of the
Word comes againſt that ſin, they will ſecretly Scorn
and Contemn the Word: Thus they did to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Paul,</hi> you may ſee when he came to Preach
the Goſpel, what Entertainment he had: St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he
was the moſt Famous Preacher that ever Liv'd upon the
Face of the Earth, next unto Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Auſtine</hi> had
three Wiſhes, and one of them was: That he might
have ſeen <hi>Paul</hi> in the Pulpit, and heard him Preach; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was a Man of ſuch an admirable Spirit. But I
ſhall ſhew you what Entertainment the Preaching of <hi>Paul</hi>
had, who was ſuch an admirable Preacher. There are
a great many Scriptures to ſhew the hard Entertainment
that <hi>Paul</hi> had, in <hi>Acts 13. 44, 45. And the next Sabboth
Day, came almoſt the whole City together to hear the Word
of God.</hi> There was a ſtrange Preacher came among
them, and there came a mighty Company, the whole
City; that is, the Generality of the City came together
to hear the Word of God. But mark, in <hi>ver. 45. But
when the Jews ſaw the Multitude, they were filled with
Envie, and ſpake againſt thoſe things which were ſpoken
by</hi> Paul, <hi>Contradicting, and Blaſpheming.</hi> Juſt thus it
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:104282:115"/>
was with the <hi>Jews,</hi> they were filled with Envy, and
ſpoke againſt thoſe things which were ſpoken by <hi>Paul,</hi>
Contradicting and Blaſpheming. It were endleſs to
ſhew you all his hard Entertainment, how he was put
in the Priſon, and in the Stocks, and Whipt, as if he
had been a very Rogue; when as, ever ſince the World
began, the Lord had never a more Glorious Inſtrument,
to ſhew forth His Praiſe; and yet he was Whipt up and
down like a Rogue, and ſcarce a Ragg to hang upon his
Back; he was accounted the Off-ſcowring of the World.
But there is a moſt Notable thing about <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry,
if you Compare two Scriptures together, in <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 9.
with what follows: <hi>And a Viſion appeared to</hi> Paul <hi>in the
Night: There ſtood a man of</hi> Macedonia, <hi>and prayed him,
ſaying, Come over into</hi> Macedonia <hi>and help us. Paul</hi> had
a mighty ſtrong Call to go and Preach to <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
he had a Viſion by Night. And it was not a Deluſion,
but even the Voice of God which did call to <hi>Paul,</hi> Come
over to <hi>Macedonia</hi> and help us: Therefore, ſaith the
Text, <hi>Immediately we endeavoured to go into</hi> Macedonia,
<hi>aſſuredly gathering, that the Lord had Called us for to
Preach the Goſpel unto them.</hi> We were ſure that God had
Called us, and this was a very ſtrong Call. Now you
will ſay, What <hi>Paul?</hi> Such a Preacher, and had ſuch a
ſtrong Call: Certainly, he would prevail with them all,
and bring them all Home. But, Mark, what the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry was, in <hi>ver. 12. And from thence
to</hi> Philippy, <hi>which is the Chief City of that part of</hi> Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,
<hi>and a Colony: And we were in that City, abiding
certain dayes.</hi> Here's no mention of any Fruit of his
Miniſtry: There we ſat certain dayes, to wait what op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
we might have to Preach the Goſpel there.
And in <hi>ver. 13. And on the Sabboth, we went out of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:104282:116"/>
City by a Rivers ſide, where Prayer was wont to be made;
and we ſat down, and ſpake unto the Women which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted
thither.</hi> Mark, It ſeems he had no Opportunity
to Preach in the City, they had no mind to hear him:
But, ſaith he, on the Sabboth-day we went out of the
City by the Rivers ſide, and we ſat down and ſpake to
the Women: There were but a Company of poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the great ones of the City, they would not come;
but a Company of Women came to us, and yet <hi>Paul</hi> had
this mighty Call of God. And when he comes to the
chief City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he was forced to go out of the
City if he would Preach; and there comes a few Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and among theſe Women, ſaith the Text, <hi>ver. 14.
A certain Woman named</hi> Lydia, <hi>a Seller of Purple, of the
City of</hi> Thyatira, <hi>which Worſhipped God, heard us:
Whoſe Heart the Lord opened, that ſhe attended unto the
things which were ſpoken of</hi> Paul. Here's the fruit of
his Miniſtry, <hi>A certain Woman.</hi> Among them all, none
but the Women would come: And among theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
there was a <hi>certain Woman,</hi> one poor Woman cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Lydia,</hi> and it pleaſed God to open her Heart: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
If God had opened the Hearts of any other, they
would have been mentioned as well. And you ſhall
find that <hi>Paul</hi> had very ill Entertainment among the reſt
of the Multitude, <hi>ver. 22. And the Multitude roſe up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
againſt them</hi> (ſee what Entertainment he had)
<hi>and the Magiſtrates Rent off their Clothes, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Beat them. And when they had laid many Stripes
upon them, they caſt them into Priſon, charging the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
to keep them ſafely. Who having received ſuch a charge,
thruſt them into the Inner Priſon, and made their Feet
faſt in the Stocks.</hi> Here's the Man that had ſuch a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Call of God by a Viſion from Heaven, and yet you
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:104282:116"/>
ſee how his Miniſtry doth prevail. Thus you ſee, that
the Goſpel may be ſent to Places, and that by a ſtrange
Work of Gods Providence, and yet a very few Imbrace
it; yea, it may be Rejected by the greateſt part. I
might ſhew unto you Examples of the ſame kind: And
juſt as it was with the Apoſtles, ſo it was with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.
As thoſe Three Famous Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi>
and <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> See the working of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Miniſtry,
in <hi>Iſa. 53. Who hath believed our Report, and to whom is
the Arm of the Lord Revealed.</hi> We come and Preach
things to the People, and they come and hear us, and think
they are very ſtrange things that they hear the Miniſter
ſay, but they do not believe it. Who doth believe it?
Yea, you know that the Lord doth Complain, that He
did ſtreach out His Hands even all the Day, <hi>Iſa. 65. 2.
I have ſpread out my Hands all the Day, unto a Rebellious
People, which Walketh in a Way that is not good, after
their own Thoughts. I ſpread out my Hands:</hi> That is,
I come in my Miniſtry, ſaith God by His Prophet, and
I there open the Arms of my Mercy, and open the
Riches of my Grace to their Souls; but they Walk in
Wayes that are not good. And what Wayes were
they? <hi>According to their own Thoughts.</hi> Look what
their own Thoughts are, and what is moſt pleaſing to
them. They more regard their own Thoughts, than all
thoſe Bleſſed and Glorious Truths, that are made known
unto them in the Miniſtry of the Word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as for</hi> Jeremiah <hi>you have it in</hi> Chap. 20. ver. 8.
<hi>you have very ſtrange kind of Expreſſions about him:</hi>
Since I ſpake, I cried out, I cried Violence and Spoil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Word of the Lord was made a Reproach unto me,
and a Deriſion daily. <hi>O the Word of the Lord was
made a Reproach and a Deriſion to</hi> Jeremiah.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:104282:117"/>
And for <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> do but read <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
and there you ſhall find, that God tells him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
that He did ſend him to a Rebellious Houſe;
yea, God told him that he ſhould Live among Bryars and
Thorns. And yet it is obſervable, That this Prophet
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> did Propheſie in the time of their Captivity,
was ſent unto the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were in
Captivity. One would have thought, that in the time
of their Affliction, that if ever they would have attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Word of the Lord, then they would. No:
But in the time when they were in Captivity, when God
had fulfilled the words that were Threatned by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Prophets; though they ſaw how God had made
good His Words by the former Prophets, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
a Rebellious People. O this was an extream
thing! It was not ſo much for them to reject <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>
that did Propheſie of their Captivity; I, he tells us of
nothing but Judgments, but we hope God is a more
Merciful God; and upon that perhaps they rejected
Him, I, but ſurely when they were in Captivity, now
they ſhould, one would have thought, acknowledged
that to the Lord belongs Glory, but to us nothing but
Shame and Confuſion. No: But yet their Hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
hard, as a Brick in the Fire, it is harder for the
Fire; and ſo were their Hearts in the time of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
I ſhall not need to Inſtance in any further par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
it is clear that God ſends the Miniſtry of the
Goſpel to places ſometimes, where it may be it will be
rejected. Now for the Opening of the Point, there are
theſe Two things I intended.</p>
            <p>Firſt, How it comes to paſs that it is Rejected, or why
Men do Reject the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What's the Reaſon that God will ſend it
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:104282:117"/>
to thoſe places, that He knows before-hand that it will
not be Entertain'd.</p>
            <p>The Lord ſends the Miniſtry of Peace, the Offer of
Peace by Jeſus Chriſt to Souls, and yet they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it, but caſt it off. Becauſe indeed, Firſt, The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallity
of People, they do not know God, they do
not know that they have to deal with an Infinite and
Glorious God in all their wayes; they do not know
whom it is that they have ſinned againſt, and therefore do
not underſtand their danger; and upon this the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel is but a dry thing unto them: Whereas,
did but the Souls of Men and Women, underſtand what
an Infinite and a Glorious Majeſty, they had to deal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
and thereby what a dreadful thing it is, to have the
Wrath of God to be revealed to their Souls, they would
hearken to the Miniſtry of the Word. That this is the
Reaſon, it appears, in <hi>John 15. 20, 21. Saith Chriſt to
his Diſciples, Remember the Word that I ſaid unto you,
The Servant is not greater than the Lord: If they have
Perſecuted me, they will alſo Peſecute you: If they have
kept my ſaying, they will keep yours alſo:</hi> But now,
Mark, ver. 21. <hi>But all theſe things will they do unto you
for my Names ſake, becauſe they know not Him that ſent
me.</hi> Here's the Reaſon why they will do thus unto you,
they will be far from entertaining of you, but will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
oppoſe you: Why? <hi>Becauſe they know not Him
that ſent me.</hi> As if He ſhould ſay, Did they but know
Him that ſent me, did they but know what a God the Lord
is, what the Father is, what an Infinite Majeſty, and
dreadful Deity they have to deal withal; did they but
underſtand that, certainly they would not caſt you out:
But they will not entertain you, <hi>Becauſe they know not
Him that ſent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:104282:118"/>
Secondly, There is nothing that doth diſcover more
the Vileneſs of ſin, than the Goſpel. O the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Preached aright, (I ſay) nothing in the World can
diſcover the hainouſneſs of ſin, the Vileneſs, the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Nature of ſin, more than the Goſpel. All the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the Law, and the Curſes of the Law, cannot
diſcover ſo much of the dreadfulneſs of the Evil of ſin,
as the Goſpel: And we know that Men that love their
ſin, cannot endure that which doth diſcover the Evil
of it.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, How doth the Goſpel diſcover ſo
much of the Evil of ſin?</p>
            <p>Certainly, You may ſee more of the evil of ſin, by
the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, than by the dreadful Threats
of the Law: For the Goſpel ſhews that ſin makes ſuch
a dreadful Breach between God and the Creature, that
only the Son of God made Man, and put under a Curſe,
can make up the Breach again: In the Red-glaſs of the
Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, that is Preached to you in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
of the Goſpel the evil of ſin, is more fully diſcerned,
than in the bright Cryſtal-glaſs of the Law; that doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
ſomewhat, but this ſhews you more: It ſhews you
that thoſe beloved ſins of yours that you have Imbrac'd,
and have had a great deal of Sweetneſs and Gain by,
O they are ſuch Snakes and Vipers in your Boſom, as
makes ſuch a Breach between God and your Soul; that
only the Son of God, paying an Infinite price for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
for theſe, can take away from you.</p>
            <p>And further, The Goſpel doth diſcover more to Debaſe
a Man, than any thing can poſſibly be Imagined: There
is nothing that doth more diſcover that which may
Abaſe Men, and bring them Low, and make them Vile
in their own Eyes, than the Goſpel. Why? The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:104282:118"/>
doth ſhew unto them, that they are by Nature the
Enemies to God. It is the Goſpel doth diſcover that,
becauſe it is the Doctrine of Reconciliation, and it
doth diſcover, that all a Mans Righteouſneſs is nothing,
his own Righteouſneſs is nothing in point of Salvation,
for Juſtification; that whatſoever Righteouſneſs a Man
hath by common Gifts, by his good Nature, it will not
ſerve his turn in the Day of Jeſus Chriſt, he may periſh
notwithſtanding: It takes a Man off from all his Civil
Righteouſneſs, and ſo makes him to be as a vile wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Creature before the Lord, and one that muſt lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
meer pure Mercy, or elſe muſt periſh to all Eternity:
whatſoever he thought himſelf, he muſt be taken from
his own bottom, even from that which his Soul Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd,
and was as dear unto him as his own Soul, he
muſt be taken from all: O now, this is a hard ſaying,
and who can bear it.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel doth teach Self-denial, that we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
our own Excellency, every beloved Luſt, and to be
nothing in a Mans own Eyes. I, indeed, it is the firſt
Leſſon of the Goſpel; ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If any man will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me, let them deny themſelves.</hi> Now Men naturally
are Proud and Haughty, and what, for them to come
and appear before the Lord as vile wretched Caitiffs in
themſelves, and to have all their Righteouſneſs to be
counted as filthy Rags; now to ſee that they muſt be
Sav'd by a Righteouſneſs that is above them, and beyond
them, and without them: O this is very hard.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel requires Conditions that are very hard
to Fleſh and Blood, that we muſt be willing to Sell and
part with all for Chriſt, as the wiſe Merchant did.</p>
            <p>And beſides, It is a very high Myſtery, a thing that is
above the reach of any Natural Man living; and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:104282:119"/>
Generally are of Slight, Vain, and Proud Spirits.
Now being partly Slight and Vain, and partly Proud,
they will not bend their Minds to dive into thoſe things
that they are not preſently able to read. It is that My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
that the Angels do ſtoop down to pry into, and it
requires a great deal of pains to behold the Glory of
God in it. Now the Vain, and Droſſy, and Proud hearts
of Men and Women, they paſs it over lightly, becauſe
they ſee no preſent need of it: They Thrive and injoy
their Eſtates, and they are well enough for the Fleſh;
and all things that are Savory to them, they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their hearts deſire; and what need have
they to trouble themſelves. Many other things might
be named, to ſhew that when the Goſpel comes to places,
why it is not entertained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, Why doth God ſend it,
God knows it will not be entertain'd; it is not with God
as it is with us, to go to a place at paradventures? It is
ſaid, <hi>If</hi> they hear them: There can be no Ifs with God,
God knows every thing. Now if God knows that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Man comes, it will not be entertain'd, why doth
God ſend it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To that I Anſwer, Firſt, That Gods Wayes
and Judgments are Unſearchable, and paſt finding out in
this thing. For, indeed, there is nothing wherein God
doth appear more Wonderful in His Wayes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
paſt finding out, than in this, in ſending the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
ſometimes to a place, where He ſees it will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail;
and denies it to another place, where He ſees that
if it were among them, it would be likely more to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
You will ſay, This is ſtrange; and yet this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
This is the Adminiſtrations of God, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
God denies the Goſpel to a place where He doth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:104282:119"/>
ſee, that if He ſent it they would Entertain it more, and
ſends it to another place where He ſees they will not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
it. Now to make this out by Scripture, that
Text is clear for it, in <hi>Mat. 11. 21. Wo unto thee,</hi> Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razin,
<hi>Wo unto thee,</hi> Bethſaida, <hi>for if the mighty Works
which were done in you, had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<hi>they would have Repented long ago in Sack-cloth and
Aſhes.</hi> It is a ſtrange Speech, almoſt as any one that is
in Scripture: Here's <hi>Chorazin,</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> have the
Goſpel ſent to them, and they did not Entertain it: Saith
Chriſt, <hi>If the Works that were done in you, had been done
in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sydon, <hi>they would have Repented, and yet
I denied it to them, and ſent it to you.</hi> Now there can
be no Reaſon given of this, but only this: The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God are unſearchable, and His Wayes paſt
finding out; Gods Mercies are His own, the Goſpel is
His own, and He will ſend it where He pleaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> But then, Secondly, The Lord ſends His Goſpel:
For though perhaps it be rejected for the generallity, yet
there may ſome one Soul Entertain it, among a People
that ſhall ſo much reject it, and for the ſake of that one,
God may ſend it: God may ſend Miniſters to a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
to ſpend their very Heart, and Strength, and
Life, and it may be may intend ſome one or two Souls,
that are as unlikely as others; perhaps ſome one or two
poor Servant or Child, and it is worth the Life of any
Man, if he may be Bleſt to call home one or two in his
Life time. You know the Lord lets it Rain, and the
Intendment of the Rain, it is to Water the Earth; but
abundance of it falls upon Tiles, and Stones, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it falls upon your Beds in your Gardens, and the
Intendment, I ſay, is for the benefit of the Ground.
So the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, Gods chief Intent is for
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:104282:120"/>
the good of Souls, though God cauſes the Miniſtry of
it to be generally: The Goſpel is Preached to Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and for the generallity it doth but as it were
Rain upon the Tiles and Stones; I, but there are ſome
Beds that have ſome good Seeds in them, and God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
them. If you water your Gardens in theſe dry
times, you aim at the Herbs, but yet the Water will fall
among the Weeds: So the Lord He Aims at His Herbs and
Flowers, though the Goſpel be diſpenſed to others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Though God ſees there be none for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
yet God layes in for time to come: God will ſend
His Goſpel to a place, though He ſees this Generation
will get no good by it; and God may Intend the good
of the Generation that is to come, by ſending His Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
in this particular Generation; though He ſees that
they will not Entertain it, yet ſome that may come after
them, may Entertain it. As they ſay in <hi>China,</hi> they
prepare Work for many Hundred years before: The
Parents they are preparing Work for their Children to
enjoy. And ſo the Lord layes In, in one Generation,
for the Children that are coming after, and therefore
whether you Entertain it or no, God notwithſtanding
will have His End accompliſht.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another Reaſon why God ſends His Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
where He knows it will not be Entertain'd by the
Generallity, it is this, To leave Men wholly without
Excuſe. I may put theſe two together, To diſcover the
Abominable ſinfulneſs of the Hearts of Men, and to
leave them wholly without Excuſe. There is nothing
in the World that doth diſcover the ſinfulneſs of Mans
Heart, more than this, That when the Lord ſends this
Goſpel among them, yet it is rejected. The Preaching
of any Moral Truths, do nothing ſo much argue the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:104282:120"/>
ſinfulneſs of Mans Heart in the rejection of them, as
when the Goſpel is Preached, and that is rejected. That
argues the Abominable wickedneſs of Mans Heart, yea,
for ought we know, more than is in the very Devil.
We do not know that there is ſo much Perverſneſs in any
of the Devils in Hell, as there is in the Heart of that
Man that doth reject the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. And
why? Becauſe God never tried them, God never put
it to trial, to offer any Terms of Peace to them, and
never told them that He would be Reconcil'd to them
upon any Terms: And therefore whether they have ſuch
perverſeneſs of heart or no, it is not diſcovered ſo as
thine is. But if thou Liveſt where the Miniſtry of the
Goſpel is Preached, and yet continueſt wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
thou art diſcovered to have that wickedneſs in
thy Heart; that for ought thou knoweſt, it is beyond
the wickedneſs of any Devil in Hell. The Devils might
ſay, Lord, hadſt thou offered Terms of Peace to us,
we would not have ſo rejected it: And then it doth
leave Men utterly without Excuſe. I do not ſay, that
this is Gods primary Intention, but this comes in: Why,
the Lord doth ſuffer the Goſpel to be Preached, to leave
them wholly without Excuſe. And for that, you have
that Text in the fore-named place, <hi>John 15. 22. If I
had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin:
But now have they no Cloak for their ſin.</hi> Sin: Why are
there any Men in the World that have no ſin? Why, did
Chriſt coming bring ſin to them? It did not add ſin, but
it did Diſcover their ſin, and it took away their Cloak
for their ſin: Now upon my coming to them, and when
they ſhall reject me, and the offer of Grace that I bring
from my Father; now they have ſin to purpoſe, now
their ſin is of a Scarlet Colour, now they have no Plea,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:104282:121"/>
they cannot ſay, Lord, if thou hadſt ſent to us, to Reveal
to us thy Mercy, and the danger of our ſin. The danger
of your ſin, may God ſay: Did not I ſend thoſe to you
that did Preach, that nothing but the Heart Blood
of my Son, could pacifie for your ſin. Could there have
been any thing more to reveal the evil of your ſin, than
this was? O now you have no Excuſe at all for your ſin.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Another Reaſon is this, which is one of the
chief: That the Lord might cauſe all thoſe hereby that
do not entertain the Goſpel, to ſee the Freeneſs of His
Grace towards them. A poor Soul that the Lord is
pleaſed to work upon by the Goſpel, hath no cauſe to
attribute any thing to himſelf: There are others, and
ſuch a Multitude of People, more Learned than I, and
Men and Women that had greater parts than I, they had
the Goſpel preached to them, and they do not ſee thoſe
things that the Lord hath Revealed to me: I can tell no
Reaſon of this Difference, only Free-grace. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
Thoſe People whom God is pleaſed to make the
Goſpel effectual, upon the hearing of this Point, and
ſeeing how it is Verified in the Examples of others; O
they have cauſe to Cry out, Grace, Grace, to the Lord.
What is there in me rather than others; as Proud, and
Stout, and Vile Hearts as any; and we ſee the Goſpel is
rejected by them: and what reaſon is it that it is not ſo
with me? <hi>John</hi> 14. 22. It's a ſpeech of <hi>Judas,</hi> (not of
him that betrayed Chriſt) <hi>Lord, How is it that thou Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeſt
thy Self unto us, and not unto the World?</hi> Lord,
We cannot deviſe how it ſhould be, that thou ſhouldſt
Manifeſt thy Self to us, and not unto the World: We
ſee that the World rejects Thee: O this is, that we may
have the more Cauſe to Bleſs the Name of God here, and
to Magnifie His Free-grace to all Eternity afterwards.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> IS it ſo, that even the Bleſſed Miniſtry of the
Goſpel, the Opening of Jeſus Chriſt, and
the Riches of Gods Grace may be Rejected
by People, and is often. The Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of this Firſt, ſhould Teach us to bewail the horrible
Wickedneſs of Mans Heart, and the Diſhonour that is
done to God in this: When thoſe Riches of Gods Grace,
that glorious Work of God in Chriſt, the Bleſſed Son of
God, coming to Ranſom Souls, and to Deliver them out
of the neathermoſt Hell; yet he Rejected. There's
no Object that ever was in the World, that is ſuch an
Object of Lamentation as this is. When Chriſt came
to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> He falls a Weeping: Upon what
ground? <hi>O, if thou hadſt known,</hi> ſaith He, <hi>at leaſt in
this thy day, thoſe things that concern thy Peace: Thou
didſt not know thoſe things that did concern thy
Peace.</hi> Perhaps it may be meant, outward Peace. In
great part it is. But if that be ſuch an Object of Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as to draw Tears from Chriſt, what an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:104282:122"/>
of Lamentation is it to Rend, indeed, the Hearts of
thoſe that underſtand what Chriſt is, what the Offer of
Chriſt means; That Chriſt ſhould be Preached in any
place, and yet rejected. When <hi>Jeremiah</hi> went to Preach
(though not ſuch a Meſſage as this is that now we are
Speaking of) yet when he ſaw the People would not
hear, <hi>Chap. 13. ver. 15. Hear ye and give ear, be not
Proud, for the Lord hath Spoken.</hi> But in ver. 17. <hi>But if
ye will not hear it, my Soul ſhall weep in ſecret places for
your Pride, and mine Eyes ſhall weep ſore, and run down
with Tears, becauſe the Lords Flock is carried away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
If ye will not hear:</hi> That indeed ſhould be the
work of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, when they are
Rejected. Not to be Careleſs, and ſay, I have done my
Work, and what need I care. But they ſhould take it
to Heart, and Lament it as the greateſt Affliction that
can befal them; yea, more than any Affliction whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
That the Bleſſed Meſſage that they are ſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
is Rejected by Wretched and Sinful Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If God in Chriſt be ſometimes Rejected,
all the Mercy of God in His Son; we ſhould not think
much, though our love and kindneſs towards others be
many times Slighted, and Diſregarded. Indeed, there's
nothing goes more to any Ingenuous Heart, than to have
his love and kindneſs to be Diſregarded: But when we
find our Hearts troubled at this, O that ſuch a one that
I have done ſo much for, and yet that he ſhould deal thus
with me; Lay thine hand upon thy Heart, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what God hath done for thee in Chriſt, and how ill
thou haſt requited Him. Is it ſo much for thee a poor
Worm, not to have thy Love and Kindneſs imbrac'd:
What is it then for the Infinite God, not to have that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104282:122"/>
Infinite Love and Mercy of His to the Children of Men,
not Imbraced but Rejected?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let's learn from hence, never to truſt our
own Hearts. We think often, had we ſuch means as
others have, then we ſhould not do as they do; ſurely
we ſhould do better. Men are very ready to truſt their
own Hearts, and in the uſe of Means: But let us learn
from hence never to truſt in our own Hearts, or in the uſe
of any Means. God may ſend you Means, and Reveal
glorious Truths unto you; yet it may ſo fall out, that
you may never come to be partakers of the good of
thoſe things: It hath been ſo with many, and you muſt
look to your own Hearts. Do not Bleſs your ſelves in
this, Through Gods Mercy the Lord hath ſent us His
Word plentifully, and the Goſpel comes to be Opened
clearly among us: That's not enough, what God hath
done, but look you into your own Hearts, how you <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace</hi>
it; otherwiſe the Goſpel may come among you,
and yet you never come to be Saved by it. But this,
indeed, is a ſad Condition, whereſoever it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Further, Gods Miniſters are to Learn from
hence, not to be Diſcouraged. They come and Preach,
and with an Expectation to prevail with the Hearts of
People, to draw them to Chriſt. When they have been
in their Studies, labouring to find out ſome Truths of
the Goſpel, and to ſit it to the Hearts of their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and have been Praying over it: They come now
with Expectation that ſome good may be done, that ſome
Soul may be drawn in to Chriſt, yet perhaps find it quite
otherwiſe, and the People to ſit Dead under it; it may
be Slight it, Contemn it, Scorn it, Diſobey it: But they
muſt not be, I ſay, Diſcouraged in this, as if ſo be a ſtrange
thing had befallen them. What art thou more than
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:104282:123"/>
Jeſus Chriſt thy Maſter? What art thou more than <hi>Paul</hi> and
other of the Apoſtles? They have been rejected all in their
Miniſtry, and what art thou that thou canſt not bear any
Rejection? Indeed, it is the hardeſt thing to be Born by a
Miniſter of the Goſpel, that poſſibly may be: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
That it is not a new thing for the Goſpel, to be
Rejected. I remember, I have read of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> he
had ſuch thoughts, that when he began to Preach, he
ſhould Convert all that heard him. He thought there
was ſo much Reaſon in what he Spake, and ſo much Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Power to prevail with the Hearts of People,
that he thought he ſhould prevail with every one; but
he found it otherwiſe by Experience. And though, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
when any Miniſter that is acquainted with the
Glorious things of God and Chriſt, come to open them
to People, they are ready to think, ſuch things will
ſurely prevail with the Hearts of People, but the Lord
teaches him to know that the Bleſſing depends upon
Himſelf: That though the things be never ſo Excellent
and Moving, yet all will not do except the Lord comes
in by His Almighty Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let all thoſe with whom the Miniſtry of the
Goſpel doth prevail in any meaſure, Bleſs God that
makes ſuch a difference between them and any others.
It is Preached unto many, but doth them no good. But
the Lord hath Called thee out, and it hath ſtruck thy
Heart, converted thy Spirit: Thou ſeeſt cauſe to ſtand
and admire at the Glory of God in Chriſt, and thou
wondereſt perhaps that all People are not taken with the
Riches of the Glory of Gods Grace in Chriſt: Well,
Bleſs God that hath made a difference between thee and
others. It may be in the ſame Family another Scorns it,
and Contemns it, perhaps one that came out of the ſame
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:104282:123"/>
Womb deſpiſes it, and God hath taken thee, and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Himſelf to thee, it may be thy rich Neighbour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns
it; but God looks upon thee (a poor Creature)
and makes Himſelf known to thee. It may be a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man he ſlights it, and makes nothing of it; and thou
who art but a Babe, haſt thoſe things Revealed. Thou
haſt cauſe to thank God for it, <hi>For Chriſt doth:</hi> He
thanks His Father for this thing, That He ſhould be
pleaſed to paſs by the Wiſe and great ones of the World,
and chuſe Babes, <hi>Mat. 11. 25. At that time, Jeſus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
and ſaid, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the
Wiſe and Prudent, and hiſt revealed them unto Babes.</hi>
Now this Scripture that I bring, not only to ſhew you
that God doth ſometimes Reveal the great Myſteries of
the Goſpel to Babes, and hide them from the Wiſe, but
as a Text to ſtir up your Hearts to Bleſs God, if He hath
done ſo for any of you. Upon this ground Jeſus Chriſt
doth thank His Father for it; then ſurely thou haſt cauſe
to thank God the Father for this great Mercy of His, to
put ſuch a difference between thee and others. For, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
it is one of the moſt glorious Works of God,
This Work of the Lord making known the Great and
High Myſteries of the Goſpel to poor weak ones; when
as the Great, and Rich, and Mighty, and Learned of
the World, do not come to underſtand it. It is one of
the great Miracles by which the Lord doth Confirm the
Goſpel to be His own, as great a Miracle as other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
that were Wrought by Chriſt. And for that, this
is very obſervable that we have in the place where
<hi>John</hi> ſends to Chriſt, to know whether He were the
Meſſias, or no. Now mark the Anſwer that Chriſt gives
unto <hi>John's</hi> Meſſengers, <hi>Jeſus Anſwered and ſaid unto
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:104282:124"/>
them, Go and ſhew</hi> John <hi>again thoſe things which ye do
hear and ſee, the Blind receive their ſight, and the Lame
walk, and the Lepers are cleanſed, and the Deaf hear,
and the Dead are raiſed, and the Poor have the Goſpel
Preached to them:</hi> And as ſome of the Evangeliſts have
it, <hi>Poor receive the Goſpel.</hi> Obſerve why Chriſt brings
this, He brings it in as an Argument that he was the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.
<hi>John</hi> would know whether He was the Meſſiah:
How ſhall he know it? Why go and tell him, <hi>The Blind
receive their ſight, the Lame walk, the Lepers are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
the Deaf hear, the Dead are raiſed.</hi> Theſe are
good Arguments to prove that Chriſt was the Meſſias.
If Chriſt could Work ſuch Miracles as to give ſight to
the Blind, to make the Lame to walk, to cleanſe the
Lepers, to cauſe the Deaf to hear, and to raiſe the
Dead; theſe indeed were good Arguments. But how
comes in the laſt, <hi>And the Poor receive the Goſpel?</hi> How
is this an Argument that Chriſt is the Meſſias? One would
think that this ſhould rather be an Argument, that He is
not the Meſſias. They might ſay, I indeed, there are theſe
great things done by Him, but there is one thing makes
us ſuſpect that He is not the Meſſias: For our Great,
Rich, and Learned Men, they do not receive Him, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Company of poor Ignorant People, this Vulgar ſort:
For ſo was the Arguing of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> there, in <hi>John
7.</hi> 48. ſay they, (when the Officers were Affected with
the Miniſtry of Chriſt) <hi>Have any of the Rulers, or of
the Phariſees believed on him?</hi> Have any of them Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on Him? <hi>But this People that knoweth not the Law,
are Curſed.</hi> Only a Company of poor Ignorant People,
they believe on Chriſt. <hi>But the Rulers,</hi> have any of
the Rulers, or of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the Great Men, and the
Rich Men, the Learned Men, Have they believed? You
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104282:124"/>
ſee that this was a Stumbling-block, whereby they
would perſwade Men, that Chriſt was not the Meſſias.
But mark, That which Men make the great Stumbling-block,
why Chriſt is not the Meſſias, that Chriſt makes
unto <hi>John</hi> the great Argument, why He was the Meſſias:
<hi>Becauſe the Poor receive the Goſpel.</hi> And Chriſt doth put
this among his other Miracles. And you will ſay,
How is this an Argument? Thus, It is one of the
greateſt Miracles that ever Chriſt wrought, and it may
well be Reckoned among thoſe Miracles, of giving Eyes
to the Blind, and Hearing to the Deaf. Thus, To make
one that is a poor weak Creature, that hath but a mean
Capacity, yet that ſuch a one ſhall be able to ſee into
the Great, and High, and Glorious Myſteries of the
Goſpel, that the Angels deſire to pry into: So to ſee
into the Reolity, and the Certainty, and the Glory of
thoſe Myſteries, that he dares venture his Soul and his
Eternal Eſtate upon: I ſay, This is as great a Work of
a <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od, as ever any Work that God did in this World,
and therefore it may well be put among Chriſts Miracles,
<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd an Argument that Chriſt is the Meſſias. If Chriſt
ſhall Reveal ſuch Glorious things, that are the Objects
of the Underſtanding of Angels, to poor Illiterate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when as the Wiſe of the World ſhall not be able to
ſee them, but ſhall Reject them: They ſhall not ſee ſo
much as to dare to venture the loſs of a Luſt for them,
of any Creatures contentment for them; but a poor
weak. Man or Woman Illiterate, that underſtands but
little in other things, ſhall come to ſee ſo much the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God ſhining in the Face of Chriſt, as he dares ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
not only all outward Comforts in this World, but
his Soul and Eternal Eſtate, upon the Grace of God in
his Son. Here's a mighty Work of Chriſt. The Poor
they come then to receive the Goſpel, it is Preached to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:104282:125"/>
them and they receive it; and hereby Chriſt ſhews his
Power. Now hath Chriſt ſhown ſuch a Miraculous
Work of his upon thy Soul, when he hath paſt by others
that are Underſtanding, and Men of Parts, &amp; yet Reveal'd
ſuch deep and hidden Myſteries of the Goſpel unto thee.
Oh admire at the Grace of God in his Son to thee, and
Bleſs him, for this is not an ordinary Mercy; it is a choice
Mercy. The Goſpel is Rejected many times where it
comes, and thou ſeeſt it; only God hath made a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
between thee and others: As I told you of that
Speech of <hi>Judas,</hi> not Iſcariot, <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Why is it
that thou Revealeſt thy ſelf unto us, and not unto the
World.</hi> Thou haſt cauſe to wonder at it indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And then further, that we may haſten to
what remains: If this be ſo, that Gods ſends the Goſpel
where it is Rejected, hence be not Scandalized when
you ſee it Deſpiſed and Contemned. Let none be Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized
at it, ſo ſaith Chriſt, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11, when he ſaith,
<hi>The Poor have the Goſpel Preached to them:</hi> in the
next words, <hi>And Bleſſed is he, whoſoever is not offended
in me.</hi> For Men are ready to be offended, when they
ſee great Ones Reject the Miniſtry of the Goſpel: But
you hear that God ſends it where it is Rejected, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be not you offended; do not think that becauſe
others do not Imbrace it, therefore there is nothing in
it, and why ſhould I: There is this Temptation in the
Hearts of many, though while they are Hearing of the
Goſpel Preached, their Hearts are taken with what they
Hear, and they are Convinc'd; but when they go away,
and are among their Companions and others that they
find to ſlight all and to diſregard all; their Hearts are
taken off likewiſe. But, O learn by this Point, never
to be Scandalized by others caſting off the Goſpel: For
it is that which Chriſt hath forewarned his Miniſters when
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104282:125"/>
they go to Preach; he doth intimate to them that they
muſt expect that their Miniſtry muſt not prevail with
all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> Laſtly, Is this true, That God ſends the Preaching
of the Goſpel where he ſees it will and doth not prevail
with many? Now let every one of you lay his hand upon
his Heart, and think thus with himſelf; Is it I? Am I the
man? am I the Woman to whom Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be
Preached, and ſhall not prevail? O the Lord forbid that
this ſhould be ſo, though it doth not prevail with others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſuch and ſuch, yet God forbid that it ſhould not prevail
with my Heart; let me imbrace it ſo much the rather. Do
I ſee Jeſus Chriſt rejected by others? O it is that which
ſhould go neer to my Heart, that the Lord is rejected by
any, and ſhall he be rejected by me too, the Lord forbid;
that as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples when others forſook
him, <hi>And will ye alſo go away? O whither ſhall we go
from thee</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> for <hi>with thee are the words of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life;</hi> ſo doſt thou ſee others ſlight and neglect the
glorious Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and wilt thou do ſo?
wilt thou add to the diſhonour of the Goſpel too? O the
Lord, the Lord forbid; but let me the rather embrace
it, by how much the more it is neglected, and diſ-regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by others. What, ſhall ſuch a glorious Goſpel be
preached in vain? What, ſhall the precious Blood of Jeſus
Chriſt be ſhed in vain? and it is in vain in reſpect of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Souls, and ſhall it be in reſpect of my Soul? the Lord
forbid. O that the Lord would put ſuch kind of thoughts
into your Hearts, when you ſee others live under the
Miniſtry of the Goſpel in a ſinful way. And thus much
for this Suppoſition, <hi>If not:</hi> What follows?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If not,</hi> Let it return to you again.</p>
            <p>Here we have firſt an encouragement to Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
in caſe their Miniſtry is rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:104282:126"/>
And <hi>Secondly,</hi> A dreadful denunciation againſt thoſe
that ſhall reject the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the encouragement of the Miniſters of God in
caſe their Miniſtry be rejected, <hi>Let it return to you again.</hi>
In this we have theſe two Things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That when any Miniſter Preaches Chriſt to a
people, if the people get no good by his Preaching, yet
he ſhall have the benefit of it upon his own Soul; that's
the firſt: let it return to you again if they will not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it, ſo as to have the good and benefit of it to them,
it ſhall return to you, and you ſhall have the benefit and
bleſſing of it upon your own Souls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let it return, that is, though it prevails not
here, yet it ſhall not loſe any thing of its efficacy, of
the life, of the vigor of it, but it ſhall return to you with
as much efficacy and life as ever, ſo as if you be ſent to
ſome other place, there may be as much hopes of doing
good as ever you had; theſe are the two things that are
for the incouragement of Gods Miniſters, in caſe their
Miniſtry be rejected. Briefly of theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That whena people rejects the Goſpel, Gods
Miniſters they ſhall not loſe by it, they ſhall have the
bleſſing of their Miniſtry; in <hi>Iſai. 49. 4. Then I ſaid,
I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my strength for
nought, and in vain:</hi> here's a dreadful complaint; but
mark what follows: <hi>yet ſurely my judgment is with the
Lord, and my work with my God:</hi> there is a correcting of
himſelf as it were; as if he ſhould ſay, what did I ſay it
was in vain, that I had ſpent my ſtrength in vain, to no
purpoſe, that I had gotten nothing by what I had done?
No, let me correct my ſelf, ſurely my judgment is with
the Lord, and my work with my God, I ſhall not loſe
my labour; though I do no good upon people, yet I ſhall
not loſe my labour: The truth is, even this Complaint is
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104282:126"/>
not ſpoken ſo much in the perſon of the Prophet, as of
Jeſus Chriſt: It is a complaint of Chriſt, for it is apparent
in the reading of this Chapter, that it is Prophetical of
Chriſt; for it follows, <hi>And now ſaith the Lord, that formed
me from the Womb to be his ſervant, to bring</hi> Jacob <hi>again
to him, though</hi> Iſrael <hi>be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious
in the eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my ſtrength:
And he ſaid, It is a light thing that thou ſhouldest be my
ſervant, to raiſe up the Tribes of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and to reſtore the
preſerved of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>I will alſo give you for a light to the</hi>
Gentiles, <hi>that thou maiſt be my Salvation to the ends of the
Earth, &amp;c.</hi> Now who was he that was a light to the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Salvation of God to the ends of the
Earth? It was Jeſus Chriſt, and yet Chriſt himſelf is
brought in here complaining, that he had laboured in
vain, and ſpent his ſtrength for nought, and in vain: but
God comes in and incourages him, and tells him that he
ſhould not loſe the benefit of their labours; his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould be with the Lord, and his work with his
God. And further, that though he did not prevail with
ſome, yet he ſhould with others, he ſhould be given as a
light to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And likewiſe that place is well
known in the 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 15, 16. For we are unto God a
ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaved;</hi> I that's
true, but mark what follows, <hi>and in them that periſh:</hi> A
ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaved, and in them
that periſh: as truly in them that periſh, as in them
that are ſaved, Gods Miniſters are a ſweet ſavour of
Chriſt, therefore their labour is not in vain. To us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
faithfulneſs; we are to look to be faithful in our
work, but for the ſucceſs that belongs to God himſelf.
It is a note that <hi>Bernard</hi> hath on the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. ſaith the
Apoſtle there, <hi>By the Grace of God I am that I am, and his
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104282:127"/>
Grace that was beſtowed upon me, was not in vain: but I
laboured more abundantly then they all.</hi> Saith <hi>Bernard</hi>
here, he doth not ſo much glory in the <hi>fruit</hi> of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
as in his <hi>labouring,</hi> for indeed we are to glory ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in our work, than in the faithfulneſs of our hearts in
our work, rather than in the ſucceſs. Miniſters many
times may look too much after the ſucceſs of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and yet if there be any thing in the world that a
man may look for the ſucceſs of his labour in, it is in the
work of the Miniſtry; but eſpecially he is to look after
his faithfulneſs in his labour: and if he be faithful there,
he ſhall not loſe his labour: But, ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> you muſt
have a care rather to diſcharge your work, to take care of
Souls, rather than the curing of them: it is your work to
take care of them, but it is Gods work to cure them; that's
to be left to God. There is a Queſtion among Divines,
Whether a Miniſter that Converts many Souls here by his
Miniſtry, or another that is as faithful every whit as he,
and as painful, and yet doth not convert Souls, or but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few; which of theſe ſhall have moſt Glory in Heaven,
whether the one or the other? Many think rather the
Second, becauſe the one hath a great part of his comfort
here, and his incouragement; the other goes on in his
painfulneſs and faithfulneſs, though he hath not ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and incouragements. And indeed, of all Works, it is
the hardeſt work for a man to go on comfortably in the
work of the Miniſtry without ſucceſs; there is no work
ſo hard as that is: What, for a man to think, O that the
Lord ſhould ſend me to a people, to what end? to preach
the Goſpel indeed, but to harden them, but to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
their ſin, but ſo as their condemnation ſhall be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
O it is a dreadful thought unto the heart of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
to think that he ſhould be ſent about ſuch a task as
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:104282:127"/>
this is. <hi>Jeremy</hi> was even weary, and ſaid, He would
preach no more in the Name of the Lord, only the Word
of God was as fire in his bones, and he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear;
but had not Gods Word been as fire in his bones,
certainly he would have forborn: Hence it is that we
read, when God was to ſend his Miniſters to People, that
they ſhould not prevail withall, the Lord made mighty
preparations, and there was much ado for to get the
hearts of his Servants to go about their work: I'll give
you two Inſtances remarkable for this: The firſt is in the
Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the Lord had a Meſſage to ſend by the
Prophet, he would ſend him to Preach, but to a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
where he ſhould not prevail; yea the Text ſaith, <hi>Go
and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but underſtand not; and
ſee ye indeed, but perceive not: make the heart of this people
fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they
ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
with their hearts, and convert and be healed.</hi> The
Lord ſends his Prophets to go and to harden the hearts
of people; as the truth is, there is nothing in the world
will harden mens Hearts more than the Miniſtry of the
Word, if it doth not ſoften them. If it doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with mens hearts to convert them, I ſay there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will harden mens hearts more. There are no People
in the world have harder Hearts than thoſe that live under
the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. <hi>Go and make the heart of
this People fat;</hi> but this was a mighty hard Meſſage: How
muſt this Prophet be prepared? There needs be a mighty
deal of preparation to make him go chearfully on in his
work. You ſhall ſee that the Prophet had a moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Viſion to prepare him: <hi>He ſaw the Glory of God ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Temple, and above it ſtood the Cherubims, and one
cryed to another, and ſaid, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:104282:128"/>
Hoſt; the whole Earth is full of his Glory, and the poſts of
the door moved at the voice of him that cryed, and the
houſe was filled with ſmoak. Then ſaid I, woe is me.</hi> The
Lord was fain firſt to reveal his Glory to him; ſecondly
to humble his heart; <hi>Then ſaid I, wo is me, for I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
becauſe I am a man of unclean lips:</hi> thirdly, <hi>the
Lord cauſed a Serophim to fly unto him, having a live coal
in his hand, which he had taken with the tongues from off
the Altar; and he laid it upon my mouth and ſaid, Lo, this
hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and
thy ſin purged.</hi> Here's three notable works of God to
prepare the heart of this Prophet: then in <hi>v. 8. I
heard the voice of the Lord, ſaying, whom ſhall I ſend, and
who will go for us? then I ſaid, here am I, ſend me.</hi> After
he had firſt ſeen the glory of God; ſecondly, after he
had been humbled for his ſin; and thirdly, after he had
had ſuch an extraordinary teſtimony of the pardon of
his ſin. Now Lord, as if he ſhould ſay, ſend me about
the hardeſt work that thou haſt to do, and then the Lord
tells him what that hard Meſſage ſhould be that he ſhould
carry? he ſhould go to a people and Preach, but it
ſhould be to harden their hearts, and not to prevail with
their Spirits. And the like we have in the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi>
if you read the ſecond, and the beginning of the
third <hi>chap.</hi> the Lord tells him, that he was to go to a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
Houſe; but you ſhall obſerve ſuch a ſtrange work of
God for the preparing of his Heart for it in the moſt part
of the firſt <hi>Chapt.</hi> the Prophet had a moſt glorious Viſion
of God for the ſetting of him a work; that teaches us, that
indeed there is nothing will ſet us ſo much a work as the
ſight of God. Secondly, ſuch a voice of God as humbled
him, for when I heard, I fell upon my face; and then God
comes and comforts him, and ſets him upon his feet. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104282:128"/>
the Spirit enters into him, and ſpake unto him, and
then declared his Meſſage, and gave him the roul, and
bid him eat it; and made it to be ſweet unto him, though
it was a meſſage of threatning: I ſpeak all this to this end,
to ſhew that there is no work more difficult than the
work of a Miniſter, and eſpecially when his Miniſtry hath
not ſucceſs; and therefore this point is very reaſonable
to tell unto them all, that though they have not the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
that they deſire, yet the good of their Miniſtry ſhall
return upon them again. Are there a People that they
are ſent to, to whom do they offer Chriſt? Why they
would fain gain their Souls unto Chriſt, that they
may live for ever in praiſing the riches of the grace of
God in Chriſt in the higheſt Heavens. But will they not,
Know, thou ſhait have the bleſſing of that peace; look
what glory and comfort they ſhould have had, it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into thy boſom. It is here in the Miniſtry of the
Word, as in other Duties; ſuppoſe you pray for a Child,
or Friend, or Kinſman, you do not ſee that he is turned
to God according to your prayers; but know, your
prayer is not loſt for all that; the bleſſing of your Prayer
ſhall return into your boſom, and therefore be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
in every good work as Miniſters ſhould be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
in their Miniſtry, though they have not ſucceſs; ſo
you, every one in your meaſure, ſhould be encouraged in
every work that God hath called you unto; go on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with peace and with comfort in all the work that
heretofore you have been ſo much diſcouraged in; for
the reward is to your faithfulneſs, and not to the ſucceſs
of your Works.</p>
            <p>The next to this is: <hi>Your peace ſhall Return;</hi> that is, as
I ſhewed you, it ſhall return with as much power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy;
for they may think thus, Lord, do we go to preach
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:104282:129"/>
to this People, and do they reject it; what hope ſhall we
have that now the Goſpel ſhall do good? it hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a foil, and now the edge ſeems to be off, and never
like to do good any where. No ſaith Chriſt, do not
reaſon ſo, do not think that your Goſpel hath loſt the
edge of it; it ſhall return to you again with as much pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as ever it did at firſt. It is not ſo with the Goſpel as
with other things. Many things in the World, if once
they receive a repulſe, their edge is taken off; but the
Goſpel, though it doth receive a repulſe, yet ſtill the
edge of it ſhall continue, and the power of it: this is
that which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>2 Tim. 2. 10. Wherein I ſuffer
trouble as an evil-doer, even unto bonds; but the Word of
God is not bound:</hi> Mark, though I ſuffer Bonds, yet the
Word of God is not bound: I am ſlighted and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
I but the Word is not bound; the Word is the ſame
that ever it was, though I be hated and caſt out, that am
the Miniſter of the Word; yet it remains in as much
ſtrength as ever it did: I indeed am caſt into a Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the Goſpel will prevail; all the perſecutions of
Wicked men, all the ſcorn that is caſt upon the Goſpel
by them, ſhall not take away the edge and power and
life of the Goſpel; but that ſhall continue as much as
ever: all the rage of Hell, and Devils, and Tyrants ſhall
not take away the power of the Goſpel. Indeed they
may reſtrain ſuch and ſuch men in the Preaching of it,
but after they are dead and rotten, and roaring in Hell, the
Goſpel ſhall prevail. We find it ſo at this day, ever ſince
Chriſt came, the Goſpel hath been oppoſed by Ungodly
men, yet it doth remain in as much life, and vigor, and
power as ever it did; and I have no cauſe to queſtion
but it will prevail ere long, more than ever it did in the
World; though its true, ſometimes we find Miniſters
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:104282:129"/>
Preach Sermon after Sermon, and there are but few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Goſpel: what ſhall we think that therefore
in hath loſt the power of it? No, Gods time is not come.
When the time of God ſhall come to call home thoſe that
belong to his Election of Grace, it ſhall appear that the
Goſpel ſhall ariſe in power and glory, and prevail in the
World again; therefore let's never deſpair, but that the
Goſpel will prevail in the World as at firſt, when as there
were but a few poor Fiſhermen to Preach it, and all the
World was enraged againſt it; the Emperors and Princes
of the Earth was enraged againſt it, and yet theſe poor
Fiſhermen did ſubdue a great part of the World by the
power of the Goſpel: therefore let not us be diſcouraged,
for when Gods time is come, it ſhall prevail in a glorious
manner more than ever. And ſo as it is with the Goſpel,
ſo it ſhould be with the Profeſſors of it: If God be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
by other, yet let not your edge be taken off, but
do you continue in the power, and life, and vigor, as
much as ever.</p>
            <p>Now the ſecond part, which is the main that I intend;
and that is the dreadful threatning of thoſe that do reject
the Goſpel: only take this one point, (there are theſe
Three:)</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Doct. 1</note> That where a people reject the Goſpel, God may
juſtly take it away from them, yea they are in danger to
have it taken from them: <hi>It ſhall return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2.</note> Such ſhall not have the bleſſing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
upon them; this ſhall be their doom, as they ſhall
loſe the Miniſtry of it, ſo they ſhall be caſt out from the
bleſſing of it.</p>
            <p>And then <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.</note> which is yet the principal of all, and
that is, That God will deal very quick with thoſe that
do reject the Goſpel, <hi>Your peace ſhall return;</hi> no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104282:130"/>
there's an end of them. Theſe are the Three things
in this ſentence againſt thoſe that are not the Sons of
Peace, where the Goſpel is preached. But a little of the
Firſt, we will leave the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That where a people do reject it, and that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for ſo it is, when you come to a Houſe and offer it, if
they do not embrace it, <hi>let your peace return again:</hi> Chriſt
here compares his Diſciples unto Chapmen that ſhould go
and offer rich Wares, they have Diamonds, and Precious
Stones, things worth Thouſands, and they come perhaps
to poor Country-people, and open their Cabinet of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
and Precious Stones, and make offers to them, but
they do not know the worth of them, they will bid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for them: Now when he ſees that they reject and
deſpiſe them, ſaith he, give me my Wares again, and ſo
he packs them up again, and away he goes; for ſaith he,
this is not a people that is fit for ſuch things as theſe are; ſo
ſaith Chriſt, you are ſuch Chapmen, I ſend you abroad
with the moſt rich pearl of the Goſpel, to go and ſhew
the excellency of it to people, and to offer it to them;
and the truth is, I require thus much of them, that if
they would have this Pearl, they muſt ſell all: Now the
Miniſtry of the Goſpel comes, and they are ignorant of
this Pearl, that they have brought this rich Commodity.
They can tell them indeed that here is an exceeding rich
Pearl, but this is the tenor, that you muſt be content to
part with all for this Pearl, that is thus: Firſt, you muſt
actually lay down and renounce every beloved ſin. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
you muſt enter into Bond as it were with God,
that whenſoever he calls for your Eſtates, your Liberties,
your outward Peace, and Comforts that you have in the
World, ſhall be at Gods diſpoſe: Thus you enter into
Bond, as in your dealing for Commodities, when you ſee
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:104282:130"/>
a great and rich Commodity, you lay down ſomewhat
for the preſent, and give Bond for the reſt to be paid
when it ſhall be called for. When you go to buy Pedling
things, there you lay down all at firſt, and no entring into
Bond; but when it is a great Purchaſe, then there is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
laid down for the preſent, and entring into Bond for
the reſt. Now certainly in this Bargain of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
there is firſt a laying down for the preſent, thy
Luſts, thy Sin; as if the Soul ſhould ſay, O Lord, let me
have my part in Chriſt, in this glorious Peace of the
Goſpel; as for any wayes of ſin that I have lived in
heretofore, Lord I renounce them; and will not live in
any way of known ſin, Lord grant me thy Grace to do
it: Indeed this is the way of the Hearts coming in at firſt;
I but ſaith God, I will not only have thy ſin renounc'd,
but thy Eſtate, and Liberty, and Life at my diſpoſe; and
thou ſhalt enter into Bonds to lay down all; yes Lord,
this is the very Engliſh of the Covenant: The Soul ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the glory of God in Chriſt, ſaith the Soul, Lord I will
not only renounce my ſin, but Lord, whatſoever I am,
whatſoever I have, whatſoever I can do ſhall be at thy
diſpoſe; and here I enter into Bond Lord, that is, I Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and Vow, and bind my ſelf by the ſtrongeſt
Bonds that a poor Creature poſſibly can do, that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou ſhalt call for any of my Eſtate, of my Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or my outward Comforts, when thou ſhalt call for
my Life, Lord they ſhall be at thy diſpoſe. Now have
you ſold all? have you thus bought the Pearl? When we
come to bring the Pearl of the Goſpel to you, have you
embrac'd it? O if our Miniſtry prevails, this hath been
the frame and working of your hearts; but if not, our
Miniſtry hath not yet prevail'd with you; but when
your Hearts begins to work thus, then our Miniſtry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104282:131"/>
to work to purpoſe in your Souls. But we may
come to moſt People and open the Pearls of Chriſt, and
open the Miniſtry of Reconciliation, and they will do
neither of theſe Two; neither lay down any thing for
the preſent, renounce no known Sin; and as for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into Bond, to have their Eſtates, and Liberties, and
Lives, and all to be at Gods diſpoſe, ſo as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
that they will never enjoy any of them, but only in
God, and for God: O how far are People from this?
No, they love their Eſtates too much, and they will ſee
what they ſhall have before they part with them: And
thus that all the Miniſters of the Goſpel Preach unto you
concerning God and Chriſt, are but meer Notions; but
we are ſure our Money and Eſtates have ſomething in
them, and ſo their Hearts embrace this preſent World,
and reject Jeſus Chriſt: and do you ſo? Well ſaith God,
Pack up your Commodities again, I have no more People
in this Place, therefore go and carry them ſome-where
elſe; there is another People that will know the worth
of theſe things; there is a People in the World that will
be willing to renounce their Luſts, and to give up all
that they have unto me, if they may have but this Goſpel
preached to them; therefore go ſomewhere elſe: Juſt as
we Read of the Apoſtles in the <hi>Acts 13. 46. Then</hi> Paul
<hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>waxed bold,</hi> they were not daunted, <hi>and
ſaid, It was neceſſary that the Word of God ſhould firſt
have been ſpoken to you, but ſeeing ye put it from you,
and judge your ſelves unworthy of Eternal Life; lo, we
turn to the</hi> Gentiles. Indeed you are the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
the only People of God for the preſent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we were to come to offer it at firſt to you; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you judg your ſelves unworthy of Eternal Life, that
is, if you by your carriage do manifeſt that you are a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:104282:131"/>
People no wayes ſuitable to this glorious Goſpel, then
we turn to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> we will pack up our Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
and go to ſome others that will buy it: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
if there be any thing in the World that makes a
Faithful Miniſter go from any Place, it is the rejection of
his Miniſtry: Other things are no ſuch Arguments as this
is, and if there be any thing can Warrant it, this as much
as any thing, by vertue of this Scripture, and by vertue of
my Text, <hi>Let your Peace return to you again,</hi> and be gone
to ſome other Place: We know the Scripture ſaith, that
Pearls are not to be caſt before Doggs, and Swine: And
indeed when Men ſhall priſe their Swiniſh Luſts before
the Pearl of the Goſpel, all the good that is tendred to
them in Jeſus Chriſt; what are they in Gods eſteem but as
Swine? and why ſhould Pearls always lye before them,
that they ſhould trample them under-foot; and therefore
the Lord would have his Light to be removed: God
Warrants his Miniſters in ſome Caſes ſo to do. But let
people know that this is a dreadful condition, if this
ſhould fall out concerning them: If the Lord ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to make a tender of the Mercy of Chriſt to a People,
or particular Souls; and if God ſhould take it away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
that Soul or People is in a moſt dreadful condition:
Perhaps you think you may ſpare it well enough; but
know, if you can do well enough without the Goſpel, the
Goſpel can do well enough without you; when that is
taken away from a Place, the very light of that Place is
taken away, there is double darkneſs. I remember
I have read of the Chriſtians in <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
people now make little eſteem of the preaching of
the Goſpel, yet the Chriſtians were ſo affected with <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom's</hi>
Miniſtry; the Story ſaith, that when he was
ſilenced by a Wicked Empreſs, they did profeſs, That they
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:104282:132"/>
would rather have the Sun withdraw the beams of light
from the World, then that the mouth of <hi>John Chryſoſtom</hi>
ſhould be ſtopt; they ſaw ſo much good in his Miniſtry,
he preaching Chriſt to them, that if it were put to their
choice whether they would be without the beams of the
Sun, or his Miniſtry; they would rather chuſe to be without
the beams of the Sun than his Miniſtry. It's true, we are not
to arrogate ſuch things to any particular man now, we
do not ſpeak to that end, no, but to the Miniſtry it ſelf.
What if God take away a faithful Miniſtry, we do not
ſpeak of any particular men that are ſent to Preach the
Goſpel to you: But certainly if God take away the clear
light of the Goſpel indeed, that Goſpel that opens Jeſus
Chriſt, and the way of Salvation and Eternal life to your
Souls. O what if God take away that from you: either
take that from you, or you from that, that you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to hear the Myſteries of it opened more, (but
inſtead of the glorious things of it, you ſhould hear ſome
pleading for Ceremonies, Croſs or Surplice, or Cringing,
and that ſhould be the Chaff that you ſhould be fed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
I ſay, when God takes away this from a People, he
takes away the light from them, and leaves them in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
It is not ſuch a fruit of Love and Mercy from the
Lord to give fruitful ſeaſons, and to bleſs you in your
Trading, as for the Lord to ſend the Miniſtry of peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you to open the unſearchable Treaſures and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of Jeſus Chriſt; that's the ſpecial Token of Gods love
to ſuch a place, and when that's removed, then the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
note of the love of God is removed; and when he
takes away that, he takes away the Bread of life from you;
and therefore the abſence of the Word is called a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:</hi>
We read of the poor people in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they came and
ſold all, that they might have Bread: It may be ſome of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:104282:132"/>
you complain of great Taxations, and want of Trading,
and your Eſtates decay, and the like; I but doth not
God recompence this with a more plentiful uſe of the
Goſpel than ever he did before? and doth not this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
you for the trouble that you ſuffer, and the
loſs of your Eſtates? I make no queſtion but there are
many Souls ſince the beginning of this Parliament that
are now in Heaven, that were alive, and did ſuffer much
for a while, but are now in Heaven, and bleſſing God for
theſe Two or Three Years; and I know no greater Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Carnal, Baſe, and Vile Heart than this, for
them to be alwayes complaining of the loſs of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
and not to think it at all made up with the liberty
of Gods Ordinances, and with the more clear light of
the glorious Goſpel that ſhines among them; whereas did
the Goſpel take your Hearts indeed, you would bleſs
God. It's true Lord my Eſtate is leſs than before, but
Bleſſed be thy Name that we live to hear Jeſus Chriſt, and
the way of Life and Salvation opened further to us than
heretofore. If God ſhould take you away, perhaps then
your Conſciences would accuſe you, and ſay, we had an
Opportunity wherein we heard Jeſus Chriſt opened to us
in his Natures, and in his Offices; O had we taken that
time, how happy had it been for us?</p>
            <p>Further, Perhaps Carnal Hearts may think it nothing to
have the Goſpel taken from them, yet when that is taken
from you, know that the Kingdom of God is taken from
you; that place in <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 43. is very remarkable, O
this is one of the dreadfulleſt Threats; <hi>therefore ſay I
unto you, The Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you,
and given to a Nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi>
When you have the preaching of the Goſpel in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
if it among you, know that you have the Kingdom
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104282:133"/>
of God among you: Now God doth require that you
ſhould <hi>bring forth the fruits thereof;</hi> therefore examine
your own Hearts what fruits of the Kingdom of God are
in my Life, in my Family: Why, the Kingdom of God is
among us, that's the meaning of Chriſt's and <hi>Johns</hi>
preaching, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand;</hi> that is, now comes the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt
in the Goſpel, and he calls people to Repent upon this
Ground. O Repent and Turn from your ſins; Why? for
the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt is come among you. I ſay
to you in this place, therefore Repent, Repent now, for
the Lord is coming to Open the Kingdom of Heaven,
and to Reveal the Grace of Chriſt, and the Glorious
things of Eternal Life to you; and therefore if you
ſhould pleaſe your ſelves rather in ſporting upon the
Lords Day, and going to Ale-Houſes and Wicked places
rather than Attending upon the Word, why the Lord may
take away this Goſpel, and ſo take away the Kingdom of
Heaven from you; and the taking that from you, it is
but a fore-runner to the depriving of you from the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Kingdom that the Saints ſhall have to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>And know there is no Dallying with God, for when
thou comeſt to the Offer of Mercy in Chriſt, ſaith Chriſt
either come in or not; Chriſt calls for your Anſwer
quickly: Though the Lord be very patient towards men
that never yet underſtood the Offering of the Goſpel of
Chriſt, but if they come once to have Chriſt preached to
them, they muſt not expect the like patience. When <hi>John</hi>
began to preach Chriſt, you know what he ſaid: <hi>Now is
the Axe lay'd to the root of the Tree:</hi> And why <hi>now</hi> more
than before? Becauſe now the Kingdom of Heaven is to
be preached to them; and now, <hi>Every Tree that bringeth
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104282:133"/>
not forth good Fruit ſhall be hewn down, and caſt into the
Fire.</hi> Perhaps they have gone this Thirty or Forty Years,
and there was no Hewing of them down; but now <hi>the
Axe is lay'd to the root of the Tree.</hi> You know that of
Chriſt to his Apoſtles, <hi>go your wayes and preach,</hi> ſaith
he, <hi>He that Believes ſhall be Saved, and he that Believes
not ſhall be damned:</hi> there is no more ado, either Believe
and be Saved, or Believe not and be Damned; there is
quick work, and indeed that's a Point that I would very
gladly have been upon, even the Conſideration of the
Quick Work of God upon thoſe Souls that ſhall reject
the Miniſtry of the Goſpel.</p>

            <p>THere are Two Points more remaining, which is to
be the Subject of this Excerciſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is this: That thoſe that are not the
Sons of Peace, (what is means you have had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
opened) that do not imbrace the Miniſtry of the
Goſpel, they ſhall have no Bleſſing from the peace of the
Goſpel, they ſhall not be partakers of the good of the
Goſpel.

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That God is very quick with thoſe that do
not embrace his Goſpel; Go and ſay peace, if there be a
Son of peace well and good, they ſhall have peace; if
not, <hi>It ſhall return,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
            <p>From the manner of the phraſe that note was raiſed,
That God doth uſe to be very quick with thoſe that do
not embrace the Goſpel: I ſhall be very ſhort in the
Former of theſe two, becauſe I would gladly have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more time in the Latter.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who entertain not the Goſpel, they ſhall not have
the Bleſſing of it. I ſhall not need to go far for another
Scripture, which is indeed a very dreadful one to this
purpoſe, <hi>Luke 14. 14. For I ſay unto you, that none of
thoſe men which were bidden ſhall taste of my Cup.</hi> We have
there a Parable, <hi>A certain man made a great Supper, and
bade many:</hi> The meaning is this, It is to ſet out God
the Fathers preparing of his Son, and of theſe Bleſſed
Dainties at the Marriage of his Son: The ſcope of it is
to ſhew the excellent things of the Goſpel, that they are
no other but the Dainties that are prepared by the
great King of Heaven at the Marriage of his Son: The
Scope of it is to ſhew the excellent things of the Goſpel,
that they are no other but the Dainties that are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the great King of Heaven at the Marriage of his
Son unto Souls, unto Believers. Well, there are ſent
his Miniſters, they are the Servants of this King, they are
ſent to Invite to this Marriage, to Invite men to partake
of the Bleſſed things of the Goſpel. Upon this Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we ſee, that generally it was rejected, <hi>One</hi> ſaith he
<hi>hath bought a Farm, another a Yoak of Oxen, and another
hath Marryed a Wife, &amp;c.</hi> and the Miniſters they come
in and give this account to God, Lord we have accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thy Command invited them to come in to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:104282:136"/>
take of the good things of the Goſpel; but theſe are
their Excuſes, their hearts are ſet upon other things:
Now mark their doom in <hi>ver. 24. For</hi> I <hi>ſay unto you, that
none of thoſe men which were bidden ſhall taſte of my Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:</hi>
That is, do they thus reject it, and ſlight it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard
it? I ſay to you, I profeſs it that there's not one
of them ſhall make ſuch a ſlight account of that Bleſſed
Goſpel of mine, and the glorious things contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
not one of them that ſhall taſte of my Supper.</p>
            <p>Only one Text more in <hi>Rom. 2. 8. But unto them which
are contentious, and do not obey the truth;</hi> (that muſt needs
be meant of the truth of the Goſpel) <hi>but obey unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
indignation, and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh
upon every Soul of man that doth evil, of the Jew firſt, and
alſo of the Gentile:</hi> Thoſe who are ſet upon their evil
wayes, and will not obey the truth, you ſee what their
Doom is: The firſt is privative, <hi>That they ſhall not taſte
of the Supper:</hi> the other is Poſitive, <hi>Wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and anguiſh ſhall be upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will ſay, <hi>That this ſhall return.</hi> What then? What
great Evil wil follow upon this? what moſt dreadful Evils?</p>
            <p>Why firſt, The very want and privation of the Infinite
good that the Goſpel tenders to thee is evil enough, and
the remaining under all thoſe Evils that the Goſpel would
have delivered thee from, that's evil enough; as thus,
What, doth the Goſpel return, and the Bleſſing from
you? why then you remain under the guilt of all your
Sins, and ſtand charged before the great God to anſwer
for all unto the Infinite Juſtice; and this the Goſpel would
have delivered you from, had you entertained it.</p>
            <p>Doth it return from you? Why then you ſtand before
the Lord under the ſentence of Condemnation, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Creature even to Eternal Death, and this the
Goſpel would have freed you from.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:104282:137"/>
Doth the Goſpel return again? Why then you ſtand
a Child of Wrath before the great God, under all the
Viols of his Infinite Wrath, ready every moment for
ought thou knoweſt to be poured out upon thee: and
this the Goſpel would have freed thee from.</p>
            <p>Doth the Goſpel go away from thee? Why then thou
ſtandeſt under the Curſe of the Law, and all thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Threatnings that are Written in the Book of God, they
are all thy Portion, and this the <hi>Goſpel</hi> would have freed
thee from.</p>
            <p>Is the Goſpel returned from thee? Then thou ſtandeſt
before God as an Enemy unto him; he looks upon thee
as one that is an Enemy to him, and thou canſt expect no
other but to be dealt withal as an Enemy; to have God
in all his Attributes to come out againſt thee; to have all
his Creatures to come out againſt thee to Avenge Gods
Quarrel upon thee, and this the <hi>Goſpel</hi> would have freed
thee from.</p>
            <p>And ſo we might further name Infinite Evils; <hi>no peace
to the wicked;</hi> no peace to thoſe who are ſo Wicked as
to reject the glorious Goſpel; and therefore thy Caſe is
Dreadful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the Bleſſing of the Goſpel be returned
from thee, then know, thou haſt loſt the moſt Happy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of good that ever Creature had: Never can a
Creature be made capable of a Happier opportunity of
good than the Creature hath, when Jeſus Chriſt comes
to be preached to it. Here's the moſt Bleſſed opportunity
of good I ſay that a Creature can have, to have Jeſus
Chriſt come to be offered to him. Now when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is
returned, thou haſt loſt this opportunity of Mercy, the
tender of Salvation that's worth ten thouſand thouſand
Worlds, ſuch an opportunity as the Devils and Damned
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:104282:137"/>
in Hell would give 10000 Worlds to have it, and
yet that is come to thee, and is gone and loſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a ſad thing for the Bleſſing of the Goſpel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If it doth Return from thee, thou doſt
not know whether it will ever return back again upon
thee; whether ever it will come any more: When God
offers Grace and it is rejected, many times he doth cauſe
the Offer to paſs away, and it never comes more again.
Thou mayeſt perhaps lye hereafter in the diſtreſs of thy
Conſcience, and think of former dayes that thou hadſt,
and cry out, O that I had ſuch dayes again! O that I
had Jeſus Chriſt preached to me again as I had at ſuch a
time! O that I had ſuch ſtirrings of the Spirit of God as
I had at ſuch a time! but now no Friend. Time was
when thou hadſt them, and thou didſt reject them, and
therefore they are gone; and thouſands of Worlds will
not purchaſe them again. I do not now ſpeak only of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the Miniſtery of it, but of the Bleſſing of the
Goſpel; perhaps thou mayſt live under the Miniſtery of
it, and yet the Bleſſing of the Goſpel may be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the Goſpel come and return with the
Bleſſing of it, thou art now in a far worſe condition than
any Heathen whatſoever; a Heathen is not in ſo ſad a
condition. Some times you will ſpeak in way of Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
What do you think me a Heathen, a <hi>Turk?</hi> Thou
art in a worſe caſe than any Heathen whatſoever, becauſe
they never had the offer of Jeſus Chriſt, and the courſe
of Mercy hath never come to them, but to thee, and left
thee; there's hope before God makes a tryal as it were,
before Mercy hath as it were her turn upon the Creature,
that it may belong to Gods Election; but now when
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:104282:138"/>
Mercy hath had her turn and left the Soul, then it is a
ſad condition; it hath not done ſo to the Heathens, and
therefore it is worſe with thee than with the Heathens in
that regard.</p>
            <p>Yea <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Hence follows, that there is the greateſt
Judgment (except being ſent to Hell it ſelf immediatly)
as a puniſhment of the greateſt Sin that ever Creature
committed, but only the unpardonable Sin, the Sin againſt
the Holy Ghoſt: For God to take away the Goſpel from
us, the Bleſſing of it to return; it is the greateſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that can befall a man in this World, except God
ſhould ſend him quick to Hell preſently: A greater Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than if thy Houſe were fired, or thy Body diſeaſed
and tormented; that were no ſuch Judgment as this, and
this is the fruit of the greateſt ſin, the ſin of the rejection
of the Goſpel, except the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Now
that Man or Woman is in a ſad condition that hath the
greateſt Judgment that God can inflict in this World, but
only that one Excepted; I ſay this is an exceeding ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Yea further, Then it is to be feared leſt
Chriſt ſhould dye in vain as for thee; though Chriſt hath
come into the World, and ſhed his Blood to ſave Souls,
yet all ſhould be in vain as for thee, O this Thought will
pierce thy heart one day, if it doth not now for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
the very thought that there ſhould be ſo great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and I not be made partaker of it, it is a Soul-wounding
Thought.</p>
            <p>Yea and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Hereafter it ſhall be to thy extream
Torment, when thou ſhalt ſee others that have embrac'd
the Goſpel and Sav'd Eternally, and thou thy ſelf caſt out:
I heard the ſame Sermon that Converted ſuch and ſuch a
one, and they are now Saved in Heaven for ever; O I
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:104282:138"/>
was at the ſame Sermon, and rejecting of it am now caſt
down here to be ſweltering under the wrath of God. Will
not theſe be ſad thoughts another day? <hi>If not, your
peace ſhall return;</hi> and you ſee the dreadful Fruit of the
returning of Peace.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then a word by way of Application,<note place="margin">Appl.</note> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Point it ſelf is enough to ſtrike our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The very naming of theſe things, and the opening
of them, hath power to ſtir and awaken the Heart; and
therefore I will only ſay thus much.</p>
            <p>Learn to know, that when you come to hear the
preaching of the Goſpel you do not come to a matter of
Indifferency, it being no great matter whether you recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, or received it not: Many people they come to
hear Sermons, and look upon them as a very indifferent
matter whether their Hearts be taken with what they
hear or no, whether they yield and ſubmit to what they
hear or not; but learn to know that it is not a matter of
Indifferency: I may well make uſe of that Speech of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
to the people in <hi>Deut. 32. 46, 47. And he ſaid unto
them, ſet your hearts unto all the words which I teſtifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you this day, which ye ſhall command your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to obſerve to do, all the words of this Law:</hi> Mark it,
Why, what's the matter? <hi>v. 47. For it is not a vain thing
for you, becauſe it is your life.</hi> It may be ſome of them,
when they heard <hi>Moſes</hi> declaring the Law of God, they
would be ready to think it is a good Law, and <hi>Moſes</hi>
doth well in telling of us the Law, but there is no
great conſequence of it how our Hearts be taken with
it; O but ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> do not you come to hear the Law
upon ſuch tearms, but ſet your Hearts upon what you
hear; Why? becauſe <hi>it is your life.</hi> Much more cauſe
have the Miniſters of the Goſpel thus to ſay when they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:104282:139"/>
come to preach Jeſus Chriſt to a people, Set your hearts to
what is delivered. When they come and ſay, <hi>Peace be to</hi> this
place, to <hi>this People,</hi> &amp; the Doctrine of the Goſpel be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to them, O ſet your hearts to what is delivered: Why,
for it is your life. When you come to Hear a Sermon, you
ſhould come ſo as to conſider that your Life may lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Sermon, for ought you know; and the rather look
to it, becauſe the Lord with whom you have to deal is a
great God, and a God that will not be dallyed withal,
and triſled withal; but if you diſobey the Meſſage of
the Goſpel, the Lord may deal very quick with you; and
that let's me into the Laſt Point which now we are to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
this Text in, and that is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That thoſe that ſhall not Entertain the Goſpel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
               <hi>the Lord
will deal very quick with them; Your Peace ſhall return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:</hi>
the Lord will not ſtand long about the matter. I
in the naming of the point have already ſpoken of a
Scripture or two, <hi>Now is the Axe lay'd to the root of the
Trees,</hi> when <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> came to Preach <hi>the Kingdom of
God.</hi> And that in the Laſt of <hi>Mark v. 16. Go and Preach</hi>
ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>he that believes ſhall be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he that believes not ſhall be Damned:</hi> The Lord Chriſt
tells how quick the Lord will be with thoſe that ſhall not
entertain the Goſpel; and there are many Texts that are
very full for this purpoſe: and becauſe it is a great
Point, and that it ſhould ſtrike much upon your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
therefore I will preſent it in the fulneſs of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Scripture. That place that you have in <hi>Matth.
10.</hi> it is juſt parallel to this in <hi>Luke</hi> 10. there where
Chriſt ſends his Apoſtles forth, as he doth the 70. he
gives the ſame Directions in effect; but mark here, <hi>Saint
Matthew</hi> goes farther than <hi>Saint Luke, Let your Peace Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to you; and whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:104282:139"/>
your words, when you depart out of that Houſe or City,
ſhake off the duſt of your feet: Verily I ſay unto you, it
ſhall be more tollerable for the Land of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah
<hi>in the day of Judgment, than for that City.</hi> See
here the quickneſs of God with thoſe that do reject the
Goſpel: So in <hi>John</hi> 3. that is very famous for this, in <hi>ver.
18. He that believeth on him is not Condemned,</hi> but <hi>he that
believeth not is Condemned already.</hi> You will ſay he is
Condemned already, becauſe his Natural Condition is
ſuch that he is under Condemnation: No, but I take it, the
Scripture doth aim at ſomething further; He is not only
Condemned by reaſon of his ſins againſt the Law, but he
is condemned already, <hi>becauſe he hath not believed on the
Name of the only Begotten Son of God.</hi> How could he
Believe in the Name of the Only Begotten Son of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ever he heard it; but here it is ſpoken of Light that
is come into the World, for ſo it follows in <hi>ver. 19. And
this is the Condemnation, that light is come into the world,
and men love darkneſs rather than light; becauſe their deeds
were evil:</hi> That is, when Chriſt ſhall come to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to any People, and they will not believe; preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there is a ſentence of Condemnation, that's the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Text, <hi>he is Condemned already,</hi> the Lord is
very quick with ſuch. And in <hi>Acts 17. 30. a place fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
And the Times of this Ignorance God winked at.</hi> He
ſaw and would not ſee as it were, he overpaſt that; but
<hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, that is, Now, when Chriſt comes to be
Preached, <hi>Now he Commandeth all men every where to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peent;</hi>
as if he ſhould ſay, Look to your ſelves that you
Repent now, whatſoever you did before; though you
could prophane Sabbaths before, look to your ſelves now;
though you were vain, and ſuperſtitious, and carnal, take
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:104282:140"/>
heed now to your ſelves; as if the Holy Ghoſt ſhould
ſay, The Lord is willing to paſs by all that was before, but
for rejection of his Son, look to that; he will not paſs by
that ſo eaſily, that <hi>One</hi> ſin ſo eaſily, as he will paſs by all
the other. All the ſins that men have Committed all
their Lives before, may more eaſily be paſt by, than that
one ſin of Rejection of the offer of Grace by Jeſus Chriſt:
Now he calls <hi>all men to Repentance.</hi> And then a third
Text is, that in <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 2. a Text that I made uſe of the laſt
Day for another purpoſe: <hi>For we are unto God a ſweet
Savour of Chriſt in them that are ſaved, and in them that
periſh; to the one we are the ſavour of Death unto Death:</hi>
What's the meaning of that? It is ſomewhat a ſtrange
phraſe and expreſſion, we are the ſavour of death unto
death; <hi>Savour of death:</hi> I take the meaning of the phraſe
to be thus: he compares his Miniſtery that was the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel, unto thoſe things that had a mighty efficacy
in them, a ſtrong vertue; ſo ſtrong, as their very ſavour was
enough, either to kill or to make alive: As there are ſome
things ſo ſtrong, as the very ſent of them can kill a man,
or even raiſe a man from a Sound, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, our
Miniſtry to ſin is the <hi>ſavour of death unto death;</hi> it is a
deadly ſavour to them. Thus you may ſee that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
of the Word, it hath a mighty quickneſs in it one
way or other, either from Heaven or Hell, to Save or to
Deſtroy. And another Scripture we have in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.
there the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Word, the Word of
the Goſpel, for certainly that's that that he ſpeaks of, <hi>v.
12. For the Word of God is quick and powerful, and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
than any two edged Sword, piercing even to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and
Marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of
the Heart.</hi> The Word of the Goſpel whenſoever it comes
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104282:140"/>
to any Congregation, it is no dull matter; you may not
look to ſit dully under that, but it is a quick Word, it
will either ſlay thy ſin, or ſlay thy Soul, one of the two;
it muſt ſlay one, and that quickly. And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. there
the Apoſtle compares the Preaching of the Word of the
Goſpel to the Rain that comes down from Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ground: Now ſaith he in <hi>v. 7. For the Earth
which drinketh in the Rain that cometh oft upon it, and
bringeth forth Herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed,
receiveth Bleſſing from God; but that which beareth Thorns
and Bryars is rejected, and is nigh unto Curſing, whoſe end
is to be burned:</hi> So thoſe people that do receive the
Dews and Showers of the bleſſed Truths of the Goſpel,
and brings forth Fruit and Works meet for him that doth
Dreſs them, and grants them ſuch Showers; theſe ſhall
receive Bleſſing from God: but mark <hi>v<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 8. But <hi>that which
beareth Thorns and Bryars is rejected, and is nigh unto Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
whoſe end is to be burned:</hi> That is, thoſe people that
live under the ſhowers of the Goſpel, and yet bring forth
nothing but Bryars and Thorns, that is, wicked Works,
they live prophanely and ungodlily notwithſtanding all
the ſhowers of the Word that comes upon them: Mark
what the Text ſaith, <hi>ſuch a one is nigh unto Curſing;</hi> he
doth not ſay preſently he <hi>is</hi> Curſed, no not ſo; but he
ſaith, <hi>He is rejected, and is nigh to Curſing, whoſe end is
to be burned,</hi> that is, continuing ſo, his end is to be burnt.
You will ſay, How long ſhall he continue ſo? No, he
cannot continue long, for the Text ſaith, <hi>he is nigh to Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi>
And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. you read there of the Witneſſes, thoſe
Witneſſes the Miniſters of the Goſpel eſpecially that ſtood
up to Witneſs for Chriſt; in <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. they are called <hi>Two
Olive Trees:</hi> The Miniſters of the Goſpel, for they are the
ſpecial Witneſſes to Chriſt, they are <hi>Two Olive-Trees,</hi> that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:104282:141"/>
is, they bring Peace to people. Do not think that theſe
things can any ways contradict what was ſaid before, they
do bring peace; and becauſe their Meſſage of peace is
ſuch a bleſſed Meſſage, therefore it is that the Lord is ſo
ſevere againſt thoſe that do reject it. They are as Olive-trees
to bear the Emblem of Peace, and as Candleſticks
ſtanding before the God of the Earth; but then mark in
<hi>verſ. 5. If any man will hurt them; if any man will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them, fire proceedeth out of their mouths and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
their Enemies; and if any man will hurt them, he
muſt in this manner be killed:</hi> They are Olive-trees, they
come and bring peace; but if they be oppoſed and hurt,
then even fire comes out of their mouths: It is ſtrange
that thoſe that are Olive-branches ſhould have fire in
their mouths. The Witneſſes of Chriſt they are Olive-branches
that have the Meſſage of peace, but if they be
oppoſed and rejected, and hurt, then fire comes out of
their mouths and devours their Enemies: By this fire is
meant the Miniſtry of their Word, the Lord makes it be
as a conſuming Fire to the Souls of thoſe that ſhall reject
their Miniſtry; and that you may ſee Gods quickneſs in
dealing with thoſe that he calls to Repentance, and offers
any Mercy to; you have in the Old Teſtament ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what:
but in the Old Teſtament the Lord never revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his Grace ſo clearly, and therefore we cannot expect
ſo much of Gods quickneſs there as in the New; and yet
mark what he ſaith in <hi>Jer. 18. 9. And at what inſtant I
ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, to build and to plant it;
if it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my Voice, then
will I repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit
them:</hi> If I come and ſpeak unto a Nation, and offer them
Mercy, and tell them of my Grace, if that Nation doth
evil in my ſight, at that very inſtant when I ſpeak, if they
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:104282:141"/>
do not turn from their evil wayes, I will repent of all
the good, and I will take all my goodneſs from them.
You ſee that God expects to have you at an inſtant: You
many times would have your Children and Servants come
as ſoon as you do call, or elſe you are ready to fly in
their Faces; certainly God may juſtly expect that at
what inſtance he ſhould call, that you ſhould come in.
The Lord may be too quick for you, your day may be
paſt, the day of Grace and Salvation may be paſt, I ſay
before you are aware; before your repenting time comes,
Gods forgiving time may be paſt: Though it is true, you
will ſay, At what time a man repents, I, that is, if God give
him a heart: But what if God will not give thee a heart,
but will harden thy heart, and give thee up to thy ſelf?
at <hi>what inſtant</hi> ſaith the Text: And then another Text
is in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. beginning, <hi>Behold I will ſend my Meſſenger,
and he ſhall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom
ye ſeek ſhall ſuddenly come to his Temple:</hi> Now this is
apparently meant concerning Chriſt; but ſaith he, <hi>Who
may abide the day of his coming?</hi> ſo he goes on and
ſhews how ſevere he will be: and then in <hi>verſ. 5. I will
come near to you to Judgement, and I will be a ſwift witneſs
againſt the Sorcerers, and againſt the Adulterers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
falſe Swearers, and againſt thoſe that oppreſs the
Hireling in his gates, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt when he comes, he
comes to be a ſwift Witneſs againſt them that live in
their Wicked wayes after his coming. Indeed all mens
ſins do witneſs againſt them, but now thoſe that live in
Prophaneneſs and Wickedneſs, when Chriſt is come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, I ſay they are to expect Chriſt to be a ſwift
Witneſs againſt them. How quick did the Lord deal
with his People upon their rejection of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
they did often ſin againſt God in the Wilderneſs,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:104282:142"/>
but when they came to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and had an
offer of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> having ſent Spies to ſee the
good Land, and they came and declared what a Good
Land it was; and yet ſome diſcouraging of them, becauſe
of the Children of <hi>Anack,</hi> they were Rebellious, and
would not go to the Land to enter upon it becauſe of
the difficulty they ſhould endure; No, God preſently
Swears againſt them, he takes a Solemn Oath, <hi>that they
ſhould never Enter into his Reſt;</hi> ſo you have it in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.
God did never Swear againſt them, till they came to have
the proffer of the Land; and upon their firſt rejection of
it after the Offer, and declaring to them the good Fruit
of it, upon the very firſt rejection, the Lord Swears in
his Wrath that they ſhould not Enter into it; and ſo they
were to turn back again into the Wilderneſs. Now we
are to know this Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to be a Type, not only
of the Church, but of Heaven it ſelf, and of the good
things of the Goſpel. Now thoſe that live in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
and do not know the good Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and
have not the Offer of it, the Lord may bear a long time
with them; but now when it comes to this, that the Lord
doth reveal unto them the Bleſſed things of Chriſt, and
make an Offer to them of the Bleſſed things of Chriſt, to
<hi>enter into his Reſt,</hi> for ſo it is apparent that the Apoſtle
doth apply it to the Bleſſed things of the Goſpel: If I ſay
when the Lord ſhall diſcover theſe things unto them, they
<hi>ſhall not Enter into this Reſt,</hi> but they ſhall pretend a
great many difficulties, O the Way is ſo ſtrict and hard,
and they ſhall ſuffer ſo much; and upon this do refuſe the
Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Bleſſed things of Jeſus Chriſt; then
is the time if ever, to Swear againſt a Soul that it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be made partaker of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:104282:142"/>
Now then I had thought to have opened the Point fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in three Particulars: <hi>Firſt,</hi> to ſhew what the deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of God doth uſe to be with ſuch, in what way he
deals ſo quick with them; Secondly the Reaſons of it;
and Thirdly to have Anſwered ſome Objections about
this: but I ſhall give you but a Word or two of each, and
ſo come to the Application.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> The way of Gods dealing with ſuch;
it is either as you heard the laſt Day, to take away the
Miniſtry from them, that he doth ſometimes; or if not ſo,
the Lord paſſes a ſentence againſt them, <hi>They ſhall not
taſte of my Supper:</hi> and ſo a man may live a long time
under the Miniſtry of the Word, under a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>Or further, That ſometimes the Lord gives him up to
himſelf, to his own hearts luſts; for this the Goſpel is
the Counſel of God, for ſo it is called in one of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts:
Now mark what Gods dealings was with thoſe
that rejected but his Counſels, in <hi>Pſalm 81. I gave them
up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own
counſels.</hi> And that famous place in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of it, there the Apoſtle ſhews that thoſe that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
but the very light of Nature, God gave them up to a
Reprobate ſenſe; much more thoſe that ſhall reject the
light of the Goſpel: that's the way of God to give them
up ſometimes to the power of their ſin; as if God ſhould
ſay, they will have none of Chriſt, nor of my Grace and
Mercy, their Hearts are ſet upon their Luſts, Luſt take
them, ſuch a luſt of uncleanneſs take them, ſuch an
earthly Luſt take full poſſeſſion of them. The Lord gives
them up to their own Hearts Luſts, the Lord ſaith of them,
<hi>He that will be filthy, let him be filthy ſtill,</hi> as you have it
in <hi>Revelations</hi> the laſt, <hi>he that will be filthy let him be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy;</hi>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:104282:143"/>
and let him have the ſatisfying of his Luſts to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt.</p>
            <p>And ſometimes it is to cut them off by ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
and fearful Judgment, the Lord many times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
moſt dreadfully againſt them.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons that ſhould have ſpent me a great part of
the time, and it might very well require a whole Exerciſe,
to have Opened to you why the Lord is ſo provok'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this Sin rather than another Sin whatſoever it be:
For the Opening of the great Evil that there is in the Sin
of Unbelief and Rejection of the Goſpel; you that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
any thing muſt needs know that it muſt require
a very large time to open it all: But in a very few Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
take them thus.</p>
            <p>You that reject the Goſpel, you ſin againſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Mercy that ever God tendred to Creatures; he never
tendred ſuch a Mercy to the Angels that ſinned againſt
him as to you: Indeed here are the <hi>bowels of Gods mercy,</hi>
as the Scripture calls them, <hi>the tender bowels of Gods
mercy:</hi> Now to ſin againſt the Goſpel, it is to ſpurn at
the very Bowels of God. Many men ſpeak of Mercy, and
deſire to hear much of Mercy, O but you had need look
to your ſelves when you hear much of Mercy, for when
you hear of Mercy your Souls lye at the ſtake one way
or other: God deals more quick with thoſe that hear
much of Mercy, than he doth with others. One Sermon
of Mercy rejected may ſend a man nearer to Hell by far,
than ten Sermons of Judgment. Though you ſhould not
reform after many Sermons of Judgment, yet they do not
make your condition ſo dangerous as one Sermon of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and therefore you had need at any time when you
hear Mercy Opened to you, you had need have your
Hearts ſhake the more, and tremble to think thus, Lord
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:104282:143"/>
here's a Sermon upon which my Soul doth more lye, than
it may be Ten Sermons before, yea perhaps than any that
ever I heard in all my life. Thou comeſt to hear a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of Mercy, and goeſt away and ſayeſt, O what an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Sermon is this! it was a Sermon of the moſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that ever I heard in my life; I ſay, Was it ſo? then thy
Soul lay more upon that Sermon than upon any that ever
thou heardeſt in thy life. Mercy is ſuch an Attribute
which God doth put ſuch a price upon, that it is reſolved
he will revenge the Wrong done to his Mercy: Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
God doth bear with, he is reſolved he will not bear
the Abuſe of his Mercy; and therefore you had need
look to it when you come to hear of Mercy, eſpecially
the Mercy of the Goſpel. There is a great deal of Mercy
in Gods Works, I but when he comes to Preach Jeſus
Chriſt to thee, there's Mercy of another Nature, there
look to thy ſelf: If thou doſt dally and trifle with Gods
Mercy, then thy condition will be moſt Dreadful. I'll
name theſe one or two Arguments to thee, becauſe when
thou ſinneſt againſt the Offer of the Goſpel, then thou
ſinneſt againſt the help of thy Soul, the means to do thee
good. The preaching of the Goſpel it is as a Board after
Shipwrack, for every poor Soul is as a man that hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
Shipwrack, and he is in the midſt of the Sea upon
a Board of the Ship, and there's all his help: Now were
it not a mad thing for this man to put off this Plank from
him when he hath no other help. Now we are ready to
be ſwallowed up of the Sea of Gods Wrath, and now God
caſts in a Plank to waft us to the Shore, if poſſibly may be.
Or rather thus, The Offer of the Goſpel it is like the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
of a Rope into a River, unto a man that is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Drowning. There is a man that is fallen into the
<hi>Thames,</hi> and you cannot get him up, but you will get a
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104282:144"/>
line and throw it into the place where he ſunk, and there
is no way for him to be Sav'd, but only that: Now if
ſuch a man put off the time from him, what help can
there be of that man. Thus it is, all Men and Women
naturally, they are even ready to ſink into the Bottomleſs
Gulf of Eternal Miſery; this is thy condition. Now
the Lord in Mercy ſends his Miniſters to come and make
an Offer of the Goſpel, and caſt a line to Congregations,
and make this Proclamation, In the Name of God, every
Soul that will take hold of this, may be ſaved from ſinking
into the bottomleſs Gulf of Eternal Horror and Deſpair;
and there is no way to ſave any ſinking Soul but only this.
Now if men ſlight and diſregard this, and put it off, is it
not juſt that men ſhould ſink down; this that I ſpeak will
eb foundgood one day: the Lord forbid that any one
Soul in this Place ſhould find this ſimilitude made good
upon them; that is, to ſink into the bottomleſs Gulf: and
there to conſider with himſelf, had not I a line caſt to
me for the Saving of me, and had I catch'd hold of it as
others did, might not I have been Saved as well as they.
This I ſay the Lord will make good one day.</p>
            <p>But now, becauſe much may be ſaid, As doth not God
call at the Eleventh hour and the like? And grant God
may call at the eleventh hour, I but it is not ſaid God
will call eleven times? That is, God may let Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
go a long time, and at length call them; but what
have you in Scripture after Rejection of Calls to Call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
do not miſtake me, I do not ſay but that God may
call eleven ſcore times; I but it is more than ſuch a one
may expect: the Lord calls at the Eleventh hour: but
you do not hear, if they refuſe then, what he will do after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
So you ſay, That the Theef on the Croſs was called
at the laſt hour, but who knows whether ever he did
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:104282:144"/>
hear of Jeſus Chriſt before that time; therefore your caſe
is not his, though it's true he was Saved at the laſt: I but
it may be he did never reject Chriſt in his life, and it
was the firſt time that ever Jeſus Chriſt was made known
to him for ought any can tell? and do you ſo? though
you be old ſinners, yet upon the offer of the Goſpel if you
ſhall preſently come in, then you may be received; but
what may be after the offer of the Goſpel I cannot
tell.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, That we find by Experience, that God
doth Convert thoſe that lives a long time under Meanes;
It's true he may be patient towards them, I but it is more
than they can expect, that it ſhould be ſo; and mark it,
you muſt not venture upon Gods patience with another,
to think that he will be patient ſo long with thee: I will
give you a notable Scripture for that, the Example is
in <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> in <hi>2 Chron.</hi> 33. 1. there you have the Story
of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> how wicked a man he was; and <hi>Manaſſes</hi>
did Reign Fifty five Years, though he were a very Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, yet the Lord ſuffered him to Reign Fifty five
Years, and it is like moſt of this time was in his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
but now comes his Son <hi>Amon</hi> after him <hi>v.</hi> 21. and
perhaps <hi>Amon</hi> he might think thus; Why may not I do
as my Father did? The Lord was patient with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
many Years, and why may not I venture as he did?
and ſo he did venture to live in the Wickedneſs that
his Father had lived in; but mark, God was quick with
him; though he ſpared <hi>Manaſſes</hi> the Father, yet he was
quick with <hi>Amon</hi> the Son, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. God ſpared him
but Two Years, for <hi>he died Wickedly,</hi> as the Story ſhews
you afterwards; ſo that you muſt know Gods patience is
his own. God may be patient with one perhaps Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:104282:145"/>
or thirty Years, and he will not with another ſo many
moneths.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then by way of Application,<note place="margin">Appl.</note> thus much:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Hence Miniſters may ſee cauſe when they come
to Preach Jeſus Chriſt to a People, to come with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
hearts; and the truth is, though it be that that
their Souls deſire above all, and they account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(or ſhould do) in their Element, when they are
opening Jeſus Chriſt unto you; yet upon the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Point, they cannot Preach Chriſt unto you
without trembling Hearts; for they have theſe thoughts
whatſoever you have, Lord I am now going to Preach
Chriſt, and open the Myſteries of Grace to this People; I
but if they ſhould reject it, how quick will the Lord
Deal with them; the Miniſtry of my Word, How ſoon
may it be to cut them down, and to ſend them to their
own places? Therefore thoſe that know what they do,
cannot but come with Trembling Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> From hence, Let all thoſe that have liv'd
under the Goſpel, and yet the Lord hath been patient
towards them for a long time, O let them learn to Bleſs
the Name of God: I perhaps was Born of Godly Parents,
and they inſtill'd good Principles into me, and they were
careful to ſet me under good Preaching, yea and I not
only had the outward Offer of Grace, but God knows
how often Gods Spirit came &amp; offered Chriſt to my Soul,
and yet I went on ſtubbornly and ſtoutly a long time.
O the rich Mercy of God, that he did not wholly give
me up, and cut me off! Rich Mercy! And what hath God
yet come and ſtrove with me again for all this Rejection?
O the Riches of the Grace of God towards me more than
towards others! Thou haſt cauſe to magnifie God, for it
is not an ordnary thing for God to deal ſo with People
as he hath dealt with thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:104282:145"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let all thoſe that do come to hear the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel, to hear the Word of the Goſpel, and yet
their Conſciences tell them that they are Oppoſers of it,
and ſecret Contemners of it, and are reſolved to go on in
their wayes, let there be ſaid what will be, yet they reſolve
to go on, and to continue as Vile as formerly: O that the
Lord would ſtrike ſome ſuch bold Sinner this Day by
this Word. By this Point that hath been thus Preached
unto thee, the Lord ſtrike thy Heart thou bold Sinner
that dareſt be bold even againſt the face of the Mercy of
God in Jeſus Chriſt, that dareſt be bold to kick as it
were God in his Bowels: If the Lord hath any purpoſe
to do good unto thee, he will ſtrike thy Heart, and humble
thee before him, in that that thou haſt gone on thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſo much rich Grace as thou haſt done; as <hi>Jehu</hi>
ſaid in another caſe, <hi>What haſt thou to do with Peace,
get thee behind me:</hi> So is God a Merciful God, and the
Preacher Preaches Mercy; howſoever thou wilt live in
the face of the Mercy of God in thy wicked wayes, What
haſt thou to do with Mercy? Now if this be ſo, Hearken
to the Exhortation in the Second <hi>Pſalm, Kiſs the Son leſt
he be angry;</hi> there indeed lies the Emphaſis, <hi>Kiſs the Son</hi>
ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt:</hi> What ſhall the Son of God, that is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, come to be Preached to you, and do you reject
him? No, take heed what you do, <hi>Kiſs him;</hi> and that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
it is a ſign of Obedience, for ſo it was uſed in thoſe
times, they came and Kiſs'd the Prince as a ſign of their
Subjection to him: <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> Obey the Goſpel, ſubmit
to it, Why? <hi>leſt he be angry;</hi> leſt the Son of God be angry:
The anger of the Son of God is a dreadful anger; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God the Father is dreadful, and yet the Anger of the
Son of God in ſome reſpect is more dreadful; as the Anger
of the Holy Ghoſt is moſt dreadful of all, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:104282:146"/>
ſaith, <hi>The ſin againſt him can never be forgiven.</hi> And
next, <hi>Kiſs the Son,</hi> and that becauſe there is ſo much Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the Son; therefore if he be rejected, his anger is ſo
much the more dreadful, <hi>And leſt you periſh in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi>
that is, when you hope to live many years, to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more Merry-meetings with your Companions, and do
not think your ſelves to be nigh to periſhing; ſaith the
Text, <hi>In the mid way:</hi> the Lord comes upon ſuch when
they leaſt think of it. The Lord comes upon many, and
cuts them off in the middle of their years. This Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
no queſtion it was in part that cauſed Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
when the Lord Chriſt was Revealed to him, that he dared
not put off a day, no ſaith the Text, <hi>Gal. 1. 15, 16. When it
pleaſed God who ſeperated me from my Mothers Womb, and
called me by his Grace to reveal his Son in me, that I might
Preach him among the Heathen; immediately I conferred
not with fleſh and blood;</hi> immediately, as ſoon as ever God
was pleaſed to reveal Chriſt to me, or in me, <hi>I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with fleſh and blood,</hi> that is, I dar'd not ſo much as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
about the difficulty of the way, or what I ſhould ſuffer
if I took this courſe; I dar'd not go to my Company and
take their Advice and Counſel, No, ſaith he, but as
ſoon as ever the Lord was pleaſed to reveal Chriſt in me,
I preſently went about the Work; and ſo in the 26th. of
the <hi>Acts,</hi> where he tells the ſtory of his Converſion, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Gods revealing himſelf to him in that glorious
way of a Viſion, <hi>Whereupon O King</hi> Agrippa <hi>I was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to the Heavenly Viſion;</hi> the very firſt Viſion I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
ſubmitted to: <hi>Paul</hi> he fell down and ſaid, <hi>Lord what
wilt thou have me to do?</hi> upon the firſt manifeſtation of
Chriſt unto him: O do you take heed that you be not
diſobedient to the Heavenly Viſion; perhaps together
with the Miniſtry of the Word the Lord may grant to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104282:146"/>
ſome of your Souls a Viſion, that is, he may come with
his Spirit and ſhew ſome of the Glory of his Son to you;
O be not diſobedient to the Heavenly Viſion, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
yield to it, and confer not with fleſh and
blood.</p>
            <p>O but you will ſay this is hard, you come at firſt and
ſay Peace to us, but this is very ſevere to tell us how
quick the Lord is.</p>
            <p>But Obſerve it, It is but ſeverity to thoſe that put off
Mercy: then if you love Mercy ſo well, what need you
fear this Severity.</p>
            <p>But further, Know that upon your receiving of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
the Lord will be as quick with you in wayes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as he is in Judgments to thoſe that do reject it. You
will ſay, How quick will the Lord be in the wayes of his
Mercy? Thus quick, that upon thy receiving the Goſpel,
and Believing, the very firſt inſtant of thy receiving it,
thou ſhalt be delivered from all thy ſin, the guilt of all thy
ſin, thou ſhalt be made as clear from the guilt of ſin as the
Child that is new born, and more clear a great deal: How
quick is God now.</p>
            <p>Yea thou ſhalt be made as clear from the guilt of all thy
great ſins that thou haſt committed, I ſay as clear from the
guilt of them as the Saints are in Heaven, and this at the
firſt moment of thy Entertaining of Jeſus Chriſt; thou
ſhalt be as clear as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> thou ſhalt
be equal with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the point of
thy Juſtification; yea in regard of any guilt of ſin,
thou ſhalt be as unſpotted before the Lord as the Saints
are in Heaven: O the Lord is willing to be quick with
you in wayes of Mercy.</p>
            <p>Now then conſider of both, Here we ſet Life and Death
before you; we know it is not in Mens power indeed,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:104282:147"/>
but we know God doth uſe to Bleſs his Miniſtry ſo as to
convey power by his Miniſtry: God is quick both wayes;
upon Entertaining he is quick in wayes of Mercy, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to clear the Soul from all thoſe horrible Wicked Sins
that thou haſt been guilty of; and if thou ſhalt reject it,
then thou may'ſt fear that the Lord will be quick with
thee another way. O conſider what hath been ſaid in
this Point, and in this Text, and the <hi>Lord</hi> give you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
