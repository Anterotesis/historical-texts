            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with him, yet in the end they fell to him, especially out of the Tribes of <hi>Judah, Benjamin, Gad,</hi> and <hi>Manasseh,</hi> so many that his Army <hi>grew to be like an Army of God.</hi> And lest any man should thinke that it were no better then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in him and them to beare defensive Armes against his Prince,<note place="margin">Verse 22.</note> it is said in the 18 Verse, <hi>That the Spirit came upon one of the chiefe Commanders,</hi> and told him they were his, and would live and die with him, and that God was with him, they knew him innocent; they saw he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly persecuted, they came to rescue him as a Partridge out of a Falcons Talons, and in so doing they did no more, then the whole hoste did at another time, when they saved <hi>Jonathan</hi> out of the hands of his father <hi>Saul,</hi> who would unjustly have put him to death.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.45.</note> The other part of the Chapter beginning at Verse 23. containeth the Catalogue of the Commanders and Souldiers that fell in to him to make him King, after the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and there you shall finde that the excellent qualities of all the Leaders, and of many of the Souldiers are described; some of them were excellent Archers, some were exact Slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers who could throw and hit at a haires breadth, some of them were as couragious as Lions, some of them were as swift as the Roes upon the Mountaines, but none of them all came neere the Tribe of <hi>Issachar,</hi> in that which makes a people strong and happy both in the time of warre and peace; <hi>They were men of understanding, who knew the times what Israel had to doe</hi>; and of this excellent commendation of this Tribe of <hi>Issachar,</hi> as of a Theame that very much concernes us, I have chosen to treate this day before this great Assembly by the assistance of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God;<note place="margin">The Text opened and divided.</note> wherein there are three things to bee handled. First,</p>
            <p>The persons spoken of, <hi>the Tribe of Issachar,</hi> and their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> heads and leaders especially. Secondly,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96242:4"/>
               <hi>Their singular commendations, they had understanding to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> know the times, what Israel, had to doe</hi>; the whole Tribe, but especially their Leaders, who were about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, knew the times in reference to their duty. Thirdly,</p>
            <p>Here is the interest which these Leaders had in the hearts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of their Brethren, and this procured principally by their wisedome and understanding; <hi>all their Brethren were at their command,</hi> or as the word signifies, <hi>depended on their mouth.</hi> I begin briefly to speake of the first.</p>
            <p>The persons, they were the men of <hi>Issachar; Issachar</hi> you know was one of the twelve Tribes,<note place="margin">1 Part, what the Tribe of <hi>Issachar</hi> was.</note> one of <hi>Iacobs</hi> sonnes by <hi>Leah,</hi> and their lot in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> fell betwixt the halfe Tribe of <hi>Manasseh</hi> and <hi>Zebulun,</hi> and their province was bounded by the mountaines of <hi>Gilboa</hi> on the one side, and mount <hi>Hermon</hi> on the other; all that goodly part of the Countrey, that was called the fat valley of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> was the inheritance of this Tribe of <hi>Issachar,</hi> a rich in-land Country, and formerly their Spirits and Genius was like to that of Country Farmers.<note place="margin">
                  <p>What their temper and spirit in time past.</p>
                  <p>Gen. 49.14, 15 opened and explained.</p>
               </note> They min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing but their back and their belly, and so <hi>Jacob</hi> himselfe did foretell of them, in the 49. of <hi>Genesis,</hi> when he said, that <hi>Issachar was like a strong Asse that couched downe betweene two burthens, and saw that rest was good, and gave himselfe willingly to beare Tribute</hi>: The meaning was, that this Tribe would bee like unto that dull, simple, slothfull creature the Asse, that minded nothing but his belley, give him but meate enough for his belly and lay what you will upon his back; so this Tribe, if they might not be outed or plundred in their rich Country, but might follow their businesse, and gather wealth, lay any thing upon them they would beare it: this of old was the Genius of this Tribe, but <hi>now</hi> another manner of Spirit possessed them; none of all the Maritine townes nor Cities where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are most active, and fit for Negotiation, went beyond,<note place="margin">What at the present.</note>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96242:5"/>
or came neere to the Tribe of <hi>Issachar,</hi> now (I say) they had learned that that makes a people happy, they had wisedome and unitie, they had understanding to know the times and their dutie, they had many thousands of eyes to see into the true state of affaires, and then they had as many thousand hands ready to execute; they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fall upon that which belonged to them; <hi>they had understanding of the times, and knew</hi> not onely what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but what all the Country, what all <hi>Israel had to doe</hi>; this was the people, and this strange alteration that God had made in the Spirit of this Tribe of <hi>Issachar,</hi> doth afford us this excellent lesson.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Lord can at his pleasure inable and raise up the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of persons,</hi>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <note place="margin">God oft raiseth up the spirits of people to doe worthily from whom men would little expect it.</note> 
               <hi>and people to doe worthily, from whom no body would expect any thing. Moses</hi> had foretold that <hi>Issachar</hi> would bee but a dull Asse, but you see how the Lord had altered, and raised him up to doe excellently; hee went beyond all the other Tribes; and God hath often done so, hee takes <hi>Moses</hi> a Shepheard, a man slow of speech, sends him and makes him a fit man to deliver a whole nation out of bondage and captivitie; at another time, hee raises <hi>Gideon,</hi> a private Gentleman, it may bee but a Yeomans sonne,<note place="margin">Gen 4. Iudges 6. 1 Sam 9. 1 Sam. 16.</note> from his Flayle when hee was threshing of Wheat, and makes him a Captaine to route the whole Army of the Midianites and to judge his people; at another time takes <hi>Saul,</hi> a Private Gentlemans sonne, who was seeking for his fathers Asses, and makes him fit to governe a kingdome; takes <hi>David</hi> a young youth from following his Ewes great with Lambe, and presently enables him to cope with the Gyant <hi>Goliah,</hi> and to destroy him, and afterwards to bee the ruler over Gods people;<note place="margin">Amos 7.14.</note> hee takes <hi>Amos</hi> from being a Neatheard, and a gatherer of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fruit, to bee a Prophet, and to preach in the Kings Chappell; takes Fishermen who were never bred in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96242:5"/>
and sends them into all the world with the power of the Gospel to subdue the Nations to Jesus Christ. Thus the Lord hath raised up instruments, and hee can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily doe it, for there is a spirit in man,<note place="margin">Reasons of it. He hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Spirit.</note> but the inspiration which gives understanding and gifts comes onely from the Almighty; the Lord hath abundance of the Spirit, and powres it out where, and how, and in what manner hee pleaseth.<note place="margin">Application.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This may bee a great incouragement to us in all our extremities and exigents, let us doe our dutie, and let us never feare Gods wanting of instruments for his worke; when wee are low, wee presently cry out, Lord <hi>by whom shall Jacob arise,</hi> by whom? by stones raised up to bee children, and by children inabled to doe the worke of men: Wee should never bee at our faiths end, though sometimes wee are at our wits end, let us doe our dutie, and leave it to God, who can easily raise up instruments to do his worke, from whom wee would never expect it; wee our selves have had a great deale of blessed experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it. In the beginning of our publique troubles, our question was, by whom shall <hi>England</hi> arise now it is thus low? Wee demanded, where shall wee finde Captaines and Commanders for a warre in a Nation where all men have been bred in ease and peace? God hath found them, and tooke Gentlemen from following their Hawkes and Dogs, and Tradesmen from their shops, and Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from their Ploughes, to bee able to cope with the most expert Commanders in the world: and now wee are at another losse, now wee are demanding, where shall we find Ministers for eight or ten thousand Congregations, to instruct them in the way of life? Feare not, if God for our sinnes deny us not this mercy,<note place="margin">Psal. 68.11.</note> hee can fulfill that in the 68. Psalme; <hi>The Lord will give the Word, and great shall be the multitude of them that shall publish it,</hi> the Lord can raise

them up unexpectedly; and so in all other our difficulties.</p>

            <p>I shall interpret the meaning of it, make you see what it is to know the times in reference to duties. Secondly,</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">3ly, applyed.</note>I shall indeavour to make Application of it for our own good. For the first,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">First explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there is a fivefold knowledge of the times.</note>What it is to know the times in reference to dutie; you may please to observe that in the Scripture, and in the practise of men, there is found a fivefold knowledge of the times.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Astrologicall.</note>There is an <hi>Astrologicall</hi> knowledge of the times, such a knowledge as the Starre-gazers do boast of; a knowledg whereby a company of vaine men doe undertake out of the bookes of the Starres to tell you whatsoever God hath decreed concerning Men or States: this knowledg is so condemned in other places of Scripture that none of you will imagine, that this was the commendation of this Tribe. Secondly,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Diabolicall.</note>There is another knowledge of the times, which I may call a <hi>Diabolicall</hi> knowledge of the times, whereby wicked and ungodly men do studie to improve all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96242:6"/>
of time to further their own lusts and wickednesses; the study and knowledge of time-servers, who indeavour to make the times further them in their cursed designes; men who like Willowes or Bulrushes in the water will bow which way soever the streame runs, and dance after the present Fiddle of the times for their owne ends. I am certaine none of you think that this was the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Tribe; such Temporizers &amp; Time-servers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may for a while applaud their own wisedomes, will one day know, they have served but an ill Master; this was farre from the Tribe of <hi>Issachar.</hi> Thirdly,</p>
            <p>You shall read of a <hi>Propheticall</hi> knowledge of the times,<note place="margin">3 Propheticall.</note> that is, such a knowledge as wherein the Lord by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth in able some of his servants, I meane the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to know what shall afterwards come to passe; and this kinde of knowledge, though every man hath an itch after it, and many doe as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did,<note place="margin">Dan. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>29.</note> when his thoughts troubled him in the night, that hee might know what should come to passe afterwards; yet our Lord hath told us, <hi>That it is not for us thus to know the times and seasons, which the Father hath kept in his owne hand</hi>;<note place="margin">Act. 1.7.</note> there is fourthly,</p>
            <p>Another knowledge of the Times, and study of it,<note place="margin">4 Historicall and Astronomicall</note> which is, an <hi>Historicall</hi> knowledge of the times, or an <hi>Astronomicall</hi> knowledge of the times; a knowledge which is extremely and deservedly cried up by learned men; a knowledge wherein many men of choycest wits, both among Heathens and Christians, have tooke very great paines, wherein they have much advanced wisedome and learning, especially in our latter age. Many rare men of choycest abilities have set downe in a continued Series, a Chronologie of all the yeers, that have been since the Creation, and of the most memorable things and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that have fallen out, or lived in the severall ages, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96242:7"/>
yeeres; and this they have done to their owne everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honour, rectifying the accompt of time, and extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantaged even the studie of the Scriptures; now this knowledge, though it bee excellent, yet my Text hath nothing to doe with it, and truly though it bee an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing, men may have it, and yet die fooles, and be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable for want of that knowledge which I am this day to speake of. The Nation of the Jewes were admirable in that kind of accompt of times: <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith of them, they were exact even to admiration; and <hi>Sethus Calvisius</hi> one of the most learned writers of that kind, though hee goe another way to worke, yet confesses that in the Jewes accompt, they did not lose above the accompt of one houre in the space of 1500. yeers; yet because they had no better knowledge of the times then that, the Lord in the eighth of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Ier. 8.</note> they were fooles, and had not so much wisedome, as the Crane and the Storke, and the Swallow, those irrationall Animals, who had so much sagacitie, as to know the times of their comming into a Countrey, and leaving a Countrey; but this people knew nothing of the times in reference to Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their owne duties: the Lord counted them fooles for all their other learning; And therefore there is, fiftly,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5 Theologicall, a gracious and practicall knowledge, which is here meant.</note>Another knowledge of the times, which I may call a Theologicall knowledge, or rather a gratious and a practicall knowledge of the times, which is, so to know the times, as to understand the moment and exigence of all affaires which fall within the times in reference to their owne dutie, that they may improve all occurrences which fall out to the right end. This is the knowledge that I am to speake of, and this knowledge infinitely goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that other; I confesse I finde a great many learned Volumes writ for the helpe of the other, to further the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96242:7"/>
Chronologicall, or Historicall wisedome of the times, abundance of Astronomicall Tables have been compiled, and other helpes set forth; but for this latter, I hardly know one little Pamphlet extant about it, and yet this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely goes beyond the other; for though a man should die ignorant of the other, and never know the <hi>Julian</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or wherein the new &amp; old stile differ one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if hee have but learned to number his dayes, so as to apply his heart to wisedome, hee will honour God here, and bee happy for ever; but without this, what learning soever hee had in the other, his life will be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and in the end hee will die a foole: And this was the knowledge of this Tribe, this Practicall knowledge, so that when the other Tribes some of them stood for the house of <hi>Saul,</hi> to continue the government there, others of them inclined to <hi>David</hi> to make him King, and others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably were unsatisfied in their thoughts concerning ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, possibly thinking it would bee best to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their old Aristocraticall government, in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Tribes, and to waite that God should raise them up extraordinary Judges in difficult times, and so they stood in a kind of indifferency and neutralitie; these men of <hi>Issachar,</hi> especially their Leaders, had so studied the times, that they did not onely know what was lawfull and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in this huge turne of theirs,<note place="margin">What this practicall knowledge of the times is.</note> in this great businesse that was before them, but they knew what was their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yea what all the kingdome, all the Common-wealth ought to doe with them, they knew the times, and what <hi>Israel had to doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this knowledge that I have brought you to, is not a mentall or speculative understanding of humane affaires, or things belonging either to Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, but it is a Practicall knowledge, which is a wise abilitie to manage all the understanding that they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96242:8"/>
have in reference to their dutie; in one word, it is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all Gods administrations, wherewith the present time is filled, his providences, his mercies, his judgements, his words, his workes, to observe them (I say) so as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bee inabled seasonably and timely to performe their owne duties, and to regulate their conversations accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exigence and juncture of times, for the glory of God, the good of their brethren, and the salvation of their owne soules, and this is the Theame wherein I now proceed.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To shew it you plainely out of the Scriptures, that it is a marvailous high commendation, and a deserved one. And secondly,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I shall indeavour to make a further illustration of this Doctrine, of knowing the times, out of Gods Word.</p>

The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls this wisedome.</note>To prove that it is such a high and deserved commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, take but these three proofes. First, every where in the Scripture this is counted true wisedome, and in the accompt of God, they goe for wise men, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the times in reference to their duties; looke first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fift of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> at the eight verse, and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.15, 16. opened and explained.</note> the Apostle layes downe this great Doctrine, That now God had sent the light of the Gospell amongst them, they must not for time to come walke as other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did walke in the vanitie of their minds, but they must leade a life worthy of the Gospell; and this hee proves by many Arguments, which when hee hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then in the 15. and 16. verses, hee sets downe what this life is, <hi>see then,</hi> that you walke <gap reason="foreign">

Fooles but as Wise men</hi>; wherein lies that? <hi>redeeming the time, because the dayes are evill</hi>; there is all required, there is the manifestation and demonstration, that you do not walke like Fooles, but as Wise men, if you have but once learned to redeeme the time in these evill dayes; the dayes are naught, the times are evill, full of snares to be avoyded, many duties to bee done; now herein will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare Gospell-wisedome, to walke so as that in these evill dayes, you may redeeme the time: and <hi>Solomon</hi> hath an excellent discourse of the same subject, in the eighth of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> in the beginning of the Chapter,<note place="margin">Ecles. 8.1. to 6. opened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

No, saith <hi>Salomon</hi> in the fifth Verse, <hi>the wise man knowes both time and judgement</hi>; the wise man that hath the interpretation of a thing, knowes what is to bee done, what is to bee refused, and when things are to bee done most fitly or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely; therefore none like the wise man.

               <note place="margin">Deut. 32.19.</note> about the 19. Verse, <hi>O that this people were wise, that they did but understand their last end</hi>; that they but rightly knew their time: and in the 90.

               <note place="margin">Psal. 90.12.</note> to make such a compute of our times, <hi>that wee might apply our hearts to wisedome.</hi> I might give you many other Scriptures which show that the Lord counts this to be true wisedome; nay, I'le add this further, the very light of nature hath taught the Heathens to judge this to bee true wisedome: the seven Counsellors of that great Emperour of <hi>Persia,</hi> in the first of <hi>Ester</hi> are said to bee <hi>men that knew the times,</hi> the meaning is, that they were wise Counsellors;<note place="margin">Ester 1.13.</note> and among the Romans it is a Proverbiall Adage, <hi>homo omnium horarum,</hi> that is, hee is a wise man that is a man for all houres, knowes the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of every time, of every place, whatsoever hee is called to, hee understands his affaires; and in truth this may well bee <hi>called</hi> wisedome, for <hi>it is</hi> wisedome; it is not onely a part of wisedome, but it is the very Systeme and comprehension of all wisedome: I know there is a particular wisedome that men may have in some affaires, as a Husbandman that knowes but how to plough his ground seasonably,<note place="margin">Esay 28.16.</note> &amp;c. that is called his wisedome; and the women that did but know how to spin finely, &amp;c. Men may have a kind of wisedome in this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar trade,<note place="margin">Exod. 36.</note> and yet all the world may know him to bee a foole in everything else; but that that is the true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wisedome which properly sets a man out to goe for a wise man,<note place="margin">What wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> properly stands in the true understanding of the times, in reference to mens duties.</p>
            <p>For both Philosophers and Divines doe agree, that wisedome is made up of these two things; the one is, Intelligence, which is nothing but the understanding of things in their nature, as they are good or evill; the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96242:9"/>
other is Sapience, which is the same understanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to particular businesses, as they stand vested with all their circumstances: and that man that hath the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of affaires, as they are circumstantianted with all things that goe with them, and knowes how hee may dexterously and opportunely apply himselfe to them, hee is the wise man, that is the first proofe, <hi>that the Spirit of God every where calls this wisedome.</hi> Secondly,</p>
            <p>The same Spirit of God doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sually call the want of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this, folly; whatsoever other excellencies meete in any man, if they want this, the Scripture calls them fooles; yea hypocrites, wicked ones, in the 8. of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the Lord speakes in the 6, 7, 8, 9. Verses, after this manner,<note place="margin">Jer. 8.6, 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>How doe you say you are wise?</hi> why doe you pretend to wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (and hee speakes not to the vulgar people, but to the Scribes, their learnedst men, that could handle their tongues and their pens best) there was no wisedome in them, they were fooles; Why? because (saith God) <hi>the Storke, and the Crane, and the Swallow know their seasons, but this people knowes not the time of my judgements</hi>; and therefore the Lord would not have them pretend to any wisedome, but bee contented to bee counted fooles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were ignorant of this: and our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the 16. of <hi>Matthew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 16.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> when the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, and the learned Doctors of the Law came and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to have some further evidence from him, by some signe from heaven, that hee was the Messias; Christ told them they were Hypocrites, they were a sinfull and an adulterous Generation, meerely because they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the signes of the times, A wicked and an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous generation would have more light: you can tell by the Clouds when it will bee faire weather next morning, and you can guesse by the morning whether it will be rain; but yee hypocrites, yee fooles (saith hee) you cannot
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96242:10"/>
discerne the signes of the times, what the times signifies, and calls for at your hands, you have no understanding of this, and therefore you may goe for a company of fooles, and hypocrites, and so left them and departed. Nay, thirdly, which makes it yet more cleare,</p>
            <p>The want of this knowledge of the times in reference <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to mans dutie, is that which the Spirit of God uses to render as the onely cause of a peoples ruine: whensoever a people are brought to ruine, if they be a people to whom God afforded meanes to save them, when they come to be ruin'd, the Lord layes it wholly upon this, <hi>that they knew not the times of their visitation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 19.41.44.</note> This you'le find in the 19. of <hi>Luke,</hi> and the latter end of it, when Christ about the 41. Verse, came to take his farefull of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and to die there; from the top of the Mountaine he looked over the Citie and fell a weeping, O (saith hee) <hi>that thou hadst but known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace, but they are hid from thy eyes</hi>; then hee goes on and tells them what shall become of them, <hi>the enemies shall cast a banke and not leave one stone upon another, levell them to the ground and their Children in them</hi>; for what I pray? <hi>because thou knew'st not the time of thy visitation:</hi> destruction came in onely at that breach, they knew not the time of their visitation;<note place="margin">Matth. 24. Luke 17.</note> and elsewhere our Lord saith, in the latter end of the world, when ruine shall come, it will bee then, as it was in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> and as it was in the dayes of <hi>Lot,</hi> men shall bee eating and drinking, and marrying wives, <hi>but know nothing</hi> they should do for their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation till utter ruine come upon them. I hope now the truth of this Lesson is cleare out of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>But if you please to goe a little further yet, and consider the excellency and difficulty of this wisedome to know the times, how much depends upon it, &amp; how much is required to it, you'l bee fully satisfied, that a greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96242:10"/>
can never bee given of any man, or any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then this, that they know the times in reference to their duties: and that I may open what belongs to the making up of this worke,<note place="margin">The right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the times ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of the Scripture in 6. Conclusions.</note> I beseech you give mee leave to open these six Conclusions out of the Scripture, which all much concerne this wisedome of knowing the times in reference to dutie. First,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That time is one of the most pretious treasures that ever God bestowes upon any man, or any people</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conclus.</hi> 1.</note> 1. because time is the onely measure out of which God powres out all his administrations. 2. Time it is the onely space in which men are to doe all their worke.<note place="margin">Exod. 21.19.</note> 3. It's so pretious that God would have men value it one to another: if any man had hurt another, hee must not onely pay for his healing, <hi>but hee must pay for the losse of his time.</hi> Yea, 4. God calls upon his people to redeeme it at any rate; <hi>Redeeme the time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.16. Col. 4.5.</note> 
               <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the time,</hi> as if there were no commoditie, that the God of heaven would so commend unto men (next to his truth) that wee should buy so eagerly, as wee should purchase time. Yea, 5. it is so pretious, that Hee who is at that great cost to make and contrive it, as to cause the Sunne every day to run about the world, and all those excellent creatures in the firmament to make it their work, for the continuation of time will call men to accompt for every moment, for every minute of it: That is my first Conclusion, that time is a pretious Jewell in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and ought to be so in all people's. Secondly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God hath joyned time and dutie inseparably one to another</hi>; so that there is no dutie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conclus.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 3.1, 2, &amp;c.</note> but it hath an appointed time for it, and there is no time, but it, hath an appointed dutie for it; it's disputable whether there bee a <hi>vacuum</hi> in nature or no, it is most certaine there is no <hi>vacuum</hi> in time: No man ever lives to see that minute of time, nor that ragge or cranny of time, of which hee may truely say at this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96242:11"/>

               <hi>There are some great duties that are to bee concurrent in the practise of all men, with every moment of their lives</hi>: My meaning plainly is this, the great businesse of glorifying God, of saving our immortall soules, of keeping a good conscience, of working out our salvation, these great things are not set off by God to any set time, but they are to be concurrent with every moment of a mans time; Trust in the Lord <hi>at all times</hi>;<note place="margin">Esay 26.

            <p>
               <hi>Severall times,</hi> I meane the severall compositions of times,<note place="margin">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96242:11"/>
junctures of time. Now so often as God doth make a new Scene of the time, every man hath some new duty or other to act; his part requires that hee should act some new thing; the Scripture is full of such expressions as these, <hi>in the times of prosperitie doe thus, in the time of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie doe thus, in the time of the Gospel doe thus, &amp;c.</hi> Now to know the time, and the severall duties belonging to every time, is one of the hardest things that belong to the taske of man, this wisedome lies in the deepe; it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing to find out what the duties are that belong to the severall times. But then fiftly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Booke of God, and onely the Booke of God,</hi>

               <hi>is able to informe them who faithfully study it, in all the duties that doe belong to every new posture or face of time.</hi> First I say, <hi>onely Gods Booke</hi> can do it, there are Bookes of excellent wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome written by other men, but take them all together, let a man bee never so versed in them, they will never discover to him every duty that belongs to every time, but the Booke of God can doe it if men have their senses exercised in the study of it; there is no time so intricate, no dutie so arduous, but the booke of God will teach all men, from the Minister to the Hearer, from the Prince to the Subject, to make every one of them perfect in all the workes which belong to them. Psalme 19.7. it is said,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>the Word gives understanding to the simple</hi>; and in the third of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> Vers. 21, 22, 23 <hi>In all thy wayes acknowledge her, and thou shalt walke in thy way safely,</hi>

               <note place="margin">Esay 30.21.</note> and these must bee thy steps. Sixtly, and principally,</p>
            <p>As there are severall times,<note place="margin">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96242:12"/>
to these times, so in every time for any duty, <hi>there is some particle of that time, which is the opportunitie of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> the season of the dutie there is <hi>the space of time,</hi> and <hi>there is the season of time</hi>; the space of time is nothing but the continuation and succession of so many minutes and moments one of another; but the season of time, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of it, is time apted and fitted, to doe a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Now these two doe very much differ one from another, the one of them the length, the duration of time, the Greeks calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but the season, the opportunitie is called <gap reason="foreign">

And concerning these seasons of time or times fitted for businesse, be pleased to consider these five things, I shall need onely to name them, because I speake to an understanding people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That any worke to be done is done easily if the opportunitie be taken</hi>; take opportunitie by the forelock, and any busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse whatsoever is to bee done, will bee done with ease; not onely because opportunitie is the ripenesse of time, but because in opportunities <hi>God offers</hi> to worke with us, and for us: Now you know any businesse that must bee done by the helpe of another, is then easily done, when both parties joyne in it. Two Men that are to lift up a burthen, if they both lift together, and take the <hi>Hae, now,</hi> it goes up easily. A vessell that is to be driven, if the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ply the Oares, the wind &amp; tide go with them, the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell is carried easily; Now (I say) the Lord offers himselfe to come in to a people when there is a fit opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

time: God offers to come in and helpe, if oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie bee taken; This made the heathens esteeme op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie a goddesse.</p>
            <p>As things are easie when men take opportunities, so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>they are then beautifull</hi>; the beautie and grace of every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, both with God and man, is, when it is done in its fit season; the righteous man in the first Psalme, is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Tree that brings forth his fruit in his season, <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in suo,</hi> his owne fruit, and in his proper <hi>season;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>God</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) hath made every thing beautifull in its season</hi>;<note place="margin">Eccles. 3.11.</note> all Gods works are beautifull in their season, and so are all mens workes too: <hi>A word spoke in season,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 25.11. Prov. 15.23.</note> 
               <hi>is like Apples of Gold in pictures of Silver; and a good word in season, O how comfortable it is.</hi> Thirdly,</p>
            <p>But know, <hi>that these Opportunities are wondrous hard to find out</hi>; very difficult it is for men to know the true sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> or opportunitie of a businesse: men may know times and seasons wel enough in particular businesses, the seasons for tilling the ground, and breeding and breaking of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, &amp;c. In such low and triviall things in comparison, seasons may easily bee knowne, but in the great morall affaires, that concerne God and mens soules, the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thing that lies before man, is, to finde out the true season when they are to bee done; this <hi>Solomon</hi> sets downe most excellently in the eighth of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 8.6. opened.</note> Verse 6. <hi>Because to every purpose there is required time and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him</hi>; marke that expression, most men are miserable, because a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse cannot bee done, without a fit season and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to know it: as if <hi>Solomon</hi> had said thus, The truth is, opportunities are so <hi>rare,</hi> oft-times so sudden, so violent, so short, the wind seldome blowing long in an opportune point, and men so ignorant, so blinded with prejudice, with vaine hopes or feares, that most men are miserable in that they cannot find out the true season of a businesse,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96242:13"/>
and thereby intimates that in every businesse the most difficult part of the worke is the right timing of it. I adde fourthly,</p>
            <p>That <hi>when opportunities are past, if they bee let slip, they are oftentimes altogether irrecoverable</hi>; and the businesse is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly lost, or never better then halfe done; it may cost more to patch up a businesse out of season, then requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have done it beautifully if the season had been taken; As the story goes of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> bookes, they were faine to give the full price for one, which would have bought all three, when two of them were burnt. <hi>Post est occasio calva.</hi> Unlesse God make another opportunitie, man can never call opportunitie back againe. Opportunities are Gods fitting of time to businesse,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.17.</note> &amp; none but God can thus fit it; therefore you shall find <hi>Esau</hi> would have repented and got the blessing,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> he wept and cryed for it, yet missed it, he might have had it once without weeping and crying, but he lost the season, and the season being gone, hee could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it with all his weeping: So the foolish Virgins came with their Lampes, pretending to have got some oyle, and cryed, <hi>Lord open to us,</hi> but the season was past, and there was no entrance; the truth is, seasons are to businesses as money is to wares, hee that would buy a commoditie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a market day, when possibly the commoditie is very cheape, may then have it for laying out his money, lose but that market, possibly ten market dayes will not helpe him againe with it, and either never buy it or give a greater rate for that which is not so good as the other would have been; if opportunities bee once past over, without the Lord create them againe, men are utterly lost in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> businesses. Fiftly, and lastly,</p>
            <p>As these opportunities are excellent, and hard to find, and irrecoverable if they bee lost: So in the last place, know, <hi>that no wisedome, no learning, nothing but a gratious heart guided by the Spirit of God, doth know how to take op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96242:13"/>
in time,</hi> for the great businesses that concerne God and his glory, no wisedome but the wisedome of grace, and Gods Spirit guiding the heart, doth ever know to doe businesses in their right seasons. In other things (as I said before) they may bee taken, naturall men may plow and sow in season, &amp;c. Yea, men may sensibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the times, so as to mourne for the afflictions of them, so as to rejoyce in the good of them; and wicked men by a devillish wisedome can take the seeming oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, to promote their owne wicked designes; the harlot can take the opportunitie of her husbands absence, the thiefe the opportunitie of the twilight, and so every man the seeming opportunitie of things that are of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, for Satan helpes them; but to know the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the things that concerne God and our soules, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a gratious heart enables a man to doe it: the Scripture is very plaine for this, <hi>Solomon</hi> expresses it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably in the tenth of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> Vers. 2. <hi>A wise mans heart is at his right hand, but a fooles heart is at his left</hi>;<note place="margin">Eccles. 10.2. opened.</note> the meaning is this, when a businesse is to be done, &amp; the right season for it, the wise man, a gracious man hath his hand ready, and his heart to joyne with his hand, he is alwayes dexterous at it, but a fooles (<hi>i. e.</hi> a wicked mans) heart, when his businesse is to bee done, his heart is at his left hand, every finger is a Thumbe, hee cannot manage it: but more clearely <hi>Solomon</hi> expresseth this,<note place="margin">Prov. 17.16. opened.</note> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. Vers. 16. <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a foole to buy wisedome, seeing he hath no heart to it?</hi> Let a wicked man have opportunities, give him wealth, give him honour, give him meanes of grace, give him any thing that may helpe to wisedome, hee hath no heart to it: So also saith <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 12.10. speaking of understanding the times,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.10.</note> 
               <hi>none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall, the godly shall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96242:14"/>Thus I have done with the Doctrinall part of it, and by this time I hope you all grant, that it is a matter of wonderfull concernement, of admirable wisedome and commendation, to have understanding of the times and seasons, so as rightly to discharge their owne duties: I now come to the Application of it,<note place="margin">Application in two Uses.</note> wherein I shall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly insist upon two Uses, the one is,</p>
            <p>For <hi>Humiliation,</hi> in reference to time past, to seasons and opportunities which are past and lost. The other shall be,</p>

(beloved) not onely our Country Villages, but our market townes, and our Cities, and I pray God it prove not that our Parliament and Assemblies are all filled with fooles in this great point, few or none of us know the times in reference to our duties. Let mee speake free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to you, God hath cast the lot of all of us in such times as have been filled with such administrations, as the like could not have been in the space of these 1000 yeers; and confident I am, that hee that loses these times wherein we have lived, would never have redeemed any time; and yet notwithstanding, have not wee, O have not wee all usually put off to the future, the duties that belong to the present time, and done in the present time, the things that should never have been done at all? Have not most of us lived all our dayes, as if God had made us for the World, as <hi>Leviathan</hi> for the Sea, onely to take our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in it? others of us to fill our shops with commodities, our purses with money, our houses with stuffe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, as if there had been no better things to have been regarded? when in the meane time for the admirable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities wee have had for the glorifying of God, and the saving of our soules, as if these had been nothing worth; woe unto us, wee have done any thing rather then make improvement of them: and as rich people will give any poore people leave to goe into their Pease-fields to gather lapfulls of their Pease, as being things of little worth, so have wee allowed any thing to take up our time, sporting, and eating, and prating, and sleeping, and such things that are of little concernment. O how much of our pretious time have they devoured and wee regard it not? what cause have we to tremble at the thought of it?

            <p>First, be pleased to view the times you lived while you were private Gentlemen, before you were called to these publique services, when you lived in your severall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; where I know by reason of your wealth, and parts, and interests, and states, you had abundance of opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96242:15"/>
more then other people had, to have done much service, to have made the times and places better for you. Did you then thus know the times? did you then walke as wise men, redeeming the times? did you know what God expected from you in your places, and have you done it? O blessed yee, if you have: But (I beseech you) will it not rather appeare upon a true search, that many of you in those dayes walked in the wayes of riot, in unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in drunkennesse, possibly in swearing, in propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gods holy time, in opposing and scorning Religion, was it not thus? it behoves you to search; did you not make your owne Families, the Townes and Lordships where you lived the worse for you, as so many <hi>Jeroboams</hi> causing <hi>Israel</hi> to sinne? did not you thereby helpe to pull downe those judgements that have beene like to devoure and destroy this whole Land? and if so, have you beene humbled under these things? have you since repented of them? or do they still stand upon your score before that God that keeps an exact accompt of all the Talents that ever hee hath put into your hands? I beseech you enquire into it; but let me goe further, and enquire whether since the time that God hath separated you from your brethren, and by a notable providence called you out to be the heads of all our Tribes, have you since that time knowne the times in reference to your duties? It is now above six yeers since many of you have beene called to this worke, one of the greatest workes that mortall men have beene imployed in these many hundreds of yeers, a work wherein you have beene assisted not onely with the prayers and teares of those that feare God, throughout the Christian world, but with the states and blood of many, and God himselfe hath carried you in his bosome, and made you the most remarkable handfull of men, that I thinke this day breath upon the earth, in regard of the mercies that hee

hath shewed you, and in this time (certaine I am) hath put into your hands as many golden opportunities, not onely required as many duties, but put as many golden opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities into your hands to establish our wretched king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to rescue a decayed, lukewarme, Apostatized Church, as ever were put into the hands of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now (beloved) have you known your times, and taken your opportunities? I know it well, that you have wrestled with huge difficulties, infinite oppositions, and I know that oft-times the perversnesse of a Patient poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his owne disease or wounds may frustrate the care of the best Physitians; and God forbid, that that which is onely your misery, should ever bee imputed to you as your sinne; but suppose upon a diligent search, any of you that are called to bee our wise men, to know the times for us, that at your doore it should lie in great part, that our miseries are not yet healed, how sad would that bee? To this end I most humbly pray you inquire, if upon a diligent search there should bee found among you any who at this day live in the same sinfull, riotous, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wicked conversation that they led, before God called them to this publique service: that after your solemne oath, with your hand lifted up to the most high God for the reformation of your wayes, that you should bee found still with <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozbi,</hi> to live in those sinnes for which God is judging this Nation; <hi>Were this to know the times, and what Israel hath to doe?</hi> Suppose further, there should bee found amongst you any such as should ordinarily neglect the publique service, and turne your backs upon it, to attend your own private affaires, after that the Kingdome hath put into your hands whatsoever under God is pretious and deare unto them; <hi>were this to know the times and what Israel hath to doe?</hi> Suppose there should bee found amongst you any that should seeke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

               <hi>Concerning the times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, it is superfluous for mee to write to you, for you your selves know perfectly.</hi> To this end I beseech you take briefly these foure Meditations to provoke you to study this wisedome in time to come.<note place="margin">Motives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</note> First,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96242:17"/>Often consider how much time, &amp; how many golden op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thou hast lost already; how oft there hath been in thy hands a price to purchase Wisdome, and thou hast lost it for want of a heart; and then thinke whether it bee not more then needfull that thou shouldest lose no more. Secondly,</p>
            <p>Consider how much doth depend upon that moment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of time that yet is behinde; It is an old saying, <hi>Our life is but a moment</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>Ex hoc momento pendet aeternitas,</hi> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity dependeth upon this moment; no lesse then the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the saving of thy immortall soule, and it may bee of thy family, it may bee of the Church and Kingdome, dependeth upon thy knowing the times. Thirdly,</p>
            <p>Consider thou canst not tell, whether ever thou shalt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> enjoy after this day one opportunity more; the Angel may quickly come and sweare concerning thee and mee, <hi>Time shal be no more.</hi> And then Fourthly,</p>
            <p>Consider when Time ceases to bee any more, thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> must give an accompt for all the time that hath been; that certainly at the barre and Tribunall of God, all the Times and seasons that God hath trusted thee with, stand upon thy score, and will bee exacted of thee: <hi>Rejoyce O young man</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon</hi> in the 11 of <hi>Ecclesiastes) in thy youth, and let thy heart cheare thee in the dayes of thy youth, and walke in the wayes of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes</hi>; take thy pleasures, waste thy seasons, <hi>but know that for all these things thou must come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Such Meditations as these would provoke your hearts to bee very carefull to lose no more time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enquire what you should doe for time to come, and how you might learne this Wisdome: And truly, it would fill a Volume, to tell <hi>what</hi> every one should doe, <hi>from what</hi> wee should redeeme our time, and <hi>to what</hi> wee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96242:18"/>
should redeeme it, and <hi>by what</hi> meanes wee should doe it. I dare not enter upon that discourse:<note place="margin">2 In particular to the Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Members of this House.</note> But there is one thing wherein I desire freedome, that I might be as help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as I can to the Honourable Senate that hath called me to the service of this day: Honourable and Beloved, God hath cast your lot so, that if you be rightly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in this one Lesson, you may make our times differ as much from former times,<note place="margin">Daniel 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> as <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Golden head did from the feet of iron and clay; Golden times indeed might bee brought about, if God vouchsafed but to teach you this one Lesson. Your duties are many, for whatsoever lies upon any other, lies eminently upon you; You are to doe all those things in every time, that others are to doe; and you are to doe many things that others cannot doe, and may not doe: That you may therefore know your duty, give mee leave to represent before you the true face of our Times wherein wee live,<note place="margin">The face of our present times represented.</note> and shew what in these Times you have to doe, and herein I will not presume to put any Prudentialls upon you, (we ought all to thinke that Prudentialls are better understood by you, then by us) but what shall I say, shall (God willing) appeare to be matter of Conscience, matters of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and things that may not bee left to liberty; Know then our present times.</p>

I meane, our times are so full of various admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, such a concurrence of all kinde of Providences and Administrations, as seldome were ever knowne in so few yeares; Wee have been sometimes full of hopes of recovery, sometimes at the brinke of despaire, sometimes dawnings of light, by and by all clouded over againe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96242:18"/>
with utter darknesse; sometimes we see a people draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh to God that hides his face from them, by and by God drawing nigh to a people that run away from him; such alterations, such vicissitudes of all kindes of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, that truly I may compare our times to the wind mentioned in the first of <hi>Ecclesiastes, It whirles about conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, now in the North, and then in the South,</hi>

               <hi>and never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in one Point:</hi> So hath it been with us for these foure or five last yeares: this day of ours hath been like that day in the 14 of <hi>Zachariah, neither night nor day, nor light nor darknesse,</hi> but a strange kinde of mixture of all these,<note place="margin">Zach. 14.6, 7.</note> and in such various and uncertaine Times as these are, what <hi>have the heads of our Tribes to doe?</hi> I answer plainly, all others with you, and you with others,<note place="margin">Psalm 107.43.</note> are in such dayes to stand and behold the Workes of God, viewing and admiring, and adoring these Mosaick works, these Checquer workes of God, but it concernes you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, to stand constantly upon your watch, and employ all your Parts and Wisdome, and Faithfulnesse, lest a change of time take you upon a sudden. As when a Ship is at Sea, if it saile to the Westward, and once get beyond the <hi>Canaries,</hi> where the Sea sets constantly one way, and state-winds blowing for so many Moneths to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one Point, a moderate skill and care of him that guides the Helme, wil carry them on with ease; but in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious winds, and tumultuous Seas, when they saile some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times among Rocks, and sometimes among Quicksands, sometimes in Gulfes, sometimes in the Ocean, sometimes almost at the Shoare, if the Pilot be not extreame skilfull and carefull, himselfe, his Barque, and all that are with him are quickly cast away: So I am assured is it now with us in these various administrations; you that are our Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, that sit at the Sterne, must shew more then ordinary skill and diligence, or we may quickly perish.

               <note place="margin">2 More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly our times are opened in 7 Particulars.</note>More particularly, there are seven severall Scenes of the Time (if I may so call them) or sorts of things, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day are acted upon our Stage, and in every one of them I shal shew you, what you that are the Heads of our Tribes have to doe. First,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Our times are times of prodigious wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes in mens conversations.</note>Our times are times of most prodigious wickednesse, horrible abominations in mens manners; I am confident, never such abominable drunkennesse, and generall loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in that kinde; never more universall liberty of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Incestuous mariages, oppressions, cruelty, injustice, malice, revenge, and every thing that might fill a Land with ungodlinesse. Since wee or our fore-Fathers were borne, never was there a greater deluge of wickednesse, then in these our times;<note place="margin">Ezekiel 9.</note> and <hi>what have the Heads of Israel to doe at such a time?</hi> Certainely you, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at such times are called to mourne for all the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Times;<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.15.</note> and you, and all others are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to walke more exactly, in that time, to redeeme the time when the dayes are evill: But <hi>You</hi> above all others are called out by God, in such times, to be his instruments, to oppose these things,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.4</note> the <hi>Ministers of God, to execute vengeance upon those that do evill</hi>: For these things, I think you shall not need to trouble your selves to make new Lawes, as excellent Lawes are already made against them all, as I thinke any Common-wealth in the world hath, but it concernes you to see that these bee put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; It concernes you in times of oppression to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the poore and the oppressed, out of the Talons and Pawes of them, who teare them and crush them in pieces; It concerns you to see that the Justices and other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Countrey, set not up these houses of Sinne, Alehouses and Tavernes, nor that when some well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted put them downe, Great men set them up againe; and so in other abominations it concernes you to see that ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96242:19"/>
Mariages and such ungodlinesses, go not unbranded and unpunished; the Lord kindle zeale in your hearts, that you may doe it: that is one, <hi>Our Times are times of abominable wickednesse.</hi> Secondly,</p>
            <p>Our times are times of Errors, horrible Errors, I meane not such Errors as are to bee found among Gods people,<note place="margin">2. Our times are times of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, heresies, and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> to whom hee never hath given an equall light, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which Errors himself beares with them, and would have his people bear one with another; but I meane our times are times of such Errors as are heretical and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, such as concern our Christian faith, and holy conversation, in a very high degree; it would weary you, but to tell you, the things that are generally knowne to spread as a Gangrene, a new generation of men are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen up, and spread all the points of Arminianisme, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Redemption, Apostasie from grace, Mans free-will; multitudes of others cry downe the Law, as not having any thing to do with Gods people; others denying that the Saints of God should ever any more confesse sinne to God in prayer; others questioning whether there bee any Church or Ministery this day upon the face of the earth, and whether there shall bee any till new Apostles arise: Nay, beyond all these, many denying the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that bought us with his blood, to bee God; or the Holy Ghost to bee God; others denying the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Trinity; and consequently affirming that we, and all the Christian world with us, doe worship Idols in stead of God, for if these men bee right, they are Idols whom wee worship. These, and abundance of such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid things as these are, doe spread and scatter like wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire every where in all corners of the Land, to the great provocation of Gods wrath, &amp; our reproach through the Christian world. And <hi>what have our Heads to doe at such a time</hi>? Certainly you, and al others ought to mourn for these
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96242:20"/>
things, and teare your clothes, and your haires, and your hearts, that God should be so dishonored, but for your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who are in high Places, for what is peculiar to you, I'll not dispute any controversie at this time, but set down Two things which I know you must yeeld to. One is,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Certainly you must search diligently into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and enquire whether Jesus Christ would have you oppose your selves against these things that are so opposite to him; If upon a diligent search, you finde that hee hath not authorized you, doe not you arrogate any authority that Christ hath not given you; my Lie will never honour God, though I should tell it for Gods glory, and your thrusting your selves into an office, Christ hath not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you unto, will never be accepted by him. But if Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Upon a diligent search, it appeares hee hath given au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority unto you, then I am as assur'd that hee hath not left it to your arbitrement, whether you'll use it, or no; hee hath not left it to your will, whether you will punish them, but if you have power to stop them, and doe not, hee will lay them all at your doores, and require them at your hands; therefore search diligently what you have power to doe, and then let not these things goe on, to Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. But supposing you have authority. <hi>What then is to be done?</hi> I answer, you must not take Blasphemies, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and Heresies to bee such upon the reports of other men, but as the Lord ordered them in the 13 of <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 13. Deut. 17.</note> so likewise must you doe, <hi>Search diligently whether indeed such and such things are done</hi>; and when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to bee done, out of the zeale of God, doe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them which the Lord would have you doe; let not your Religion be thus contaminated, suffer not your children, to whom you ought to bee nursing Fathers, to bee thus poisoned by such corrupt Doctrines, nor devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96242:20"/>
by such wolves: This I know you will all subscribe unto; This I desire above all may sticke with you, that if the Lord hath given you power, hee hath not given you libertie to forbeare such men; God in mercy make you zealous for him, that hath been zealous for you in all your troubles. Thirdly,</p>
            <p>Our times are times of wrath, a great deale of wrath from the Lord is gone forth;<note place="margin">3. Our times are times of wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> you know what dreadfull Vialls of wrath, have been poured out in blood; terrible quivers of destroying arrowes have been shot out in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence, all which tell you God is angry: And what then have our Heads and Leaders to doe? certainly all people should tremble when God is angry; <hi>The Lyon roares,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 18.</note> 
               <hi>what beast doth not tremble?</hi> and every one must labour to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him when hee is angry; but you whom the Lord hath placed under him in such high place and authority, must with <hi>Moses</hi> at such a time, call to <hi>Aaron</hi> to run with his Censer,<note place="margin">2 S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m. 21.1.</note> you must labour to enquire out the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of it, and execute the judgement and vengeance that God would have executed upon them who have procured it; You must with <hi>Josiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 22.13. Ionah 3.</note> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.13. inquire what will appease him, and with the King of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> call upon every one to turne from the evill of his doings, and your selves bee examples to the rest. Fourthly,</p>
            <p>Our times are times of Warre, terrible warres, unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall warres, bloody warres, as ever <hi>England</hi> knew,<note place="margin">4. Our times are times of warre.</note> and as yet the Armies are in the Field, and though there bee no open Enemy, the Sword is not put up; and in <hi>Ireland,</hi> poor wretched <hi>Ireland,</hi> the warre is more terrible, where if we labour not to end it by sending our brethren timely suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, the bloody enemy is like to come to make a new war upon us ere it be long; And in the times of warre, <hi>What have the heads of our Tribes to do</hi>? Certainly all people in a time of warre, should make it a time of mourning; <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:96242:21"/>
saith,<note place="margin">Ezek. 21.10.</note> 
               <hi>The Sword is furbished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and drawne, and made bright for slaughter, should wee then make mirth</hi>? Should this bee a time of jollitie? and all should labour to finde out the Causes of the warre, what the Sword-procuring sins are, and every one to repent and turne from them. But you that are our Heads, are to look to these 2 Things principally. First,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That while the warre doth last, and must last, that our Campes and Armies may bee in such a condition, that God may not abhorre our Armies; <hi>When the Host goes forth to the battail,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 23.9.</note> 
               <hi>keepe thee from every evill thing.</hi> And Secondly,</p>
            <p>In the times of Warre, you should alwayes labour after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> an honourable, safe, and just Peace; peace is the end of warre; <hi>Pax una triumphis,</hi> One peace is worth 100 Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and therefore you must principally addresse your selves to God, who alone can give us Peace: Kings and States may begin a warre, but God onely must end it; we may daube up a peace, and get counterfeits of peace, but all will bee <hi>arena sine calce,</hi> Sand without lime, a mortar which will not hold, but as a swelling in a high wall, whose breach comes suddenly: Therefore remember againe and againe, your work lies with the God of Peace, pacifie him, and hee will create peace for you. Fifthly,</p>
            <p>Our Times are times of Divisions; such Divisions, as (I thinke) were hardly ever knowne in the Christian World;<note place="margin">5. Our times are times of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> Divisions every where, divisions in Parliament, divisions in the Assembly, divisions in the Citie, divisions in State affaires; but woe and alasse, most of all, and worst of all, divisions among Gods people, the Servants of God who heretofore prayed together, fasted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could have been banished together, now, as if the curse of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> were fallen upon them, they are divided in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and scattered in <hi>Israel; Manasseh</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96242:21"/>
               <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> against <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and every one eates the flesh of his owne arme, and through the wrath of the Lord, the Land is darkened and infatuated, by the miserable divisions of Gods owne people; and these divisions are fomented, encouraged, and back'd by a Third il-affected party, who desires that these Two, like wilde beasts, may teare one another, and weaken one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may devoure them both; and all this goes on thorough our sinne: And truly wee are in my poore thoughts, as if God had left us to bee as <hi>Moab,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.</note> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> where two stood up against one to destroy it, and then the other two to destroy one another; as the foolish Woman, wee are pulling downe our house with our owne hands. And now (Honorable and Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) in such sad &amp; uncomfortable times as these are, <hi>what have the Heads of our Israel to doe</hi>? what doth the Lord looke for at your hands? Certainly you with others, and you above all others, should labour to bee our Physitians, our <hi>Aesculapiusses,</hi> to joine our dissever'd limbes, and if it bee possible, to make us one againe: Noble Senators, is there no way that your Wisdome can contrive to make Pacification, Accommodation, and Reconciliation, but must wee goe on thus to ruine one another? Any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary head may serve to embroyle things, but here would bee the Master-piece of your Wisdome, if you could find out a way how the envie of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and the ill will of <hi>Manasseh</hi> might cease, and that Gods people might yet bee reconciled and united, of one minde as farre as is possible, and made of one heart in those lower things, wherein they cannot bee of one minde: Would God put this in your hearts, that you might speedily and earnestly set about it, that if there should be found any <hi>Animosities</hi> amongst your selves, you would lay them down first, &amp; all agree to study the Publike good, and then see what you

can doe to reconcile others in the Ministery, in the City, in the Countrey; o that you could doe as <hi>Constantine</hi> did, who burnt all the Libells that were presented to him from one Bishop against another, and never left till hee had made peace among them. O that God would both ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you, and provoke you to set speedily upon this worke, God, and his people have their eyes upon you, and expect you should imploy all your Wisdome, Piety, Parts, and Authority to extinguish those flames which threaten spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ruine to us all.</p>

               <note place="margin">6. Our times are times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note>Our times are times of Reformation; As they are times of sinne and errour, and wrath, and warre, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, which all five are very sad, so the other two are excellent, our times are times of Reformation; I mean, they are times not onely of much Gospell light, but they are times of growing, and increasing light, wherein the light of the Gospell spreads more, and the Lord as in other parts of the world, so especially amongst us, seemes to bee laying out the platforme of his Temple, and to set out a new edition of his Church, fairer and more beautifull then ever; and <hi>what have the Heads of our Tribes to doe</hi> at such a time? without all question, very much of it will lie upon your hands under God, you have contended stifly and couragiously for our liberties, and properties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to recover us from bondage and slavery, and God hath been with you in it; and although the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth not yet feele it, and so it may bee doth not greatly thank you, because in desperate diseases, the cure is commonly more costly and more tedious then the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease is, but I doubt when God vouchsafes a settling they will finde the fruit of what you have done for them, and blesse God for you that are their healers. But know (I beseech you) that our Religion is our most Orient Pearle, and that whereupon our heart
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96242:22"/>
is most set<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if there should bee any miscariage in it all will perish with it, wee should call every thing else <hi>Ichabod,</hi> if Religion miscarry, all is gone; and therefore to provoke you to helpe us in this thing, let mee leave these two Conclusions in your bosomes. First,</p>
            <p>A Reformation begun, and not carried on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alwayes brings more wrath from God; you have begun the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, you are engaged in it by oath and Covenant, and some happy proceeding and progresse you have made in it, God grant you slack not in it: For you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l finde in the Scriptures, a reformation begun and laid aside is a peoples undoing; In <hi>Elijahs</hi> dayes there was a Reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, it fell downe and the Kingdome perished with it. In <hi>Josiah's</hi> time a Reformation was begun, and quickly laid aside with the death of that good King, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was ruined presently after it. In <hi>Haggai</hi> his dayes, the Reformation was begun, then laid aside; God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently smote them with Blasting and Mildew, and would have undone them, if they had not taken it up againe: God lookes you should carry this work on. And I adde,</p>
            <p>Without setling Religion, you shall never settle the Common-wealth; Hee that writes a Booke of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and troubled state of the Church, will hardly ever write a Booke of the quiet and setled State of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; Christ is King of Nations and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths as well as King of Saints: Now the glory of Christ is so much concerned in the matter of Religion, that they shall never finde him propitious to them, for their good in humane affaires, who neglect him in that that is dearest to him. But <hi>what have our Heads and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to doe in that?</hi> I feare not to say confidently, that they are mistaken who say, you have nothing to doe with it; All the good Kings that ever I read of in the booke of God, thought not onely they had to doe with it, but it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96242:23"/>
was their first work <hi>a Jove principium,</hi> they all began with it, they ever accounted the Reformation, &amp; preservation, &amp; propogation of Religion to be their Crown: but <hi>what have you to doe?</hi> I answer, you must with <hi>David,</hi> set your whole hearts to the house of your God,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.</note> really and seriously; with <hi>Solomon</hi> set as many on worke as you can possibly, to prepare materialls for Gods house;<note place="margin">1 Kings 5. 2 Chron. 17.7. Nehemiah 8. 2 Chron 31.</note> with <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> send abroad as many faithfull Preachers as you can, to goe about and instruct the people from Towne to Towne, and Citie to Citie, till you can get Ministers to bee setled. With <hi>Nehemiah</hi> labour to build the walls of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> though in a troublesome time, with a Sword in one hand and a Trowell in the other, set up discipline to bee a hedge and fence to the Churches. With <hi>Hezekiah</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to provide honorable maintenance for Gods house and his Ministers, that young men may not bee discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in their studies. For when young Students can see, <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Justinian,</hi> the study of the Law or Physick can give them wealth and honour, and the Ministry nothing but beggery, it will bee a great snare to them, though the worke of the Ministry bee honorable, and hath an abundant reward with God, yet for want of maintenance <hi>the house of God will bee forsaken;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nehemiah 13.11.</note> 
               <hi>Sint Maecenates, non deerunt marones</hi>: Men of parts must have incouragement, and in your provision for them forget not the Schooles of the Prophets, remember the Universities: Indeavour to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the worke, that the beautie and power of Religion may be promoted, and the Lord direct you to it. Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and lastly,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">7. Our times are times of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances.</note>Our times are times of Deliverances, the greatest deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances that I thinke the Lord hath wrought, since hee brought <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi>; such deliverances as we our selves are like men in a dreame, such deliverances that there hath beene but few footsteps of ordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96242:23"/>
in them; deliverances that have beene the fruit of Prayer, the fruit of Covenanting, the fruit of Fasting, and in all these the fruit of free grace, wherein the Lord hath exceeded not onely our Faith, but our Prayers, and hath measured out to us all that hee hath done by the shekel of the Sanctuary, his own shekel that is double of ours; I know, you forget not the wonderfull things the Lord hath done, <hi>and what have our Heads to doe at such a Time</hi>? Truly, all others with you, but you more then all, at such a time must bee carefull of these foure things;</p>
            <p>First, God expects when hee workes deliverances, that his people should consider his workes, and stand amazed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> at it; <hi>When the Lord turned the captivitie of Zion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 126.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>wee were like men in a dreame, our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with joy</hi>; The Lord (say they) hath done great things for us; Thus let us admire his works.</p>
            <p>In times of deliverance, you must bee very carefull to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> pay your vowes;<note place="margin">Psal 50.14. Psal. 66.13, 14 Eccles. 5.4.</note> the vowes that you made in the time of your low condition; the vowes you made, when your Selves, and Liberties, and Religion, and the Kingdom were all like to bee buried quicke together; God expects in times of deliverance to have those vowes remembred and paid; consider what they were. Thirdly,</p>
            <p>When the Lord workes such deliverances, hee expects, and it will very well become the Heads of our Tribes, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> keepe the same lowly and humble spirit, that they had while God kept them under afflictions; to have their eares as much opened to good counsell, when God hath exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, as when hee abased them; this is a hard lesson to learne: I finde the best of all Gods servants have much failed in this particular. Good <hi>David</hi> himselfe in the day of his prosperity kept not alwayes that humble spirit which hee had in his low estate, nor <hi>Asa,</hi> nor <hi>Uzziah,</hi> nor <hi>Hezekiah</hi>; and wee know the story of that famous Queen,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96242:24"/>
whose motto in the time of her afflictions was <hi>Tanquam ovis,</hi> as a sheepe for the slaughter, yet afterwards it was thought needfull to intreate that it might not bee <hi>tanquam indomita juvenca,</hi> as an untamed Heifer. Men are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prone to bee lifted up, when God enlarges them, but God infinitely detesteth it, and will not put it up at the hands of any. Therefore I most humbly beseech you, (Right Honorable, and Honorable and beloved) let <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> his sonne, and <hi>Uzziah,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> bee warnings to you, and doe you labour to maintaine the same lowly spirit, that you had when you could keepe dayes of mourning for the sinnes of the Kingdome, for your personall sinnes and Parliament sinnes, such a spirit would infinitely please God. And lastly,</p>
            <p>In the time of deliverance, God expects of those that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> are the Heads and Rulers of a people, that every delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance should by them bee improved to the utmost, for the end for which it is given; every Rod hath a voyce and calls for some dutie, and every mercy and deliverance hath a voyce and calls for a dutie, every victory your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have got, and every towne hath beene surrendred, every plot that hath been discovered hath some dutie written upon it, which God expects you should learne: All these things without question lie upon you, and God doth and will expect them at your hands, and what heart would not tremble to thinke how much lies upon you? my soule is deepely affected with your taske, more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane strength must carry you on, or you will bee <hi>impares oneri,</hi> never able to goe through your work. VVhat grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man who understands this, would ever pray to God in his Chamber without remembring you, and your work? and for you your selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O what need is there that you should call in the Payers and supplications of all Gods people to helpe you; and that every one of you,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96242:24"/>
lay aside any businesse of your owne, all self-interest, and count it to be but catching of Flyes, in comparison of the worke you are called to; and that you lay aside all carnall confidence of any power or wisdome of your owne, or relying on any Arme of flesh, that is never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to carry you thorough all your worke: But in stead hereof, to relie wholly upon the wisdome, promise, and power of God, submit your selves to him, and trust to him alone, who onely is able to carry you thorough all. Thus of the second part of my Text, the excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of this Tribe of <hi>Issachar, They had understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to know the times, and what Israel had to doe.</hi> Spare mee libertie for a few words of the Third, and I have done; which is,</p>
            <p>The interest that they had in their Brethrens hearts,<note place="margin">Third part of the Text, The interest these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>all their Brethren were at their command,</hi> or at their <hi>mouth, hung upon their mouth</hi>: certainly it is not meant of any compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but a power they had got in their brethrens hearts by their Wisdome and faithfull carriage; they saw that they were wise and faithfull men, and that set them up high in their esteem, and by this inward respect, the lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of their hands, was as good as the displaying of a Banner, to make all their brethren come out and spend their lives, and whatsoever they had in their Countreys service; which affords us this Lesson,</p>
            <p>That <hi>when the Heads and Leaders of a people are wise,</hi>
