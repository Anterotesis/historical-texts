            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, Our Grand-Father of Glorious Memory, deſiring to prevent, that the Peace which he had procured for his Subjects, after the great Loſſes they had ſuſtained, by the long Continuance of Civil and Foreign Wars, might not be diſturbed by occaſion of the <hi>Pretended Reformed Religion,</hi> as it had been during the Reign of the Kings, his Predeceſſors; had, by his Edict given at <hi>Nantes,</hi> in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1598. regulated the Conduct which was to be obſerved, with Reſpect to thoſe of the ſaid Religion, the Places where they might publickly exerciſe the ſame, appointed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Judges, to adminiſter Juſtice to them: And laſtly, alſo, by ſeveral diſtinct Articles, provided for every thing, which he judged needful for the maintenance of Peace and Tranquility in his Kingdom, and to diminiſh the Averſion which was between thoſe of the One and Other Religion: and this, to the end that he might be in a better condition for the taking ſome effectual Courſe (which he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do) to re-unite thoſe again to the Church, who upon ſo ſlight Occaſions had with-drawn themſelves from it. And foraſmuch as this Intention of the King, our ſaid Grand-Father, could not be effected, by reaſon of his ſuddain and precipitated Death; and that the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the fore-ſaid Edict was Interrupted during the Minority of the late King, Our moſt Honoured Lord and Father, of Glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, by reaſon of ſome new Enterprizes of thoſe of the <hi>Pretended Reformed Religion,</hi> whereby they gave occaſion for their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſeveral Advantages, which had been granted to them, by the afore-ſaid Edict: notwithſtanding, the King, Our ſaid late Lord and Father, according to his wonted Clemency, granted them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Edict at <hi>Niſmes,</hi> in the Month of <hi>July,</hi> 1629. by means of which the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom being now again Re eſtabliſhed, the ſaid late King, being animated with the ſame Spirit and Zeal for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101095:3"/>
Religion, as the King Our ſaid Grand-Father was, reſolved to make good Uſe of this Tranquility, by endeavouring to put this Pious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in Execution; but Wars abroad, coming on a few Years after, ſo that from the Year 1635. to the Truce which was concluded with the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> in 1684. the Kingdom having been only for ſome ſhort Intervals, altogether free from Troubles, it was not poſſible to do any other thing for the Advantage of Religion, ſave only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the number of Places permitted for the Exerciſe of the <hi>Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Reformed Religion,</hi> as well by the Interdiction of thoſe which were found Erected, in prejudice to the Diſpoſal made in the ſaid Edict, as by ſuppreſſing the Mixt Chambers of Judicature, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of an equal number of <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> the Erecting of which was only done by Proviſion, and to ſerve the preſent Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
            <p>Whereas therefore, at length, it hath pleaſed <hi>God</hi> to grant, that Our Subjects enjoying a perfect Peace, and We Our ſelves being no longer taken up with the Cares of Protecting them againſt Our Enemies, are now in a Condition to make good Uſe of the ſaid Truce, which we have on purpoſe facilitated, in order to the applying our ſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irely to the ſearching out of Means, which might ſucceſsfully effect and accompliſh the Deſign of the Kings, Our ſaid Grand-Father and Father, and which alſo hath been * Our Intention ever ſince we came<note place="margin">☞</note> to the Crown; We ſee, at preſent, (not without a juſt Acknowledgment of what We owe to <hi>God</hi> on that Account) that Our Endeavours have attained the End We propos'd to Our ſelves, foraſmuch as the greater and better Part of Our Subjects of the ſaid <hi>Pretended Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> have already Embraced the <hi>Catholick;</hi> and ſince, by Means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Execution of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and of all other Ordinances in favour of the ſaid <hi>Pretended Reformed Religion,</hi> is become uſeleſs, We judge that We can do nothing better towards the entire effacing of the Memory of thoſe Troubles, Confuſions, and Miſchief, which the Progreſs of that falſe Religion hath been the cauſe of in Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and which have given Occaſion to the ſaid Edict, and to ſo many other Edicts and Declarations which went before it, or were made ſince with reference thereto, than by a Total Revocation of the ſaid Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and the particular Articles and Conceſſions granted therein, and whatſoever elſe hath been Enacted ſince, in favour of the ſaid <hi>Religion.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>ON <hi>Saturday</hi> the 8 / <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1685. the <hi>Intendant</hi> of the Upper <hi>Guienne,</hi> who Reſides at <hi>Montauban,</hi> having Summoned the Principal <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the ſaid City to come before him, repreſented unto them, That they could not be ignorant, that the Abſolute Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the King was, to Tolerate but One Religion in his Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Roman Catholick Religion;</hi> and therefore, wiſhed them rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to comply with the ſame: And in order thereto, adviſed them to. Aſſemble themſelves, and conſider what Reſolution they would take. To this Propoſal ſome anſwer'd, <hi>That there was no need of their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling themſelves upon that Account; foraſmuch as every one of them in particular, were to Try and Examine themſelves, and be always in a readineſs to give a reaſon of the Faith which was in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Day the <hi>Intendant</hi> again commanded them to Meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Town-Houſe, which, he ordered, ſhould be left free for them from Noon, till Six of the Clock in the Evening: Where meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accordingly, they Unanimouſly reſolved, as they had Lived, ſo to perſiſt till Death in their Religion: Which Reſolution of theirs, there were ſome Deputed by them to declare to the <hi>Intendant;</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting themſelves before him, he who was appointed Spokeſman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Addreſs himſelf to the <hi>Intendant</hi> in theſe Words: <hi>My Lord, We are not unacquainied, how we are menaced with the greatest Violence:—Hold there,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Intendant</hi> (interrupting him) <hi>No Violence.</hi> After this the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> continued; <hi>But whatever Force or Violence may be put upon us,</hi>—Here the <hi>Intendant</hi> interrupting him again, ſaid, <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101095:6"/>
               <hi>forbid you to uſe any ſuch Words:</hi> Upon which Second Interruption, he contented himſelf to aſſure him in few Words, <hi>That they were all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to Live and Dye in their Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Day after, the Battallion of <hi>La Fere,</hi> conſiſting of 16. Companies, entred the City, and were followed by many more. The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> all this while dreaming of no other Deſign they had againſt them, but that of ruining their Eſtates, and Impoveriſhing them, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken ſome Meaſures how to bear the ſaid Tryal; they had made a Common Purſe, for the Relief of ſuch who ſhould be moſt burthen'd with Quartering; and were come to a Reſolution to Poſſeſs what they had, in Common: But, Alas! how far theſe poor Souls were miſtaken in their Accounts, and how different the Treatment they received from the <hi>Dragoons</hi> was, from what they had expected, I ſhall now Relate to you.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, in order to their Executing the Deſign and Project they had formed againſt them, they made the Souldiers take up their Quarters in one certain Place of the City; but withal, appointed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Corp de Guards</hi> to cut off the Communication which One part of the City might have with the Other, and poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Gates, that none might make their Eſcape. Things being thus ordered, the Troopers, Souldiers, and Dragoons began to Practiſe all manner of Hoſtilities, and Cruelties, where-with the Devil can Inſpire the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane and Reprobate Minds: They marr'd and defac'd their Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-ſtuff, broke their Looking-Glaſſes, and other like Utenſils and Ornaments; they let the Wine run about their Cellars, caſt abroad and ſpoyl'd their Corn, and other Alimentary Proviſions: And as for thoſe things which they could not break and daſh to pieces, as the Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Beds, Hangings, Tapiſtry, Linnen, Wearing Apparrel, Plate, and Things of the like Nature; theſe they carried to the Market-place, where the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> bought them of the Souldiers, and encouraged the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to do the like. They did not ſtick to Sell the very Houſes of ſuch, who were moſt Reſolute and Conſtant in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. It is ſuppoſed, according to a Moderate Calculation, that in the time of four or five Days, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of that City were the poorer by a Million of Money, than they were before the entring of theſe Miſſionaries. There were Souldiers, who demanded Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns apiece of their Hoſts for ſpending-Money; and many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were forced to pay down Ten Piſtols to each Souldier; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:101095:7"/>In the mean time, the outrages they committed upon their Perſons were moſt deteſtable and Barbarous; I ſhall only here ſet down ſome few, of which I have been particularly Inform'd. A certain Taylor called <hi>Bearnois,</hi> was bound and drag'd by the Souldiers to the <hi>Corp de Guard,</hi> where they Boxed and Buffetted him all Night, all which blows and Indignities he ſuffered with the greateſt conſtancy Imaginable. The Troopers who Quartered with Monſieur <hi>Solignac</hi> made his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Room a Stable for their Horſes, tho the Furniture of it was Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at 10000 Livres, and forc'd him to turn the Broach till his Arm was near Burnt, by their continual caſting of Wood upon the Fire. A Paſſenger as he went through the ſaid City ſaw ſome Souldiers beating a Poor Man even to Death, for to force him to go to Maſs, whilſt the conſtant Martyr to his laſt Breath, cryed, <hi>He would never do it,</hi> and only requeſted they would <hi>Diſpatch and make an end of him.</hi> The Barons of <hi>Cauſſade</hi> and <hi>De la Motte,</hi> whoſe Conſtancy and Piety might have Inſpired Courage and Reſolution to the reſt of the Citizens, were ſent away to <hi>Cahors.</hi> Monſieur <hi>D'Alliez,</hi> one of the prime Gentlemen of <hi>Montauban,</hi> being a Venerable Old Man, ſound ſo ill Treatment at their hands, as it's thought he will ſcarcely eſcape with Life. Monſieur <hi>De Garriſon,</hi> who was one of the moſt conſiderable Men of that City, and an intimate Friend of the <hi>Intendant,</hi> went and caſt himſelf at his Feet, imploring his Protection, and conjuring him to rid him of his Souldiers, that he might have no force put upon his Conſcience; adding, That in Recompence of the Favour he beg'd of him, <hi>He would willingly give him all he had,</hi> which was to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of about a Million of LIvres; but by all his Entreaties and Proffers, he could not in the leaſt prevail with the <hi>Intendant;</hi> who gave order, that for a Terror to the meaner ſort, he ſhould be worſe uſed than the reſt, by dragging him along the Streets.</p>
            <p>The Method they moſt commonly made uſe of, for to make them Abjure their Religion, and which could not be the Product of any thing but Hell, was this; Some of the moſt ſtrong and vigorous Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, took their Hoſts, or other Perſons of the Houſe, and walk'd them up and down in ſome Chamber, continually tickling them and toſſing them like a Ball from one to another, without giving them the leaſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and keeping them in this condition for three days and nights together, without Meat, Drink, or Sleep: When they were ſo wearied, and fainting, that they could no longer ſtand upon their Legs, they laid them on a Bed, continuing as before to Tickle and Torment them;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101095:7"/>
after ſome time, when they thought them ſomewhat recovered, they made them riſe, and walked them up and down as before, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Tickling, and other times Laſhing them with Rods, to keep them from Sleeping. As ſoon as one Party of theſe Barbarous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters were Tyred and wearled out, they were Relieved by others of their Companions, who coming freſh to the Work, with greater Vigour and Violence reiterated the ſame Courſe. By this Infernal Invention (which they had formerly made uſe of, with ſucceſs, in <hi>Bearn</hi> and other places) many went Diſtracted, and others became Mopiſh and Stupid, and remain ſo.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who made their Eſcape, were fain to abandon their Eſtates, yea, their Wives, Children, and Aged Relations, to the Mercy of theſe Barbarous, and more than Savage Troops. The ſame Cruelties were acted at <hi>Negrepliſſe,</hi> a City near to <hi>Montauban;</hi> where theſe Bloody Emiſſaries committed unparallel'd Outrages. <hi>Iſaac Favin,</hi> a Citizen of that Place, was hung up by his Arm-pits, and tormented a whole Night, by pinching and tearing off his Fleſh with Pincers; tho by all this they were not able to ſhake his Conſtancy, in the leaſt. The Wife of one <hi>Rouffion,</hi> a Joyner, being violently dragg'd by the Souldiers along the Streets, for to force her to hear Maſs, dyed of this cruel and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Treatment, as ſoon as ſhe reach'd the Church Porch.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other their Deviliſh Inventions, this was one: They made a great Fire round about a Boy of about Ten Years of Age; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, with Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, cryed, <hi>My God, help me;</hi> and when they ſaw the Lad reſolved to Dye ſo, rather than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Religion, they ſnatch'd him from the Fire, when he was at the very point of being Burnt. The Cities of <hi>Cauſſade, Realville,</hi> St. <hi>Anthonin,</hi> and other Towns and Places in the Upper, <hi>Guienne,</hi> met with the ſame Entertainment, as well as <hi>Bergerac,</hi> and many other Places of <hi>Perigord,</hi> and of the Lower <hi>Guienne;</hi> which had a like ſhare of theſe cruel and inhumane Uſages.</p>
            <p>The forementioned Troops marched at laſt to <hi>Caſtres,</hi> to commit the ſame Inſolencies and Barbarities there alſo: And it is not to be doubted, but that they will continue, and carry on the ſame courſe of Cruelties, where ever they go; if <hi>God,</hi> in Pity and Compaſſion to his People, do not reſtrain them.</p>
            <p>It is to be feared, (for it ſeems but too probable) that this dreadful Perſecution, in conjunction with thoſe Artifices the <hi>Papiſts</hi> make uſe of to diſguiſe their Religion, and to perſwade <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101095:8"/>
ſhall be ſuffered to Worſhip God as formerly, will make many to comply with them, or at leaſt make their Mouths give their Hearts the Lye, in hopes of being by this means put into a condition to make their eſcapes, and returning to that Profeſſion, which their weakneſs hath made them deny.</p>
            <p>But, Alas! this is not all; for thoſe Poor Wretches, whom by theſe Deviliſh ways of theirs, they have made to Blaſpheme and Abjure their Religion, as if this were not enough, muſt now become the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors and Tormentors of their own Wives and Children, for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige and force them to Renounce alſo; for they are threatned, that if within three days time they do not make their whole Family Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in like manner, thoſe rough Apoſtles (the <hi>Dragoons</hi>) ſhall be fain to take further pains with them, in order to the perfecting of their Converſion. And who after all this can have the leaſt doubt, but that theſe unhappy <hi>Dragoons</hi> are the very Emiſſaries of Hell, whoſe very laſt Efforts and Death ſtruglings theſe ſeem to be?</p>
            <p>This Relation hath given a ſhort view of ſome of thoſe Sufferings, the <hi>Reformed</hi> have undergone, but not of all: It is certain, that in divers places they have tryed to wear out their Patience, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Conſtancy by applying Red hot Irons to the Hands and Feet of Men, and to the Breaſts of Women. At <hi>Nantes</hi> they hung up ſeveral Women and Maids by their Feet, and others by their Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and that Stark-Naked, thus expoſing them to Publick View, which aſſuredly is the moſt cruel and exquiſite Suffering can befall that Sex; becauſe in this caſe their Shamefac'dneſs and Modeſty is moſt ſenſibly touched, which is the moſt tender part of their Soul. They have bound Mothers that gave Suck unto Poſts, and let their little Infants lye Languiſhing in their ſight, without being ſuffered to Suckle them for ſeveral days, and all this while left them crying, moaning, and gaſping for Life, and even Dying for Hunger and Thirſt, that by this means they might Vanquiſh the Conſtancy of their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted Mothers, Swearing to them they would never permit they ſhould give them Suck till they promiſed to Renounce their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpel. They have taken Children of Four or Five Years of Age, and kept them from Meat and Drink for ſome time, and when they have been ready to faint away and give the Ghoſt, they have brought them before their Parents, and horribly Aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that except they would Turn, they muſt prepare themſelves to ſee their Children Languiſh and Dye in their preſence. Some they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101095:8"/>
have bound before a great Fire, and being half Roaſted, have after let them go: They beat Men and Women outragiouſly; they drag them along the Streets, and Torment them day and Night. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way they took, was to give them no<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſt; for the Souldiers do continually Relieve one another for to Drag, Beat, Torment and Toſs up and down theſe Miſerable Wretches, without Intermiſſion. If it happen that any by their Patience and Conſtancy do ſtand it out, and Triumph over all the Rage and Fury of thoſe <hi>Dragoons,</hi> they go to their Commander and acquaint him, they have done all they could, but yet without the deſired ſucceſs; who in a Barbarous and Surly Tone, anſwers them; <hi>You muſt return upon them, and do worſe than you have done; the King Commands it; either they muſt Turn, or I muſt Burſt and Periſh in the Attempt.</hi> Theſe are the Pleaſant Flowry Paths, by which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> allure <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to return to the Boſome of their Church.</p>
            <p>But ſome it may be will object; You make a great noiſe about a ſmall matter, all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have not been expoſed to theſe Cruelties, but only ſome few obſtinate Perſons: Well, I will ſuppoſe ſo, but yet the Horror of thoſe Torments Inflicted on ſome, hath ſo fill'd the Imagination of theſe Miſerable Wretches, that the very thoughts of them hath made them comply; it is indeed a Weakneſs of which we are aſhamed for their ſakes, and from whence we hope God will raiſe them again, in his due time; yet thus much we may alledge for their excuſe, that never was any Perſecution, upon pretence of Religion, carried on to that pitch, and with that Politick Malice and Cruelty that this hath been; and therefore, of all thoſe which ever the Church of Chriſt groan'd under, none can be compar'd with it, True indeed it is, that in former Ages it hath been common to Burn the Faithful under the Name of <hi>Hereticks;</hi> but how few were there expoſed to that cruel kind of Death, in compariſon of thoſe who eſcaped the Executioners hands? But, behold here a great People at once Oppreſs'd, Deſtroy'd, and Ruin'd by a vaſt Army of Prodigious Butchers, and few or none eſcaping. Former, yea late times have given us ſome Inſtances of Maſſacres; but theſe were only violent Tempeſts, and ſuddain Hurricanes, which laſted but a Night, or, at the moſt, a few days, and they who ſuffered in them were ſoon out of their pains, and the far greater number eſcaped the dint of them: but how much more dreadful is the preſent condition of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in <hi>France?</hi> And to the end we may take a true view and right
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101095:9"/>
meaſures of it, let us conſider, that nothing can be conceived more terrible, than a State of War; but what War to be compared with This? They ſee a whole Army of Butcherly Canibals entring their Houſes, Battering, Breaking, Burning, and Deſtroying whatever comes to hand; Swearing, Curſing, and Blaſpheming like Devils; beating to exceſs; offering all manner of Indignities and Violence; diverting themſelves, and ſtriving to out-vie each other in inventing New Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Pain and Torment; not to be appeaſed with Money, or good Chear; foaming and roaring like Ravenous raging Lyons; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Death, at every moment; and that which is worſe than all this, driving People to Diſtraction, and ſenſeleſs Stupidity, by thoſe Deviliſh Inventions we have given you an Inſtance of, in the Relation of <hi>Montauban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, This Perſecution hath one Characteriſtical Note more; which, without any Exaggeration, will give it the Precedence in Hiſtory for Cruelty, above all thoſe which the Church of <hi>God</hi> ever ſuffered under <hi>Nero, Maximinus,</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> which is, The ſevere Prohibition of departing the Kingdom, upon pain of Confiſcation of Goods, of the Gally, of the Laſh, and perpetual Impriſonment. All the Sea-Ports are kept with that Exactneſs, as if it were to hinder the Eſcape of Traytors, and common Enemies: All the Priſons of Sea-Port-Towns are cramm'd with theſe miſerable Fugitives, Men, Women, Boys, and Girls; who there are Condemned to the worſt of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for having had a deſire to ſave themſelves from this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſecution, and deluging Calamity. This is the Thing which is unparallel'd, and of which we find no Inſtance: This is thaat Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Excefs of Cruelty, which we ſhall not find in the Liſt of all the Violent and Bloody Proceedings of the Duke of <hi>Alva:</hi> He Maſſacred, he Beheaded, he Cutchered; but at leaſt, he did not Prohibit thoſe that could, to make their Eſcape. In the laſt <hi>Hungarian</hi> Perſecution, nothing was required of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but only that their Miniſters ſhould Baniſh themſelves, and Abandon and Renounce the Conduct of their Flocks; and becauſe they were unwilling to obey theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, therefore it is they have groan'd under ſo long, and ſo terrible a Perſecution, as they have done. But this <hi>Hungarian</hi> Perſecution is not to be compared with that we are ſpeaking of; for the Fury of that Tempeſt diſcharged it ſelf upon the Miniſters only; no Armies were Imploy'd, to force the People to change their Religion, by a thouſand ſeveral ways of Torment; much leſs did it ever enter the Thoughts

of the Emperour's Councel, to ſhut up all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Hungary;</hi> in order to the deſtroying of all thoſe who would not abjure their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> which yet is the very condition of ſo many wretched Perſons in <hi>France,</hi> who beg it as the higheſt Favour at the Hands of their Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Enemies, to have Leave to go and beg their Bread in a Foreign Country; being willing to leave their Goods, and all other outward Conveniencies, behind them, for to lead a poor, miſerable, languiſhing Life in any Place, where only they may be ſuffered to Dye in their Religion. And is it not from all this moſt apparent, that thoſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who have Inſpired the King with theſe Deſigns, have refin'd the Myſtery of Perſecuting to the utmoſt, and advanc'd it to its higheſt Pitch of Perfection?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Great</hi> God! <hi>who from thy Heavenly Throne do'ſt behold all the Outrages done to thy People, haſte Thee to help us! Great</hi> God, <hi>whoſe Compaſſions are Infinite, ſuffer thy Self to be touched with our extream Deſolation! If Men be Inſenſible of the Calamities we ſuffer, if they be deaf to our Cries, not regarding our Groans and Supplications; yet let thy Bowels, O Lord, be moved, and affect Thee in our behalf. Glorious</hi> God, <hi>for whoſe Names ſake we ſuffer all theſe things, who knoweſt our Innocence and Weakneſs, as well as the Fury and Rage of our Adverſaries, the ſmall Support and Help we find in the World; Behold, we periſh, if thy Pity doth not rouze Thee up for our Relief. It is Thou art our Rock, our</hi> God, <hi>our Father, our Deliverer: We do not place our Confidence in any, but Thee alone: Let us not be confounded, becauſe we put our Truſt in Thee. Haſte Thee to our Help; make no long tarrying, O</hi> Lord, <hi>our</hi> God, <hi>and our Redeemer!</hi>

            <head>A Letter ſent from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> giving an Account of the Perſecution of thoſe of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHat you have heard concerning the Perſecution of thoſe that are of our <hi>Religion,</hi> in the Land of <hi>Bearne, Guienne,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigord,</hi> is but too true: and I can aſſure you; that they who have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you that Account, have been ſo far from amplifying the Matter,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101095:10"/>
that they have only acquainted you with ſome few particulars; yet am I not much ſurprized at the difficulty you find to perſwade your ſelf, that the things of which your Friends Inform you, are true: In caſes of this Nature, ſo amazingly unexpected, we are apt often to diſtruſt our own Eyes; and I profeſs to you, that though all places round about us Echo the Report of our Ruine and Deſtruction, yet I can ſcarcely perſwade my ſelf it is ſo indeed, becauſe I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it. It is no matter of ſurprize, or amazement, to ſee the Church of <hi>Chriſt</hi> afflicted upon Earth, foraſmuch as ſhe is a ſtranger here, at well as her Captain, Lord and Husband, the Holy and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> was; and muſt, like Him, by the ſame way of Croſs and Suffering, return to her own Country, which is above. It is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Aſtoniſhment, to find her from time to time ſuffering the worſt of uſage, and moſt cruel Perſecutions; all Ages have ſeen her expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuch Tryals as theſe, which are ſo neceſſary for the Teſting of her Faith, and ſo fit a matter of her Future Glory. Neither is it any great wonder, if, amidſt theſe ſore Tryals, vaſt numbers of thoſe who made Profeſſion of the Goſpel, do now Renounce and forſake it: We know that all have not Faith; and it is more than probable, that they who do not follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but becauſe they Thrive by it, and for the Loaves, will ceaſe to be of his Retinue, when he is about to oblige them to bear his Croſs, and deny themſelves. But that which ſeems Inconceivable to me, is, that our Enemies ſhould pitch upon ſuch ſtrange ways and methods to deſtroy us, as they have done, and that, in ſo doing they ſhould meet with a ſucceſs ſo prodigious and doleful. I ſhall as briefly as I can endeavour to give you an account of ſo much as I have underſtood of it.</p>
            <p>All thoſe thundring Declarations, and deſtructive Arreſts, which continually were Sued for, and obtain'd againſt us, and which were Executed with the Extremity of Rigour, were ſcarce able to move any one of us. The forbidding of our Publick Exerciſes, the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of our Churches, and the ſevere Injunction that not ſo much as Two or Three of us ſhould dare to Aſſemble, in order to any thing of Divine Worſhip, had no other effect upon the far greater part of us, than to Inflame our Zeal, inſtead of abating it; obliging us to Pray to <hi>God</hi> with greater Fervor and Devotion in our Cloſets, and to Meditate of his Word with greater Application and Attention. And neither the great wants, to which we were reduced by being depriv'd of our Offices and Imploys, and all other means of Living, and by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101095:10"/>
thoſe inſupportable charges with which they ſtrove to over-whelm us, as well by Taxes, as the Quartering of Souldiers (both which were as heavy as could be laid upon us) nor the continual trouble we were put to by Criminal or other matters of Law; which at the Suit of one or other were ſtill laid to our charge, tho upon the moſt frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and unjuſt pretences imaginable; I ſay, all theſe were not able to wear out our Patience, which was hardned againſt all Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: inſomuch as the deſign of forcing us to abandon the Truth of the Goſpel, would Infallibly have been Ship-wrack'd, if no other means had been taken in hand for this purpoſe. But, Alas! our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were too Ingenious, to be bauk'd ſo; and had taken our Ruine too much to Heart, not to ſtudy for means effectual and proper to bring about their deſires: They call'd to mind what Prodigious ſucceſs a new kind of Perſecution had had of late Years in <hi>Poctou, Aunix,</hi> and <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> which the <hi>Intendants</hi> of thoſe places had bethought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of; and they made no difficulty to have Recourſe to the ſame, as to a means Infallible, and not to be doubted of.</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> That we had not the leaſt thought that ever ſuch violent Methods as theſe, would have been pitched upon, as the means of our Converſion: We were always of Opinion, that none but <hi>Dennuieux</hi>'s, and <hi>Marillacs,</hi> could be fit Inſtruments for ſuch like Enterprizes; neither could we ever have Imagin'd, that Generals of Armies, who account it a Shame and Reproach to Attack and take ſome paultry Town or Village, ſhould ever debaſe themſelves to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege Old Men, Women, and Children in their own Houſes; or that ever Souldiers, who think themſelves ennobled by their Swords, ſhould degrade themſelves ſo far, as to take up the Trade of Butchers and Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by tormenting poor Innocents, and inflicting all ſorts of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we were the leſs in expectation of any ſuch thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the ſelf-ſame time they Treated us in this manner, they would needs perſwade us, <hi>That the King's Councel had diſapproved the Deſign:</hi> And indeed, it ſeem'd very probable to us, that all Reaſons, whether taken from Humanity, Piety, or Intereſt, would have made them diſavow and condemn a Project ſo Inhumane and Barbarous: Yet now, by Experience, we find it but too true, that our Enemies are ſo far from rejecting the ſaid Deſign, that they carry it on with an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Zeal and Application, without giving themſelves any further trouble to effectuate their Deſires, than that of doing theſe two things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:101095:11"/>The Firſt of which was, to Lull us aſleep, and to take away from us all matter of Suſpition of the miſchief they were hatching againſt us; which they did by permitting ſome of our Publick Exerciſes of Religion, by giving way to our Building of ſome Churches, by ſettling Miniſters in divers places to Baptize our Children, and by publiſhing ſeveral Arreſts and Declarations, which did intimate to us, that we had reaſon to hope we ſhould yet Subſiſt for ſome Years: Such was that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by which all Miniſters were ordered to change their Churches every three years.</p>
            <p>The Other was, to ſecure all the Sea-Ports of the Kingdom, ſo as none might make their eſcape, which was done by renewing the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Prohibitions of departing the Kingdom without leave, but with the addition of far more ſevere Penalties.</p>
            <p>After theſe precautions thus taken, they thought themſelves no longer oblig'd to keep any meaſures, but immediately lift up the hand, to give the laſt blow for our Ruine. The <hi>Intendants</hi> had order to repreſent to us, <hi>That the King was reſolved to ſuffer no other Religion in his Kingdom beſides his own, and to Command us all in his Name, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to Embrace the ſame, without allowing us any longer reſpite to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what we had to do, than a few days, nay hours;</hi> threatning us, <hi>That if we continued obſtinate, they would force us to it by the extremity of Rigour; and preſently Executing theſe their Menaces, by filling our Houſes with Souldiers, to whom we were to be leſt for a Prey; and who, not content with entirely Ruining of us, ſhould beſides exerciſe upon our Perſons all the Violence and Cruelty they could poſſibly deviſe:</hi> And all this to overcome our Conſtancy and Perſeverance.</p>
            <p>Four Months are now paſt and gone, ſince they began to make uſe of this ſtrange and horrible way of Converting People, worthy of, and well becoming its Inventors. The Country of <hi>Bearne</hi> was firſt ſet upon, as being one of the moſt conſiderable Out-parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to the end that this miſchievous enterprize gaining ſtrength in its paſſage, might ſoon after over-whelm, and as it were deluge all the other Provinces in the ſame Sea of the uttermoſt calamity. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Foucaut</hi> the Intendant, went himſelf in Perſon to all the places where we were in any numbers, and commanded all the Inhabitants that were of the Proteſtant Religion, under the Penalty of great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercements, to Aſſemble themſelves in thoſe places he appointed to them; where being accordingly met together, he charged them in the Kings Name to change their Religion, allowing them only a day
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101095:11"/>
or two to diſpoſe themſelves for it: He told them, <hi>That great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Souldiers were at hand, to compel thoſe that ſhould rfuſe to yield a ready Obedience;</hi> and this threatning of his being immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Effect, as Lightning is by Thunder, he fill'd the Houſes of all thoſe who abode conſtant in their reſolution to Live and Dye Faithful to their Lord and Maſter, <hi>Jeſus Chrſt,</hi> with Souldiers; and Commands thoſe Inſolent Troops (fleſh'd with Blood and Slaughter) to give them the worſt Treatment they could poſſibly deviſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not undertake, <hi>Sir,</hi> to give you a particular Account of thoſe Exceſſes, and Outrages, theſe enraged Brutals comitted in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Orders they were charged with; The Relation would prove too tedious and doleful: It ſhall ſuffice me to tell you, That they did not forget any thing that was Inhumane, Barbarous, or Cruel, without having regard to any Condition Sex or Age; they pull'd down and demoliſhed their Houſes; they ſpoil'd, daſh'd to pieces, and burnt their beſt Moveables and Houſhold ſtuff; they bruiſed and beat to Death Venerable Old Men; they dragg'd Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Matrons to Maſs, without the leaſt pitty or reſpect; they bound and Fetter'd Innocent Perſons, as if they had been the moſt Infamous and Profligate Villains; they hung them up by their Feet, till they ſaw them ready to give up the Ghoſt; they took Red hot Fire-ſhovels, and held them cloſe to their bare Heads, and actually apply'd them to other parts of their Bodies; they Immur'd them within four Walls, where they let them Periſh for Hunger and Thirſt: And the Conſtancy wherewith they ſuffer'd all theſe Torments, having had no other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but that of augmenting the Rage of theſe Furies, they never ceaſed Inventing new ways of Pain and Torture, till their Inhumanity at length had got the Victory, and Triumphed over the Patience and Faith of theſe Miſerable Wretches. Inſomuch, that of all thoſe many numerous Aſſemblies, we had in that Province, as that of <hi>Pau, d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, de Novarre, &amp;c.</hi> there are ſcarcely left a ſmall number, who either continue conſtant in deſpite of all theſe Cruelties, or elſe have made their eſcape into <hi>Spain, Holland, England,</hi> or elſewhere, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Goods and Families for a Prey to theſe Mercileſs and Cruel Men.</p>
            <p>Succeſs having thus far anſwered their Expectation, they reſolved to loſe no time; but vigorouſly Proſecuting their work, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately turned their Thoughts and Arms towards <hi>Montauban;</hi> where the <hi>Intendant</hi> having Summoned the Citizens to appear before him,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101095:12"/>
ſpeaks them much of the ſame Language, as was uſed to thoſe of <hi>Bearne;</hi> whereunto they having returned about the ſame Anſwer, he orders 4000. Men to enter the City, and makes them take up their Quarters, as at <hi>Bearne,</hi> only in the Houſes of <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command to Treat them in like manner, as they had done thoſe of <hi>Bearne:</hi> And theſe Inhumane Wretches were ſo diligent and active in Executing theſe pittileſs Orders, that of 12, or 15000. Souls, of which that Church did conſiſt, not above 20, or 30. Families are eſcaped; who, in a doleful and forlorn Condition, wander up and down the Woods, and hide themſelves in Thickets. The Ruine of this Important Place, drew after it the Deſolation of all the Churches about it: which were all Enveloped in the ſame common Calamity, as thoſe of <hi>Realment, Bourniquel, Negrepliſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet was not the Condition of the Churches in the Upper <hi>Guienne</hi> more ſad and calamitous, than that of thoſe of the Lower <hi>Guienne,</hi> and of <hi>Perigord;</hi> which this horrible Deluge hath likewiſe overwhelm'd. Monſieur <hi>Bouflers,</hi> and the <hi>Intendant,</hi> having ſhared the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; Monſieur <hi>de Bouflers</hi> taking for his Part <hi>Agenois, Tonnein, Clerac,</hi> with the adjoyning Places; and the <hi>Intendant</hi> having taken upon him to reduce <hi>Fleis, Monravel, Genſſac, Cartillon, Coutras, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne,</hi> &amp;c. The Troops which they commanded, in the mean time, carrying Deſolation to all the Places they paſſed through, filling them with Mourning and Deſpair, and ſcattering Terror and Amazement amongſt all thoſe to whom they approached.</p>
            <p>There were at the ſame time 17. Companies at Saint <hi>Foy,</hi> 15. at <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rac,</hi> and as many in proportion in all other Parts: So that, all Places being fill'd with theſe Troops, accuſtom'd to Licentiouſneſs and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, there is not any one of the ſaid Places, where they have not left moſt dreadful Marks of their Rage and Cruelty; having at laſt, by means of their exquiſite Tortures, made all thoſe of our <hi>Religion</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the Communion of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as <hi>Bergerac</hi> was moſt ſignally Famous for the long Tryals it had moſt Gloriouſly endured, and that our Enemies were very ſenſible of what Advantage it would be, to the carrying on of their Deſign, to make themſelves Maſters there alſo, at any price whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; they accordingly fail'd not to attempt the ſame with more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and Obſtinacy, than any of the forementioned Places.</p>
            <p>This little Town had already, for Three Years together, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Patience and Conſtancy, endured a Thouſand ill Treatments,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101095:12"/>
and Exactions from Souldiers, who had pick'd them to the very Bones: for beſides that, it was almoſt a continual paſſage for Souldiers; there were no leſs than 18. Troops of Horſe had their Winter-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there; who yet in all that time had only gain'd Three Converts, and they ſuch too as were maintain'd by the Alms of the Church.</p>
            <p>But to return: The deſign being form'd to reduce this City, two Troops of Horſe are immediately ordered thither, to obſerve the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and ſoon after 32 Companies of Foot enter the Town: Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Bouflers</hi> and the Intendant of the Province, with the Biſhops of <hi>Agen</hi> and <hi>Perigueux,</hi> and ſome other Perſons of Quality, render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there at the ſame time, and ſend for 200. of the chiefeſt Citizens to appear before them; telling them, <hi>That the Kings Expreſs Will and Pleaſure was, they ſhould all go to Maſs; and that in caſe of Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, they had order to compel them to it:</hi> To which the Citizens Unanimouſly anſwered, <hi>That their Eſtates were at the diſpoſe of his Majeſty, but that God alone was Lord of their Conſciences; and that they were reſolved to ſuffer to the utmoſt, rather than do any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the motions of it.</hi> Whereupon they were told, <hi>That if they were ſo reſolved, they had nought elſe to do but to prepare themſelves to receive the Puniſhment their Obſtinacy and Diſobedience did deſerve;</hi> and immediately 32. Companies more, of Infantry and Cavalry, enter the City (which, together with the 34 Companies beforementioned, were all Quartered with <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) with Expreſs Command not to ſpare any thing they had, and to exerciſe all manner of Violence upon the Perſons of thoſe that entertain'd them, until they ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted a Promiſe from them, to do whatſoever was Commanded them.</p>
            <p>Theſe Orders then being thus Executed, according to the deſires of thoſe who had given them, and theſe miſerable Victims of a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Military Fury, being reduc'd to the moſt deplorable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate condition; they are again ſent for to the Town houſe, and once more preſſed to change their Religion; and they anſwering with Tears in their Eyes, and with all the Reſpect, Humility, and Submiſſion ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, <hi>That the matter required of them, was the only thing they could not do,</hi> the extreameſt Rigour and Severity is denounc'd againſt them; and they preſently made good their Words, by ſending 34. more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies into the City, which made up the full number of an hundred; who encouraging themſelves from their numbers, and flying like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Wolves upon theſe Innocent Sheep, did rend and worry them in ſuch a manner, as the ſole Relation cannot but ſtrike with Horror
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101095:13"/>
and Amazement. Whole Companies were ordered to Quarter with one Citizen; and Perſons whoſe whole Eſtate did not amount to 10000. Livres, were taxed at the rate of 150. Livres a day: When their Money is gone, they ſell their Houſhold-ſtuff, and ſell that for two pence, which hath coſt 60 Livres; they bind and fetter Father, Mother, Wife and Children: Four Souldiers continually ſtand at the door, to hinder any from coming-in to ſuccour or comfort them: they keep them in this condition, two, three, four, five, and ſix days, without either Meat, Drink, or Sleep: On one hand the Child cries, with the Languiſhing accent of one ready to Dye, <hi>Ah my Father! Ah my Mother! What ſhall I do ' I muſt Dye, I can endure no longer:</hi> The Wife on the other hand cries; <hi>Alas! my Heart fails me, I Faint, I Dye!</hi> Whilſt their cruel Tormentors are ſo far from being touch'd with Compaſſion, that from thence they take occaſion to preſs them afreſh, and to renew their Torments, frighting them with their Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Menaces, accompanied with moſt execrable Oaths and Curſes; crying, <hi>Dog, Bougre, What, wilt not thou be Converted? Wilt not thou be Obedient? Dog, Bougre, Thou muſt be Converted, we are ſent on purpoſe to Convert thee:</hi> And the Clergy, who are witneſſes of all theſe Cruelties, (with which they feaſt their Eyes) and of all their Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and abominable words, (which ought to cover them with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Confuſion) make only a matter of Sport and Laughter of it.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe miſerable Wretches, being neither ſuffered to Live or to Dye, (for when they ſee them fainting away, they force them to take ſo much as to keep Body and Soul together) and ſeeing no other way for them to be delivered out of this Hell, in which they are continually Tormented, are fain at laſt to ſtoop under the unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Burthen of theſe extremities: So that, excepting only a few who ſaved themſelves by a timely Flight, preferring their Religion before all Temporal Poſſeſſions, all the reſt have been conſtrained to go to Maſs.</p>
            <p>Neither is the Country any more exempt from theſe Calamities, than Towns and Cities; nor thoſe of the Nobility and Gentry, than Citizens. They ſend whole Companies of Souldiers into Gentlemens Houſes, who Treat them in the moſt outragious and violent manner conceivable; inſomuch that not a Soul can hope to eſcape, except it may be ſome few, who like the Believers of old, wander in Deſarts, and lodge in Dens and Caves of the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:101095:13"/>Furthermore, I can aſſure you, that never was any greater conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, than that which we are in here at preſent; the Army, we hear is come very near us, and the <hi>Intendant</hi> is juſt now Arrived in this City; the greater part of the moſt conſiderable Merchants are either already gone, or caſting about how beſt to make their eſcape, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning their Houſes and Eſtates to their Enemies; and there are not wanting ſome Cowardly Spirits, who, to avoid the miſchief they are preparing for us, have already promiſed to do whatſoever is required of them. In a word, nothing is ſeen or heard in theſe parts but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, Weeping and Lamentation; there being ſcarce a Perſon of our Religion, who hath not his Heart pierced with the bittereſt Sorrows, and whoſe Countenance hath not the Lively Picture of Death Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on it: and ſurely, if our Enemies Triumph in all this, their Triumph cannot likely be of any long continuance.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I cannot perſwade my ſelf to entertain ſo good an opinion of them, as to think that ever they will be aſhamed of theſe their doings, ſo Diametrically oppoſite to the Spirit of the Goſpel; for I know the Goſpel, in their accounts, paſſeth for a Fable: but this I dare averr, that this Method of theirs will Infallibly lay waſte the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which, according to all appearance, is never like to recover of it; and ſo in time, they themſelves will be made as ſenſible of theſe miſeries, as others now are. Commerce is already in a manner wholly extinct, and there will need little leſs than a Miracle to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it to its former State. What <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Merchants will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward be willing to engage themſelves in Trade, either with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons without Faith; and who have ſo cowardly betray'd their Religion and Conſcience, or with the Outragious and Barbarous Perſecuters of the Religion, which they profeſs? and who by theſe courſes declare openly and frankly, that it is their Principle, not to think themſelves oblig'd to keep their word with Hereticks? And who are thoſe, of what Religion ſoever, that will Negotiate with a State exhauſted by Taxes and Subſidies, by Perſecutions, by Barrenneſs and Dearth of ſeveral years continuance; full of a deſpairing People, and which Infallibly will e're long be full of thoſe that are proſcrib'd, and be bathing in its own Blood.</p>
            <p>And theſe miſerable Wretches, who have been deceived by thoſe who have told them, That it would never be impos'd upon them to abjure their Religion, and who are ſtupified by the extremity of their Sufferings, and the terror of their bloody and cruel Enemies, are wrapt

            <head>An Extract of a Letter, containing ſome more Inſtances of the Cruel and Barbarous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BUt this, <hi>Sir,</hi> is not the thing which troubles me moſt, at this time; there's another cauſe of my Grief, which is but too juſt, and even pierceth my Heart with Sorrow; and that is, The Cruel Perſecution, which the Poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>France</hi> do ſuffer, amongſt whom I have ſo many near and dear Relations: The Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they are put to, are almoſt Incredible; and the Heavenly Courage, wherewith ſome of them are ſtrengthned by their Great Captain and Leader, to undergo them, is no leſs amazing and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful: I ſhall give for Inſtance one or two of theſe Champions, that by them you may judge of the reſt.</p>
            <p>A Young Woman was brought before the Council, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige her to abjure the Truth of the Goſpel; which ſhe boldly and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſing, was commanded back again to Priſon; where they ſhaved her Head, and ſing'd off the Hair of her Privities; and having ſtript her Stark-Naked, in this manner led her through the Streets of the City; where many a blow was given her, and Stones flung at her. After this, they ſet her up to the Neck in a Tub full of Water; where after ſhe had been for a while, they took her out, and put upon her a Shift dipt in Wine, which as it dry'd, and ſtuck to her Sore and Bruiſed Body, they ſnatch'd off again; and then had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ready, dipt in Wine, to clap upon her: This they repeated ſix ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times; and when by this Inhumane uſage, her Body was become very Raw and Tender, they demanded of her, <hi>Whether ſhe did not now find her ſelf diſpoſed to Embrace the Catholick Faith?</hi> for ſo they are pleaſed to term their Religion: But ſhe, being ſtrengthned by the Spirit and Love of Him, for whoſe Names ſake ſhe ſuffered all theſe Extremities, undaunted anſwer'd; <hi>That ſhe had before declared her Reſolution to them, which ſhe would never alter; and that, though they had her Body in their Power, ſhe was reſolved not to yield her Soul to them; but keep it pure and undefiled for her Heavenly Lover; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a little while would put an end to all her Sufferings, and give a</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:101095:15"/>
               <hi>Beginning to her Enjoyment of Everlaſting Bliſs:</hi> Which Words of hers, adding Fuel of their Rage, who now deſpaired of making her a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, they took and faſtned her by her Feet, to ſomething that ſerved the turn of a Gibbet, and there let her hang in that Ignominious Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, with her Head downwards, till ſhe expired.</p>
            <p>The other Perſon I would inſtance in, and whom I pity the more, becauſe (for ought I know) he may yet ſurvive, and ſtill continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Tormentor's Hands, is an Old Man; who having, for a great while, been kept cloſe Priſoner (upon the ſame Account as the former) in a deep Dungeon, where his Companions were Darkneſs and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and filthy Creeping Things, was brought before his Judges, with Vermin and Snails crawling upon his Mouldred Garment; who ſeeing him in that Loathſom Condition, ſaid to him: <hi>How now Old Man, does not your Heart begin to Relent? and are not you willing to Abjure your Hereſie?</hi> To which he anſwer'd: <hi>As for Hereſie, I profeſs none; but if by that Word you mean my Religion, you may aſſure your ſelves, that as I have thus long Lived, ſo, I hope, and am reſolved by the Grace of</hi> God, <hi>to Dye in it:</hi> With which Anſwer they being little pleaſed, but furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Incenſed, beſpoke him in a rougher Tone: <hi>Do'ſt thou not ſee, that the Worms are about to devour thee? Well, fince thou art ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, we will ſend thee back again, to the loathſom Place from whence thou cameſt, that they may make an end of thee, and conſume thy obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Heart:</hi> To which he reply'd, with the Words of the Holy Patient <hi>Job; Novi poſtquam vermes confoderint (Corpus) iſtud, in carne mea me viſſurum eſſe Deum. I know that after Worms have eaten this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that in my Fleſh I ſhall ſee God.</hi> And having ſo ſaid, he was ſent back to his loathſom dark Abode; where if he be ſtill, I pray <hi>God</hi> to give him Patience and Strength to hold out to the End, that ſo he may obtain the Crown of Life.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be too tedious, in giving you all the Particulars of their Cruelty, and of the Sufferings of the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> yet I cannot well forbear acquainting you with what lately I am moſt credibly inform'd of; which take as follows: Some <hi>Dragoons,</hi> who were Quartered with a Perſon, who they could by no means oblige to Renounce his Religion; upon a time, when they had well fill'd themſelves with Wine, and broke their Glaſſes at every Health they drank; and ſo fill'd the Floor, where they were, with the Fragments; and by often walking over, and treading upon them, reduced them to leſſer Pieces and Fractions: And being now in a merry Humour, they muſt needs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101095:15"/>
go to Dance; and told their Hoſt, That he muſt be One of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but withal, that he muſt firſt pull off his Stockings and Shoes, that he might move the more nimbly: In a word, they forc'd him to Dance with them bare-footed, upon the ſharp Points of Glaſs; which when they had continued ſo long as they were able to keep him on his Legs, they laid him down on a Bed; and a while after ſtript him ſtark naked, and rolled his Body from one end of the Room to the other, upon the ſharp Glaſs, as beforementioned; which having done, till his Skin was ſtuck full of the ſaid little Fragments, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him again to his Bed, and ſent for a Chyrurgeon, to take out all the ſaid Pieces of Glaſs out of his Body; which, you may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, could not be done without frequent Inciſions, and horrible and moſt extream Pain. Another Perſon being likewiſe troubled with the unwelcome Company of theſe <hi>Dragoons,</hi> and having ſuffered extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their Hands, without the expected Succeſs of his Converſion; one of them on a time looking earneſtly upon him, told him, <hi>That he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured himſelf, with letting his Beard grow ſo long:</hi> But he anſwering, <hi>That they were the cauſe of it, who would not let him ſtir out of door, for to go to the Barber:</hi> The <hi>Dragoon</hi> reply'd <hi>I can do that for you as well as the Barber;</hi> and with that told him, <hi>He muſt needs try his Skill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him:</hi> And ſo fell to work; but inſtead of ſhaving him, flea'd all the Skin off his Face. One of his Companions coming-in at the Cry of this poor Sufferer, and ſeeing what he had done, ſeemingly blam'd him for it, and ſaid, <hi>He was a Bunglar;</hi> and then to his Hoſt, <hi>Come, your Hair wants Cutting too; and you ſhall ſee, I will do it much better than he hath ſhav'd you:</hi> And thereupon begins, in a moſt cruel manner, to pluck the Hair, Skin, and all, off his Head, and flea'd That as the other had done his Chin. Thus making a Sport and Merriment of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Suffering of theſe miſerable Wretches.</p>
            <p>By theſe Inhumane, and more than Barbarous means it is, that they endeavour to overcome the moſt reſolved Patience, and to drive Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Deſpair and Faint-heartedneſs, by their Deviliſh Inventions. They refuſe to give them Death, which they deſire; and only keep them alive to torment them, ſo long till they have vanquiſh'd their Perſeverance; for the Names of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>Rebels,</hi> are equally odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their Enemies; who tell them, <hi>That the King will have Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Subjects, but neither Martyrs nor Rebels; and that they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Orders to Convert them, but not to Kill them.</hi>

            <p>IN the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Amen.</hi> I Believe and Confeſs with a firm Faith, all and every thing and things contained in the Creed, which is uſed by the Holy Church of <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> I Receive and Embrace moſt ſincerely the Apoſtolick and Eccleſiaſtical Traditions, and other Obſervances of the ſaid Church. In like manner, I receive the Scriptures, but in the ſame Sence as the ſaid Mother Church hath, and doth now underſtand and Expound the ſame; for whom and to whom it only doth belong to judge of the Interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures: And I will never take them, nor underſtand them otherwiſe, than accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the unanimous Conſent of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>I profeſs, That there be truly and properly Seven Sacraments of the New Law, inſtituted by our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and neceſſary for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Mankind, altho' not equally needful for every one, <hi>viz.

            <p>I receive and embrace all and every thing, and things, which have been determined concerning Original Sin and Juſtification by the Holy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I likewiſe profeſs, that in the <hi>Maſs</hi> there is offered up to <hi>God,</hi> a true, proper, and propitiatory Sacrifice for the Living and Dead; and that in the Holy Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> there is <hi>truly, really, and Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, the Body and Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that in it there is made a change of the whole Subſtance of the Bread into his Body, and of whole Subſtance of the Wine into his Blood, which change the Catholick Church calls <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> I confeſs alſo, That under one only of theſe two Elements, whole <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the true Sacrament is received.</p>
            <p>I conſtantly believe and affirm, that there is a Purgatory; and that the Souls there detained, are relieved by the Suffrages of the Faithful.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Kind Reader,</hi> FOraſmuch as in the Edict of the <hi>French</hi> King, the perpetual and irrevocable Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> is recall'd and aboliſhed; I thought fit (becauſe the whole Edict would be too long to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted here) to give you ſome paſſages of the Prefatory part of it, whereby it may appear what ſtreſs was laid on it by <hi>Henry</hi> the IV.

            <p>—Now it hath pleaſed God to give us a beginning of enjoying ſome Reſt, we think, we cannot employ our ſelves better, than to apply to that which may tend to the Service and Glory of his Holy Name, and to provide that He may be Adored and Prayed to by all Our Subjects; and if <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

For this cauſe, acknowledging this affair to be of the greateſt Importance, and worthy of the beſt conſideration, after having conſidered the Complaints of Our Catholick Subjects, and having alſo permitted to Our Subjects of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> to aſſemble themſelves by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties for framing their Complaints, and making a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection

of all their Remonſtrances, and having thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conferred divers times with them, we have upon the whole judged it neceſſary, to give to all Our ſaid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects one General Law, clear, plain, and abſolute, by which they ſhall be regulated in all differences, which have heretofore riſen among them, or which may riſe hereafter, and wherewith both the one and the other may be contented; having had no other regard in this deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, than ſolely the Zeal we have to the Service of God, praying that He would henceforward grant to all Our Subjects a Durable and Eſtabliſhed Peace: And We implore and expect from his Divine Bounty the ſame Protection and Favour he hath always beſtowed upon this Kingdom from our Birth, &amp; that He would give our ſaid Subjects the Grace to underſtand, that in obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Our Ordinance, conſiſteth (next to their Duty toward God and us) the principal Foundation of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion Concord, Tranquility, Reſt, &amp; the re-eſtabliſhment of this ſtate in its firſt Splendor.
