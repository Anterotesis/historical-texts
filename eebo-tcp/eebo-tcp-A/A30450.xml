         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is nothing more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
than for every Man to form
himself upon some Pattern or
other. Few have the strength
of Thought, and the correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Judgment that is necessary for framing a
Scheme to themselves. It is much easier, as
well as much surer to work after some Oaiginal;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65700:5"/>
in which we may be better able to find out what
may be Corrected or Improved, than to form
an entire Design to our selves. This is the
simplest and surest way of Instruction. Great
attention to observe well, and some reflection
to judge aright, will carry us far.</p>
            <p>But when we view Patterns given us in Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
we are apt to mistrust it, both because we flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our selves, and so do not believe any thing
that is too high above us; and because we see
Friendship or Interest dispose men to flatter
others, both living and dead, we do not
believe the Heroes of former Times had so
much Good, and that with so few Mixtures, as
their Lives represent them; so that dead Patterns
and written Examples move us but feebly. As
for those whom we have known, we find after
much Practice, such Defects and Abatements
in them, as will much sink the high Thoughts
that a slighter knowledge of them might at
first raise in us. And though Charity is willing
to shade them, yet still they are Foils which
weaken the Lustre of the Piece. If we follow
any too closely, we may insensibly enter into
the Imitation of their Weaknesses, as well as of
their Virtues; and by too servile a forming our
selves according to such Originals, we may
run into Singularity and Affectations, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65700:5"/>
are always disagreeable. For some Native or
bolder airs, that lookt nobly in the Original,
shew but poorly when Copied by a weak and
unskilful Hand. After all, since a Copy must
needs sink below the force and grace of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
for Copy imports weakness; If we take
our Patterns from those who are too near our
own size, they will raise us but very little;
and if we take them too far out of our reach,
they will make us despair of rising up to
them.</p>
            <p>But what mistakes soever we may commit
in Copying out men like our selves, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
err in endeavouring to become as like God
as is possible. The word in my Text rendred
<hi>Followers,</hi> is <hi>Imitators,</hi> and is the same word
from which the Abusive Ones of <hi>Mimick</hi> and
<hi>Mimichry</hi> are drawn.<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 26.</note> God made man <hi>after his
own image,</hi> or to be an image and resemblance
of himself. He had no other Pattern to Copy
from, but his own Infinite and Eternal Mind;
he made us from that Pattern, and has obliged
us to imitate it. But is there not a boldness
that seems to border on Blasphemy in this, for
a Mortal man to pretend to be like God? It
seems too high an aim: A flight above our
reach, and beyond our prospect. The very
Idea of God carrying Infinite Perfection in it,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65700:6"/>
declares him to be Incomprehensible: Can we
then pretend to imitate that which we cannot
look at:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 18.</note> 
               <hi>No eye hath seen, or can see him;</hi> and
though all is light about him, yet it is a <hi>Light
to which we cannot approach; for clouds and darkness
are round about him,</hi> with relation to us. Yet
if this Light is too strong for us to behold,
God has so tempered it, and has brought it
so near us by dwelling in Flesh, that while we
look at him in that <hi>express image of his person,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 6.</note>
we see in his <hi>face the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> and in him <hi>with open face, as in a
glass, we behold the glory of the Lord.</hi> The
brightness that would otherwise dazzle, is here
so softned, as yet to lose none of its Beauty,
or its Glory; it is both more Instructive, and
more agreeable, as well as less vehement and
awful.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter it is certain, that
this is the Great and Fundamental Truth of all
Religion, That its main Design is to raise and
exalt the Nature of man, all that is possible,
into a Conformity to the Divine Nature. This
is the standing difference between True and
False Religion, between Idolatry or Superstition
on the one hand, and Pure Religion and Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
on the other. That whatsoever proposes
any Forms or Practices, Opinions or Interests
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65700:6"/>
to be espoused, that have no real tendency in
them to the reforming or exalting our Natures,
but that rest in these, as things in which the
Divinity will be pleased, as in such Acts of
Homage and Submission that are offered to it
with which the Deity is appeased or bribed,
so as to dispense with, or forgive greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
This is Superstition, and is the practice of
those who study to corrupt Religion in its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and most important parts, and who would
bring men into Parties, and under Conceits,
of which they may have the conduct, and by
which they may manage other Ends that may
pass under solemn Names, but are really the effects
of Passion and Ambition, and are directed to
serve the Interests of Carnal and Designing Men.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, The right view of True
Religion is, when a Set of such Principles
and Practices is set before us, which gives us
great and noble thoughts of God, and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Life; just and humble ones of our selves,
with a tender regard to other men, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
contempt of this World, with every
thing in it, and even of Life it self: And when
this set of Mind breaks out into a course of
vertuous and generous Actions; When we
shew that our Religion is the best of all
others, because we are made much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65700:7"/>
by it; and all others feel such an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in our Religion, and such effects from
it, that thereby they are both disposed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after it, and prepared to believe well of
it. For the World will always think this to
be as true an Argument, as it is a short and
an easy one, That that must be the best Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which makes the best Men. All the Rules,
Forms, Practices, and Institutions in Religions,
must be such as have a tendency to raise,
to feed, and to maintain those great and noble
Ideas which True Religion gives. When they
are so practised, they contribute towards it, and
so become a part of True Religion.</p>
            <p>For instance, If one prays only as a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
in which so much Time must be spent,
so many Forms gone through, so many Words
repeated, and so many Acts drawn out of the
Mind; which being done, if he think his Duty
is also done, God is pleased, Scores are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and all is set to rights; here is the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
conceit of Prayer. On the other hand,
If one considers Prayer as a mean and method
to raise within him high thoughts of God, and
low ones of himself; a severe sense both of his
Sins and Duties; with earnest Addresses made
to God, and humble Resolutions formed in
himself; and thus uses Prayer as a real mean to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65700:7"/>
humble and to purify himself, to keep him in mind
of his Duty, and to direct him by fervent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to obtain Divine Assistances; he feels this
is a Practice, the continuance of which makes
him really the better; and upon such Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
he sees it is very reasonable for him to
believe, that according to the Promises made
in the Gospel, of the hearing and granting our
Prayers, that God will accept of such Addresses,
and will upon them make such returns as our
Necessities or Occasions do require. This in
general then is certain, That God has not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Religion on the World, as it were, to lay
a Tax on men, or raise a Tribute from them;
he needs nothing from us, as we cannot give
him any thing; he has only commanded us to
be Religious, because it is the only possible
way to exalt our Natures, to compose our
Minds, and to govern our Actions. It is that
which renders us proper Objects of the Divine
Love and Complacence, and puts us in the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
way of attaining the utmost Happiness of
which we are capable; which is to see God as
he is, and to be made like unto him: Our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made like God here, is the certainest Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
as well as the surest Earnest, of our being to
enjoy him for ever, in that State of a more and
perfect Conformity to him, than we are capable
of arriving at here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65700:8"/>
What is this, to be like God! Can a mortal
and finite Nature, stretch it self so far beyond
its Bounds and Capacities, as to become either
Infinite or Eternal? Can such frail and short-sighted
Beings, as we are, become Omnipotent
or Omniscient? No surely: Man is but <hi>Vanity,</hi>
and even men of <hi>high degree are a lie;</hi> they are
no less a <hi>Vanity</hi> than the rest; but because they
seem to be somewhat, they are a <hi>lie.</hi> The
Kings and mighty Potentates of the Earth, after
all the swellings of Flattery and Vanity, are,
when compared to God, as nothing, or <hi>less than
nothing, and vanity;</hi> a diminution in Speech, that
wants not its beauty. Wherein must we then
resemble God, or how can we hope to become
like unto him? It must be at a great distance,
and with an infinite disproportion, that we can
pretend to this Imitation.</p>
            <p>God may be considered by us, either in an
Intellectual way, as he is a Mind perfect in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
or in a Moral way, as he is perfect in his
Dealings with all others. In both respects we may
be able to find out proper Instances of conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves to him. He is a pure and perfect
Spirit, not clogged with Matter, or any union
or relation to Matter. We are indeed chained
down to a Body and lock'd up in it: We are
incumbred with all its pressures, and drawn
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65700:8"/>
down to an earthliness and lowness, by too great
a commerce with sense and sensible Objects.
This captivates and depresses us, nor can we
quite throw it off, or escape from it, till the
Prison can hold us no more, and our Fetters
fall off. A disturbed Imagination does now
viciate our Thoughts; violent Passions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
Appetites do strangely, by a sort of
Magick, transform our Souls: They become
heavy and dull, feeble and unactive, and almost
as Low and Insensible as Matter it self. Then do
we rise up to resemble God in the Intellectual
way, when we raise our Minds as much out of
our Bodies and above them as we can; when we
deny our selves all commerce with those viciating
Objects, that corrupt our Minds, and war
against our Souls: And when we reduce our
selves to short allowances, with relation to
those more Innocent amusements and delights;
which may be necessary to the support of the
Body, and to the keeping it in such tune, as
to answer the occasions that our Souls may
have with it; or to give our Minds such
easy and lively intervals between severer exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
a continuance in which would quickly
wast or overset us, that so we may return to them
with greater advantage, and prosecute them with
more force. But besides this, a Man who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65700:9"/>
would raise his Mind to be the greatest and
noblest sort of Being to which it can be exalted,
ought to break himself all he can to all eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and vehemence, and to a quick pursuit of
his Passions or Pleasures. He ought to shake
off all those additional fetters which he has
added to those under which he is put by the state
of Life he is now made subject to. He gives
wings to his Soul, who raises it often above Sense
and Interest, above the views of Pleasure or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
who directs it to Contemplate and to
Meditate; and by such practices is, as it were,
making escapes from his Body and Bodily Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
who grows even ashamed of that necessary
commerce which he must hold with this mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
World, and therefore he not only prepares to
leave it, but is daily looking and longing for it.
In a word, do not all Men feel that when then
they let their Minds go far into Voluptuous,
Covetous, or Ill-natur'd designs, their Souls are,
as it were, steep'd and soak'd into Matter, they
are depressed and debased by it, and made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of nothing that is high or generous. By a
long continuance in these things they lose their
relish of better things, as they become incapable
of them. Their Minds grow down to Earth, and
become little better than what the Libertines
allow them to be, mere sluggish and unactive
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65700:9"/>
Matter. Is not this a Degeneracy and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basing
of our Natures, and a sinking them
deeper and deeper into Matter and Corruption?
Whereas those, and those only, feel that they
have Souls indeed, who rise to the higher Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Thought and Meditation: Who break
themselves to Appetite and Passion, to Humour
and Interest, and live in Thought and Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
who awaken all those noble Seeds that are
in their Natures, and Exercise and Improve
them, and make themselves to become as much
Minds as they can possibly be. The Clog of
the Body will be often taking them down, yet
they will rise up again, and aspire after as much
of Intellectual Light and Life as this state of
Matter and Mortality will allow of.</p>
            <p>A Second thing in the Intellectual way, in
which the considering God as our Pattern will
direct us to raise and exalt our selves, is when
we consider him as Acting eternally upon a true
and full view of all things, and upon the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and clearest Light, with a perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
Wisdom. It is true we are not capable of
this sort of Perfection. God sees all things past,
present, and to come, in one single view. Yet
in this we see what is the Perfection of a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Nature. It is Thought, Acting with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and Guided by Knowledge. The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65700:10"/>
we know things, the more we examine their
Nature, Causes, and Effects; the more we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
what is past, and look into what may
be before us; the deeper we go into our selves,
to consider our Capacities, and to examine
our Defects, the greater views we give our
selves of Truth in general, the more we open
our Minds to know the Works of God, the
Courses of the Heavenly Bodies, the Structures
of this Earth, with all the varieties with which
it is both Beautified and Enriched; but above
all, the more we consider this strange mixture
of Light and Darkness, of Soul and Body which
meet in Man, the wonderful Capacities of his
Mind, and the amusing Texture of his Body;
and when from all this we accustom our selves
to think much of God and his Attributes,
when from mere Speculative views we descend
to more Practical ones, and view our selves,
and compare our Obligations and our Actions,
and from a strict review of what we have seen,
form a wise prospect of what may be before
us; and above all, when a Man brings those
more general Thoughts to an exact knowledg
of himself, and a strict rule of Life, then
does he become truly Wise, and so grows
up to be as sublime, and as exalted a sort
of Being, as he can work himself up to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65700:10"/>
Then a Man grows up to the height of his
Nature, when he is often turning his Thoughts
towards some useful Piece of Knowledge or
Observation: when he reflects much, and judges
slowly, but sedately and truly, and frames his
whole Life to a constant Pursuit of that which
is the effect of so much Consideration and
Care. A Man needs but reflect a very little
on what he feels within himself, to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the truth of all this. The more Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and Implicite, the more Rash and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
the more Headstrong and Wilful he is,
he feels that he is the lamer and imperfecter
sort of Creature: He whose Knowledge is
only imployed in the mean Business of Life,
or in the meaner Arts of Cozenage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit;
he who is led or driven blindfold, and
who neither knows, nor is concern'd to know
how he ought to conduct himself, but leaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to Chance or Fate, to sudden Thoughts,
or unlook'd-for Accidents, and is not the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
for what is past, nor the carefuller of what
may be before him; this Man, I say, is with
all his Shows of Wealth and Greatness, with
all his Gilding and Trappings, but a poor, a
blind, and a miserable Creature: a Slave to
Humour or Interest, to Envy or Ill-nature.
But he is of a much Nobler Order, one is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65700:11"/>
tempted to say, of another sort of Beings,
who has opened his Mind, and spread his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
wide, to the acquiring of true and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Knowledge; who imploys his Thoughts
and Time to the digesting of what he knows,
and the rendring it useful to himself and others,
and who makes it the study of his whole Life,
to reduce those his Theories to Practice, and
so lives by Thought and Reflection. Souls so
raised, are aspiring to imitate that Original Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
they are on a true Scent, and in the
right Way; they may perhaps make some
wrong Steps, but it is impossible that
those who take this Method can miscarry. All
must end happily with those who begin so
well.</p>
            <p>As God is Pure and Perfect in Himself, so
he is Holy in all his Ways; and all those who
arrive at good degrees of this Intellectual Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
are at the same time very exactly careful
in observing the Moral Order of Things, that
Rule of their Actions and Deportment towards
others. These are reduced to Two general
Heads, of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness. Truth</hi> is the
Vertue which of all others Nature puts on us
with the most forcible Impression. It is indeed
no other but the speaking and acting according
to the Sense that we have of Things. It is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65700:11"/>
that which Nature always suggests; it shoots
it self ever first into our Thoughts and Words.
It is simple and uniform, ever the same, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without Care, and managed without
Study. It requires a good degree of study to
carry on false and deceitful Designs, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Disguises, with that contrivance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Mind, and with that Memory and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
that are necessary to indirect Practises.
Whereas if a Man has but the Virtue and the
Courage to be Honest, he goes on with little
anxiety, trusting to his Integrity, for that will
both support and conduct him. <hi>Truth</hi> is the
first and the most indispensable of all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
among Men. It is the Basis of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
and the Foundation of all the Confidence
and Security that can be in the World. Many
Nations have differed much in their Notions
concerning the other Virtues, but all have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
that within Society, at least, <hi>Truth</hi> ought
to be maintain'd sacredly; and the more open
and free, the more unreserved and hearty this
Sincerity is, it tends to establish Nations and
Neighbourhoods upon a surer Bottom. It is
the same Vertue that makes us true in our
Words, just in our Dealings, faithful to our
Promises, and exact in our Payments: all arise
from the same Root, from an Integrity of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65700:12"/>
Heart, and a candid Sincerity in all that one
professes, says, or does. This is the speaking
the Truth as one thinks and intends it, and
the maintaining the Truth as it has been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
or promised. This is the conforming our
selves to the Divine Being,<note place="margin">9 Dan. 4.</note> who is <hi>true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
keeping his Covenant and Promises;</hi> who is the
<hi>God of Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">51 Psal. 6.</note> and who <hi>desires Truth in the inward
parts:</hi> Whereas the Men of Falshood and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
who love and tell Lyes, who lie in wait
to deceive, who give themselves to Oppression
and Extortion, who take Advantages from the
simplicity and credulity of other Persons, to
impose on them the more dextrously; and who
make <hi>Lies their refuge</hi> and their Strength, and
are not wanting to fortifie them with Oaths
and Imprecations, that they may vent them
with the better Grace, and give them the more
Credit; these are fallen from the Resemblance
of the true and righteous God, and are lapsed
into the state of the Apostate and fallen. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">8 John 45.</note>
whose Character is, That <hi>he abode not in the
truth, because there is no truth in him, who when he
speaketh a Lye, speaketh of his own;</hi> that is, his
natural Stile and Dialect, <hi>for he is a Lyar, and
the Father of it.</hi> Here we must begin our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to God, as to our Morals. It is a vain
thing to pretend to make any farther Progress
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65700:12"/>
in Religion, 'till we have learnt to practise this
which is the first Element of Virtue. There
is no going further 'till we enter upon the
diligent Practice of this: as a careful Master
will not carry his Scholars over the first Elements
'till they are once fully the Masters of these.
It is the deceiving them to pretend to lead them
further, before these are well understood by
them; so Truth is of so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndispensable a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
both with Relation to Religion and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Life, that without it we can neither be
Happy nor secure in this Life, nor have any
Hope in the next. Since <hi>Liars</hi> are reckoned in
almost in every Catalogue, that is given us, of
those who are adjudged to endless Miseries.</p>
            <p>Next Truth is Goodness and in this we find
that Nature has also made very deep Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
on us: We feel Dispositions to Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Compassion, to Acts of Mercy
and Pity, and to Love and Friendship, laid in
our Natures. We feel that the more these are
shut up, and restrained in us, the feebler their
Influence and the fain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er their Power is, that
we are thereby the lower, the meaner, and the
deader in every thing that is either Great or
Generous: whereas the more we awaken and
open these Seeds in us, the greater Compass they
take, and the stronger that they work upon us,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65700:13"/>
we become thereby a nobler Sort of Creatures:
We have greater Thoughts, better Designs,
with a more generous Exaltation of Nature and
a further enlargment of our Faculties.</p>
            <p>Goodness is not meer Pity; much less a
feeble Disposition to pardon too easily, or to
carry Compassion beyond all Rules or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures:
such a Goodness as this, would too much
encourage the wickedest Race of Men, they
would presume too much upon it. If Princes were
too easie in this way, Society would become
an impracticable Thing: The worst Sort of
Men would be too bold, if the best were too
merciful. The chief Acts of Goodness are,
the endeavouring to make others truly Good.
He who feels in himself the Power and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Principles of Religion and Virtue,
endeavours to spread and communicate these
all he can: He is so sensible of his Happiness,
in being under their Influence, that he takes
all the Methods he can, to infuse the like Sense
into all others. Love and Compassion are
the Root of this Disposition in him: all the
other Offices and Acts of Charity, are Acts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a Lower Order, though they are all
necessary in their Kind: those which tend to
make Men truly Good, are of the Nobler
Sort. This we find in the Manifestations of
the Divine Goodness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:65700:13"/>
God is perfect in himself, and from that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
there is a perpetual emunation to all Rational
Beings, while they are capable of being made
truly Good. In Order to that End even the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of Sin is offered but as an Encouragement
to our becoming truly Good: our Faculties are
made capable of it: all Knowledge is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us in Order to that End: and the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
of Life are given us like so many Larges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which make it easie and convenient, to
give us the more freedom of Thought, and the
better to dispose us to enter upon wise and
good Methods. So the whole Design of God
in all his Dealings with us, is to make us real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Good. Other Things are only collateral,
and are directed to this end.</p>
            <p>Here then is the true Idea of perfect Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
a real Desire and hearty Endeavour to
make Men good, by all the Means and Methods
that we can think on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HAPPY THEY</hi> who have their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to do much Good; who ought to consider
this as the Noblest Character of Divinity, by
which they do shine with a Glory that is much
Brighter than all the Attire of Majesty. They
are born to be publick Blessings to Mankind,
not only as they protect and defend them, as
they rescue them from Oppression and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65700:14"/>
and as they do Justice and spread their
Royal Bounty among their People. This is
no small Degree of Honour, but it is not all
their Dignity. They can make the World
not only the safer and the happier, but
the better by their Means. They can set such
an Example that will bring many to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to imitate it. What they do is much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
they are ever in view, and always nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
lookt to. Many for Interest, and others
for Decency, will follow the Patterns that they
set, especially if all is Uniform and of a
Piece; and if they join with it, the Influences of
their Favour, and the Force of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to encourage and promote Virtue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and to discourage and disgrace Vice
and Impiety.</p>
            <p>The bare Practice of Virtue, and giving
good Examples, is all that the lower sort of
Men are capable of doing, in order to the
reforming the World. But for those who are
fortified with Power and Authority, who have
Rewards and Punishments in their Hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that, which in other Persons is of little
Force, but has in them a mighty Influence,
their good or ill Looks which carry Life, or
give Death, or at least a Damp that will put
boldest to a stand. For them, I say, to be silent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65700:14"/>
Observers of the Vices of others, is to give
them Impunity, if not Protection. When these
are of the side of Nature, and give it scope,
then they are very successful: little Labour,
with bad Examples in those set on high, will
soon corrupt a Nation. But when they work
against the Current, tho' the Foundation of all
that they can hope to effect, must be laid in
their own good Example; yet this will work
slowly and feebly, if not follow'd with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Influence. Practices that have got possession,
when they have Nature on their side, will be
stubborn, and are not easily conquered. But
Rewards and Encouragements, with some few
Severities, when extorted, will turn the Tide at
last.</p>
            <p>Are not those then born for the Noblest
Ends, and exalted to the best Purposes, who
live and govern so, that the World grows the
better by their means. But as this is the Top
of their Honour, and a high one it is indeed,
so they must remember that they must give
an Account of it to him <hi>by whom Kings reign.</hi>
The greater Opportunities and Advantages that
are put in their Hands, they have so much the
more to answer for, since <hi>to whom much is given,
of them much will also be required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65700:15"/>
Here then is our Pattern, and this is our
Lesson;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> we must be the <hi>followers of God,</hi> and
<hi>shew forth the vertues of him who hath called us
from darkness to his marvellous light.</hi> But if we
think this is too far out of sight, let us view it
a little, as it is brought nearer us, and set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us in more sensible Idea's. In the Person
of our Blessed Saviour, we see those Characters
of the Divinity, in a Light, that is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to our Faculties. If we view him
with relation to the Particulars that have been
hitherto insisted on, we find that tho' he was
clothed with our Nature, together with all its
innocent Infirmities, yet he not only kept at a
perfect distance from all the Defilements of
Sense, but he despised Wealth and Greatness,
Ease and Pleasure, and fled even from the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of a Crown: He neglected his Person,
and spent many Days in Fasting, and the
Nights in Prayer: He lived in Contemplations
that were indeed above us, because he saw
Truth in a Light superiour to our Capacities:
He was neither led by Partialities nor Humours,
but was ever delighted to do the Will of God
in all things.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 22.</note> 
               <hi>There was no guile in his mouth:</hi>
He would not save his Life by the concealing
or disguising of Truth,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 23.</note> but freely confessed that
upon which his Enemies were resolved to take
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65700:15"/>
it away: He was ever open and sincere,
tho' he knew that all his Words were wrested
to the worst Sense possible. He was ever <hi>doing
good,</hi> as his Life was a perfect Pattern of it:
His Time was chiefly imployed in instructing
the Multitudes that gathered about him: he
taught them plainly, suitably to their Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
with great Tenderness and Patience: only
he shewed a just Indignation, which he has
thereby recommended to us, against the proud,
the bloody, and the hypocritical Corrupters of
Religion in his Time: He bore all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
that was put upon him, and all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
that were done him, with silence and
patience, and was ever ready not only to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them, but to render Good for Evil; while
an unaffected Humility, and a decent Modesty
run thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all he either said or did. Thus he
lived, and thus he died. He died that he might
reconcile us to God; but he lived to set us a
Pattern, to shew us what true Religion was,
how to be attained, and how practised. This was
that which gave the Christian Religion its chief
Authority, after the Miracles with which it was at
first proved, had ceas'd. The shining Lives,
the Purity, the Sinceri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, and the Charity of
those who professed it, recommended it so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
to the World, that even the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65700:16"/>
of all its Enemies,<note place="margin">Jul. Ep. 49.</note> 
               <hi>Iulian the Apostate,</hi> in
a Letter to one of his Priests, in which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the small Progress he was making in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
Heathenism, and confesses the Disorders
that were among them, says, <hi>The Christians,</hi>
(whom he in derision calls usually the <hi>Galileans)
had gained their Credit by their Charity to the Poor,
and by the Gravity</hi> or Purity <hi>of their Lives.</hi> It
is true, his Malice made him put in the Word
<hi>counterfeit</hi> Gravity, but the virulence of that is
very plain. In the same Letter, speaking of
relieving the <hi>Poor,</hi> he does it by this Gradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
he reproaches the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with their neglect
of them; he says none of the <hi>Iews</hi> did beg;
but of the <hi>Christians,</hi> he says they not only
take care of their own Poor, but of ours like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
It was by the force of such Patterns,
that the Christian Religion prevail'd so much
as it did in the World.</p>
            <p>But what made the Stand? what put a Stop to its
Progress, and has brought it under so fatal a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
that now it is losing Ground instead of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any? We that are called <hi>Christians,</hi> are chiefly
to be blam'd for this: Our bad Practices, and
the ill Examples we set the World, have given
it deep, and, with relation to us, just Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices.
It amazes a Man to think, what it can
be that should possess the World so much against
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65700:16"/>
a Religion that is so Pure and Holy in all the
parts of it, but chiefly in its Precepts, and that
particularly tends to make all Mankind both
safe and happy. The first and great Reason,
is the corruption of Men's Natures; that
stands it out in a stiff opposition to that which
is so contrary to them, to their Ends, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
their Appetites, and their Passions.
This they are willing to fortifie by all the ill-natur'd
Observations, whether true or false,
that they can make, of those who are of any
Form, or bear any Character in this Religion.
But suppose all were true that they suggest,
and that we were as bad as they wish we
were, or study to make us appear to be; we
are certainly so much the more to blame, since
our Practices will have a more certain Influence
than our Discourses; yet whatever we may be,
tho' we may have the Defects and Infirmities
of Humane Nature hanging about us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
too often on us,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 7.</note> yet <hi>we have this
treasure put in earthen vessels.</hi> How contemptible
soever the Pot or <hi>Vessel</hi> may be, that makes
not the <hi>Treasure</hi> found in it to be of less Value.
It is so temper'd, and was so from the very
beginning, that <hi>the excellency of the power may
appear to be of God, and not of Man.</hi> Let Men
say of us what they please, and let us defend
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65700:17"/>
us from it the best we can, yet what can the
whole Tribe of Libertines say against the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
and Rule of Life, that Temper of Mind,
and Course of the whole Conversation, that
this our Religion prescribes: Let us bear our
own Burden, but let no part be cast on that
Faith which we believe, and that Doctrine
in which we instruct the World: Nor ought
Judgments to be made too rashly: for Men
may have weak Sides and frail Minutes, and
yet upon the whole they may sincery believe,
and faithfully follow this <hi>form of Doctrine,</hi> even tho'
Humane Nature may be so strong, as to make
them give Ground sometimes, and start aside but
too often. Yet certainly this is so strong a Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
to those who seek for it, and study to fortifie
themselves by it, against the Power of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
that it ought to have a great effect
on all Persons, in whom, or by reason of whom
the Honour of Religion may be concerned;
to oblige them to a great attention to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to a strict watchfulness over all they
do; for they are watched and observed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who wait for their halting, and will not
fail to improve all the advantages that are given
in this manner, with a most industrious spite.
But after all, we cannot pretend to go further than
St. <hi>Paul</hi> did,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Beye followers of me, as I also am of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65700:17"/>
Christ.</hi> Then indeed our Words will have the
utmost Force, that can be put in Words, when
our Lives are of a piece with them: but when
it is otherwise, it is the worse for our selves;
but our Cause has still the same truth and the
same force in it, how ill soever it may be set
out, or supported by us. God be thanked for
it, we are not so destitute of Patterns, but that
some remain; and some we have known, who
are now enjoying the Rewards of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Vertue, who have signally edify'd the
World, and whose Name and Fame do still live.</p>
            <p>We are to do all this <hi>as dear Children,</hi> under
deep Impressions of the Love and Goodness of
God: for these are the powerfullest Motives to
a generous and lively Obedience. The Glory
and Majesty of God strike us, but his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
overcomes all those that are capable of a
just sense of things; we receive a great deal in
common with the rest of Men, or of Christians,
and those Blessings are of such a Nature, that if
we but let them in upon our Thoughts, in their
true value, we will feel a mighty force in them,
to determine us to a sincere Obedience. The
Blessings that go to all Mankind in common,
or at least to a great part of it, will not perhaps
make such Impression on some, as those that
are more special, or that having more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65700:18"/>
and particularly to themselves. In such
every Man who examines the whole conduct of
Providence towards himself, from his first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out to the present time, will be able to
collect such a train of kind and tender, happy
and indulgent Instances of the Goodness of God
towards him, preserving him from Evil, rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him out of Dangers and Inconveniences,
conducting him thro' Difficulties, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with many Blessings; that he will soon
find Matter enough, if he but believes and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
Providence, to raise within himself a
grateful Sense of it, and humble Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for it. In this no Man's Life is so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
but that it will afford him great occasions
of Praise and Thanksgiving: for all Men
share more or less in the Watchfulness of
Providence.</p>
            <p>SOME have indeed had a larger measure of
it: happy and great Accidents, have as it were
by a Combination, led them thro' Difficulties
that seem'd insuperable, they have rescu'd them
out of Dangers, that have been of so extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
a Nature, as if They had been directed on
Design, to shew the wonderful Interpositions of
Providence, for their Preservation. Friends and
Enemies, Seasons and Winds, and Heaven and
Earth, have seem'd as it were to conspire to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65700:18"/>
their Elevation, and cross Accidents have seem'd
to be interspersed thro' their Lives, only to make
the unlookt-for happy <hi>Crisis,</hi> come with the
greater surprize upon themselves, and upon all
others, as if they were the special Favourites of
Providence, and markt out to be among the
most amazing Instances that can occur in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.
If such things have hapned to any, and
have set them as much above the rest of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
by the Distinctions of Providence, as they
are by the Elevation of their Fortunes, then
what Returns do they owe to that Goodness and
Love that has been so very bountiful to them,
in such a copious Distribution of its Favours?
What returns of Praise and Gratitude ought they
to make? How ought they to distinguish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the rest of Mankind, by their Zeal
and Activity, and by their Influence and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
to promote the Glory of that God who has
laid so much Honour on them, and to imploy
their thoughts and time chiefly in contriving and
executing the best Designs they can think of, or
that can be suggested, for the greatest Good of
Mankind; which, if they sincerely pursue, this
will be, after all, the greatest of all the Blessings
of Heaven to them; it will make them Blessings
indeed to this World, and advance them to the
highest degrees of Happiness in the next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:65700:19"/>
Here is then the design of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
chief Aim to which all the rest is directed, to
raise and perfect our Natures, to make them as
great and as pure, as wise and as good as is
possible to raise them above the Depressions
of Interest and Sense, above the Intanglements
of Appetite and Passion, above little, low, and
narrow things, to an enlargement of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
to an exaltation of their Thoughts and
Tempers, and, in a word, to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like God, that is, the perfectest kind of
Beings possible. Can a greater Thought enter
into the Mind of Man, or can he pursue a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
Design? which carries Greatness and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in very Sound of it. It is plain this must
be the greatest Design of Religion; it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
primary End of the Creation, and the chief
Business of the whole Christian Religion. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man must feel there is somewhat in the bare
Proposition of it, that strikes his Faculties,
which presently yield to it, and dispose him to
close with it.</p>
            <p>Oh happy they who do really set about, and
do sincerely prosecute it: It shews a nobleness
of Mind to be capable of so great a Thought,
which could not move an abject Soul. This is
none of those vain Speculations that set Men
on to a fantastical Pursuit of unattainable things.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65700:19"/>
The Design is solid and practicable, as well as
it is generous and great: It does not swell
the Mind with Air and Vanity, on the contrary
it seasons it with Modesty and Humility. How
difficult soever the Performance may be, there
are Aids proportioned to the Labours of it;
which will both encrease our Force, and render
all those Difficulties the more easie to us.</p>
            <p>Our sincere Endeavours will be both accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and assisted: and how small a Progress soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
we may make here, how often soever we
may be taken down from so high a Flight, and
how much soever we may feel our Bodies
and our Senses, and the necessary Commerce
that we are engaged in with sensible Objects,
depress and distract us; yet as there is a secret
Pleasure in great Undertakings, even tho' our
Success does not answer our Hopes, so we are
sure we shall master all at last, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
arrive at that State of a more perfect
Conformity, whereas our Bodies shall be made
like unto the glorified Body of the Son of God,
and shall shine as the Sun in the Kingdom of
our Father, so in our Minds we shall become
like unto God; for we shall see him as he is,
and the sight of these infinite Perfections shall
transform our Minds, into as near a Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of them, as is possible: and as in this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65700:20"/>
we shall ever feel a true Joy and real Happiness,
following us, in proportion to those Advances
we make in our Conformity to God: so when
that Conformity shall be carry'd as far as our
created and limited Capacities can go, then
we shall with it partake of a proportion'd ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Joy: as great a fulness as our Faculties
can receive: and <hi>we shall be ever with the
Lord, in those Pleasures that are for evermore.</hi>
In this our being now the <hi>followers of God</hi> will
certainly end; we who study to follow him
here, shall follow him into those Mansions of
Glory, where with Angels and Saints we shall
be unspeakably happy to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Thither God of his infinite Mercy lead us
thro' all the Changes and Chances of this
mortal Life; for the sake of Iesus Christ
our Saviour, to whom with the Father,
and the Holy Ghost, be all Honour and
Glory both now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
