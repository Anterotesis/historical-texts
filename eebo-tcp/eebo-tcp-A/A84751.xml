            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He cauſe of the calling of this Aſſembly of this Common-Hall, it was the buſineſſe of <hi>Scotland,</hi> I thinke it is not unknowne to many of you, that about two months ſince both the Houſes of Parliament did ſend a Committee into <hi>Scotland</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the aſſiſtance of our brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in this Warre: the Committee hath from thence ſent Propoſitions to both the Houſes, whereby wee ſee their willingneſſe to come to our aſſiſtance: but one part of it is, that without ſome ſupplyes of Money, they are not able at all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113607:3"/>
to come into this aſſiſtance, The Houſes conſidering the neceſſity of their comming in, and of ſpeedy ſupplyes of Money to that purpoſe, they did ſend a Committee, and did deſire that a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Councell might be called, which was done upon Munday laſt, and they did thither ſend a Committee, with deſire that the Common-Councell would take that into conſideration, that is, the neceſſity of their comming, and ſpeedy ſupplies to bee raiſed. And for the effecting of this, not having any other means ſo neare at hand as that, they did deſire that the Common-Councell would appoint a Committee out of themſelves to conſider of this buſineſſe with the Committee of the Houſe of Commons: Theſe they met, and have been together theſe two dayes conſidering of it, that is, <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday,</hi> and they did intend, and doe ſtill, to ſend to divers of thoſe that are able and rich of this City, to the intent that they might ſee, what they would lend to this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; and to tender to them ſuch ſecurity, as they conceive to be very convenient and fitting for thoſe that are willing to lend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: but when they had entred upon the buſineſſe, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſpeed, and the neceſſity that the ſupply ſhould be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they thought that would be too long a way, yet reſolved to proſecute it ſtill, but withall they did deſire, that my Lord Major would be pleaſed to call a Court of Aldermen this morning, (which hee did) and likewiſe a Common-Hall, to the intent that the neceſſity of the raiſing of this money ſpeedily might be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you, becauſe the other would be a longer way; which though it be intended ſtill to be proſecuted; yet when you are all here together, we may the better know your affections to this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and that the Money may be ſpeedily raiſed, though not the whole, yet it will be ſomewhat to the buſineſſe, if ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſumme might ſpeedily be ſent away.</p>
            <p>I conceive there is no need to acquaint you with the benefits that will redound to this kingdome, and the advantages wee ſhall have by a nearer aſſociation with them, and by their comming in, to this purpoſe for our aſſiſtance; the benefits certainly when wee conſider of them, are many. As firſt,</p>
            <p>This great cauſe which is now in agitation, that by this means will be much ſecur'd; it will bee aſſur'd to us, that the event, and the ſucceſſe of it (by Gods bleſſing) will bee made a great deale the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113607:3"/>
certainer: If they do not come in, then we are to conſider how we ſtand. Certainly, the Parties they are very equall in this buſineſſe, and where the Parties are equall, the ſucceſſe muſt needs bee dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and very uncertain. Now we all of us ſee, that all ranks and degrees of men, even from the higheſt Lords, to the meaneſt Commoners, they are engaged on both ſides; and if the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage be of either ſide, it is in the other, becauſe that the greater part of the Nobility and Gentry we know they are the other way. Likewiſe if we conſider the Citi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and Townes of this kingdom, that there is <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> that there is <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> that there is <hi>Shrewſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> that there is <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> that there is <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and that there is <hi>Exeter,</hi> and divers others Cities and great Townes in their cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
            <p>If we goe through all the Counties of the Kingdome, wee ſee there the greateſt parts of the Northerne parts poſſeſs'd wholly by the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle, Northumberland, Cumberland, Weſtmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, York-ſhire,</hi> and ſome other parts. So in the Weſt, goe to other Counties, there is a mixture in all of them, that we cannot ſay there is any part of the Kingdome free; ſo that the mixture ſeemes to be of the people likewiſe, if not the greater party the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way.</p>
            <p>If we conſider likewiſe the events and ſucceſſes; as we on the one ſide have taken <hi>Portſmouth, Chicheſter,</hi> and ſome other places, ſo they on the other ſide have taken <hi>Exeter,</hi> and <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> and other places. If we conſider the events of the Skirmiſhes, Fights, and Battailes that have been; we cannot ſay, that on any ſide hath been any compleat Victory; that at <hi>Edgehill,</hi> it pleaſed God to give us a deliverance, we finde it was no compleat Victory, by thoſe things that followed; ſo this at <hi>Newbury</hi> lately no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat victory, for had it been ſo, the Warre had been at an end, ſo that which way ſoever we looke, unleſſe wee call them in to our aſſiſtance, certainly the Parties on both ſides, are very equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; and certainly when two men of equall ſtrength doe wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, it is an even lay which of them will give the fall; as long as the ballances ſtand ſo even, it is very uncertain which way they will weigh down.</p>
            <p>We are to conſider, (that in reſpect that the danger is ſuch, and the event of the Warre ſo uncertaine, without their comming in)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113607:4"/>
what the cauſe is that is loſt, in caſe the day ſhould be theirs; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conſidering that the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi> are wholly engaged, that the Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> are wholly engaged, that the Prelates and their Party are wholly engaged, that there are divers that are Neuters, and ill-diſpoſed men, that they likewiſe encline that way: Conſidering that that Party is acted by Jeſuiticall Counſells, for certainly they are behinde the Curtaine, though they are not ſo viſible to us: I ſay, when this is conſidered, who are the Parties that ſhall get this day, it is very eaſie to prognoſticate what the loſſe will be, no leſſe then of Religion, and of our Lawes, and of our Liberties: In a word, if that that Party doe prevaile, I am affraid we have loſt all; and therefore thoſe other things, they will not be ſo conſiderable which I ſhall tell you of. Wee know the great Loanes and Contributions that have been made by the Worthy Citizens of this City, and by divers other well-affected perſons throughout the Kingdome; the Money, the Plate, the Horſes, and other things for this Warre too, they will bee loſt: but not onely ſo, but certainly, that theſe have been lent to the Parliament for the maintaining of the Warre, againſt that Party, this will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wee may adde to this the Charters and the Franchiſes of this great City, it will be eaſily foreſeen, what will be the event of that, whether they wil be continued to you, yea or no, conſidering what affection you have born to this cauſe.

For the firſt of thoſe, certainly both at home and abroad, thoſe that are averſe, they looke upon us as a Proteſtant Kingdom, but divided among our ſelves; they heare Proteſtations on both ſides, that both Parties doe proteſt to maintaine the Proteſtant Religion, the Laws of the Kingdome, and the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and they ſee and read the Declarations that goe out on both ſides, and the matter of fact being that that makes the cauſe, they know not what to believe of that; for when they read the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Declarations, they ſee that affirmed by one party, that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed of the other, ſo that indeed they know not which way to bend themſelves to beleeve, (of the matter of fact, I meane:) But now a great many after the caſe hath been ſtated, as it hath been on both ſides b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cotland</hi> hath ſent a Committee into this Kingdom, to informe themſelves of the buſineſſe how it ſtood, to the intent they might know how to carry themſelves between both Parties; I ſay, when after all this, they ſhall ſee a whole Proteſtant King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as one Man, a Proteſtant Kingdome that hath had differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces heretofore, and thoſe differences have beene ſetled, when they have beene in the ſame diſtractions as wee have, and ſo ſetled, as that it hath beene with a cleare Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their innocencies, that they had juſt cauſe to doe, what they had dont, and went away as they did, with that full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113607:5"/>
they have given to the world: I ſay, when they ſhall ſee ſuch men, as have for ſo long a time ſtood by as a third Party, and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators onely, and lookens on; when they ſhall ſee a Kingdome, that is altogether unbyaſs'd, that hath the ſame King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lives in the ſame Iſland, that hath the ſame Religion: I ſay, when they ſhall behold a whole Kingdome to declare for the one Party, that is, for our Party; when they ſhall ſee them not onely doe ſo, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a League and Covenant, and that by oath with us, for the maintaining of this Religion: when they ſhall ſee them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging their whole Kingdome as one man, in a War for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of this cauſe: I ſay, certainly that muſt bee a convincing, ſilencing argument to all theſe men, that this is the Party that doth maintain really, and in truth, the true Proteſtant Religion, the Laws of the Realme, and the Liberties of the Subject: That is for the firſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, there is another Party, that are well enough ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in their judgements, but out of feare of their eſtates, and other ſiniſter, by and baſe ends, (for ſo they may be called, for as this Covenant calls it a deteſtable Neutrality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo may wee) I ſay, when theſe Parties ſhall ſee ſuch an addition of ſtrength to the one ſide, their owne principles of feare will reach them to goe to that that is the ſtronger ſide. But admitting that men ſtood in their judgments, and in Neutrality, as they now doe, and that their comming in did not alter one man; yet we are to conſider what the ſtrength is that they doe bring in wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h them, and what that is like to doe, admitting the parties to bee as equally engaged, as now they be; and that is by their owne Propoſitions, that when they come in, they intend to come in with 18000 Foot, with 1000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dragoneers, and 2000 Horſe, with 21000 Horſe and Foot, with a Traine of Artillery proportionable and ſuitable to ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Certainly, by the bleſſing of God, ſuch a force to bee added to the one Party, that is now even, it cannot but in all likelihood cary down the ſcales, and alter the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uſineſſes, that makes oddes. If we have the addition of that whole Kingdome to this Party that is even with the other, or neare ſo, now wee may eaſily judge of the event. This is the firſt benefit I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to you, wee are like to reap by their comming in, that

            <p>The ſecond is this, which I ſhall propound to you, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it will bee for our profit, that it will eaſe the Warre, that it will make the charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the burthen of it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> equall, it muſt needes lengthen and protract the Warre; when two ſcales are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt equally ballanced, wee know for a great while it falls on the right hand, and on the left hand, and it is a great while before they ſtand ſtill; ſo that if the War bee protracted and lengthened, that will bee ſpent in time, and a great deal more, then a good round ſumme will be in making a ſudden concluſion of it; I think every Leſſee, hee had rather pay a good round Fine, than for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>inue, conſidering the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and devaſtations that goe along with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that for my own part, I think it is a very clear caſe, that wee had better buy out with a round ſumme, a ſhort War, then to have a long War con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, though it bee without any charge at all; If all our horſe and foot, and trayn of Artillery, and Garriſons, were all paid to our hand, wee had better buy a ſhort Peace, by bringing them in, than to have a long War without charge, becauſe of that ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable poverty, that a long War muſt needs bring to a Kingdom; this firſt thing that I have offered, is in point of time, the ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Warre, the Benefit and Profit that it will bee to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Wee all know this Warre hath contracted a great debt upon the Kingdom, and it will contract farre more; In caſe this ſhall bee hereafter to bee paid in ſheere Money and Coyn, I am afraid the Kingdom is not able to pay it at once, (I beleeve that all men know) Suppoſe this then ſhall bee appointed to bee paid at certain yeers and times, what will bee the event of that? I am afraid the deſtruction of the Kingdom, for then the caſe will bee thus, the greateſt part of the Lords and Gentry are ingaged in the other way, and here lies a great debt annually to bee paid by the Kingdom, and certainly this will diſaffect people to all other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, when they ſhall yeerly bee under the payments of ſuch mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eys, that the Parliament hath contracted upon them; And then conſidering who it is will operate upon the other party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there is another party that will not bee eaſily reconciled to the party that hath been on the other ſide, and ſo this other party
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113607:6"/>
ſtriking in the other way, what this is like to produce, is very dangerous to mee; whereas on the other ſide, as long as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are equally engaged, as wee are, without their comming, I am afraid there will not bee that force on the one ſide, as to make the other ſide, (that is, the Papiſts, and the Prelates, and the other Malignants) out of their eſtates to pay theſe debts, which their comming in, in all likelihood will make us doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which if theſe debts bee paid out of their eſtates and Lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience will come to the Kingdom by it; for here is the caſe, they that have it now in their hands, to imploy i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113607:8"/>
my Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> (I may name him here) at a Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, he did declare to my Lord Major and Aldermen, that their Houſe would in few dayes likewiſe take it; this Covenant ſhews their willingneſſe (in the firſt place) for wee by that are bound to the mutuall defence of our Religion, and preſervation of our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Liberties, for by that we are bound to the preſervation of the Liberties of Parliaments; and that Delinquents and Malignants may be brought to their juſt triall; ſo this is already done.</p>
            <p>It was likewiſe declared by the Commiſſioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they did not doubt, but by this time they were taking it in that Kingdome; and their Commiſſioners here they have taken it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; ſo that they have joyned themſelves to us by oath, for the mutuall preſervation of Religion and Lawes.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, they have ſhewed their conſent by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions they have ſent to us, which are the termes upon which they are to come in; they have not ſtayed here but they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to action; they have named the Generall of their Army, which is my Lord Generall <hi>Leſley,</hi> which was their Generall when they came into this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe they have granted Commiſſions into all the Shires of <hi>Scotland</hi> for the raiſing of Horſe and Foot, and named their Colonells, Captaines, and other Officers, and liſted them. There is a further progreſſe likewiſe, that is, that we have taken <hi>Berwicke</hi> already, for the facilitating of their comming in, which may bee a place of retreat for them, and a Magazine for their Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Victualls. And ſince this hath been taken by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they have ſent ſome Troops of Horſe, and certain Foot for the ſecuring of that Town: and if they had before knowne the conſent of the Parliament for their having the uſe of <hi>Berwicke,</hi> they had put in their Ammunition and Victuall before this time into <hi>Berwicke,</hi> which before this time ſurely they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113607:8"/>
reliefe it will be to this City in the point of Coales, and other Trade, you may eaſily ſee: Moſt of this to the Common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was declared by two Worthy Commiſſioners that were ſent out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> my Lord <hi>Mackland,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henderſon.</hi> But it may be ſaid, if they be ſo willing, and ſo ready to come, and have all things ready, what is the reaſon wee heare not of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Kingdome? They have anſwered us by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that it is impoſſible for them to doe it, without ſome ſum of Money: and that this is no pretence, but that it is really ſo, we have it from our owne Committee there, wee have it from all hands there: and if we conſider how they have been exhauſted heretofore, I thinke we may eaſily believe it our ſelves: and that their Army that is in <hi>Ireland</hi> have been 14 moneths without any pay at all, they are ſaine to ſupply them with neceſſities, which hath been foure ſcore thouſand pound, elſe that Army muſt have ſtarved. We know they had two years Warre, we promiſed them a brotherly aſſiſtance, and there is an act for it, but it is knowne by reaſon of the troubles we have here at home, we have not paid them that; ſo that conſidering the poverty of that Kingdome (without offence I thinke we may ſay ſo) I ſay, conſidering the poverty of that Kingdome, it is certaine, it is not a pretence of theirs, but it is really ſo. Neither indeed can we preſume it, when as the Covenant and Oath they take, binde them as well as us, that they ſhould come to our aſſiſtance; it binds them as much to our aſſiſtance, as that Oath binde our ſelves to our owne aſſiſtance, and therefore wee cannot preſume, that they would (being diſ-inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of an Oath, afterward) be willing to take that Oath, unleſſe they did likewiſe know their owne neceſſity, that they could not come in without ſome ſumme of Money; and truly I ſuppoſe that they cannot come in without Money, (as hath been declared to you) and that we muſt ground upon and build upon, for wee are aſſured it on all hands.</p>
            <p>It will be then ſaid, what is that ſumme? Why truly the ſumme that they have ſent in their Propoſitions, is 100000 <hi>l.</hi> I confeſſe a great ſumm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and that that I know not how to mention in this Aſſembly, conſidering how this City hath been exhauſted former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe great Contribution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and by thoſe aides that they have given in this caſe. But on the other ſide, though I cannot indeed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113607:9"/>
tell how, when I conſider the ſumto preſſe it: yet when I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the inevitable danger that follows, and the great advantages that we loſe by every dayes delay in it. I ſay, when I conſider them, I cannot on the other ſide but preſſe it. Let us therefore conſider, in caſe this bee not within ſome convenient time raiſed, what an infinite diſadvantage comes by it to us.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, all thoſe preparations they will bee in a manner loſt, if that it be not preſently raiſed, there will be no comming in this Winter, if there be no comming in this Winter, no gaining of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> if no gaining of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> no Coales, nor materials for Fewell. Nay, that is not all, but if they doe not come in now, and if wee doe not provide this Money, I ſhall deſpaire of their comming in at all, and that upon this ground, that if wee bee not able now to raiſe the ſumme of Money, the continuance of this Warre, it will more and more every day, and that ſenſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſ-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to doe it at another time. If we cannot doe it now, wee ſhall be leſſe able to doe it, a weeke, a moneth, a quarter of a yeare hence; for the Warre you ſee deſtroyes all Trade, (that hath been opened to you before) wee ſhall grow poorer, our Enemies ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; if we be not able to bring them in now, we ſhall never bee able to bring them in at all.</p>
            <p>It will be deſired, if it bee poſſible to raiſe this great ſumme of Money, what is the ſecurity ſhall be given? for truly it was never deſired of this city, that ſo much mony ſhould be given to them, but it is deſired it ſhould be onely lent, for if they come not in in time, the buſineſſe is as good as loſt: they have therefore (conſidering this) already engaged the Publike Faith of that Kingdome, with the Publike faith of this Kingdome, for the raiſing of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> either by borrowing of it here, or in Forain parts. Therefore this is the firſt Security that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>endered to you now, that money is a borrowing in Parts beyond the Sea; that Mony that is ſo bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, ſhall goe on towards the repayment of this, what ever it is that ſhall be lent. But beſides this Publike Faith, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wayes viſible how this Publike Faith will bee diſ-engaged, that is, by the Sequeſtrations, for there is an Ordinance of both Houſes for 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to be raiſed for them out of the Sequeſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now this ſhall not need to diſcourage any that ſo little hath bin raiſed out of the Sequeſtrations hitherto, for the Houſes have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113607:9"/>
been preparing the buſineſſes a great while, and now <hi>Michaelmas</hi> is come, all the Rents are ready, within few weeks to bring it in; that is for ſo much.</p>
            <p>Their comming in, it gaines <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> the gaining of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> gaines a great maſſe of Coales that are there ready already, when they come in; and out of that there will bee likewiſe an Annuall or a Monethly payment of the Coales, for the diſ-engaging of thoſe that ſhall lend this ſumme. Beſides, when they come in, if they cleare thoſe Countrys, wee know how full of Papiſts, &amp; how full of Prelates, thoſe Northern Countreys are, as <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> but eſpecially the whole Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> a whole County, <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, Cumberland,</hi> &amp;c. full of Papists, full of thoſe of the Prelaticall party, full of Malignants, when they come in, thoſe parts are cleared, they will be free for three whole moneths, and ten dayes, for the diſ-engaging of this, (which I forgot to tell you before what the <hi>Scots</hi> are to doe for this 100000 <hi>l.)</hi> for they are to bring in their Traine of Artillery, their 21000 Horſe and Foot, they are to continue three moneths and ten dayes in your Service, after they come into your Kingdome, after the payment of this 100000 <hi>l.</hi> ſo that there is full three moneths and ten dayes for theſe Counties to lie open to the repayment of this Mony; for thoſe three moneths they are to be without pay.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principall things, that wee have yet thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the diſ-ingaging of us, that wee tender to you; there are divers others, which the Committee hath taken into conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they ſee as much or more certainty in, than in any of theſe that hath been propounded; If it were no more than the Publique Faith of both Kingdoms, as long as the Kingdoms ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, or the Cauſe thrives in the hands of one or other, this muſt bee diſ-ingaged, ſo that at beſt it is but a Loan, and muſt bee paid if the Cauſe ſurvive, truely, if it doe not ſurvive, it being our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I know not what reaſon wee have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> deſire to ſurvive it, and if wee loſe it, I am ſure wee loſe all.</p>
            <p>Truly Gentlemen, thus, I have but one word more to ſay; The Cauſe it is Gods, if it bee not ſo, let us repent that ever wee med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it; It is the Cauſe of our Countrey, if it bee not ſo, let us now ſay, wee repent, and leave it; It is the Cauſe of theſe three Kingdomes, <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> it is the Cauſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113607:10"/>
for if this Cauſe be carryed againſt us, certainly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cauſe throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> will fare the worſe for it: this is the Cauſe, &amp; this we all know to be the Cauſe. It hath pleaſed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God out of his Providence to call even us poor creatures, to be the managers of this great cauſe of his, we have undertaken it, we have formerly by our Proteſtations engaged our ſelves to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it, wee have all of us, both Parliament, City, and all well-affected Subjects, of this Kingdom, wee have put our ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to it, wee have of late manifeſted to God and all the world, that wee doe not repent of what wee have done, wee have entred into a Solemn League and Covenant; I think the ſolemneſt that ever was ſeen in this Kingdom, Gentlemen thus, let our cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this ſervice ſhew, that wee have taken that Covenant, and doe affect this buſineſſe, with our whole hearts; I have done, <hi>Pray God give his bleſſing.</hi>

            <p>YOU have heard a worthy Gentleman of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, it is deſired by this grave and Reverend Aſſembly of Miniſters, that three of the Miniſters of this Aſſembly, ſhould likewiſe ſpeak unto you concerning this great buſineſſe, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my indiſpoſition of body, being required by them, though that Gentleman of the Houſe of Commons hath ſpoken ſo abundantly to the purpoſe, yet notwithſtanding I am here come to ſpeak ſomething, the rather to declare my willingneſſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this Cauſe, that is every way ſo juſt, and every way ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and ſo good, that I may truly ſay, as the Martyr did, that if I had as many lives, as I have haires on my head, I would bee willing to ſacrifice all theſe lives in this Cauſe; You know the ſtory of <hi>Craeſus,</hi> that though hee never ſpake in his life, yet when hee ſaw his Father ready to bee killed, it untyed the ſtrings of his tongue, and then hee cryed out, that they would not kill his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; you are not ignorant that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> lye a dying,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113607:10"/>
and though I never appeared in this place, yet I bleſſe God that hath given mee that health, this day, to ſpeak ſomething in this Cauſe, for the reviving of the dying condition of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> It is ſuch a Cauſe as is able to make a very Infant elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and a dumb man to ſpeak that never ſpake in all his life; The matter I am deſired to ſpeak to, is, concerning the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, to perſwade you to bee liberall towards the bringing in of the <hi>Scots,</hi> to help us in this our great neceſſity; The truth is, it is a great ſhame that <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſtand in need of another Nation, to help it to preſerve its Religion and Liberties: That <hi>England,</hi> that hath been enriched with the Goſpel of Peace, and the peace of the Goſpel for ſo many yeers, that <hi>England,</hi> that hath been bleſſed with ſo many rare Miniſters of God, ſo many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and powerfull ſervants, that have preached the Word of God in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; that <hi>England,</hi> that hath profeſſed the Goſpel with ſo much power and purity; that <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſtand in need, of the help of their Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for to preſerve that Goſpel that they have profeſſed ſo many yeers; I confeſſe to mee it ſeems a very ſtrange Prodigie, and a ſtrange wonder; but it hath pleaſed Almighty God for the ſins of <hi>England,</hi> for our great unthankfulneſſe, and for our unthankfulneſſe under theſe means, and for the great blood-guiltineſſe, and Idolatry, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of this Nation, it hath pleaſed God to ſuffer a great part of the Kingdom, to bee blinded, eſpecially thoſe parts, where the Word of God hath not been preached in a powerfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and there are many in the Kingdom, that will not bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that there is an intention to bring in Popery, and to bring in Slavery; Many of them (I ſay) think that though the Popiſh Army ſhould prevaile, and the plundering Army ſhould prevaile, yet they think all would goe well with Religion, and with their Liberties; I ſay, it hath pleaſed God to ſuffer abundance in the Kingdom, to bee blinded with this opinion, out of a juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to puniſh us for our unthankfulneſſe, and for our ingratitude; and this is the reaſon that ſo many men ſtand Neuters, and that ſo many are Malignants, and diſaffected to this great Cauſe, in ſo much that I am concluded under this, that there is little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability to finiſh this Cauſe, without the comming in of the <hi>Scots</hi> (as you heard ſo worthily by that Member of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113607:11"/>
The ſons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> are grown ſo ſtrong, what through our fearfulneſſe, what through our covetouſneſſe, what through our malignity, that there is little hope (I ſay) to finiſh this great Cauſe, or to bring it to a deſired peace, without the help of another Nation, and by the aſſiſtance of God, by the help of another Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it may be done; Theſe are two mighty, two omnipotent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to prevaile with you to contribute your utmoſt aide and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to that Cauſe; ſince it cannot ſpeedily bee done without their help, &amp; by Gods bleſſing, it may ſpeedily be don by their help.</p>
            <p>What would the Kings party doe, if they could engage another Nation to their help? 21000. if they could engage them to our ruine; what would they not doe? How much more ſhould wee be willing to contribute our greateſt help to engage a Nation, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is part of our own Nation, within the ſame Iſland, and our Brethren, ſo faithfull, and ſo well affected to this Cauſe, what ſhould wee not bee willing to doe to ingage ſo great a party? I would intreat you to remember, that it is not many yeers agoe, ſince our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> came hither into <hi>England,</hi> in a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like manner, and yet with peaceable affections, and that you would reminde your ſelves, what good they did to you, when they were then in <hi>England,</hi> they were the chiefe Cauſes of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that now wee doe enjoy, and of all the good that hath been reaped by this Parliament; (as you may well remember) By their comming in you know this Parliament was procured, and their ſecond comming in (through Gods mercy) may bee a means to confirm this Parliament, and to eſtabliſh it, and to uphold it in its dignity, and in the priviledges of it, and to keep it from being ruined; and if the Parliament bee ruined, you all well know that our Religion, and our Liberties are ruined, for the Parliament is the great Conſervatour of Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and I may truly ſay, as you know <hi>Caligula</hi> did once wiſh, that all <hi>Rome</hi> were one neck that hee might cut it off at one blow; They that intend to ruine the Parliament, they ruine your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Liberties, &amp; all <hi>England</hi> at one blow; Now (I ſay) as their firſt comming was a meanes to produce this Parliament, ſo their ſecond comming in (through Gods bleſſing) may bee a means to eſtabliſh it, and to confirme it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when they were here, you know how faithfully they carryed themſelves, and when they had

done their work, how willingly they went away without doing any hurt, and I doubt not of the ſame faithfullneſſe, nay, you ought all to beleeve, that they will likewiſe, when they have done the worke they are called too in <hi>England,</hi> they will likewiſe with the ſame faithfullneſſe depart, for it is Religion that brings them here, and the ſame Religion will make them willingly leave us, and goe home to their owne Countrey, when they have done that worke for which they came. I am aſſured that the great hope at <hi>Oxford</hi> is, that they will never prevaile for the petting of Money for to bring them in; and if they once ſee the matter of Money effected, and if they once heare of the Scots comming in, it will worke ſuch a terrour there, as I am aſſured, that it will (through Gods mercy) produce a notable complyance of that Party with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for an effectuall peace, ſuch as all the godly of the Land ſhall bleſſe God for.</p>
            <p>I foreſee there are many Objections that may be brought to hinder this worke, many mountaines of oppoſition that will lye in the way: And likewiſe that the Malignants will bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> many things in your eares, if it be poſſible to put ſome great rub in the way, to hinder the effecting of this work, but I hope, the love you have to God, and to your Religion, and to the Goſpel, and to yours wives and children, will ſwallow down all theſe objections, and conquer them all; Ile name ſome few objections, and give you ſome ſhort anſwer.</p>
            <p>Some it may bee, will put you in minde, to call in queſtion the lawfulneſſe of contributing towards the bringing in of the <hi>Scots</hi> to this Nation; But for this, Ile give you an eaſie anſwer, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Gentlemen, it is as lawfull for the Parliament to call in our brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> to their help, as it is lawfull for mee, when my houſe is on fire, and not able to quench it my ſelf, to call in my neighbour to quench my houſe, that is ready to burn down; The Kingdom is all on fire, wee are not able with that ſpeed to quench it, as wee wiſh, wee call in our brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi> to help us to quench the flames that are kindled among us; It is as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as it is for the Maſter and Marriners of a Ship, when it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſink through a mighty Tempeſt, to call in other Marriners to help to keep the Ship from ſinking; It is the condition of our Kingdom now, it is ready to ſink, and it is our deſire that our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113607:12"/>
brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> would come in to our aide, to keep it from ſinking.</p>
            <p>Others it may be will object and ſay to you, it is rebellion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to call in another Nation to your helpe. But I beſeech you give me leave to put you in minde, that when the <hi>Scots</hi> came laſt into <hi>England,</hi> there was a Proclamation out againſt them, wherein they were called Rebels, and there were prayers to bee ſaid in our Churches (as you well remember) in which we were to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them as Rebells, and there was Money likewiſe contributed then, for to hinder their comming in, and to raiſe an Army to drive them out of the Kingdome, and I doubt not but you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, all the ill-affected did contribute Mony to keep them out of this Kingdom, and from tarrying in; but it pleaſed Almighty God through his great mercy, ſo to change and alter the ſtate of things, that within a little while, the Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> even by Act of Parliament, they were proclaimed and made the true and loyall Subjects of the King, and in thoſe Churches in which they were prayed againſt as Rebells, even in thoſe very Churches, they were pronounced the good Subjects of the King; this I doubt not but you remember, &amp; I doubt not, but through the mercy of God, the Lord raiſing up our hearts, I doubt not but the ſame effect, will come of their ſecond comming into this Kingdom; and they that now tell you they are Rebels, and you do an act of Rebellion, in the contribution to the bringing of them in. I doubt not but you ſhall ſee an Act of Parliament to call them his Loyall Subjects, (wherein I hope our King will concurre with his Parliament) and likewiſe Prayers made; nay, a day of thankſgiving, as was after their firſt comming, a day of Thankſgiving for the mercy of God, in ſtirring up their hearts to be willing to come unto our help.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſome others will object and ſay, why ſhould we that are Miniſters, engage our ſelves ſo much in this buſineſſe? to ſee a Reverend Aſſembly of grave Miniſters to appeare here in ſo great an Aſſembly. This it may be, will bee a mighty objection to ſome, but I beſeech you give me leave to give you a ſhort anſwer did I not think that that that ſhal be ſaid this day, would mightily conduce to peace, for my part, I would not have been the month of the Aſſembly; did I thinke any other way to produce a ſolid and a ſetled peace, a Religious peace. I that am a Miniſter of peace,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113607:12"/>
an Ambaſſador of peace; I would not have been a Trumpeter to this buſineſſe this day: the truth is, if you would have peace with Popery, a Peace with ſlavery; if you would have a <hi>Judas</hi> peace, or a <hi>Joab</hi> his peace, you know the Story, he kiſs'd <hi>Amaſa,</hi> and then killed him; if you would have a peace that may bring a maſſacre with it, a French peace, if you would have ſuch a peace, it may be had eaſily; but if you would have a peace that may continue the Goſpel among you, and may bring in a Reformation, ſuch as all the godly in the Kingdome doe deſire, I am concluded under this, and am confident that ſuch a peace cannot bee had without contribution towards the bringing in of the Scots, and that is the reaſon for the promoting of this peace, this bleſſed peace, that we have appeared here this day: and me thinks (Gentlemen) the very ſight of theſe worthy Divines, me thinkes ſo many Divines, ſo many Orators, ſo many ſilent Orators to plead with you, to bee willing to engage your ſelves to the utmoſt to help forward the Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> to come to our help. And likewiſe I would put you in mind of the 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Numbers,</hi> there you ſhal read that there were two ſilver Trumpets; and as there were Prieſts appointed for the convocation of their Aſſemblies, ſo there were Prieſts to ſound the ſilver Trumpets to proclaime the Warre. And likewiſe in the 20. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> you ſhall finde there, that when the children of Iſrael would goe out to Warre, the ſonnes of <hi>Levi,</hi> one of the Prieſts, was to make a ſpeech to encourage them. And certainly, if this were the way of God in the Old Teſtament, certainly much more in ſuch a Cauſe as this, in which Cauſe Religion is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twin'd, and indeed ſo interlac'd, that Religion and this Cauſe, they are like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his twins, they muſt live and die together. And (Gentlemen) if Religion were not concerned in this Cauſe, and mightily concerned; and if Religion did not live and die with it, we had not appeared this day; And I hope this will be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent anſwer unto this Objection.</p>
            <p>But there is another Objection which I will anſwer, and then briefly give leave to my other Reverend Brethren, that likewiſe are prepared to ſpeake here. The great Objection of all is this, that the City is already exhauſted, and ſo much Money hath been lent already, that there is no hope of lending any more; this is the grand Objection, But truly (Gentlemen) for my part, this is one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113607:13"/>
of the chiefe Arguments I have to perſwade you to lend a little more, becauſe you have lent ſo much: give me leave to put you in minde of that Story, in the 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. the Story of King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> that came to viſit the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when he was ready to breath out his laſt, the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> gives him a bow and arrows, and bids him ſhoot, hee ſhootes, and bids him ſmite, hee ſmites the ground thrice, and then he ceaſed, the Prophet was exceeding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him, and tells him, you ſhould have ſmote the ground 5 or 6 times, and then you ſhould have utterly conſumed the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> whereas now you ſhall ſmite them but three times. Give me leave to apply this, Gentlemen, you have ſmote the ground thrice, you have lent once, twice, and thrice, indeed you have been the fame of <hi>England,</hi> and the Repairers of <hi>England,</hi> and the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>England,</hi> you have lent much, but let mee tell you, you muſt ſmite the ground 5 or 6 times, if ever you look to conſume the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> if ever you look to bring this Warre to a happy Peace, that your poſterities may rejoyce in this Peace, you muſt ſhoot one arrow more, and then through Gods bleſſing, you may utterly conſume theſe Enemies, that you and your poſterity may rejoyce in a happy peace; It is a famous ſtory of <hi>Johannes Eleemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zinarius,</hi> that when hee had given even almoſt all hee had to the poore, his friends were exceeding angry with him, and told him hee had undone himſelf, what was his anſwer? O (ſaith hee) I have not yet ſhed my blood for Jeſus Chriſt; Jeſus Chriſt hee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied himſelf of his Divinity, to make us rich, hee became poore, and ſhed his blood for you; You have not yet made your ſelves ſo poore as Jeſus Chriſt was, that had no houſe to lodge in, and he did all this for your ſakes; You have not yet ſhed your blood for the Cauſe of Chriſt; Wee read that <hi>Moſes</hi> was willing to bee blotted out of the book of life, for the Cauſe of God; and wee read of <hi>Paul,</hi> that hee was willing to bee accurſed, for the people of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſake; And will you not bee willing to venture your earthly proviſions for ſo good a Cauſe as this is, which (I ſay) <hi>England</hi> was never engaged in the like.</p>

            <p>PRovidence hath caſt this Aſſembly, met for ſuch a weighty occaſion (as indeed it is the weightieſt, that hath concerned <hi>England</hi> in our age) to bee late, and ſo perhaps weariſome to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, but you may well bee content to ſtay a while, although you ſhould bee deprived of a great part of your ſleep this night, if this Evenings buſineſſe may have the hoped ſucceſſe of it, it may make you ſleep quietly and ſecurely many nights after. Things of preſent and abſolute neceſſity, call for action, not deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this work that you have been called unto, is ſuch, as you muſt leave objecting againſt it, and rather fall a bleſſing God, that you may bee uſed in it; In the 1 of <hi>Chronicles</hi> 22. 14. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and the people had come and offered of their eſtates freely, and bountifully; <hi>David</hi> hee humbles himſelf then, Who am I? and who are wee? It were happy if you come all with ſuch an humble frame of ſpirit, to admire that God preſerves your lives, and calls you at this time to ſuch a work, ſo concerning his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the good of three Kingdoms, yea of the Chriſtian world; If ever you that have eſtates had cauſe to rejoyce in them, then now when God preſents ſuch a large opportunity for his ſervice as hee loth; and wherein conſills mans happineſſe, but in being ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in his generation?

our ſelves ſafe, and quiet, keep our eſtates, take heed of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too farre, wee know not which ſide may prevaile; this is an argument of a vile and a ſordid ſpirit; let ſuch a mans name bee writen in the earth; Unworthy is ſuch a man to live in ſuch a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration as this, in which God is doing ſuch great things, as might enliven the deadeſt heart, quicken the dulleſt ſpirit, raiſe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt, and inlarge the ſtraiteſt ſpirit living upon the earth; In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times indeed there was leſſe charge called for, there was leſſe trouble, but there was leſſe ſervice too, and what doe you think to bee the meaſure of a mans happineſſe, either little trouble, or much ſervice? A gratious heart thinks it as great a mercy to lay out for God, as to receive from God; God in theſe our dayes is riſen on high in his adminiſtrations, and our hearts ſhould riſe together with him; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 105. 4, 5.

            <p>God can doe his work without you, and doe it certainly hee will, howſoever, but ſeeing hee is now laying a foundation of the moſt glorious building, that it is like ever hath been in this world, if hee ſhall bee pleaſed to call you to bee helpfull in it, it will bee Gods mercy, and your glory; Were it that this one principle were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the hearts of people, that to doe publique ſervice, it is not onely a duty, but a dignity, how ready, how abundant then would men bee in the Work of the Lord? There hath lately been the moſt bleſſed union of two Nations, as ever was in the world, lifting up their hands to the high God, ſwearing that they will amend their wayes, and ſeek to reform themſelves according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Word, let us now reach forth our hands and hearts, unto our brethren in <hi>Scotland,</hi> let us come up fully unto this our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and rejoyce in it, for certainly that Nation is a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God doth love, a Nation that God doth honour, and by thoſe many expreſſions of his love, ſhewed that hee doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make them ſpeciall inſtruments of the great things he hath

            <p>A Nation it is that hath engaged it ſelf to God in a higher way, in a more extraordinary way, than any Nation this day upon the face of the earth hath done; in the moſt ſolemn way Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the eternall God, powring forth their prayers, and their tears for joy, together with their Covenanting; A Nation that hath reformed their lives for ſo ſmall a time more than ever any people that wee know of in the world have done, and a people that have riſen up againſt Antichriſt more in another way, than ever people have done, and that is the great Work of God in theſe times, and therefore God certainly hath a love unto them, becauſe they breake the ice, and begin the work, and ariſe in ſuch a way as they doe for the pulling down of that man of ſin. A Nation that God hath honoured by giving as glorious ſucceſſe unto, as ever he did unto any; whoſe low and meane beginnings hee hath raiſed to as great a height, as ever low beginnings in any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey were: How hath God diſſipated and biaſted the Counſells of their adverſaries? how hath he diſcovered all their Treacheries? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be in themſelves (comparatively at leaſt) a poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of little ſtrength, (as the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was) yet they have kept the word of Gods patience, and God hath kept them in the houre of temptation; God therefore is with them: (How happy ſhould we bee, if we may have them in a neare union with us?) And a people that have carryed themſelves with as great honour and faithfulneſſe, with as great wiſdome and order in the moſt difficult worke that ever a people did undertake, in thoſe by and intricate paths that were before uncrodden.

Was there ever ſuch an example ſince the world began, of a people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of a poorer Countrey, into a fat and richer Countrey, and having thoſe opportunities that they had to enrich themſelves to goe away ſo as they did? (their greateſt enemies they now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at them.) A people they are that began to riſe for their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when the generality of this people here, were ready baſely to bow down their backs, and put their necks under the yoke: and had it not been that they had been willing to have endured the brunt, we had all been ſlaves (it is like) at this day. A people that are exceeding ſenſible of our condition, witneſſe that when our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Reverend Aſſembly came unto them, they received them with teares, and much meltings of ſpirit, in their Generall Kirke Aſſembly; witneſſe their readineſſe and willingneſſe to come now, though in winter ſeaſon, in times that wee dare not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture our ſelves abroad; witneſſe the temptations that they have had unto the contrary, and yet carryed through all.</p>

A Nation it is that wee are engaged unto likewiſe, that that now is deſired of you, is no more indeed then is their due, it is due already to them, but they deſire it not in that way. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall ſuch an opportunity as this is be loſt for want of Money? God forbid; ſhall a people to whom God hath given ſuch teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his acceptance, be rejected by us, when they would come in and help us? Their Liberties are ſetled, why they, though on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> they are not therein ſatisfied, to ſit ſtill, but are willing to come themſelves, and come into the brunt, and hazard themſelves, for the ſetling of their brethren in the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Lord likewiſe.</p>

There is no City in the world, that hath ſuch a cloud of incenſe of prayers goe daily up to heaven (I verily believe) as doth from this City. Yea, put all the Cities of the earth together, I ſcarce thinke that God is ſo much honoured in family duties in them all together, as he is in this place. A City that hath had the powerfull preaching of the Goſpel, beyond all Cities upon the face of the earth; and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of it receiving more encouragement here, then they have done in any other parts of the world. A City that hath more of the power and life of godlineſſe, then any place yet upon the face of the earth; ſurely God intendeth good to this City, and doth likewiſe delight in it, and he hath great things for this City to do, and great mercy to beſtow upon them.</p>

Never did the Lord ſtir up ſo many young ones, as he hath done in this city at this time, that promiſes great mercy, that ſpeaks aloud to us, that God intendeth to do great things by them. Never was there ſo many godly ones, or more, (to ſpeak with modeſty) together in place of power in this City, then there is at

And now ſhall this City withdraw themſelves from ſuch a noble and great work of God, as they are called unto at this time, and let it fall becauſe of them? for it is in your power, either to raiſe it, or to let it fall, (that is the Engliſh of it) it is in your power now, either to ſave us, or to undoe us, and ſhall this be let fall now out of love of Mony? ſhall I ſay, Let the Mony of thoſe men periſh with them? No, I came not hither to threaten, but to perſwade; conſider that the mercies that you have from Chriſt, coſt Chriſt more then money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they coſt Chriſt his deare heart bloud: Who is it that raiſed your eſtates more then others? have not many of you come hither low, as <hi>Jacob,</hi> with your ſtaffe to this City, and now behold theſe bands, this eſtate? who knows but that you are raiſed for ſuch a time as this? Have not you engaged your ſelves many times in prayer to God, when firſt you entred into Covenant to God, did not you give up all your eſtate then to God, to bee employed in his Service, God cals for his due at this time from you? Oftentimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſick beds, and death beds (in your apprehenſion of death, that they would have been death beds) you have then given up all again to God, and vowed that if God did raiſe you up, you would live to his ſervice, you would employ your ſtrength in his Service.

               </gap> we have heard of it; That what warrant have wee to take up Armes to maintain Religion? that is not at preſent to bee diſcuſſed, but only this, to ſatisfie and ſtop all their mouths with one word:</p>
            <p>Thus farre none can deny it, but it is lawfull to take up armes, to maintain that civill right wee have to our Religion, and this wee doe; For wee have not onely a right to our Religion, by the Law of God, but wee have a Civill right to this our Religion, that other Chriſtians have not had, and therefore there can bee no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this, to retard you in ſuch a work as this, you have done much, but a gratious heart will ever think what hee hath done for God, it is but poore and low; That example is famous of <hi>David,</hi> that had done ſo much for preparing the Temple of God, in the 1 of <hi>Chronicles</hi> 22. 14. It was 1000000 talents of ſilver, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113607:19"/>
1000 talents of gold; which ſome compute a matter of 33 Cart loads of ſilver, allowing 20000 <hi>li.</hi> to every Cart load, and 70 mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of <hi>French</hi> Crowns of gold, this <hi>David</hi> had done preparing but for the houſe of the Lord, and yet hee ſaith that out of his poverty hee had done all this; all this was but a poor and low thing for him to doe in compariſon of the great God; why, have you done more then this? therefore ſeeing it is for the high God, you have done it, look upon what you have done, but as low, and ſtill goe on in the work of the Lord; You have done much, and ſo have the adverſaries too; Wee would have you to weigh this, that the adverſary hath been at as much charge, as you have been, as bountifull and free as you have been; in the 46 of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 6. Wee read that the Idolaters did laviſh out their gold upon their Idols, yea, they laviſhed their gold out of their bagges: Certainly, our adverſary hath felt the burthen of this, and hath been at the charge of it, as much as you; You have done much, but yet you have not gone in a good work ſo farre as a <hi>Herod</hi> hath done; <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his 15 Book of <hi>Antiquities,</hi> and about the 12 Chapter, tells us of <hi>Herod</hi> the King, that in the time of ſcarcity, hee ſold away all his moveables, all the plate that was ſerved to his table, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed corn from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and bought it for the poor, and cloathed them, yea, and gave ſeed corn to the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> his neighbours; Why now, in this our Kingdom, wee may ſee much Plate ſtill at many Noble mens tables; yea, at many Gentlemens tables, a great deal of Plate reſerved, they have not ſold all their moveables, and Plate to give away; it is but a proportion of their eſtates, and but to lend upon ſo good ſecurity.</p>
            <p>And take this one conſideration further, your having done much, is a mighty preparation, to make your doing now to bee formidable to your adverſaries; for what is the hope of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary? but that you are drawn dry; They triumph in this, and they tell the world, that there muſt bee ſuch petty wayes, to ſeek to the City, to get petty ſummes of money, and all is even gone, and therefore wee ſhall have them to bee a prey ere long; but when they ſhall ſee, that after ſo much hath been expended here, that you have ſuch free ſpirits, and to come out ſtill abundantly with further treaſure, this will more daunt their hearts; this 100000 <hi>li.</hi> will daunt their hearts more than 2000000 <hi>li.</hi> before hath done; If you ſay, why doe wee doe all?

the ſpeciall honour, yet the Countrey will bee required for a great part beſides; but the Lords work now to bee done, it muſt bee done eſpecially by his ſervants; and wee know in <hi>Ezra,</hi> when as the adverſaries of <hi>Judah</hi> would have come and helped in the work, they would not ſuffer them to come and help in the work; I ſay not, wee ſhould doe ſo; but onely to ſatisfie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it is true, wee are in a wilderneſſe, but wee know God hath brought us into the wilderneſſe, and hee will ſpeak comfortably to us in it; and let us not bee afraid of difficulties, leſt wee bee deprived of that good Land that God is bringing us into; and little cauſe have wee to bee diſcouraged, for thoſe wee have to deal with, their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are baſe and vile; why ſhould wee fear thoſe uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtines?</hi>

            <p>And wee ſee God hath been with us, in every thing that wee have undertaken; Wee have never ſhown our ſelves like men, but God hath ſhown himſelf to be like a God for us. If you ſay, Well, but were it not better wee bent all our forces to ſome Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? To that wee anſwer you thus: You have to deal not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his Majeſty, but with a Popiſh party that are about him, and what ſecurity you can ever have of your peace, (as was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily ſaid before) except the Scottiſh Nation comes in for to faſten it, it is eaſie for any one to judge. I will tell you but one ſtory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that, and becauſe it is ſuitable unto you, I will therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it here: It is a Story that I finde in the Chronicles, that in the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fixt, King <hi>Edward</hi> ſends to this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for aſſiſtance againſt the Lords, and the Lords ſend to the City for their aſſiſtance likewiſe, againſt the Protectour, the Earl of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet;</hi> and the Common Councell was called, (I ſuppoſe in this place,) and there ſtands up, as the ſtory ſaith, a wiſe diſcreet Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, in the Common Councell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and makes this ſpeech unto them; Firſt, hee acknowledges that the cauſe was right for the Lords, for the Kingdom, though it were againſt the will of the King, becauſe the King would not then put in execution thoſe Laws that ſhould bee, but hindered them, but yet (ſaith hee) let mee reminde you of that that I have read in <hi>Fabians</hi> Chronicle, (it was one <hi>George Stadley</hi> that ſtood up, let mee reminde you of that) when there was a fight between the Lords and the King, the Lords ſend for aſſiſtance to the City, the City granted their aſſiſtance, the Lords prevailed, the King was taken, and his Son a Priſoner; afterwards they were both releaſed upon Compoſition, and amongſt other things, this was one, that howſoever the City ſhould bee preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the City ſhould ſuffer nothing for what they had done; and this Compoſition was confirmed by Act of Parliament, but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113607:20"/>
(ſaith this Citizen) what came of it? did the King forgive? No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor forget, for afterwards all our Liberties were taken away, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were ſet over us, for our Heads and Governours; the bodies and the eſtates of the Citizens were given away, and one miſery followed after another; and ſo wee were moſt miſerably perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and here was their Accommodation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore then (to cloſe all) you have heard before, that wee come not onely to perſwade you, but to ingage our ſelves as well as to perſwade you, and to doe that, that wee would have you doe: For our parts, as wee have in ſome proportionable manner done it already, ſo wee are ready to doe it further, and it beſeemes us well to doe it; Wee read in the 3 of <hi>Nebemiah,</hi> that the firſt that did help to repair the City, it was the Prieſts of the City, and about the middle of the City, the Prieſts of the Plain; I ſuppoſe it is meant, the City Miniſters, and the Countrey Miniſters, and you ſhall finde in that Chapter, ſeverall ſorts of people were there, there were the Rulers these ſpecially mentioned; I ſuppoſe their chief Rulers, as their Aldermen, &amp;c. they were very forward in that work of the Lord; Yea, there were the Tradeſmen, there you read much of the Goldſmiths, two ſeverall times in that Chapter, you read of the Goldſmiths, more then others, and you read of the Apothecaries, that they were ready in their work; yea, and you read of the Daughters of men, how they forwarded their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; I would I had to ſpeak to many young ones this day, I hope I ſhould prevail much with them, to bee great forwarders of you that are more ancient, that you may doe this freely, which you are here exhorted to.</p>

            <p>I Am commanded by the Aſſembly of Divines, and they by a command from the Houſe of Commons, to bee preſent at this ſolemne and publike meeting, and from them to move for that, which I confidently preſume is granted already, a helping heart, and a helping hand, to preſerve (O that we muſt be forced to ſay ſo, and yet bleſſed be God that we are alive to ſay ſo, to preſerve!) our Religion, our lives, and the lives of ours. It is I confeſſe my happineſſe, that I am not to ſpeak unto ſuch who have made our troubles, and that laugh at them, but unto them that ſee our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, &amp; know how to compaſſionate them: the perſwaſion is the more hopeful, when the compaſſion is beforehand afoot: if that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Gentleman that ſpake firſt, had bin ſent with fire to deſtroy your City, or others with Swords from that grave Senate, to have deſtroyed your lives, or with armed power to have compelled and plundered your eſtates; there I confeſſe a refuſall, nay a contempt had been the moſt proper anſwer. But Sirs, their addreſſe unto you is paternall, it is humble and full of efficacy, it is but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt you to preſerve your own lives, it is but to requeſt you that you would not ſuffer your ſelves, your wives, your children, your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:113607:21"/>
City, your Religion to be deſtroyed. I confeſſe that I had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red divers things to have worked on you; but they that have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before me, have ſcarce left me any new matter to ſay, but all (which I wiſh with all my heart were wrought in you, as well as in my ſelfe, nothing leſt but) to doe.</p>
            <p>The Religion that we have all our lives profeſſed, if it bee not worth thy money, trample it under thy feet: Religion (brethren) is an invaluable thing, it is farre above our eſtates, farre above our lives, nay it is far above our ſoules. For our eſtates, the Heathen ſay ſo much, That our eſtates were not to be inſiſted on, when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was in danger, and therefore ſome of them have according to their imaginary Religion, (the ſtrength of it) they have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected their goods to preſerve their Gods; nay they hare (as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus</hi> did) neglect his owne wife and children, to take care of that vaine Deity that they ſacrificed unto. It is (I confeſſe to mee) a moſt remarkable thing that <hi>Pliny</hi> reports, (and good Gentlemen, let not Heathens exceed Chriſtians, in love either to their Country or Religion:) You know that <hi>Hanniball</hi> was a ſore enemy to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they to maintaine themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them had exhauſted all their publique treaſury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Conſull in the Senate beſpake the people that they would all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Well Sirs, as that which you are deſired to expend ſomething of your eſtates for is Religion, that is farre beyond all your eſtates, ſo it is that, that is farre beyond all your lives: For I beſeech you what are all your lives for value unto Religion, what will your lives bee to you for comfort, when the Sunne is taken out of the Firmament, and the Goſpel is removed out of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh horizon? if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſhould outlive the Goſpel, why (the Lord bee mercifull to you) what would your lives availe you?
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113607:22"/>
were it not better to make Religion and the Goſpel your Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, then to make Idolaters your Executors? were it not better to make Religion your Executors, then to make your ſelves, or your poſterities heires of Idolatry? When <hi>Troy</hi> was taken, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes</hi> diſdained to take his Sonnes counſell, to ſave his life: Away! live when <hi>Troy</hi> is taken? And truly (Friends) if there bee in any of you, (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I perſwade my ſelfe there is in all of you that heare me this da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>) a ſenſe of God, a ſenſe of your ſoules, a ſenſe of the Goſpel of Chriſt, why you muſt acknowledge now, that all your comforts are loſt, that all your hopes on earth are loſt, and all your hopes in heaven are gone, if the Goſpel, if that Religion bee gone. Nay, (as I ſaid at the beginning) it is that, that no not your ſoules can ſtand in competition with; I confeſſe the ſoule of man is a precious thing, it is as the ring of Gold, yet if I doe not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake my ſelfe) Religion is the moſt precious Diamond in that ring. The buſines of Religion, why, it is the ſalvation of your ſouls, no leſſe then your ſouls, and higher I cannot ſpeak. And if this will not move you, at this time to lend out your ſtrength, to preſerve your lives, your eſtates, your Religion, that which preſerves your ſoules to eternity, I can ſay nothing more. But then Sirs obſerve one thing, there is not onely this dignity in Religion that may challenge all that you are and have; but there is likewiſe an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in Religion: It is one of the beſt Maſters, and one of the beſt Fathers, true Religion is. What you lay out to preſerve it, that one day will returne to preſerve you. I have ever thought our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be our ſhield; and as he ſaid of his ſhield, ſo Religion will ſay to you, Defend me, and I will defend you. It is our ſhield, why, preſerve your ſhield, you preſerve your ſelfe: O that this large Auditory would but remember two or three things, that I will ſpeake unto you. It is better (Friends) to keep your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with the expence of all you have, then to keep all you have with the loſſe of one dram of Religion; and if you ſhould quit the preſervation of Religion, you ſhall loſe in the event, both Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and your ſelves too. There will be a double loſſe; you may perhaps for the preſent be at a double coſt to keep up Religion, but you ſhall be at a treble loſſe if you loſe Religion; you ſhall loſe your lives, you ſhall loſe the eſtates that you keep, and you ſhall loſe your ſoules too; and if any thing keeps you, it is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113607:22"/>

            <p>These are three things methinks, wherein the Lord hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe to you, that may for ever engage your hearts,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113607:23"/>
with all alacrity to ſpend, and to be ſpent for his cauſe: Why, the one is, he never would to this day ſuffer the deſtroyer, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their intentions, (he would never ſuffer the deſtroyer) to enter into this City; he hath ſtill diverted them, as you have obſerved by ſome admirable acts of providence, when their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions have been to come to this place, (the Lord knowes in what condition you had been by this day, if providence had not (at one time eſpecially) diverted them from it; but notwithſtanding all this, God hath not ſuffered them to this day, to ſhoot one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row into your City. But then there is another thing; as the Lord hath not to this day ſuffered them to come in a publike hoſtile way, ſo he hath from time to time diſcovered all the Treacheries, Plots, and deſignes againſt you. When the enemy could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you above board, but thought to undermine your Lives and States, and all (I need not ſay much to revive your memories,) of late dayes, did God unknowne to you, deliver you from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhould you now be backward to doe for this God, that hath preſerved all that you have, and all that you are? Nay, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider one thing more; he hath in all the publike ſervices; wherein indeed, if any people in the Land deſerve our acknowledgements and honour, this City hath got it from the whole Land. But this is that I was ſaying, God hath in all the publike Services and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails which have of late been fought in the land, God hath hanged the ſhield of ſalvation upon your ſhoulders, he hath been pleaſed to caſt all the glory, not onely of preſervation, but of the great ſucceſſe, and honour, and victory, God hath caſt it upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>London.</hi> And will you, that God hath defended all this while; will you that God hath preſerved from ſecret treachery; will you, that God hath given hearts all this while to ſtand for <hi>God</hi> above all the people of the earth: will you that God hath done ſo much for in the times of battaile, more then for all the reſt, wil you fail now to do for God? God forbid, I beſeech you rather that your hearts may be doubled and trebled for that God that is ſo good to you. And not to trouble you long, becauſe the truth is, I am confident there needs no more to be ſaid, you long ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who ſhould moſt ſhew his affection at this time to preſerve all: Why, there is one thing more that might bee ſpoken too, that is, touching our brethren of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Why, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
