         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37227:4"/>
to write any thing touching the <hi>Life</hi>

thoughts, becauſe the world was not
able to containe, the heaven of heavens
vouchſafed to entertaine; for both his

being too great, that who ſhould adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

all which knew him a great deale
better then I, being able to give the

welbeloved ſubject therof, would gredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertane and welcome the ſame with
their divers humors, and piercing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Theſe, and many more, with the
conſcience of my unworthines, &amp; inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie
to performe ſo high a task, (which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37227:4"/>

conditions, to lanch out my fraile
barke, into that great Ocean of ſorrow,
even from the cradle to the grave, whence
ſtorme-beaten as you ſee, I have with
much adoe recovered my deſired haven.
Firſt, that whatſoever diſtaſte you finde

bewrayed: Next, that whatſoever is here
written of his late Highneſſe, not content

a Ladder to mount up your thoughts to a

further alſo that you would not be
too buſie upon this report to cenſure any

I proteſt, I have endeavoured to pleaſe,
without partiality, ſo farre, as in my

would delay to cenſure me for this letter,
untill with mature judgement you have
throughly peruſed the ſame, conſidering
how much more eaſie it is to cenſure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
then to doe well our ſelves. Again,
that ſince the way by which I muſt paſſe,
is through a long, darke, ſilent, ſolitary,
untroden path, leading even to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

ſorrow, ending in teares, wherein I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Moneth comming to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where,
what joy was at ſo loving a meeting, and
ſo long wiſhed, I leave for you to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie lying at this foreſaid
Towne, his Highneſſe and ſome other
Lords, were inſtalled Knights of the
moſt Honourable and Noble Order of
the Garter; after which (the Sickneſſe
increaſing) His Highneſſe removed from
thence to <hi>Oatelands,</hi> where by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from his Majeſtie, he tooke houſe
by himſelfe, having ſo many to attend
upon him in every Office, as was thought
fitting for his yeares. A little after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
to <hi>Nonſuch,</hi> and from thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſent for to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
he againe returned to <hi>Oatelands,</hi> where
he begun to ply his Booke hard for two
or three yeares, continuing all his Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sports, Hawking, Hunting, running
at the Ring, Leaping, riding of great Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Dauncing, Fencing, toſſing of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37227:8"/>
Pike, &amp;c. In all which, he did ſo farre
excell as was fitting for ſo great a Prince;
whereby, together with his continuall
travaile, being ever in action, he came to
have a very active and ſtrong body; ſo
that then he would many times tyre all
his followers before he himſelfe would
be weary.</p>
            <p>Much about this time, being thirteene
yeares of age, he began to know himſelfe
a little better, and finding himſelfe to bee
a Prince indeed, began not onely to ſtrive
for vertues anſwerable, but alſo to chaſe
away the reliques of childiſh imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
naturall to all, increaſing every day
in favour with God and man.</p>
            <p>In the 14. and 15. yeares of his age, he
began to be very juditious, almoſt in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, drawing neerer to a Majeſtique
gravity; to be a reverent and attentive
hearer of Sermons, to give commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the ſame, to have Boxes kept at
his three ſeverall ſtanding Houſes, <hi>Saint-Iames,
Richmond,</hi> and <hi>Nonſuch,</hi> cauſing all
thoſe who did ſweare in his hearing, to
pay moneyes to the ſame, which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
duly given to the poore; he beganne
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37227:9"/>
now alſo to be of an excellent diſcourſe,
putting forth, and asking ſtrange Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Suppoſitions, both of this, and
forraine States, and deſiring to know,
and to be reſolved almoſt of every thing,
whereby at length he attained to have a
reaſonable inſight and judgement, in
State-affaires; now alſo delighting to
ſhoot in great and ſmall Field-pieces, to
levell them to the white, and ſee them
ſhot off.</p>
            <p>The 16. yeare of his Age, being to
come to the time of his Inveſtment in the
Principalitie of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornewall;</hi> He
did advance his owne Title and Right ſo
farre, as with modeſtie he might: which
preſently was gently and lovingly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and granted of his Majeſtie, with
the conſent of the Right Honourable, the
High Court of Parliament: The fourth
of <hi>Iune</hi> following, being appointed for
that ſolemne action, the <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> before
which, his Highneſſe not onely for his
owne Recreation, but alſo that the
World might know, what a brave
Prince they were likely to enjoy, under
the Name of <hi>Meliades,</hi> Lord of the <hi>Iſles,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:37227:9"/>
(an ancient Title due to the firſt borne of
<hi>Scotland)</hi> did in his Name, by ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the ſame of purpoſe, ſtrangly
attired, accompanied with Drummes and
Trumpets in the Chamber of Preſence,
before the King and Queene, and in the
preſence of the whole Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> delivered
a Challenge to all Knights of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
in two Speeches; the relation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were out of purpoſe, but the ſumme
was:</p>
            <p>That <hi>Meliades,</hi> their Noble Maſter,
boyling with an earneſt deſire, to trie the
Valour of his young yeares in foraigne
Countreyes, and to know where Vertue
triumphed moſt, had ſent them abroad to
eſpy the ſame, who after their long Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes
in all Countreyes, and returne;
ſhewing, how no where in any Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
ſave in the Fortunate Iſle of <hi>Great
Britaine,</hi> they had found his wiſhes;
which miniſtring matter of exceeding
joy to their young <hi>Meliades,</hi> who (as they
ſaid) could lineally derive his Pedegree
from the famous Knights of this Iſle, was
the cauſe that he had now ſent to preſent
the firſt fruits of his Chivalrie at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37227:10"/>
feete. Then after, returning with
a ſhort ſpeech to her Majeſtie, next to the
Earles, Lords, and Knights, excuſing
their Lord in this their ſo ſudden &amp; ſhort
warning: and laſtly, to the Ladies; they
after humble delivery of their Chartle,
concerning time, place, conditions, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of weapons, and Aſſailants, tooke
their leave, departing ſolemnly as they
entred.</p>
            <p>Now began every where preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be made for this great fight, and
happy did he thinke himſelfe who ſhould
be admitted for a Defendant, much more
Aſſailant: At laſt, to encounter his
Highneſſe, with his ſix Aſſailants, 58.
Defendants conſiſting of Earles, Barons,
Knights, and Eſquires, were appointed
and choſen, eight Defendants to one Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailant,
every Aſſailant being to fight by
turnes, eight ſeverall times fighting, two
every time with puſh of Pike and Sword,
twelve ſtroakes at a time; after which,
the Barre for ſeparation was to bee let
downe untill a freſh onſet.</p>
            <p>The great night of this Solemnity
now approaching, his Highneſſe in his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37227:10"/>
owne lodging, in the Chriſtmas, did
Feaſt the Earles, Barons, and Knights aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailants,
and defendants, untill the great
Twelfth appointed night, on which this
great fight was to be performed; which
being come, his Highneſſe, to the great
wonder of the beholders, did admirably
fight his part, giving and receiving that
night, 32. puſhes of Pikes, and about
360. ſtroakes of Swords, which is ſcarſe
credible in ſo young yeares, enough to
aſſure the World, that <hi>Great Britaines</hi>
brave <hi>Henry</hi> aſpired to immortality.</p>
            <p>Againſt the morrow, after the ſame
ſaid fight, was alſo prepared a Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke
Feaſt at his Highneſſe houſe at <hi>Saint
Iames,</hi> at which his Majeſtie, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
his Brother and Siſter, with all the
other Earles, Lords, and Knights of the
Court were preſent; where after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
(according as before they had beene
judged) his Highneſſe gave three priſes,
to the three beſt deſerving, <hi>viz.</hi> to the
Right Honourable the Earle of <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery</hi>
one, and to Sir <hi>Thomas Darcy,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Robert Gourdon</hi> Knights, the other two.</p>
            <p>The Barriers finiſhed, and priſes won,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37227:11"/>
judged and delivered, ſhortly after began
preparation every where to be made for
his Highneſſe <hi>Creation,</hi> every one from
the higheſt to the loweſt (to ſhew there
exceeding love) ſtriving who ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in bravery, untill faſt-poſting <hi>Time</hi>
at length brought forth the long wiſhed
for day; before which, his Highneſſe
then lying at <hi>Richmond,</hi> a Houſe ſcituate
on the Rivers ſide, ſeven miles from <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
the place of his <hi>Creation,</hi> the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
being to be brought from ſuch a
place, the Right Honourable the Lord
Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> with the worſhipfull
Aldermen his Brethren, accompanied
with thirtie ſix ſeverall Companies of
Citizens of divers callings, in ſo many
ſeverall Barges, and all Citie-like brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
poſſible, with their ſeverall Flagges,
Banners, Colours, Armes, Trumpets,
Drummes, and Phyfes, with other ſuch
proviſion, came from their mighty and
renowned City, up the ſilver-ſtreamed
River, to welcome, meet and accompany
his Highneſſe, towards the ſolemne A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
where having encountred with his
Highneſſe Barges with all the joy, love,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37227:11"/>
and kindneſſe poſſible, to the wonder of
the World; all eyes were bent towards
ſo joyfull and deſired a ſight: they came
altogether rowing downe the proud Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which for two or three miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſeemed to be covered with Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Barges Boates, and Oares unto <hi>White-hall</hi>
bridge at the Court, where hee was
alſo received, and welcommed by the
Right Honourable the Lords of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
moſt Honourable Privie Counſel,
with divers others, and from thence by
them conducted unto his Majeſtie, where
he remained untill the time of his <hi>Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
which being the next day, he was in
preſence of the right Honorable the High
Court of Parliament, Lords Spiritual and
Temporall, By his Majeſtie, the King his
Father, Created <hi>Prince of Wales, Duke of
Cornewall, great Earle of Cheſter, &amp;c.</hi> with
a full Inveſtment in all the Ancient and
great Liberties, ever poſſeſſed by any of
his famous Predeceſſors, and with the
joy and approbation of the whole
Houſe.</p>
            <p>His Highneſſe being now abſolute of
himſelfe, did take up Houſe with a full
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37227:12"/>
addition of high Officers, Sir <hi>Thomas Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lener</hi>
Chamberlaine, Sir <hi>Charles Cornwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
Treaſurer, and Sir <hi>Iohn Hollis</hi> Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouler
of his Houſe, making good and
ſtrict Ordets through the ſame, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
and below ſtaires, more like a grave
wiſe, and ancient Counſellour, ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
diſpoſing, &amp; diſpatching his affaires,
then ſo young and great a Prince: Now
were allorted unto him certaine Lands
for his revenewes, which he was ſo farre
from diminiſhing, that hee left the ſame
encreaſed, by thouſands a yeare; his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
did now begin to looke which way
to helpe themſelves, ſince his Highneſſe,
was every day more and more able to
give: yet he being very ſparing to give
any thing, did onely give Grants unto
ſome, with promiſes, hopes and delayes
unto others, becauſe he would not (hee
ſaid) diſpoſe of any thing, untill with the
gift he might perpetrat the ſame, which
could not be, untill either yeares, or the
High Court of Parliament ſhould ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him, but this time as yet not being
come, he went on his owne frugall cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
ſuffering almoſt nothing to paſſe in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37227:12"/>
his Houſe, or other affaires, which hee
himſelfe did not overſee.</p>
            <p>At laſt, bethinking himſelfe that <hi>Wales</hi>
and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> &amp;c. his Principalitie had a
long time beene without a Prince of their
owne, he thought hee might the rather
ſhew his Authority in renewing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
Leaſes; wherefore having firſt by
a Writ called <hi>Scire facias,</hi> avoided and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated
all their former Rights and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
hee brought them unto a generall
ſubmiſſion to compound, take and hold
new of him; which they were all ready
to performe, a little before his death:
Whereupon Surveyors, and Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
were appointed, and diſpatched to
ſurvey all his Lands, and to returne a true
certificate of the whole valew; untill
which, (being but a little before his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and death) he deferred all manner
of Suits, becauſe he would firſt be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
truely, what, and how great their
demands were.</p>
            <p>In the 17. and 18. yeares of his Age
he began not onely to be a Man in ſtature,
but alſo in courage and wiſdome, to the
admiration of all, and with the eyes of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37227:13"/>
his Spirit ſurveying the mighty Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
whereunto he was Heire apparant,
he did alſo ſtraine to be the better furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
(if ever his ſhoulders ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
ſo great a burthen with furniture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
the ſame, it being wiſdome, in the
time of peace, to prepare for the ſame,
knowing that Peace is the harbinger of
Warre, (chiefly in Ships, counted the
brazen Wall of this Iſle) he in the time of
our ſecurity thought thereof: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did not only intreate his Majeſtie to
cauſe his Officers of the Navy to build
him a Ship, called the <hi>Prince,</hi> (then the
faireſt of this Iſle) but alſo to advance
the affaires of the Navy, to his power,
now and then got leave of his Majeſtie to
goe in perſon to view the Ships, and
Storehouſes, which divers times he did.
Not content herewith, he did alſo pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
Tilting, charging on Horſebacke
with Piſtols, after the maner of the Wars,
with all other the like inventions. Now
alſo delighting to conferre, both with his
owne, and other Strangers, and great
Captaines, of all manner of Wars, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes,
Furniture, Armes by Sea and Land,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37227:13"/>
Diſciplines, Orders, Marches, Alarmes,
Watches, Stratagems, Ambuſcadoes,
Approaches, Scalings, Fortifications,
Incampings, and having now and then
Battailes of head-men appointed both on
Horſe and Foot, in a long Table; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he might in a manner, view the right
ordering of a Battaile, how every troope
did aide and aſſiſt another, as alſo the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the light Horſemen, Vauntguard,
Maine Battaile, with the aſſiſting wings,
and Rerewards, &amp;c. which are out of my
element to ſpeake of. Neither did he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
as he loved the <hi>Theoricke</hi> of theſe
things, to practiſe the ſame, entertaining
in his Houſe a Dutch Captaine, ſent unto
him by his Excellence <hi>(Grave Maurice)</hi>
a moſt excellent Ingineer, in all manner
of things belonging to the <hi>Wars;</hi> cauſing
alſo, from time to time, new Pieces of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to be made, learning to ſhoot, and
levell them right to the white; No leſſe
provident was he to have great Horſes,
and thoſe of the beſt, which were ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him from all Countreyes; ſo that, I
may truely affirme, no Prince in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome
did exceed him therein. Thus,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37227:14"/>
in theſe, and other worldly pleaſures,
which ſtoope for acquaintance unto
greatneſſe, did he ſpend the yeares paſt.</p>
            <p>In the 19. yeare of his Age, whether
by his continuall toile of body, and
minde, or ſome internall unknowne cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
(I know not) where before he was of
ſomewhat a full round face, and very
pleaſant diſpoſition, his Viſage began
to appeare ſomewat paler, longer and
thinner then before, hee himſelfe being
alſo more ſad and retyred then uſuall, yet
without any complaint of him, or jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
of his Followers, ſave that ſome halfe
a yeare after, hee would now and then
complaine of a ſmall kinde of giddy
lumpiſh heavineſſe in his forehead, the
paine wherof, moved him (as I thinke) for
the moſt part, ever before hee would put
on his Hat, to ſtroke up with his hand his
brow and forehead; he did alſo uſe to
bleed at the noſe often, and in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie,
wherein he found great eaſe, untill
a little before his Sickneſſe, (the paſſages
being ſtopped) this helpe, to his further
griefe, left him; he was now ſubject to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37227:14"/>
many ſtrong and extraordinary qualmes,
ſo that for danger and celerity they
were forced many times to fetch him
againe with ſtrong waters, which being
onely by intermiſſion now and then,
were let paſſe as they came, without any
ſuſpition of ſo ſuddaine ſorrowes.</p>
            <p>Much about the beginning of this
Summer, there could almoſt bee no
newes heard, but of his Siſters marriage,
of which many ſpeeches went currant,
according to the divers affections of
Proteſtants and Papiſts; ſome wiſhing
her to bee married to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
ſome to the Prince of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſome to
the young Lands-grave, and ſome to his
Highneſſe the Palſgrave her now huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
But hee following the ſtreame
of his Fathers well ſetled affections, for
great <hi>Britaines</hi> eternall felicity, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of all Papiſts, did onely fancy the
Palſgraves motion, ſhortly after advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the ſame by all meanes poſſible at
the comming of the Right honourable
the Count <hi>Hannaw:</hi> the Palſgraves great
Ambaſſadour, whoſe errand as the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37227:15"/>
ſpeech went, was to knit up this match,
unto whoſe ſuite his Highneſſe did not
onely give way, and ſecond the buſineſſe,
but alſo in ſigne of love, entertaine, and
countenance the ſaid Count (next unto
his Majeſty) more then any, never reſting
untill all was agreed (as thankes bee to
God) it is now finiſhed.</p>
            <p>Matters now being at reſt, the Duke of
<hi>Bovillon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſwimming immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: after ſupper, was moſt pernitious to his health: for it ſtopt his bleeding at Noſe, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bloud pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying, engendred that fatall Feber which followed.

               </note> and Count <hi>Hannaw</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home againe, his Higeneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to <hi>Richmond,</hi> where hee lay untill
the progreſſe; the pleaſure of the River
running cloſe by the houſe, inviting him
now and then to ſwimme, which hee
endeavoured to learne in the evening,
to the diſlike of many, who did ſee him
ſwimme after ſupper, his ſtomack being
full, affirming it to bee full of danger, and
that it was needleſſe for him to adventure
himſelfe in the water; but no remedy,
hee would needs continue the ſame, and
did untill his removing from thence.
Hee did now alſo delight many times
to walke late at night by the Rivers ſide
in Moone light, to heare the Trumpets
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37227:15"/>
ſound an eccho, which many ſuſpected,
becauſe the Dew then falling did him
ſmall good.</p>
            <p>But the time of the progreſſe now
approaching (when as hee was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
hee muſt needs meet the King his
Father at <hi>Beaver Caſtle</hi> in <hi>Notinghamſhire</hi>
the ſecond Saturday after the beginning
of the ſame, which now drawing neere,
his Highneſſe neither conſidering the
ſtrength of his body, the greatneſſe of
the journey (being neere foureſcore and
ſixteene miles) nor the extreame and
wonderfull heat of the ſeaſon, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
my perſuaſions to the
contrary, determined to ride that great
journey in 2. dayes, according to which
hee ſet forth on fryday by one of the
clock in the morning from his houſe at
<hi>Richmond,</hi> comming to <hi>Finchingbrooke</hi>
beſides <hi>Huntington,</hi> a houſe pertaining
to Sir <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> Knight, Maſter of
his game, by tenne of the clock in the
morning, which as they ſay is threeſcore
miles, in nine houres poſting, where hee
remained all that night, the next day
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37227:16"/>
having ſix and thirty miles to <hi>Beaver
Caſtle,</hi> where hee meet with his Father
juſt at the time prefixed.</p>
            <p>But the time of one thing, I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
forgot to tell you, how before his
comming from <hi>Richmond</hi> in intending to
feaſt the Courtat his Mannor of <hi>Woodſtock</hi>
about the end of this progreſſe (it being
the firſt time of their generall meeting
there, ſince the houſe became his) had
given order to his Officers to provide a
moſt magnifique Feaſt againſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the foreſaid houſe; withall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ordained a great Summer-houſe of
greene boughes to bee built in the parke
wherein the great ſupper ſhould bee, all
which was with ſpeed performed:
meane while, although the ſeaſon was
exceeding hot, his Highneſſe did ride
many and extraordinary journeyes in
the ſame (which as was thought) did
much incline his boyling bloud towards
inflamation.</p>
            <p>At laſt, their journeis being towards
an end, to <hi>Woodſtock</hi> they came, where his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37227:16"/>
Highneſſe (accordingly to his former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention)
did feaſt the Lords and Ladies
at a long table, neere which hee himſelfe
did beare them company from the
Wedneſday night of their comming, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the Sunday night, which (unknowne
to him) hee had appointed for the laſt
great farewell unto all his friends; By
this time the appointed night for this
great feaſt being come, his Highneſſe
did himſelfe in perſon come into the
banqueting houſe, to ſee all things in
good order, for great was his care to
give contentment.</p>
            <p>At laſt, the King and Queene being
ſet at a Table by themſelves at the upper
end of the roome, his Highneſſe with his
Siſter accompanied with the Lords and
Ladies ſitting at another Table of thirty
yards long and more, by themſelves,
there was to bee ſeene one of the greateſt
and beſt ordered feaſts as ever was ſeene,
nothing wanting which any way was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to adorn ſuch a ſolemne meeting; All
which to the generall joy of the whole
Court; his Highneſſe like to a Princely
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37227:17"/>
Bridgrome cheering and welcomming
his Gueſts, there appeared an univerſall
contentment in all; but litle knew he that
it was his laſt great farewel to his Father,
Mother, Siſter, yea, unto the whole
Court, that it was his laſt Feaſt of Feaſts,
one for all. And indeed, when we looke
backe unto the ſame, therein beholding
his Highneſſe cheerefull carriage, the
Time, Order, State, Magnificence, and
Greatnes thereof, we may behold ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
Ominous therein.</p>
            <p>The Monday after, the Court remove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from thence, his Highneſſe, after
leave obtained, haſted home againe to
<hi>Richmond,</hi> becauſe of the Newes of the
<hi>Palſegraves</hi> approach, whom he intended
to grace with all poſſible honour. Being
returned, he began to give order for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, and to diſpatch all affaires both
of his owne, and concerning the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intended Triumphes for his Highnes
the <hi>Palſgraves</hi> better welcome; He now
alſo of himſelfe (I know not by what
motion) conſidering the great paines, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
and ſmall meanes of a number of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37227:17"/>
his Followers, who had ſpent much, and
gotten nothing in his Service, did give
order for a number of ſeverall penſions,
according to his diſcretion, to ſome of
them, promiſing alſo, after a while
(that none ſhould be diſcouraged) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the reſt.</p>
            <p>But now, whether the continuall vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
of his Exerciſes, or his too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
eating of abundance of Grapes,
and other fruits, or ſome ſetled Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly,
engendred by ſome unknowne
cauſes, I cannot determine, yet did hee
looke ſtill more pale and thinne, from
day to day, complaining now and then of
a cold, laſie drowſineſſe in his head, which
(as I thinke) moved him many times to
aske queſtions of divers about him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the quality, cure, and nature of
the Feaver, (called for the ſtrange diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie)
<hi>The new Diſeaſe;</hi> belike, fearing
ſome ſuch like thing by his indiſpoſition;
He alſo uſed before this, now and then,
and in his Sickneſſe to ſigh often, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
being ſometimes demanded the cauſe
by his Phiſitians, Doctor <hi>Hamond,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37227:18"/>
others neere him, hee would ſometimes
reply, that he knew not, ſometimes that
they came unawares, and ſometimes alſo
that they were not without cauſe.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
Head-ach, Lazineſſe, and indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
increaſing, (which notwithſtanding
becauſe of the time, he ſtrove mightily
to conceale) whereas oft before, he uſed
to riſe earely in the morning to walke
the fields, he did lye a bed, almoſt every
morning untill nine of the clocke, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning
of his lazineſſe, and that hee
knew not the cauſe; during which time
(belike jealous of himſelfe) hee would
many mornings before his riſing, aske
of the Groomes of his Bed-chamber,
How doe I looke this morning? and at
other times the ſame queſtion againe;
which they, fearing no danger, to make
his Highneſſe laugh, would put off with
one jeſt or other.</p>
            <p>But he ſtill continuing ill, the tenth
of the foreſaid Moneth, hee had two
ſmall fits of an Ague, forcing him to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37227:18"/>
keepe his Chamber, which his Highneſſe
finding, had ſome ſpeech with Doctor
<hi>Hamond,</hi> his Phyſitian, willing belike
to have taken ſome ſtrong Phiſicke, the
ſooner to have removed the cauſe. But
he not daring to bee too bold with his
Highneſſe body, without a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
did onely give unto his Highneſſe
a ſoftning Gliſter, which had its owne
good effects, ſtirring the humors.</p>
            <p>On the Morning, being Tueſday, the
thirteene of <hi>October,</hi> he having (as was
thought) taken cold, had a great looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
his belly opening 25. times, avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a great deale of Choller, Flegme,
and putrified Matter toward the ende,
yet for all this, on the morrow, he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe (as he ſaid) reaſonable well,
becauſe of the <hi>Palſgraves</hi> comming, hee
haſted from thence to Saint <hi>James,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he gave order, and would needes
remove on Thurſday, the thirteenth of
the ſame moneth, notwithſtanding any
perſwaſions whatſoever to the contrary,
neither was it without great danger (as
they all ſhewed him) to hazard himſelfe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37227:19"/>
abroad ſo ſoone, his Body being yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen:
but he affirming himſelfe to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well, would needes goe on with his
former determination.</p>
            <p>At laſt to Saint <hi>James</hi> he came, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well, but that he looked pale and ill,
ſo that ſundry did ſpeake ſuſpitiouſly of
his lookes, fearing ſome diſtemper in his
Body: yet ſo ſtrong was his minde, that
complaining of nothing, he did beare out
the matter very bravely in ſhew, being ſo
well, that he gave his Phyſitian (who
had waited a long time) leave to goe
home to his houſe; meane while his
indiſpoſition ſtill continuing and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
there might have beene perceived
in him a ſudden great change, for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be diſpleaſed almoſt with every

things, yet not regarding, but looking,
as it were, with the eyes of a ſtranger

talke of, aske queſtions, and view curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,

upon, turning them away with the backe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37227:19"/>
of his hand, and departing, as who would
ſay, I take pleaſure in nothing; yet was he
wonderfully buſie in providing, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
order for every thing belonging to

<hi>Grave Maurice</hi> his Brother, whom
he alſo much honoured and eſteemed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
becauſe of a Noble and Heroicke diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
which he ſaw in him, fitting his
humour, with whom he uſed to play of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
at Cardes, and Tenis, delighting
much in his company, and above all the
reſt, one great Match they had at Tenis,
on Saturday the 24. of <hi>October,</hi> the day
before his laſt Sickneſſe, where his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
courage, negligently, careleſly,
and wilfully (neither conſidering the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
weake eſtate of his body, danger,
nor coldneſſe of the ſeaſon) as though
his body had been of braſſe, did play in
his ſhirt, as if it had been in the heate of
Summer; during which time, he looked
ſo wonderfull ill and pale, that all the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37227:20"/>
beholders tooke notice thereof, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
to one another what they feared:
But hee (the match being ended) carried
himſelfe ſo well, as if there were no ſuch
matter, having all this while a reaſonable
good ſtomack to meat; yet this night at
his going to bed, complaining more
then uſuall of his lazineſſe and head-ache.</p>
            <p>But oh whether goe I now? muſt
I againe launch out into a Sea of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,

where the Court lay ſo neere; becauſe
hee uſed after his owne, to heare the

and did preſent his ſervice to preach

ever ſince the time (long before) in
which hee heard him preach a Sermon
of judgement, which hee did ſo well like
of, that many times hee did ſpeake of the
ſame, affirming it to have beene ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
that hee in a manner did ſhew
them the ſame, long it was not ere his
Highneſſe was ready and gone to the
Chappell to heare him.</p>
            <p>But ere I proceed, give mee leave I
intreate you, to admire the wonderfull
providence and goodneſſe of God,
which did ſo provide for him a Sermon
of <hi>Mortification,</hi> or Preparation, which
you will: For the time, text, powerfull

to our following unthought of <hi>Funerall,</hi>
as though an Angell had come the
whole weeke before from Heaven, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing
unto him the time, neceſſity, text,
order, and amplifications thereof, ſo
truly did hee thunder out the mortall
miſery of mankind, but chiefely of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>
The Text was out of <hi>Job</hi> the 14.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37227:21"/>
and 1. verſe, <hi>Man that is borne of a Woman,
is of ſhort continuance and full of trouble.</hi>
From which hee ſhewed 3. things; firſt,
our miſerable entry into the World,

<hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> and endurance in the
World full of trouble; in which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
and troubles of all Eſtates were
well ſhewed, but chiefely thoſe of
great ones. Sermon being ended, his
Highneſſe did commend the ſame, being
very attentive all the time thereof; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
thereafter going into <hi>Whitehall,</hi>
where hee alſo did heare another Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with the King his Father; which
being alſo done, to dinner they went,
his Highneſſe in outward appearance
eating with a reaſonable good ſtomack,

a ſuddaine ſickneſſe and fainteneſſe of

followed ſhortly after a ſhaking, with a
great heat and headache, which from
hence forth never left him; his Highneſſe
finding himſelfe thus ſuddainely taken,
was forced to take his leave, departing

hee found himſelfe very ill, remaining
all this evening in an Agony, having
a great drought (which after this could

Doctor <hi>Mayerne</hi> his Majeſties chiefe

that in his judgement the ſureſt way for

from the very dangerous forenamed acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents

which he feared to be venemous, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
humors ſeated in the naturall parts,
inclining by reaſon of the quantity, to a

that in great quantity with reiteration (if

not being decayed, nor too much opreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
before that Feaver turned continuall,

               <p>This morning hee did riſe and put on

that he could not tell, what to make of

miſlike the French Doctors company,

               <p>The former daies and this, his ſtomack

conſidering the greatneſſe of the danger,

altogether refuſing to allow of, becauſe

which working ſeven or eight times,

               <p>Having thus prepared him to heare,
hee went further, putting him in mind
of the <hi>Exceeding great danger hee was in,</hi>
and that although hee might recover
(as hee hoped hee ſhould) yet hee might
alſo die; and that ſince it was an inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and irrevocable neceſſity that <hi>All
muſt once die,</hi> late or ſoone. (Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reward of ſinne) hee asked, if it
ſhould ſo fall out, whether or no hee
was well pleaſed to ſubmit himſelfe to
the <hi>Will of God;</hi> to which hee anſwered,
yea withall his heart. Then the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
went on demanding queſtions
of his faith; Firſt of the Religion and
Church wherein hee lived; which his
Highneſſe acknowledged to bee the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37227:36"/>
true Church, wherein onely, and
without which there was no ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Then of his faith in Chriſt onely, by
him, and in him, without any merits of
his owne, being aſſured of the Remiſſion
of all his ſinnes; which hee profeſſed hee
did, hoping and truſting onely therein;
Then of the Reſurrection of the body,
life everlaſting, and the joyes of Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
All which hee confeſſed and beleeved,
hoping withall Saints to enjoy the
ſame.</p>
               <p>This conference, with a great deals
more, the Archbiſhop had with him to
this purpoſe; (which may alſo give unto
you abſolute ſatisfaction of his Soules
health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thereunto his life bee conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.)
After which, fearing hee ſhould
too much diſquiet him, with many good
exhortations, hee tooke leave for that
time.</p>
               <p>This day being the fifth of <hi>November<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
a day of everlaſting remembrance and
thankſgiving for our deliverance from
the Powder Treaſon, was order given
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37227:36"/>
every where unto all Churches, to pray
for his Highneſſe, untill when, the great
danger was unknowne to the Commons,
which was effectually as ever untill his
death performed.</p>
               <p>This day, and at ſundry other times
ſince his confuſion of ſpeech, hee would
many times call upon Sir <hi>David Murray</hi>
Knight (the onely man in whom hee
had put choiſe truſt) by his name <hi>David,
David, David,</hi> who when hee came unto
his Highneſſe, demanding his pleaſure,
in extremity of paine, and ſtupefaction
of ſenſes confounding his ſpeech, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
hee did reply, I would ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
but I cannot utter it; which forme
hee ſtill uſed, ſo long as hee had any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ſence or memory.</p>
               <p>This done, alſo (but too late) to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the reſt, came Doctor <hi>Palmer,</hi> and
Doctor <hi>Gifford</hi> famous Phiſitians for
their honeſty, learning, and Phiſick, who
with the former foure went all ſix to a
conſultation what now remained; finally
to bee done, wherein by ſome (as they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37227:37"/>
ſay) was againe propounded the neceſſity
of bleeding, the oportunity whereof,
by the evacuation of his belly was now
over paſſed.</p>
               <p>In the end, the Doctors (long before
this deſpairing of his recovery) did at
laſt agree upon <hi>Diaſcordium,</hi> as the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meanes (under God) now remaining,
which tempered with cooler Cordials,
was given him in the preſence of many
honourable Gentlemen, about tenne a
Clock at night, the operation whereof
was ſmall or none; neither all this while
did nature of it ſelfe incline towards
ſweating, and to force the ſame they
thought it to no purpoſe. This night
was unquiet as the reſt, his accidents
remaining in the ſame ſort, but now and
then ſpeaking, but ſo confuſedly that hee
could not bee underſtood.</p>
               <p>Among the reſt, this night about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
Maſter <hi>Naſmith</hi> his Majeſties
Chirurgeon ſitting on his bed ſide, his
Highneſſe pulled him unto him by the
hand, ſpeaking unto him ſomewhat, but
ſo confuſedly, by reaſon of the ratling
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37227:37"/>
of his Throat, that hee could not bee
underſtood; which his Highneſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
giving a moſt grievous ſigh,
as it were in anger turned him from him;
thereafter (unleſſe hee were urged) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſpeaking unto him, or any.</p>
               <p>In this extremity, (Sir <hi>David Murray,</hi>
who in this one death ſuffered many)
came unto him, intreating him, &amp; asking
him, that if hee had any thing to ſay
which troubled him, that hee would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
make knowne his mind: but his
Spirits being overcome, and nature
weake, hee was not able to ſay any thing,
ſave that of all other buſineſſe hee gave
order for the burning of a number of
<hi>Letters</hi> in a certaine cabinet in his clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
which preſently after his death was
done.</p>
               <p>Not long after (as I thinke) on Friday
morning about three a clock, his back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
ſhoulders, armes and tongue, by
reaſon of the horrible violence of the
convulſions, diſ-joyntingly deviding
themſelves, the effect ſhewing that the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37227:38"/>
retentive power was gone, the Spirits
ſubdued, the ſeat of reaſon overcome,
and nature ſpent, in which extremity,
fainting and ſounding, hee ſeemed twice
or thrice to bee quite gone, at which time
there aroſe wonderfull great ſhouting,
weeping and crying in the Chamber,
Court, and adjoyning ſtreets, which
was ſo great (together with ſomewhat
elſe which they uſed) that they brought
him againe.</p>
               <p>This crie was ſo great, that all thoſe
in the ſtreets thought hee had beene
dead; whereupon it went for the moſt
part currant in the City and Countrey
that hee was gone.</p>
               <p>I am not able to expreſſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable
ſorrow which every where
was for this wofull newes, chiefely in
that dolefull houſe, you may imagine
no thought can thinke the greatneſſe
thereof, nor underſtanding conceive the
ſame, this little which I have ſaid, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lading
my weakeneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:37227:38"/>
Thus given over of all into the hands
of God, did his Highneſſe lie in extreame
paine; during which, ſtill now and then
(till two or three houres before his
death) looking up, and ſpeaking, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to ſpeake, which for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and extremity of paine (being ſo
neere gone) could not bee underſtood,
all the World were ready in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire,
to bring cordiall waters <hi>Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
and <hi>Quintiſſentiall</hi> Spirits to be given
unto him; amongſt which, one in the
afternoone was miniſtred; which ſet that
little nature remaining, on worke, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a ſmall ſweat, which, too late, was
the firſt hee had; Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> alſo
did ſend another from the Tower, which
whether or no to give him, they did a
while deliberate.</p>
               <p>After the operation of the firſt, his
Highneſſe reſted quietly a little while,
preſently after falling into his former
extremities; whereupon (as the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
remedy) with the leave and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
of the Lords of the Counſell there
preſent, the cordiall ſent by Sir <hi>Walter
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37227:39"/>
Raleigh</hi> (after it had beene taſted and
proved) was given unto him; but in
vaine, ſave that forcing that ſparke of
life that remained, it brought him againe
into a ſweat; after which, as before hee
had ſome reſt for a little while. But,
no remedy, death would needs bee Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour;
in vaine did they ſtrive againſt
the ſtreame, for hee ſhortly after became
wonderfull ill againe; ſight and ſence
failing, as alſo all the infallible ſignes
of death approaching; In which extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there preſent, who ſeeing it was now
the time of times, before the laſt gaſpe,
to miniſter ſome comfort unto his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(if as yet there were any ſence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining)
came unto him, firſt ſpeaking
aloud; putting him in mind of all thoſe
things which hee had ſpokn unto him
the day before in his perfect ſenſe, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
aloud in his eare, to remember
<hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to beleeve, hope, and truſt
onely in him, with aſſured confidence
of mercy, to lift up his heart, and prepare
him to meete the Lord <hi>Ieſus,</hi> with many
other divine exhortations: Thereafter
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37227:39"/>
calling more loud then ever, thrice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in his eare, Sir heare you mee,
heare you mee, heare you mee; If you
heare mee, in certaine ſigne of your faith,
and hope of the bleſſed reſurrection,
give us for our comfort a ſigne, by lifting
up of your hands, which hee did, lifting
up both his hands together: Againe hee
deſired him yet to give him another
ſigne, by lifting up his eyes; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done, they let him alone; For the
Archbiſhop had with ſtreames of teares,
powred out at his bed ſide, a moſt excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
powerfull paſſionate prayer.</p>
               <p>All this while alſo, from three a
clock in the morning untill night, there
was continuall prayer in the houſe, and
in every place where the danger was
knowne; by which his time growing
neerer and neerer, and hee weaker and
weaker; Thus did hee lie, patiently ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
betwixt death and life, unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
neceſſity, and Gods will forcing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and againe invincible courage and
magnanimity (loath to bee overcome)
ſhewing ſome indignation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37227:40"/>
of death: yea death it ſelfe (for all
his cruelty) ſtood a long while hovering
in doubt what to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo did his Highneſſe
young yeares, his Triumphes at hand,
the teares, and exceeding ſorrow of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Mother, Brother, Siſter, the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
cries of his Servants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the
whole Land (who ſaid, her loſſe, above
all was moſt unſpeakeable) move his
hard heart to pitty: But a greater crie
before this, having outcried thoſe cries
(even the crie of our ſinnes) there was
no remedy: for death (although un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing)
not being able to reſiſt the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
decree, muſt needs ſtrike the cruell
ſtroke; Many times did hee from that
morning untill night offer to ſhoote and
thruſt in his dart a little, yet pulling it
preſently back againe, as it were of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
delaying the time, expecting ſome
mercifull Meſſage from Heaven, untill
at laſt the cloudy night bewraying the
irrevocable doome, by natures decay,
the exceſſe of paine having taken away
the ſenſe thereof, of meere pitty, that
thereby hee might open unto him the
doore of Heaven for his paſſage into
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37227:40"/>
glory, being loath that the Angell,
(who had long attended to convey his
Soule unto Heaven, ſhould make any
longer ſtay) he thruſt his Dart quite tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
After which, his Highneſſe quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
gently, and patiently, halfe a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or thereabouts, before eight a clocke
at night, yeelded up his Spirit unto his
Immortall Maker, Saviour, and Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
being attended unto Heaven, with as
many Prayers, Teares and ſtrong Cries,
as ever Soule was, on Fryday the ſixth of
<hi>November,</hi> 1612. The Corps ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as the Cuſtome is) was laide along
upon a Table on the floore, being the
faireſt, cleareſt, and beſt proportioned,
without any kinde of ſpot or blemiſh,
as ever was ſeene.</p>
               <p>On the Morrow after came the Lords
of the Councell, by appointment from
his Majeſtie, to give order for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Body, &amp;c. which was the
ſame night effected, about five a clocke
in the Evening, in preſence of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
and Chirurgions who aſſiſted the
Cure, together with the Phiſitian of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37227:41"/>
Prince Palatine, with many other
Knights, and Gentlemen, in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
where he dyed, by the Chyrurgeons
of his Majeſtie, and his late Highneſſe,
under all their hands, as followeth.</p>
               <p>The skinne like that of a dead man,
blacke; but no way ſpotted with black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or pale markes, much leſſe marked
with purples like flea-bites, which could
ſhew any contagious or peſtilentiall Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome.
About the place of his kidnyes,
hips, and behind the thighes, full of red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and by reaſon that with great
paine he had a long while lien upon his
backe, his belly ſomewhat ſwollen and
ſtretched out, by reaſon of the windineſſe
which iſſued out of the ſmalleſt opening
made in the Navill, ſomewhat high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
incontinently the belly falling;
The ſtomacke whole and wholeſome
within and without, having never all his
ſickeneſſe time beene troubled with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings,
loathings, or yealpings, or any
other accident which could particularly
ſhew that it was attainted. The Liver
without, in his higheſt parts marked with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37227:41"/>
ſmall ſpots, and in the lower with ſmall
blackiſh lines, paller and blacker then
was fitting; The Gall, Bladder, void of
of any humour, full of wind: The Spleen
on the top, and in the lower end black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,
filled with a blacke heavy blood:
The Kidneies faire, and without any ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh.
The Midriffe under the Filme, or
Membrane, containing the heart (which
contained a little moiſture) ſpotted with
blacke, as it were a Leadiſh colour, by
reaſon of the bruiſing: The lungs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
for the greateſt part blacke, the
reſt all ſpotted with blacke, all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed,
and full of a duſt blood, with
a corrupt and thicke ſerocitie, which by
a vent made in the body of the Lungs,
came forth foaming in great abundance;
in which doing, and in cutting the ſmall
skinne which invironeth the heart, to
ſhew the ſame, the Surgeon by chance
having cut the Trunck of the great veine,
the moſt part of the bloud iſſued out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Cheſt, leaving the lower veines
empty; upon ſight whereof the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
did draw conſequents of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
heat and fulneſſe, the which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
yet more evident in this, that the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37227:42"/>
windepipe with the throat and tongue
were convered with a thicke blackeneſſe,
and amongſt other accidents, the tongue
cleft, and dry in many places: The heart
ſound and dry, in all appearance, good
in all his quallities.</p>
               <p>The hinder veines which are in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
filme of the braine, called <hi>Piamater,</hi>
ſwolne and ſtuft with aboundance of
blood, a great deale more then naturall;
the ſubſtance of the braine faire and
cleare, but the ventricles thereof full of
a cleare water, which after the inciſion
ranne foorth in great aboundance: One
part of which accidents (as they thought)
was ingendred, onely by reaſon of the
Fever maligne, by reaſon of the putrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of divers humors gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a long time before, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
not being ſubject to any dangerous
ſickeneſſe by birth; the other part, by
reaſon of the convulſions, reſoundings
and benummings, which by reaſon of
the fulneſſe, choaking the naturall heat,
and deſtroying the Vitals, by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignitie,
have conveyed his Highneſſe to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37227:42"/>
the grave, without any token or accident
of poyſon.</p>
               <p>Thus (or very neere thus) loſt wee
the delight of mankind, the expectation
of Nations, the ſtrength of his Father,
and glory of his Mother, Religions ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
hope; Fooliſh people immagine
that they have done enough, when they
have railed upon the Phyſitians, as
though they could have altered Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
by prolonging his life, never tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beholding the Omnipotent power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving
him, which although in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
untill the blow was given, could
not be ſeene, yet now (even of the blind)
may be eaſily diſcerned. And I pray you,
if we narrowly looke upon the practiſe
of the meanes, what omiſſion of duty
ſhall we find therein? Some neere his
Highneſſe, together with Doctor <hi>Mayern,</hi>
at firſt called and wiſhed he might bleed,
others againe, miſliked the ſame, both
learned.</p>
               <p>The Phyſitians, although jarring at
firſt in their Propoſitions and reaſons, at
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37227:43"/>
laſt did every thing by a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
under all their hands; Nothing
was wanting, which either Art or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
could thinke thereof, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they did, they alwaies thought moſt
ſafeſt and beſt. They toiled continually
day and night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if it pleaſed not God
to give a bleſſing to the meanes, muſt
they therefore be blamed? You know
<hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> may water
but it is God that giveth the increaſe. But
imagine, there had beene any ſuch ſtrife
amongſt them, the Phyſitians, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
what ſhould we thinke thereof,
but that the God of Order will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
have his will, brought to paſſe, by
a kind of confuſion, as he overthrew the
Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> with the hoſts of <hi>Midian,</hi>
&amp;c. So in Phiſicke, when his will muſt
be done, if it pleaſe him to breake and
take away the ſtaffe of bread, not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the meanes; who, I ſay, can let
him (whoſe will muſt be our law) to doe
whatſoever he will.</p>
               <p>Indeed his Highneſſe great and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
patience, ſtriving ſo long to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermaſter,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37227:43"/>
and hide the ſame in his health,
in my judgement, did much wrong the
Phyſitians, who by reaſon of his patience,
never dreamed of his danger; as alſo
his moſt wonderfull and matchleſſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
all the time of his Sickneſſe, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no kind of froward diſpoſition; ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſhew (for any complaints were
heard of him) as though hee had never
been ſicke nor ſore. As alſo the Vrines,
which untill a little before his Death,
ſhewed no ſuch danger; with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
unknowne ſtate of his greateſt
griefe cloſely rooted in his head (as in
the opening hath beene ſeene) which
could not at firſt be fully knowne, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
too late; the picture of Death by a
ſtrange extraordinary countenance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
from the beginning poſſeſſed him:
vaine rumors alſo have beene ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
that he was poyſoned: But if the
former Diſcourſe be well conſidered, his
Death, in my judgement, will appeare to
have beene naturall, grounded upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
urgent cauſes. For the Phyſitians in
opening found no ſuch cauſe in his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
upon his skinne being no kinde of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37227:44"/>
ſpot, or any ſuch ſuſpition. To ſurmiſe
as ſome have done, that hee was poiſoned
by a <hi>Sent,</hi> conſidering the premiſes, mee
thinkes were great folly, contrary to
the opinions of all the learned, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this relation to his Majeſty, proved
him free from any ſuch infection: For
my part, my skill reacheth not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
of any thing; onely I thinke it beſt
to hold, that hee died in the rage of a
malicious and extraordinary burning
Feaver, wherein his vitals and ſenſes
were from the beginning ſo over-preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
ſtupified, and amazed, chiefely the
heart and head, which notwithſtanding
all cordials and other helpes uſed (God
not bleſſing the meanes) could never bee
releeved.</p>
               <p>The Monday after, the Right honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
the Lords of the Privy Counſell
of his Majeſty, with exceeding care came
to Saint <hi>Iameſes,</hi> to give order for all
things belonging to ſo wofull a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
according to which, the whole
Houſe, Chappell, great Chamber, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
Lobby, Privy Chamber, and Bed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37227:44"/>
Chamber were all hung in black with
all things fitting, thick ſet with Scutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Highneſſe divers Armes,
which being done, under the State in
the Chamber where hee firſt ſickened,
appointed for the Coffin, there was a
place erected above an Ell in heigth,
where it was to ſtand to bee watched
untill the Funerall; Threeſcore and tenne
Gentlemen of his Servants, ordinary
and extraordinary (which were all hee
had) being appointed night and day to
attend the ſame, tenne at a time, it being
ſo ordered that the tenne who watched
in the night, did conſtantly wait the third
day after; Meane while was order given
that the Funerall ſhould bee ſolemnized
on Monday the 7. of <hi>December</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
untill which time, I will not renew
griefes in remembring the unſpeakeable
ſorrow which was in that wofull Houſe,
now longing to doe their laſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>The time of the Funerall now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
on Thurſday the third day
of <hi>December,</hi> the Coffin was removed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37227:45"/>
from the Chamber where it ſtood all
this while, unto the Privy Chamber,
there being watched for that night. On
the morrow it was removed from thence
to the preſence Chamber, where it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
all that night untill the next
day, being Saturday at three a clock in
the afternoone, at which time his crowne
and cap of ſtate were ſet upon a cuſhion
at the head of the Coffin; after which
the Heralds marching before the ſame,
the Coffin was removed by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of his Privy Chamber unto the
great Chamber, where his Guard atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
in which it was ſet downe for the
ſpace of a quarter of an houre; thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being lifted againe by the foreſaid
Gentlemen, it was brought downe
ſtaires towards the Chappell, where
againe for a pretty while it was ſet
downe in the Court; where being lifted
againe, the Gentlemen of his Majeſties
Chappell ſinging mournefull ditties
before them, it was brought into the
Chappell and there placed under a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy
ſet with great Armes of the union
at full, chained with divers other Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37227:45"/>
and ſeverall Armes, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
untill the Funerall day; This
Sunday at night before the Funerall,
his repreſentation was brought (made in
ſo ſhort warning, as like him as could be)
and apparelled with cloathes, having
his creation robes above the ſame, his
cap and crowne upon his head, his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Coller, with a <hi>George</hi> about his neck,
his golden ſtaffe in his Right hand lying
croſſe a little; briefely, every thing as
hee was apparelled at the time of his
creation; which being done, it was laid
on the back on the Coffin, and faſt
bound to the ſame, the head thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſupported by two cuſhions, juſt as
it was to bee drawne along the ſtreets
in the Funerall chariot, drawne by
eight black horſes, decked with his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Scutcheons and Plumes.</p>
               <p>But now the time being come, and
all things to adorne the Triumphes of
his mournefull <hi>Hadadrimons</hi> black day,
the Funerall being foure houres in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling

(as was thought) the number of 2000.
Mourners in black; the Relation whereof
were now to no purpoſe; ſince the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
rankes, and names are already prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a booke to be ſeene; As it paſſed
along, the whole World, ſenſible and
inſenſible things, and creatures ſeemed
to mourne, and have compaſſion, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth and all; There was to bee
ſeene an innumerable multitude of all
ſorts of ages and degrees of men, women,
and children, whoſe wonderfull ſorrow
who is able to expreſſe? ſome holding
in their heads, not being able to endure
ſo ſorrowfull a ſight, all mourning,
which they expreſſed by ſeverall ſorts
of lamentation and ſorrow, ſome wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
crying, howling, wringing of their
hands, others halfe dead, ſounding,
ſighing inwardly, others holding up
their hands, paſſionately bewayling
ſo great a loſſe, with Rivers, nay with
an Ocean of teares: Well, on they came
at laſt to <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey</hi> the buriall
place, where, after the dolefull muſick
of all ſorts being ended, the Coffin was

ſeverall Armes of the Vnion chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

Herſe, <hi>Juvat ireper Altum.</hi> After
which the whole Aſſembly having
taken their places, banners, bannarets,
and penſils of all ſorts being at reſt,
after an univerſall ſilence, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (who was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to doe his Highneſſe the laſt duty)
was ſeene in the Pulpit, who with a
grave ſober countenance, ſhewing the
inward ſorrow of his heart, after a little
pauſe and prayer, did with exceeding
paſſion make the Funerall Sermon; Of
which though you write that you are
marvailous deſirous to heare the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet I am loath to ſay any thing,
fearing to wrong ſo grave and great a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37227:47"/>
Perſon; Nevertheleſſe, ſince I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
thus farre (I hope without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence)
I ſhall heere (as neere as I can
remember) rehearſe a word or two
thereof, whereby you may judge of the
reſt.</p>
               <p>The Text was out of the 82. <hi>Pſalme</hi>
the ſixt and ſeventh Verſes: <hi>I have ſaid
yee are Gods, and yee are Children of the
moſt high: But yee ſhall die as a Man, and
yee Princes ſhall fall like others.</hi> Where
after hee had moſt learnedly by way of
introduction ſpoken of the Authour, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
ſcope, and meaning of this <hi>Pſalme,</hi>
he devided the ſame into two maine bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Firſt, the Exaltation of <hi>Princes;
I have ſaid yee are Gods, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly,
in what reſpect they are ſo called: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
in the humiliation, leaſt they ſhould
bee out of meaſure exalted, he admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
proved by infinite variety of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
both divine and morall, the vanity
and inconſtancy of greatneſſe, with all
the ſhadowiſh toyes thereof; Thirdly,
for ocular proofe and uſe of all, inviting
their eyes to the preſent dolefull ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of their late ever renowned <hi>Prince,</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:37227:47"/>
who, not long agoe, was as freſh, brave,
and gallant as the beſt of them, unto
whom all the delights and pleaſures of
the World did begge for acquaintance,
lacking nothing which heart could
wiſh for, who yet now for our ſinnes
lay thus low, bereaved of life and all
being, forced to prove the truth of this
Text, not onely to fall, but to fall as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>After which, when hee had moſt
truly and excellently ſhewed a part of
his Highneſſe Excellencies, and many
Noble vertues (for all was not poſſible)
chiefely his rare and ſingular piety both
in himſelfe, and in the governement of
his Houſhould, which hee ſo extolled,
that hee profeſſed hee would not bee
aſhamed hereafter to propoſe the ſame
for a rule unto himſelfe. For conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
unto them all, hee ſhewed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
meaſure of felicity, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
had attained unto by death, and
that now in reſpect of himſelfe hee was
not to be pittied, being compared with
thoſe, who had out lived him, the ſame
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37227:48"/>
one brave ſhip lying amongſt a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of others, all tending towards one
Haven, whither at length they muſt
needs all come, or ſhip-broken periſh by
the way, which ſetting forth betimes,
as it were, new, freſh, and ſtrong, with a
faire gale of wind, arriveth quickly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any danger at the Haven of ſafety;
whereas the reſt loytering a long time
by theſe, and theſe Inticements, ſet forth
at laſt in a more dangerous ſeaſon, ſome
overladen, ſome miſſing of their way,
ſome with leakes, ſome wracked, ſome
ſtarved, ſome drowned, all exceedingly
tempeſt-beaten, with much adoe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
their deſired Haven: Even ſo, hee
ſaid, his late Highneſſe had gotten the
like advantage of all thoſe that had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived
him; all which laded with infinite
more ſinnes, indangering their ſafe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
muſt either periſh by the way,
or ſtorme beaten, arive with much toyle,
whither hee betimes with eaſe attained.
So with exhortation unto all, to make
right uſe thereof, with exceeding great
paſſion and many teares, hee ended.</p>

This very day alſo the two Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> did ſolemnize
this blacke day, with all the ſignes of
ſorrow which could be imagined, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in their two Univerſitie Churches,
Funerall Sermons, all mourning, both
in heart, habite, and countenance; the
fore-runners of which their extreame
ſorrow, long before this, in their ſeverall
Bookes of mourning <hi>Epitaphs</hi> burſt forth,
<hi>Oxford</hi> in her <hi>Iuſta Oxon:</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi>
in her <hi>Epicedium Cantabrig: &amp;c.</hi> with
divers other Orations to this purpoſe.
The Funerall Sermon in Saint <hi>Maries
Oxon:</hi> was Preached by Doctor <hi>Goodwin</hi>
Deane of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> Colledge there;
The Text being out of <hi>Eſay,</hi> the 57. 1.
<hi>The Righteous periſheth, and no man conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in his heart; and mercifull men are
taken away from the evill to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which he was not onely exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moved himſelfe, but alſo moved the
whole Univerſitie, and City, to ſhedde
fountaines of teares.</p>
               <p>The other of <hi>Cambridge</hi> was Preached
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37227:49"/>
by Doctor <hi>Carey,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Chriſts Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
and Vicechancellour of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie,
his Text being out of the ſecond
of <hi>Samuel,</hi> Chap. 3. verſe 34. the laſt
words of the Verſe: <hi>And all the people
wept againe for him.</hi> In ſpeaking whereof,
and weeping himſelfe, hee made all the
people weepe againe and againe.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhops Sermon (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid)
being ended, the Earles, Lords, and
Barons, &amp;c. by this time having offered
up their ſeverall Banners, and Honours
which they carryed; as alſo the great
Officers of his Houſe, Sir <hi>Thomas Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenor</hi>
Chamberlaine, Sir <hi>Charles Cornwallis</hi>
Treaſurer, Sir <hi>John Hollis</hi> Comptrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
together with his three Gentlemen-Uſhers,

and <hi>Iohn Lumley,</hi> having all by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
(Sir <hi>Thomas Challenor</hi> beginning)
broken their White ſtaves and Rods
croſſe-wiſe over the Coffin, thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
their places, the Aſſembly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
the Coffin with the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as is before ſaid) remaining ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Hearſe, to be ſeene of all, untill
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37227:49"/>
the 19. of the ſaid Moneth of <hi>December,</hi>
when decked and trimmed with cloathes,
as he went when hee was alive, Robes,
Coller, Crowne, Golden Rodde in his
hand, &amp;c. it was ſet up in a Chamber
of the ſaid Chappell at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Repreſentations of the Kings
and Queenes, his famous Predeceſſors,
where it remaineth for ever to be ſeene.</p>
               <p>He was of a comely tall middle ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
about five foot and eight inches
high, of a ſtrong, ſtreight well-made
body (as if Nature in him had ſhewed all
her cunning) with ſomewhat broad
ſhoulders, and a ſmall waſte, of an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Majeſticke Countenance, his haire
of an Aborne collour, long faced, and
broad forehead, a piercing grave eye,
a moſt gracious ſmile, with a terrible
frowne, courteous, loving, and affable;
his favour like the Sunne, indifferently
ſeeming to ſhine upon all; naturally
ſhamefaced, and modeſt, moſt patient,
which he ſhewed both in life and death;
ſlow to anger, that even then, when hee
was many times moſt offended, he would
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37227:50"/>
(overcomming himſelfe) ſay nothing;
mercifull he was after he had a little pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
the offendors; neither did hee
judge raſhly, but after due examination
of both parties; Diſſimulation he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
moſt baſe, chiefly in a Prince, not
willing, nor by nature being able to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
fawne, or uſe thoſe kindly who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
not his love. Quicke hee was to
conceive any thing, not raſh, but mature
in deliberation, yet moſt conſtant having
reſolved: true of his promiſe, moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
even from his youth; ſo that hee
might have beene truſted in any thing
that did not force a diſcovery: being of a
cloſe diſpoſition, not eaſie to be known,
or pried into: of a feareleſſe, noble, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke,
and undanted courage, thinking
nothing unpoſſible, that ever was done
by any: a few faire words prevailed
more with him, then all the threats of
the world: very pittifull and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
unto any in miſery, whom upon
Petition, he ever ſome way releeved.</p>
               <p>Moſt ardent in his love to Religion,
which love, and all the good cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37227:50"/>
of, his heart was bent by ſome meanes
or other (if he had lived) to have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſome way to have compounded
the unkind Iarres thereof; He well ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his love to good men, and hatred of
the evill, in diſcerning a good Preacher
from a vaine-glorious, in whom above al
things he abhorred flattery, loving and
countenancing the good; of the idle and
loytering never ſpeaking but with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine;
in which he ſhewed he had a heart
flexible to good, and al kind of goodnes,
which (as I thinke) was the cauſe one
day, he uttered this ſpeech of the Deane
of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> his Chaplaine.</p>
               <p>That he thought, whereas hee and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
like him, at their firſt entry into the
Pulpit, did looke him in the face, their
countenance did, as it were ſay unto him:
Sir, you muſt heare me diligently; you
muſt have a care to obſerve what I ſay:
As alſo in his conſtancie in obſerving the
Prayer time, duely before Dinner and
Supper, which untill his death hee never
willingly omitted, whatſoever haſte hee
had, or were it never ſo late.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:37227:51"/>
What ſhould I yet adde, his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of an Oath, that hee was never
heard (I now appeale to Envy it ſelfe)
to take Gods Name in vaine, with an
addition of any other ſeeming light,
much leſſe horrible Oathes, with full
ſwinge of paſſion; witneſſe the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Moſt Reverend, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in his Funerall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
wherein was remembred by him,
(amongſt many other things) that ever
memorable reply of his Highneſſe, who
being asked one day (by one that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rejoyced, his Highneſſe was no ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer)
why he did not ſweare in play aſwell
as others; to his eternall praiſe made this
reply, That he knew no Game worthy
of an Oath.</p>
               <p>To live long he never deſired, nor aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
many times ſaying, That it was to
ſmall purpoſe for a brave gallant man,
when the prime of his dayes were paſt, to
live ſo long untill he were full of aches,
ſoares, &amp;c. uttering contemptible ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Death; affirming many times,
that hee neither deſired, nor aſpired, or
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37227:51"/>
hoped to live long, and that when hee
ſhould be ſicke three or foure daies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then God have mercy on me, would
he ſay.</p>
               <p>Popery with all the adjuncts and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
thereof, hee hated to the death,
yet he would now and then uſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Papiſts very kindly, ſhewing that hee
hated not their perſons, but their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>I muſt not forget his love to Learning,
to the Muſes, to all the Learned who any
way did excell; to the two Univerſities,
chiefly <hi>Oxenford</hi> (becauſe mourning <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
did never injoy his preſence) whoſe
unſpeakeale ſorrow for his death, will
ſhew the great portion of his love they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.
I ſhould but increaſe ſorrow, to
tel you how exceeding kindly their Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellour,
Doctors, Graduates, and
Students were uſed, when they came to
ſee him at <hi>Woodſtock;</hi> What care he had to
give them contentment, how carefull he
was, and what ſpeciall commands were
generally given throughout the whole
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37227:52"/>
houſe, that they ſhould not want the
ſame; of his mild and grave carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, and his loving ſpeeches in
their abſence.</p>
               <p>No leſſe carefull hee was to obey
the King his Father in every thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo very diligent to obſerve and
honour the Queene his Mother, ſo much
as in him lay, or as poſſible hee might;
wiſe hee was to know and not know,
ſee and not ſee, almoſt every thing which
was done or ſaid. Wonderfull was his
care and wiſedome in governing of his
houſe, and revenewes, giving order and
ſeeing every thing done almoſt himſelfe,
ſo that ſcarce were there any of his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Servants whom hee did not know
by name, amongſt whom there was
not one knowne or ſuſpected Papiſt;
his care being ſo great, that all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicantes
names ſhould bee written up,
that hee might know if there were any,
that would not receive.</p>
               <p>So that I may moſt truly affirme,
that ſince the beginning of Princes no
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:37227:52"/>
houſe did ever exceede him in all things;
His Revenewes hee left increaſed by
thouſands a yeare; Sparing hee was, yet
liberall where either honeſty, deſert, or
poverty did move him; neither (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the World thinke) was hee ever
knowne to give away any thing, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
any thing but upon mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration;
As for thoſe penſious which
hee gave a little before his death, they
were either given to ſuch as had very
well deſerved them, or who having ſpent
their meanes in his ſervice, hee could not
out of his Noble diſpoſition but relieve,
thinking it better to doe ſo, then beſtow
upon them other unknowne ſuites and
leaſes, which otherwiſe hee muſt needs
have done; Hee was loving and kind to
Strangers, whoſe hearts upon ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
hee did eaſily gaine. In ſtate
matters and petitions not pertaining unto
him, hee was ever ſparing and not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to meddle: In his owne affaires
touching coppy-holds, leaſes, or any
thing of like nature, whatſoever abuſes
were, hee ever redreſſed, or minded to
helpe, upon petition of the party aggree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:37227:53"/>
Friday being the day wherein hee
died (I know not by what naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
or motion) hee did not of a long
time before his death love, miſliking it
above all the dayes of the weeke, upon
which hee would not willingly uſe any
kind of exerciſe, or ride any journey,
ſometimes not ſo much as play at cards
thereon, alleaging that hee continually
found ſome indiſpoſition upon that day,
and that hee never had good luck upon
a Friday, ſuch an ominous conceit of the
diſmalneſſe of this day having poſſeſſed
him, which at length proved to bee
the period of his dayes.</p>
               <p>He loved and did mightily ſtrive to
doe ſomewhat of every thing, and to
excell in the moſt excellent; Hee greatly
delighted in all kind of rare inventions
and arts, and in all kind of Engines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Warres, both by Sea and
Land: In the bravery and number of
great horſes; in ſhooting and levelling of
great peeces of Ordnance; in the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and marſhalling of Armes; in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and gardening, and in all ſorts of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37227:53"/>
rare muſique, chiefely the trumpet and
drumme; in limming and painting, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
in all ſorts of excellent and rare
Pictures, which hee had brought unto
him from all Countries.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſay more of him? over
and above all theſe things, hee had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
kind of extraordinary unſpeakeable
excellency, my fraile penne and dull
ſtile not being able to expreſſe the ſame,
gathered (out of queſtion) by him long
agoe from the plentifull Garden of the
King his Fathers all admired <hi>Bazilicon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n,</hi>
long ſince in his youth dedicated
unto him.</p>
               <p>I dare ſweare, none will thinke an ill
thought, much leſſe ſpeake an ill word
of him, unleſſe it bee ſome <hi>Ianus</hi>-faced
Machivillian, or hollow hearted Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powderers,
who as they would have
blowne up King, Progeny, and State,
cannot chooſe now but barke againſt
him, who was a terrour to all the Papiſts
in Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:37227:54"/>
As hee was a Man, no queſtion but
hee had imperfectious as others (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
hee could not have converſed with
men) which I profeſſe, I neither knew,
nor delighted to ſearch after; or if I had,
you know of all others, I am rather
boud to cover and conceale the ſame
with <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> then with <hi>Ham</hi>
to ſhew his nakedneſſe; If I were able,
yet certainely whatſoever they were,
ſuch a number of noble vertues did cover
and weigh downe the ſame, eclipſing
their light, that they could not eaſily
bee perceived, unleſſe it were perhaps
by ſome maliciouſly bent, who though
they might have gathered great ſtore
of honey, have rather choſen (like
droanes) to open the gall; whom I alſo
leave to the gall of bitterneſſe untill it
conſume them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now ſince his Soule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
in Heaven (whereof I intreat
you doubt not) let us alſo leave him;
For his good life in generall, his unfaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
love to Religion, his love to good
men, his ſound, and ſaving knowledge,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37227:54"/>
and practice of the ſame, his attentive
and reverent hearing of the word, his
humble flexible heart eaſily caſt downe,
and drawne by the ſame, with many
other good things, which were in him,
are ſure ſignes of the favour of God, and
conſequently of his ſalvation. To
which if wee conſider with what innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
prayers, and ſtrong cries, his
ſoule was attended unto Heaven, wee
may reſt fully ſatisfied of his felicity;
For although the extremity of paine
from the beginning of his ſickneſſe, did
as it were ſtupifie and bereave him of
ſence, that hee could not give thoſe
wiſhed teſtimonies to the World at full;
(the Lord chooſing to try him in the
furnace of affliction) yet ſince wee ſhall
bee judged not according to our death,
but according to our life (although his
death in ſuch an extremity, as is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was very good, wee may certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude, that his Soule now praiſeth
God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when we miſſe him where
we were wont to ſee him, let us lift up
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37227:55"/>
our mindes to a higher Watch-tower, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that his Soule now reſteth in
Heaven, where all cares, troubles, ſoares,
ſickeneſſes, croſſes, and afflictions, ſhall
no more annoy him; where the feares,
jarres, jealouſies, diſcontentments, mute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
uproares, &amp; diſſentions of State ſhall
never vex him; where he ſhall hunger no
more, thirſt no more, deſire no more, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all tears wiped from his eies, in place
of thoſe fraile ones, which could not here
indure the ſight of the Candle, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding

injoying the bleſſed fruition of his God,
in the company of Millions of his Saints
and Angels, waiting for the full revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and felicitie of the Sonnes of God,
and renovation of us all, when God ſhal
be All in All; where let us leave him
(of whom we are not worthy untill we
be gathered unto him) admiring his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
Wiſdome which did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
us, untill he let us know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
how hee will bring light out of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37227:55"/>
darkeneſſe: For ſince he is goodneſſe it
ſelfe, his will (whatſoever it be) muſt
needs be good; And I pray you, what,
how many, how great, and how wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things hath the Almighty done with
this one blow, in humbling of ſome, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the pride of others, caſting ſome
downe, and againe in raiſing up of others;
letting all ſee, as in a Mirrour, the vaine
inconſtancie of Greatneſſe, making ſome
others inexcuſable, if they receive no
good from ſo ſenſible a Leſſon, with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
moe, knowne onely to the All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
All-ſeeing Majeſtie.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore admire the infinite and
incomprehenſible Wiſdome of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, which ſo ſoone tranſlated him
from this Vale of darkneſſe, and miſery,
into that marvellous joy and light, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh
it ſeem ſtrange unto our blind eies:
For what know we but that the boyling
head-ſtrong paſſions of youth, evill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
(which corrupteth good manners)
the raines of Liberty, the corruption of
time, with infinite other inticements,
whereunto fleſh and blood are prone,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37227:56"/>
might have corrupted him, when dying
with a conſumed body, and a more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Soule, he might with an evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
(though ful of years) have gone to
the grave, with farre more hatred, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with innumerable more ſinnes, then
now he did; when by the contrary, with
the love, prayers, and teares of all, hee
was attended unto Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thus have I beene bold to trouble
you, and out of my love (for ſatisfying
your curioſity) to exceede the bounds of
