         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In this true spirit of Prophecy, did <hi>Solomon</hi> (with his Father <hi>David,</hi> and other Saints) <hi>find out and set in order many right words, words of Truth, given from one Shepherd,</hi> Eccl. 12. 10, 11. <hi>The spirit of the Lord, the rock of</hi> Israel, <hi>spake to and by</hi> David. <hi>His Word,</hi> saies he, <hi>was in my tongue,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 2, 3.

Man and Angel, in the utmost wisdom of their own nature, are bounded with first-creation vanities, for Object; of which number, its very self is; and they, therein.

               <p>The doubling of the words, <hi>Vanity of vanities,</hi> is emphatical, more strongly asserting this irrefragable Truth, That vain are all things in the first-creation world, or natural state of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.

If we narrow or confine its significancy to meer visible outward naturals, and call the upper sort of Vanities (the invisible excellencies of natural Man or Angel) Spiritual, we blaspheme also, by thrusting them into the room, and giving them the Title of the New-creation things of God. <hi>Flesh and Spirit, natural and Spiritual,</hi> in Scripture, are the distinguishing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of all natural first-creation life and <hi>things</hi> thereof, in Angel or Man; and of <hi>the things of God,</hi> in the second.

               <p>If the natural life of Angel and Man, set up in both, by the first-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had bin immortal, unchangable, eternal, every one of them had infallibly bin saved.

All had infallibly perished, for ever. None will now so perish, but such as finally refuse to part with and lose their fading life and things, in the first creation, for Gods everlasting crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life, wisdom, righteousnes, and glory, in the second. Misse but the true extent and bounds of the word all, in this saying, <hi>all is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and we misse all, as to the main scope and design of this Book.

For so, he perfectly excludes the true spiritual <hi>things of Christ and God, and shuts up the kingdom of Heaven</hi> (Mat. 23. 13.) excludes all the truths or things thereof, out of his doctrine. Then, <hi>the whole counsel of God,</hi> about the salvation of man <hi>is counted foolishnes and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by him.</hi> Where will man be, when <hi>God is Judge himself?

               <p>Satan is ready to suggest; and man, as ready to believe, there is some <hi>new thing</hi> in the but renewed old nature of man, beyond what, at first, was in it. All men are experimental witnesses of Satan's first lie to <hi>Eve,</hi> that the life of nature, given in the first-creation, was eternal; and, that <hi>they should not Die at all.</hi> No such thing as Death, incident to it. But, this life, renewed and confirmed by the second <hi>Adam,</hi> sayes Satan (and Man joynes in it) is Eternal. But, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and warranting man safe in the established life and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of restored nature, is Satans doctrine, and Man's accursed other Gospel. Christ restores mans lost first-covenant law-life; Satan asserts this to be a Gospel state, and man agrees, to take it so, and look no farther, for salvation. As soon as any are renewed by Christ, into some degree of the lost righteous life of nature, Satan is at their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, with the same lying Suggestion, as to <hi>Eve,</hi> this is Eternal Life, <hi>ye shall not Die at all. Paul</hi> (not without a cause) <hi>was afraid and Jealous of the Serpents thus beguiling the Corinthians, through his subtilty, as he did Eve,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 2, 3. This is his <hi>other Gospel,</hi> in a perfect contrariety to every tittle of Christ's (v. 4) <hi>another Jesus, another spirit</hi> and state of life, for salvation, <hi>in</hi> direct <hi>contradiction to all, Paul preached;</hi> which, nor <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any true Gospel-preacher, ought to let passe, undiscovered and uncontrolled. Fixing in nature, at best, for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is union with the Devil, in unchangable <hi>enmity to God,</hi> and his new-creature spirit, in which, ever, any could be saved. Under Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans reign, nature is seldom fully restored in man, from <hi>filth of flesh.</hi> And, <hi>filth of spirit,</hi> or <hi>enmity to God</hi> and his spirit of truth, is inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable from the highest restorations of it, till the Reign of Christ. Yet, under all these disadvantages, and shortnesses of primitive purity, is it, when restored, asserted to be better and safer then that,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37441:12"/>
for Salvation. This, Satan most wickedly suggests, and Man most foolishly believes, to his own destruction, as he will find, at winding up. Thus <hi>Satan and his Apostles, transformed into the likeness of Christ and his,</hi> in word and language, preach up restored nature, a-fresh, for a currant Gospel-state of absolute salvation; in which, men are under an absolute impossibility of ever finding it. <hi>All the inticing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive words</hi> of Satan's and Man's serpentine and humane wisdom, look, and run this way. Scripture interrogatories are the strongest assertions. <hi>Is there anything new,</hi> any <hi>newnes of life,</hi> in mans restored Old? nothing of it. whatever can be found in this restored state, <hi>has bin already of Old time, before us,</hi> in the unstained purity of it, in Adam, who yet was not fence-proof against Satans charming wiles, and power. Twas then, perfect, in its kind; rarely yet so, since. Twas but a corruptible perfection of a loseable goodness. And, lost it was. Most vain; mad and unprofitable then, is all Man's labour, since the fall, in seeking for, asserting (or undertaking to prove) eternal spiritual life, to be found in fading natural.

He had the start and vantage-ground of all others, in his day, for finding true hapiness in worldly vanities, if any such thing were ever to be found, therein. What, litteral or mystical, all visible or invisible Riches and Glories of that sort, signified, or amount unto, he had so full an experience, that for any to think or hope to find therein, what he could not, is madness. The King, here, may also point back to the first, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the second <hi>Adam,</hi> in our <hi>flesh, made under the Law,</hi> as the first. Both first and second <hi>Adam,</hi> in <hi>holy flesh, life of the Law, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Man, were greater then Solomon,</hi> in the first-creation Principle of life and action, and free from enmity to the second. The first could not secure his standing, in that changable principle. The second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to attempt it, but surrendred and let it fall (for that principle
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37441:20"/>
of unchangable righteousness, in which he could) as the first ought to have done. <hi>He would not be a Judg, Ruler, or King,</hi> in the former, <hi>as the</hi> professing <hi>Jews,</hi> in that spirit, <hi>would have had him, who crucified him for owning himfelf a King, in the latter,</hi> wherein the Son of God. Yet, such a King, will he shew himself to be, to their sorrow, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no. What can men hope for, in but some gradual restorings of that life of nature, they had in perfection, untinctur'd also with <hi>filth of spirit, or enmity to God, and the power of godliness, in his spirit of grace,</hi> which lurk's under the highest restored <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Man, or form of godliness,</hi> in his spirit of nature? <hi>Adam,</hi> in innocency, had not eternal life; <hi>and God took away what he had,</hi> his fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for his sinfull keeping it up against (and refusing to surrender it in exchang for) his everlasting life. If what was <hi>Adam's</hi> sin, to do, be asserted the duty he ought to have done (to Wit, the keeping what he had, and where he was) what instructions are we like to have, towards the avoiding <hi>a sinning after the similitude of his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression?</hi> And they that confine the Death of the second <hi>Adam</hi> to his body, denying the surrender and Death of his spirit, as to its first-covenant Life of the Law, will teach the <hi>pittying, sparing,</hi> and keeping up of <hi>that</hi> (<hi>as Satan, by Peter, counselled Christ himself</hi>) to be the very way of salvation. Thus runs the doctrine of Satan's and Man's other Gospel, in a flat contradiction to Christ's, in every point.</p>

Again, a man, weak and shallow in his natural Powers, and uncultivated by Education, Reading and Converse with better Understandings, is a Fool, to a man of deep Natural Judgement, quickness of Mind, of a soaring searching Capacity, and great Reach, advanced also by Learning and Converse. This Fool and wise Man may both be found, and oft are, in the but heathenish spirit of nature, and that, in the corrupt, rebellious state thereof, walking contrary to such, and to all light and wisdom, natural and spiritual.

The loss of all, as obediently surrendred to the sacrificing hand, Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-cross, Sword and Fire of God's High Priest, is our only way of being delivered from all evil, of sin or punishment, for ever. And, on such obedience, <hi>we shall</hi> certainly <hi>receive the promise of the Father,</hi> the everlasting creature-life and <hi>spirit of the Son,</hi> which will fill us with all good, for ever, above wonder.</p>
               <p>Is not here <hi>great Gain,</hi> on all hands, to encourage us to bear such loss, the spiritual Law of the Cross, and ordinances of God's new-creation sanctuary call for, as undispensably necessary for our admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or entrance thereinto?

Man's unspeakable advantage; never sold or parted with, from love to what's to be parted with for it, but to Man's unspeakable loss. <hi>Buy the Truth,</hi> therefore, at any rate; but <hi>Sell it, at no rate,</hi> though <hi>all the kingdom's of this World and glory of them</hi> (all natural, humane or Angelical excellencies) be bidden for it. <hi>Paul,</hi> when eminent in first-covenant holines, <hi>parted with all, as dung,</hi> for this Truth. All that have tried this most gainfull traffique, have found it so. No active obedience, performable in Man's own nature, ever does his work for salvation; but, passive; a right ceasing from that life, with all its activity and labours. Should a Man live a thousand years twice told, in the utmost fruitfulnes of his rectified naturals, he will still find <hi>Solomon's</hi> account true; <hi>all vanity.

All changable goodnes, earthly, first-creation Life and Fruits, first or last, must passe away, from obedient Saints, and incorrigible sinners, in God's Love or Wrath. This <hi>fiery triall, seem's grievous,</hi> at present, to nature, in Saints; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. Our nature, in <hi>Christ</hi> himself, <hi>was sorrowfull to death;</hi> cast out a word, for scaping the Death-Cup, but he instantly called it back. <hi>His</hi> living <hi>Soul,</hi> of the same kind with the first <hi>Adam's, was</hi> sorely put to't, made <hi>exceeding sorrowful,</hi> under the death-work of his <hi>second-Adam's quickning-spirit,</hi> or gospel-sword and fire upon it; <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 38, 39. Obedient submission to God's present, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Wrath, in this case, is the only possible way of deliverance, from his <hi>Eternal; the Wrath to come.</hi> All willful refusers of the former, are sure to meet with the latter. Those that with <hi>Paul, received Gods</hi> just <hi>sentence of Death within them,</hi> On their naturals, at best, have unspeakably the best on't. Those that please themselves a-while in resisting and scaping it, fall under it for ever. <hi>The sufferings and shame</hi> brought on the natural man <hi>of the Saint, are not to be compared with the joy and glory</hi> of spiritual life, <hi>that follows.</hi> Nor does the present

false joy, stiffnecked resisters of the Cross (or holy Ghost, in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing operation upon their naturals) please themselves with, signify any thing, in comparision of the griefs, torments, and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of spirit, this crosse will bring upon them, in Eternal Death. The demolishing-work of the Cross, is grievous to nature, in Saints, at present: but, in no comparison so grievous as 'twil be to it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious resisters; and that, for ever. True Saints soon find the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their obediently sacrificed nature, by a resurrection out of the death of that, into the everlasting righteous life of the sacrificing high Priest of their Gospel-profession; <hi>Melchisedeck.</hi> So have they <hi>eternal life abiding in them, the Kingdom of Heaven within them, live and walk in Christ's kingdom-spirit,</hi> the Gospel-principle of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting righteousness. Thus, by submitting to the temporary wrath at present (brought upon them, in God's everlasting kindness) <hi>do they scape the wrath to come.</hi>

This <hi>filth of spirit cleaves</hi> fast <hi>unto all,</hi> and is inseperable from Man's nature, since the first sin of it.

In all his fading natural excellencies and perfections, he had no glory, to these beautiful new-creation Lilies, that excel. Men yield up all their fading natural life and fruits to Christ, as <hi>the man, the spirit of everlasting righteousness; or to the Devil, the Man of sin and everlasting</hi> wickedness. If to Christ, he offers all up, in sacrifice to God. If to Satan, he sets up and uses all, in unchangable enmity to God.

These, sinned against, and not hearkned to, vex and torment them, taking from them such full un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed delights and uninterrupted pleasure, as they desire to find in their earthly life, will, and way. Gods spiritual conviction-light (given in mercy) finally rebelled against, is, in wrath, kept up in their consciences, as a <hi>never dying Worm, that will torment them,</hi> to all eternity, witnessing against themselves, as unpardonably guilty; and for God, as most just, <hi>in his unquenchable wrath</hi> upon them; <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 44.

Their fall, evil Change, and Punishment, lies in this. They retain all the Natural Life, Glory, and Excellencies of their First-Created State, as by their wilful Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and God's Righteous Judgment, turn'd into (and used in) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable <hi>Enmity to God. They kept not their first Estate, but left their own Habitation;</hi> Jude 6. What was that? A State of Unstain'd Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Purity, and of changable Obedience (in their Wavering Natural Principle) to Spiritual Light, by which, cleerly shew'd and offered an Unchangably Righteous Creature-Life, by a New-Creation,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37441:33"/>
on the Obedient-Surrender and loss of their Changable. The Lord was pleas'd to deal more favourably with Man (as of less Natural Capacity, and so, under lower Spiritual Conviction then Angels; and then also, as Over-reach'd and Overset by the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Subtilty and Power of the Evil Angel) taking from him the Fading Righteous Life, Wisdom, Excellencies, and Corruptible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his Inferiour, Humane Nature; not leaving him them, to Fight with against himself, as he did, to the Evil Angels. But, when this Life (with the things thereof) is gradually Restor'd by the Redeemer, in Men, Satan is presently at the same point, with them, as with Eve (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3.) that <hi>they shall not die, at all;</hi> they have Eternal Life. Though it was not so, in the first <hi>Adam;</hi> yet, when Restor'd by the Second, and Men Confirm'd or Establish'd therein, by him, it is. Indeed, this Fixing, Establishing Doctrine to (and work upon) them, is Satan's, not Christ's. For, it fixes them in unchangable enmity to Christ's Gospel-spirit, and all his Gospel-things or truths. <hi>Adam'</hi>s attempt and design, for keeping up the Righteous Life he was Created in (and thence, Refusing to Surrender, and part with it, for what was Presented to him <hi>in the Tree of Life</hi>) was his very Sin.

And then, as to the second <hi>Adam;</hi> Let his original Creature-nature or Spirit (<hi>Set up</hi> by himself, in Personal Union with his divine, <hi>From Everlasting, Prov.</hi> 8. 23.) be denied; and the very Creation (in effect, or rather in the

Angels are compleated in their personal Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any such thing as Man's Earthly Body or Life. The Spirit of Man (before it enters the Body, or after departed out of it) is not the Compleat Person of a Man. For, Man consists of <hi>Spirit, Soul, and Body,</hi> as distinct Essential parts of his being, <hi>which Paul</hi> distinctly <hi>Pray's, may, in Saints, be Preserved blameless, unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 23. <hi>The whole Spirit of Man</hi> Comprehends, in its make, a Dormant Souly, Animalish Life.

At the death of the Body, <hi>this Soul</hi> (or Souly Life) <hi>ceases,</hi> as to exercise; lies dormant, again, in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as before it's entrance thereinto. So, till the Resurrection of the whole Man, the <hi>Spirits</hi> even <hi>of Just Men made perfect</hi> in Spiritual New-Creation Life, Act and Converse, as pure Intellectual Powers, Intuitively, after the manner of Angels, only. Now, as there's a time for the Birth of Man's Body; so, from the frail materials, and constituting Ingredients of it, is there an appointed time for its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution; and so, for the Death of the Man, by a Seperation of his essential parts. This is a truth, universally experienc'd and known by all. And, the like Vicissitudes and Seasons are appointed for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of this greater Visible World, without Man, as well as lesser World, the Sum and Abridgment of all, within him.</p>

When this is at its height, Approaches God's appointed Season (from the perishing Materials thereof) for <hi>plucking it up, breaking it down, and Slaying it.</hi> This Season is attended with Man's <hi>Weeping and Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> as the Consequents thereof.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37441:36"/>
inevitably incident to his body. In the declining state thereof, is he reduced to a kind of equality with Childhood, as debilitated in the exercise of his rational Powers, in and by bodily Organs or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Brain, Animal spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So, <hi>if he come to 70 or 80 years, his</hi> decayed <hi>strength</hi> affords him little <hi>but labour and sorrow</hi> (Psal. 90. 10.) as finding himself to have out-lived the brisk and vigorous exercise of that Reason, by which distinguished from brute Beasts. In this case, 'tis man's duty, and wisest course, to fall in, and comply with God's twofold dispensation upon his fleshly body, by willingly owning and submitting to the decay's thereof, in God's latter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing work upon it, for <hi>pulling it down,</hi> as well as to be found <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and delighting in his</hi> former <hi>planting and building up of the same.</hi> 'Tis man's gross folly, to struggle and contend for an impossibillity, even the keeping up of that, which he sees, by an inevitable Law of necessity, must be laid down.

               <p>Come we, now, to the Mystery of all this. All the methods of God's wisdom in his dealings with man's body (or bodily life, the outward part of his natural man) are typical to the like methods and dispensations to his immortal spirit, considered in the but mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, first-covenant, natural righteous Life thereof, planted in it, by the first creation. A birth, life, death, and buriall are incident to this also, as God's appointments to it.

Neither of them, as they came out of their Creator's hands, were found in <hi>enmity to God,</hi> or the life of his spirit of Grace (though they had it not) till they both sinn'd, and fell. The voluntary evil, rebellious use of their own mind, introduced this enmity to God's. Changable enmity, in man, is now inseperable from his life.

But, what? Have Gospel-Saints all truth, and First-Covenant Saints, none? Can any believe this? Yet, most true. Let but the Scripture-sense of truth, be duly considered, as the Character of the Gospel Spirit and words thereof, in distinction from the Law-Spirit of this World (in all its variety) and words thereof, the Wonder at (and unbelief of) this, would cease.

Every individual man therefore is fitly call'd a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosm, or little World; an Epitome or Compound of all, found in the greater, without him. And, all these Lives in him, are mortal; <hi>All, vanity.</hi> The very righteous first-covenant Life of his immortal spirit (whether in the intuitive, inorganical; or rational, organical operations thereof) is mortal too. All men are witnesses of this, by the death and loss of it in all, for the first sin of all, in, and with the first. Yet farther; One sort of Life, Man has, that's not found in the whole Macrocosm, or greater World, without him; a Life of rational-sense, exercised in and by his Body. Neither Angel, nor Beast have this; no Creature, above or below him. The Result, from God's uniting Man's Spirit, and fitly organiz'd Body, is called <hi>a living Soul;</hi> Gen. 2. 7. 1 Cor. 15. 45. <hi>The Soul</hi> (Souly or animalish Life) sleep's (or remain's dormant and unexercised) in the Spirit, when departed, till a re-union with its Body, at <hi>the Resurrection,</hi> whether <hi>of Life or Damnation; John</hi> 5. 29. The essentials of Man, <hi>Body, Soul, and Spirit</hi> (whatever suspension of exercise, or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary alteration be incident to any of them) make up the discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating form of Man, from all other Creatures, in both Worlds, for ever, in Earth, Heaven, or Hell. Man's corruptible Body, at first, made of dust, receiv'd an additional frailty by his sin, in the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate state of his whole Nature. The Spirit departed out of it, it soon moulder's into dust. Then does Man cease from the exercise of Bodily Life, as well as the Beast, when he dies. In this, therefore, Man has <hi>no pre-heminence above a Beast. For, he</hi> is made of the same materials, <hi>has the same Breath in his Nostrils,</hi> and comes to the same end. The Beast receives his animation, by the quick'ning up of a meer sensual Life in his Body. So, his Spirit never has its Body again; nor any Life above, and without it: but ceases for ever.

Why should this Sworn Mortal Enemy of Saints, be troubled at Christ's comming as an Enemy upon them, too? He know's, why. Christ comes to kill and offer up his party, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man, Life, and Will, in them, in Sacrifice to God. And, he know's a Gospel-Spirit and Principle of Life and Action, will be set up in them, in the room thereof, <hi>that's</hi> Wiser and <hi>Stronger then he; which he can never</hi> reach, or <hi>touch;</hi> Jo. 4. 4. and 5. 18. This is the Thing, the Life, he unchangably hates, and dread's. 'Tis the Friend of the World and Devil, and Enemy of God, in the Saint, that Christ cast's into the fiery Furnace of his Cross, to destroy. And, this <hi>Destruction of</hi> Man's <hi>Flesh</hi> (or fleshly natural Life and State) <hi>makes</hi> way for his <hi>Salvation in God's Spirit. This Devil, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, is not cast out, but by Fasting and Prayer.</hi> (Mat. 17. 21.) the Impoverishing of nature, the Mourning-State, and Death thereof, at best; an abstinence from all the Serpents Diet, all worldly desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables; and earnest <hi>Prayer,</hi> for; and labour of the Spiritual Mind, after <hi>the never-perishing Meats,</hi> at Christ's Heavenly Table. When Satan observ's Man, in a long course of Faithful Obedience to Law-Light, and can't fix him there, but find's in him a dangerous Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to obey God's farther, Gospel-Light (as giving notice of a better State, yet, in the new-Creation Life or <hi>Land of Promise;</hi> and so also, fair warning of Christ's Approach with his Cross, on that Law-Life, he long own'd him in) he bestirr's himself, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (might and Main) to cause him to resist the work (and so, prevent the effects) of this Cross. <hi>Job</hi> was sore put to't, for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, under the demolishing, death-work thereof. And Satan was

in a wonderful toss, through fear of what matters might come to, with him. <hi>That which</hi> Job <hi>fear'd, did come upon him</hi> (Job. 3. 25.) the Death of his Law-State, at best. And, that which Satan chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear'd, came upon him, too; the Life of Christ's <hi>Gospel-Spirit, that's greater then he.</hi> One First-Covenant Saint (fix'd in <hi>Holy Flesh,</hi> and the Law-Life thereof, against God's Holy Spirit, and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Life and words thereof) becomes a more Useful, Creditable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, for his Service, against the Gospel, then a thousand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Persons, in the corrupt nature, that have no colour of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, about them.

The natural Man, in the saint himself, is in a union of mind and Judgment, with Enemies without, also, against his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mind; the fleshly Warrier, in every desire, thought, lust, and motion, against it; <hi>alway's for War, no Peace</hi> to be had with it; <hi>Psal.</hi> 120. 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 1-20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 1.

So, in their sight, was he most <hi>despicable, as the off-scouring of all things.</hi> And this seemingly deplorable condition, will be more the lot of Saints, <hi>in the last Age of this World,</hi> then ever, before. <hi>Ezekiel'</hi>s natural Man, could not see the possibility of spiritual <hi>Israel'</hi>s <hi>recovery out of the desolate State of dry Bones in a Valley,</hi> then, or now; <hi>but said, in answer to the Lord's Question, thou knowest;</hi> Ezek. 37. 3. <hi>With him, what seems Impossible</hi> to Man, <hi>is Possible.</hi> This can God do. And, he reserves the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and Demonstration of his Power, herein, for such a desperate season; to fetch up Saints out of all their Visible and Invisible Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Hands; and put their Enemies <hi>Necks under their Feet;</hi> as in Type, Josua, <hi>the Kings of</hi> Canaan, <hi>under his Captains Feet;</hi> Jos. 10. 24.

They oppress them, who alone, in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est love, <hi>shew them the way of Salvation.</hi> But, this disturbs them in their large and swift steps, towards damnation.

               <p>Here's another Similitude or Comparison, to manifest the truth, already spoken to.

The less he needs, the more Covetous and Raking is he, to heap up such Treasure; the more Tenacious and Churlish, as to the free parting with any thing, to those that want. This is familiar to common Observation. Thus, is Vanity and Folly Written out, in all his Foolish Labours, Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud's, Carking Thoughts, and Sharking Practices, to heap up Wealth in his last day's, which render's them his worst; his Litteral latter end, worse then his beginning, or any other part of his Vain, Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy Life in this World. <hi>All he Labours for, is but Vanity of Vanities,</hi> Shadows of Shadows, Figures of the inward, Mystical, <hi>Laodicean Riches,</hi> heap'd up in the fruitful exercise of our own nature, in a first-covenant righteous Life.

But, <hi>How readest,</hi> or understandest <hi>thou this Law?</hi> In the first-covenant wisdom of Man, or new-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant wisdom of God? Here arises all the Dispute and difference; about the reading. As to the first <hi>Query</hi> about the Letter, <hi>Christ granted he answered right.

and ready <hi>to justify themselvs, reckon'd all this, already done by them.</hi> But indeed, nothing. For, 'tis not in the first-Covenant Spirit of the Law, but new Covenant Spirit of the Gospel, any can answer the true meaning of the Law; as <hi>Austin</hi> said. Both Lawyer and Young Man loved themselvs in the fading Law-Life of their own nature, <hi>not the Lord their God,</hi> at all, in the everlasting Gospel-Life of <hi>his spirit of Grace.</hi> This is Charact'red, in its own Oracles, by the word, or title, <hi>Love</hi> (1 Cor. 13.) as unchangably loving, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God. So, is positively asserted to be <hi>the fulfiller of the whole Law</hi> (Rom. 13. 9, 10.) on all accounts, to all intents and purposes, to God's well-pleasing, and Man's Salvation, in the comprehensive litteral and mystical meaning, sense, and requirings thereof, towards God or Man. The terms, on which 'tis possible (according to the methods and appointments of God's Wisdom) for any to receive and be possess'd of this Gospel-spirit (or principle of Life, Desire, Thought, Word, and Action) being rejected, and the Law-spirit of Nature kept up alive, in which 'tis impossible to do any of the things required, for eternal Life; what must such self-confident, vain boasters come to? In their own Law-spirit, at best (from which enmity to God is inseparable, since the fall) in stead of <hi>loving the Lord their God with all their heart, soul, strength, and mind, and their Neighbour as themselves,</hi> they'l be found to hate both God and his new-creature Gospel-spirit, the supream mystical Neighbour and Friend of God and Man, in personal union with God, and offering, personal Union with its self, unto Man. And, if unchangably fix'd in their Law-spirit, they'l, with the fallen Angels, <hi>Hate the Lord their God, and their said Neighbour, with all their heart, soul, strength,</hi> and <hi>mind.</hi> All their <hi>good words,</hi> and <hi>fair speeches,</hi> by which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselvs, and simple, undiscerning hearers (<hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 18.) all their plausible pretences of love to God, Christ, and his Gospel-Truths (by which they palliate their evil matters) will not serve their turn.</p>
               <p>This great Mystical <hi>Neighbour,</hi> Christ's Gospel-Spirit, called <hi>LOVE,</hi> is the Fountain <hi>Creature-Vine-Tree, that brings forth right Fruit,</hi> true <hi>Wine, cheering to the Hearts of God and Man,</hi> as in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thams</hi> Parable; <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 13.

               <p>The second link in this threefold Chain or Cord, imported here, may be the Union of divine and creature-nature, in Christ's person; the divine and supream creature-Form, or Image of God most high, the Infinite divine Father or Essence.</p>
               <p>The third and lowest of the three Cords or Links in this golden Chain, is found in the unchangable Union of Christ and Saints, in his new-creature-spirit.

Thus come <hi>all things to be the Saint's, as he is Christ's, and Christ God's;</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23. This, have Saints, in their lowest of these three unions.

His errand and business was, to put it to death. Passive obedience to his own Gospel-cross, Spiritual-sword, or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision-knife, was the high duty of his natural spirit and whole Man.

Christ, in his Gospel-spirit (the true principle of active obedience to God, for ever) did and said, alwayes, what was well-pleasing to to his <hi>Father</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 29.) as found in exact harmony with the very mind and will of his infinite divine spirit. <hi>He despised the shame</hi> and contempt of those that despised his Crucified natural man; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2.

other Gospel, is the very same, you call Christ's. You only come forth in an affected singularity of words, but say all the same things, we do. We Preach and own the Cross of Christ. Upon what? The corrupt Spirit of fallen nature, with the vile affections and lusts thereof. But, what say you to the Cross on your enlight'ned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd, righteous nature, made <hi>Wise, Strong, and Honourable,</hi> in Conformity to that Life of the Law, or Holy Flesh, Christ took, as Born of a Virgin?

Thus, while we all talk of, and apply Christ's Gospel-Words, to our several Saintships (natural and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, in first and second Covenant, our Holy Flesh and God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit) all seem's in a Confused Buzz and Jumble of words, to <hi>simple,</hi> undiscerning People (<hi>Ro.</hi> 16. 18.) yea, to Man's Wisdom, at best, to be one and the same thing; Christ's and <hi>Satan'</hi>s Gospel, all one.

While any do this, as ignorantly and innocently as <hi>Paul</hi> did (in Zeal for his Law-Life, or first-Covenant principle of action) why may we not hope, that they, as <hi>Paul,</hi> may (through greater Mercy, then they are yet aware of) be turn'd by Christ, into signal Preachers and owners of Christ's Gospel? But then, with <hi>Paul,</hi> they must look presently for Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, even from those they were joynt-Persecuters, with. Sure, this is an encouragement, worth noting, and may serve to wipe off the Injurious Imputations of Censoriousness, Satan's self-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Gospellers do so brand Christ's, with. Multitudes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, enamout'd wholly with Satan's, will most carefully take heed of coming neer the sound of one word of Christ's Gospel, lest they should be Perverted, to their own Salvation, and <hi>delivered from the Wrath to come.</hi> But, there are a second sort (a far smaller
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:37441:88"/>
number, yet) of Christ-haters, that can afford, sometimes, to hear the sound of true Gospel-words, but take no heed how they hear them. So, do they, little or nothing, perceive, or regard any distinction between the Voice of the true Shepherd, and that of Strangers; Christ's and Satan's Gospel. May we not reckon these shuffling <hi>Halters between God and</hi> Baal, in a more dangerous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the former? They'l boast of their Wisdom, and Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opinion they have of (almost) every body, any teachers, that take and own the letter of Christ's Gospel, and talk against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanes, or the like. These glory in their shame. Oh, thank God, say they, we have a liberty to hear any body. What's all this? A Liberty to be Mad, and Rebell against God, that has convincingly evidenc'd to them the true Shepherd's Voice, Words, or Doctrin (in and from himself and Saints) from all variety of Strangers Voices, or Doctrin. They'l please themselvs to talk much of bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; that they hope, at bottom, and as to the main, all may <hi>be</hi> well, though at top, ouvert Action, Practice, Choice, and their whole course, be of a dangerous Complexion, and that, against ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd Conviction of Christ's Gospel-truths, &amp; a kind of general owning, and worded-kindness for them, and the Assertors thereof, in a Corner. But they follow after, and sit under such Teachers and Doctrin's, as are, in all extreamity, contrary thereunto, as Hell to Heaven (sure, Doctrins of Devils are so, to Christ's) and this, when the Doctrin of Christ's Gospel, lies before them, and is fairly offered to them, in <hi>the Words of God's Wisdom, which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost teaches.</hi> A most dangerous boasted Libertinism! God defend me from such embondaging, destructive Liberty. For, 'tis sorely doubtfull, whoever <hi>halt</hi> thus <hi>between God and</hi> Baal (as to own God's Words with their Mouth only, <hi>and</hi> Baal's in their Heart) that, at bottom, they down right hate God's, and love <hi>Baal'</hi>s Gospel; like that, not only, best; but, only. What less can be feared, when their halting, brings them, at length, wholly to avoid God's offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gospel, and positively own (so far as wholly chusing to sit under Satan's, is an owning) a directly contrary Gospel? Yea, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in all extreamity; that Devils themselvs shall be saved, at long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run. Might this generally take place, all other <hi>Doctrin's of Devils</hi> might be spared. If they can get Men to swallow down this, what
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:37441:89"/>
need any other, or any care, or troubling our selvs about Religion, or Salvation, at all? We shall all be saved, say Devils, and you shall all be saved. Wee'l warrant you, ye shall fare as well as we do. I believe that. This Perswasion is the largest inlet to Rantism, that ever was devised, be Practice what it will, from a little present self-interest. How powerful and prevalent is felf-destroying self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love? The general and uniform Doctrin of Devils, is, what the old Serpent Preach'd to <hi>Eve,</hi> that Eternal Life is to be found in the first-Creation State of Man and Angel; so, no need of a second, or second Covenant Principle of Life, in flat contradiction to <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7. Men, in all variety of Church-form or way, all sorts of Pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards God, Christ, Gospel, and Salvation, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of first-Covenant Principles, are all of a Batch, all as one Man, against the true, new-Covenant Gospel of Christ, to a tittle. All spiritual Light, for discerning of Christ's from <hi>Baal'</hi>s Gospel, does but highly aggravate their Sin, in rejecting Christ's for <hi>Baal's.</hi> The Devil and his Angels had fuller Light, cleerer discerning of Christ's Gospel-Life, at first, then even <hi>Adam</hi> in his Innocency, and of the necessity of parting with their first-Covenant Law-Life, for it, as their unspeakable advantage, for the gaining Eternal Life, and scaping Eternal death; yet chose, as we find, their own eternal Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. All Men, that hate Christ's Gospel-Life, fixedly, unchangably, do the same thing; make the same evil choice, and will come to the same end; <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 36. All Men, since the fall, are (in light) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, that was below Angels before their fall, who yet made such choice as prov'd their irrecoverable Destruction. Consider this, well. And then, since the fall, is there positive En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Man's whole nature, and so in all Mankind, to the Gospel-Life of Christ, and all right words thereof; which was neither in Angel or Man, before their fall. Bare Light or knowledg then, by the best meer Enlightning Spiritual Gifts, is so far from doing our work for Salvation, that through Obstinate, Wilful, Knowing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against it, does it lay Men under far deeper and sorer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, then if they had never had such Light, or heard of Christ's Gospel, at all; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26-29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. 'Tis, indeed, the direct, full, unpardonable Sin against the Holy Ghost, if finally persisted in. Nature, in it self, corrupt or righteous, is as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Milstone, to Christ's Gospel; an Infidel, as to all the Doctrin thereof. What? <hi>Wise, Strong, and Honourable in Christ,</hi> Infidels, Unbelievers, as to Christ's Gospel?

               <p>And, as for the wicked rich ones, <hi>the Old foolish Kings,</hi> in a state Christ pronounces wo to, <hi>they streng then their hands,</hi> and confidences (against all the warnings, counsels and power of God himself) <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising,</hi> assuring, and warranting <hi>them</hi> eternal <hi>Life; Ezek.</hi> 13. 6. 22. See Christ's contrary Judgment, on both sides; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3-12. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 20--26. Men's presumptuous, self-confident Kinging it, in their own renew'd law-nature, in a wilful despite to God's Gospel-spirit of Grace, renders them a spiritual <hi>Sodom,</hi> and Synagogue of Satan. Though they impudently say, they are <hi>Jews,</hi> or the very Gospel-Church and Spouse of Christ (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 9.) They lie; or, at least, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themselvs with most false imaginations, and delusive dreams. They need every thing, conducible to true blessedness. The highest and utmost folly of these Old, doting Kings, is, they'l not hear of their madness; not be told on't. They'l no more be admonish'd. They deafen their Ear, and willfully turn away their understandings from any such true openings of Scripture, as open that Kingdom of Heaven, they set themselvs to shut up against themselvs and others. Yea, if any word, of a seeming tendency towards the Kingdom, or spiritual, Gospel-sense of any Scripture, drop from themselvs, unawares, in their ministry, or sick-bed, they'l carefully call it back, or limit it into a compliance or harmony with all their other false words. They'l, by no means, leave any jealousies behind them, in their hearers, as to the truth of their reputed Gospel ministry and doctrin. Thus go matters, all a long their lives, and at their deaths. So, their hearers applaud their doctrin, <hi>praise their sayings,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to those chambers of darkness and death, where none of them ever see light. This get's man in honour (or in the fading Glory of his own restored nature, <hi>form of Godliness, Image of the

See, for all this; <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 12-20. <hi>The old foolish King,</hi> in all Generations, is at this desperate work; reckon's and call's Christ and his poor wise children, mad; and say's, they have a Devil; <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Hos.</hi> 9. 7, 8. But, such Kings are the fools and mad-men, beyond words, in refusing all spiritual admonition and counsel, as to the unspeakable gain of parting with that fading law-life (they trust in) for Christ's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Gospel-life and riches. These foolish Kings are in a Toil. The more they struggle, bestirr themselvs, and lay about them, to heap up their deceitful riches, and strengthen their false confidences therein, the more are they ensnar'd in the works of their own hands; more and more entangled, catch'd, and held fast by Satan, in that fading life, he know's will prove eternal death to them, with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. They strive for Salvation, in direct enmity to God, and that spirit of grace, in which it ever can be found. This is the sad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (these, the deplorable circumstances) of these old foolish Kings. And all this, under the undeniable experience of the withering and decay's of all, rested in, by them, for Salvation. Here's the case of Teachers and Hearers, at this day, under the blastings of God's displeasure upon them all; and upon all, they trust in. Such a course, finally persisted in, will render them despicable Creatures, to God, Christ, Spiritual Saints, and Angels, for evermore. But, room still is left for a hopefulness of seven thousand, yea, seventy times seven thousand Spiritual Saints, yet involv'd in the Universal Heresy of the sleshly Professour or Carnal-Gospeller, amongst us.

They were all Created perfect in their own natures, Humane and Angelical (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 15.) and in Obedient Subjection to the Gospel-Spirit, in the Light of it. But, they soon hated that Life, turned from the Light that shew'd it them; and this was their Apostasy.

                  <hi>Solomon</hi> (having consider'd the present generation of old foolish kings, in his own day, upon earth) tells us, the case was alway's the same, in former, and will so be, in all after-times of this world. So, these two last Verses of this Chapter, are a farther enlargment, as to the Character, and future condition of the Old foolish King, to Eternity. As to the <hi>poor wise Child,</hi> he asserted him, in general, to be <hi>better than the Old foolish King;</hi> vers. 13. Then, <hi>vers.</hi> 14. gives his reason for it; because <hi>he comes out of his Prison to reign,</hi> with Christ, in a state of eternal Life, absolute freedom, and true blessedness. There's enough for him; all that need be said of him. But the <hi>Old foolish King</hi> (vers. 13.) declar'd in general (vers. 14.) amidst all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited riches, to be poor; he farther signifies (vers. 15.) that he will so be found, to all eternity. And then (vers. 16.) that this is the Case of all the like old foolish Kings, in former generations, from the beginning of the World, and will be found the Case of all of the like spirit, in after-Generations, to the World's end.</p>
               <p>To the first of these, he speaks in the former part of this Verse; <hi>There is no end of all the People, even of all that have been before them.</hi> There's no end of their immortal beings, and exquisite sensibleness of their whole Persons, Body, Soul, and Spirit, in a Resurrection-State of Damnation. Annihilation-death they'l ever desire, but never find. Such death will ever flee from them. And Eternal Life they can never have. For, though in a general, confused, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom-guess at happiness, every one would be happy; that Life, in which true happiness ever can be found, are, and wil they be found in a Spirit of unchangeable enmity to. Such life, then, can they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have; nor, such death, as annihilation of their beings, or insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness in their beings, amounts unto, however hotly pursued, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, or sought by them. There's no end of their being, nor yet of their most exquisite sensiblenes therein, under the tormenting wrath and fiery indignation of God, for ever. The immortality of their whole being, in a resurrection of damnation, will hold them close to't,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:37441:94"/>
under punishment, for ever, in hell, for the ill Use they made of their immortal Spirits, and mortal first-covenant righteous life thereof, while in their mortal Body's, upon earth. The second Child or whole man, body, Soul, and Spirit (put together again in a resurrection-state of immortality, as to being) is to answer for all, done in the mortal body, or natural state and life of all; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10. and <hi>Ec.</hi> 12. 14. Thus will it be with the Old foolish King, for ever, as to being. But, as to that Mortal, changable first-Covenant righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Life (which he pleased and flatt'red himself with, as an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Life of true blessedness) that will come to an end. He will find himself rid of all the fading good, and comfort of that, which he would fain keep; and will be kept up, for ever, in a most desolate wretched State of being, under wrath, which he would fain be rid of. So, is he gone, every way. All he would not have, he must have, and that, for ever: and all he would have, he will for ever be deprived of, without the least relief (when Tormented in the flames of God's Wrath) so much as by <hi>a drop of Water to cool his Tongue;</hi> Luk. 16. 24.</p>
               <p>The mortal first-Covenant Life of his immortal Spirit, Exspires and Vanishes; dies away, and ceases, with the mortal Life of his Body. So, such wise, old foolish Kings (<hi>wise in Christ</hi> (1 Cor. 4. 10.) as to first-Covenant attainments, and fixing there, in Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the second) will die, and perish for ever, as the Fool, or Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Sinner of the Gentil's. Yea, worse will be his final Doom, of the two. The righteous Mystical Sodomite (in the form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, righteousness of Man, in his own restor'd nature, but Enmity to the Power of it and righteousness of God, in his Gospel Life and Spirit of Grace, which is filth of Spirit) will have worse on't, then the Litteral <hi>Sodomite,</hi> in <hi>filth of flesh.</hi> His greater advance, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The death of the natural State, at best (from which, since the fall, Enmity to God is inseperable) obediently yielded to, must needs be more acceptable to God, then the Life thereof, or any thing performable therein. From Love to God's Mercy (or the unspeakable gift of new Creation Life) to submit to, yea, and joyn with God, in doing justly (or Executing his righteous Judgment and Sentence of Death, on our fleshly, natural, law-state) in the awak'ned Life and Power of his Gospel-Spirit, in us; this is the Sum of all, God requir's of us, as the terms and condition of our full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into (and striking) the new and everlasting Covenant with him, Establish'd in all things, and sure. This doing justly, in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our guilty natural Man or Spirit, the Enemy of God, even to the death thereof; and, living wholly to him, in our never-sinning Spiritual Man, or his never-sinning Spirit (1 <hi>To.</hi> 3. 9.) <hi>is all,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir's

All the best things in the first-Creation-make and life of Angel and Man, are of no neerer kin to God's new-Creation Sanctuary and Holy things thereof, then as figures and shadows of them. The rational powers and things of man, are not more hid from the brute beast; then the Spiritual things of-God, from the wisest and most rational man; 1 Cor. 2. 10, 11. 14. <hi>'Tis</hi> too painful, yea, 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for man (Save in sanctuary-life and light, <hi>Ps.</hi> 73. 16, 17) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the spiritual, new-Creation things of God's House; and, less yet, the deep things of his very infinite Divinity. The truly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Man, Judges (or discern's and sees) all things (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15.) Divine, Spiritual, and natural. The highest first-Covenant-Saint, in Holy Flesh, Righteousness of Man, is a Fool, a Stranger, <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Man,</hi> a Profane Infidel, as to all Gospel-Things and Truths. Such troublesome self-confidents, <hi>Paul</hi> desir'd to be delivered from (2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 2. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14, 15.) as most impertinent, irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable Babblers and Disputers against all those Gospel-Truths, or Sanctuary-things, they bid at, and pretend to the knowledg of. That contradicting Wisdom and very Understanding, they use in the dispute, is to be abolish'd by the Cross, as the Blasphemous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of God, and all his Gospel-Truths. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> found it in himself, till Christ knock'd down that earthly Wisdom, and caused him to turn from that fleshly Mind, Understanding, or Principle of reasoning, in obedience to his heavenly; <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 3-6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Christ himself,</hi> in the flesh, turn'd away his foot or feet, his own fleshly or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural understanding and will, the two Feet of the Living Soul (on which it walks abroad, to View, Desire and feed upon worldly Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, Perishing Meats) refusing to think the thoughts, do the will, or speak the words thereof, but the will and words of him that sent him, by Crucifying that Will and Understanding, utterly Abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Life, Desire, Thought, and Motion thereof. And, such death is the only <hi>Consecrated Living way,</hi> into the new-Creation San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary-Life; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. and, 10. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>The natural man, even in Christ's person, however perfect, was a prohibited Stranger, amongst the rest, that might not enter into

his own new-creation Sanctuary, House, or Temple, in the single, changable, first-covenant law-life, in and under which, made. 'Twas impossible, even for him, as so, to enter. By Death, he ascended into it, and set it open, to his followers in the like Death of nature. Such obedient Death is the only way to eternal life. Never was there any other way to it, for any Angel or Man. That law-life, that was but a changable shadow, in him and in us, must pass (by the death of nature in both and all) under the cross-work of the Gospel-spirit, that the life which is true in him, may be true in us, also; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>and</hi> 5. 20. In Scripture sense, all's true, in the new-creation; all, shadow, in the old. True Life, Light, Wisdom, Righteousness, is found in the new, only. All things eternal, things of God, are there. All the Wisdom, Life, Light, Righteousness, Glory, things of Man or Angel, in the old, are but shadows of the substantial things of God, in the new. The changable, earthy Image of God, and righteous first-covenant Life of the Law (Man was at first created and set up in) is but shadow of the new-creature life and Image of the heavenly, or second <hi>Adam.</hi> All, in the former, are things of man, Life, Wisdom, Righteousness, of Man: all in the latter, things of God, Life, Wisdom, Righteousness of God. A zeal for God's heavenly, Spiritual things, must eat up our earthly, or natural. The fire of his heavenly Sanctuary-Spirit, must consume our Earthly Life and state, eat up all mortal desire and thought, root and all. By such destruction of our flesh, or natural state, can we come to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that Spirit. <hi>We must put off the old Man,</hi> the Image of the earthy, or can never put on the new, and Image of the heavenly. The Earthly House and Life of this present tabernacle must be dissolved, that we may have that Building of God, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.

               <p>God the Mediator, in his changable Angelical nature, from the beginning; and humane, toward the latter end of this world, did

cease, by a Holy death, from all the works of both, in the activity of the changable principle of first-covenant Life. Angels and Men must do (and suffer) likewise, or never enter into his rest; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 4. 10. The mystical Sabbath-Law of the Cross, upon the works and and working Spirit of nature, is expressed by turning away our foot from the Lord's Sabbath, <hi>from delighting in our own will and way, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Obedient submitting thereto, is the keeping our foot from the Lord's house, and turning it away from his Sabbath. Those that honour God herein, he will put ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting honour upon, lifting them up over the heads of all earthly powers, humane or angelical, called the high places of the earth.</p>
               <p>He will cause them to ride upon these high places, that have had their turns to ride over their heads; <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. 12. But those, that from a fond love to their own vain life, despise the Lord's sanctuary life, shal be lightly esteemed (1 Sam. 2. 30) yea, made vessels of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and everlasting contempt.

The Orthodox humane builders of a first-covenant Church (which their Wisdom Judges, asserts and warns, firm and safe, for Salvation) reject and refuse the corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of the second; and so, the whole new-creation building on the rock, the true church or house of God.

The natural spirit, in its own unsubdued motions and way's, defiles even Saints themselvs; and this is figured by the Tongue, a little Member of the Body, but an unruly one, as used by the unruly Spirit and will of Man. 'Tis a raging and enraged Expresser and Provoker of unruly Passions in our selvs and others. Whatever may be done with the Litteral, the Mystical Tongue of Man's Spirit, can no Man tame, by any Curbing-Bit or Bridle, any device, or means, to be found in the first-Creation World, or, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

The obedient death of a Spirit, a Life, a State of Enmity to God, is acceptable to God, by Jesus Christ, the High-Priest, Slayer, Offerer up, and Presenter thereof, unto God most high. The Cross of Christ, is the Yoke, the Bit, the Bridle, put upon it, for like reason, as Yokes and Bridles, on unruly Beasts, to make them obey their Masters and Riders.

               <p>This unruly beast, in the Saint, greatly need's a taming-bit and bridle, to fetch it about, and teach it obedience to Christ, its divine and Spiritual Lord and Master. The demolishing, death-work of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:37441:108"/>
the cross, upon it, can only do this. Satan was riding this mystical beast, the natural or legal Spirit in <hi>Paul,</hi> towards <hi>Damascus,</hi> against the Gospel. Christ meets him, throw's off that rider (for ever, and not only for a season, as from <hi>Balaam</hi>) strikes down the beast, flat to the earth; the earthly, natural Spirit, as well as litteral body of <hi>Paul.</hi> The latter was a figure of the former. Christ turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his understanding and heart, or will, into a full career of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Devil's design and Kingdom. So he presently prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch'd the Gospel, at <hi>Damascus,</hi> whither he was comming, with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and resolution, to persecute it. Then, forthwith, the Devil and professing <hi>Jews,</hi> hunted and forc'd him out of the City. But, let Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Strike while he will, at <hi>Paul,</hi> and do his worst, in rage, against him (whom, before he used as a serviceable instrument) when Christ is the rider. The more deadly wounds he or his instruments do give any thing in <hi>Paul,</hi> that can be wounded and slain, the more tame and obedient does it grow, to his new rider and true master. Christ will render the most malicious practices of all enemies against <hi>Paul</hi> (or any, in like case) conducible to the bringing him to his own hand, which is the Saint's true good, and great gain. <hi>The Wicked</hi> (Angels or men) <hi>that are his Sword,</hi> are used by Christ as whipp's and scourges, to tame the unruly tongue, natural Spirit, or rebellious fleshly mind in the Saint, that warr's against his Spirit, in himself and Saints. The said wicked are (as 'twere) ridden also, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by Christ, the Saint's new rider (<hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 13, 14) used, as his Sword and hand, to carry on his cross-work on what's to die in the Saint, the said unrulytongue. The whole knot of evil angels and men, can do nothing to, or against his Saints, but what's exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to their good, at every turn, in every point. All's on the right wheel, still, come what will or can, under Christ's conduct, for the Saint's advantage. The due consideration of this, will cause Saints to rejoyce, with <hi>Paul,</hi> in the greatest tribulations (and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all enemies, amidst the thickest troop's of them, round about them) having a fixed eye upon <hi>the glory that follows, which exeell's and remain's,</hi> for ever. In stead of sinking, and growing <hi>weary</hi> under <hi>contradictions</hi> and persecutions, he said, <hi>God forbid I should glory</hi> or rejoyce in any thing, save what's doing to me, by <hi>the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> let who will be the instruments, for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<pb n="214" facs="tcp:37441:109"/>

The natural Spirit, corrupt or righteous, is in a union of mind, with the Devil, till this death-work of the crosse upon it, be finish'd. <hi>Be not,</hi> therefore, <hi>rash with thy mouth,</hi> tongue, language, or expression of thy natural Spirit; <hi>nor let thy</hi> carnal mind or fleshly <hi>heart,</hi> that's in union with the Devil, <hi>be hasty,</hi> forward, and consident, <hi>to utter any thing before God.</hi> Let not that be the Speaker to Men, in Preaching; or to God, in Prayer, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private. It will do Satan's drudgery, carry on his designs, where or when-ever it is the speaker or actour. It will do all, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, to his Spirit of truth, and Saint's. <hi>Let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing (or word) before God.</hi> This shew's, <hi>Solomon</hi> mean's by mouth, in the first clause, the expressing and doing of the will and mind of the natural heart or Spirit, that's in enmity to God. The Saint ought to have a jealous eye over it, and keep a continual watch against it; so as never to do the will, or fulfil the lusts thereof; but oppose, fight against, and <hi>crucisie them. If we live and walk in Christ's</hi> Steddy <hi>Spirit</hi> of everlasting righteousness, thus we shall do; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 16. and, 24, 25. All yielding Obedience to, or doing the will and lust of the flesh, or carnal mind of enmity to God, is compliance with the Devil, against the Gospel-will of Christ (in himself and us) and divine will of God.

                  </gap>, which God call's the only things that are. Thus cross and contrary is the judgement, are the conceptions and words of Man's wisdom, at best, to God's. Man will own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above his fading natural things, first-creation vanities, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite divinity. He will not believe there are any middle sort of things, of a spiritual everlasting righteous new-creation nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween natural, and purely divine things. Thus, does Man leave no room for his advance in creature-ship, above his natural first-creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on state of vanity, but only a being swallowed up, into infinite divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wholly losing his creaturality, by annihilation: and so, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, getting just nothing. Infinite Divinity will be where 'twas, and what it was, from Eternity to Eternity, beyond and above all possibility of addition; and, all Creatur's, Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, where they were, before Creation; a meer absolute nullity, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished Shadows.</p>
               <p>If there be no other creature-state, but what they (both and all) receiv'd by the first creation, what else imaginable, can become of them, but a reduction of them all, into their primitive nothing? The towring, presumtuous thought of being godded with God, is, at bottom, when well examin'd, a being downright nothing'd; and no better. God will not only confute, but destroy all this wisdom of man, in which he presumtuously, rambles about for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, in his own will and way (against his makers known mind and counsel, about him) pitching upon his own fading, natural creature things, in preference to, and exclusion of God's heavenly, Spiritual Eternal creature-things, as not worthy his regard, or minding.

Those, that rejoyce in Christ Jesus, or in his Gospel-Spirit, the Holy Ghost, with joy unspeakable and Glorious, are despised and trampled on, by their first-covenant brethren, whose confidence is wholly in their holy slesh, or restor'd naturals. The first and second-covenant Saint, are properly the natural and Spiritual man. The enlightned moral heathen, obedient to the restor'd rational, first-covenant light, or law of nature, may be comprehended under the title, natural man. But, the corrupt heathen, living and walking wholly in the brutish lusts of his degenerate, fallen nature, is a beast. He has not, what is properly, in a Scripture-sense, the life of a man, or any part of it. That Death in Sin, threatned (and accomplish'd upon) <hi>Adam</hi> and all his posterity, they delight in, rather then accept of deliverance out of it. But, the enlightn'd, restor'd natural man, in the light, or also life of the first-covenant, is of a distinct, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary palate, desire, appetite, and thought or judgment, from and to the Spiritual.

For then, <hi>God breaks</hi> with them, the promises of it being but conditional; <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 34. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 15 25. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 30. and 31 Chapters. Man, in his first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Law-Principle (his restor'd, enlight'ned spirit of nature) is alway's in danger of breaking this Vow, Covenant, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take (by contract) with God. God therefore promises to make another Covenant with them, in another Spirit, his unspeakable gift to them; a steddy, <hi>right,</hi> constant <hi>Spirit</hi> of everlasting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness (<hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 10.) the Gospel, new and everlasting Covenant-Principle of Life; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31. 33. This, God engages to do, by quick|'ning up the incorruptible Seed thereof, into Life, motion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing activity, if they obediently submit to his declared terms, in giving up their clensed nature, to him, in Sacrifice, by a holy Death. Their polluted nature was no meet sacrifice for him, neither is it slain, but somewhat disabled only, by Law-Conversion; and, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually striving to fetch them back to their old Sins, with the <hi>Dog to the Vomit,</hi> often prevailing, so as to recover its former <hi>Dominion</hi> over them, and ride in Triumph again, with its uncontroll'd <hi>vile affections and lusts.</hi> The first-Covenant, natural, or Law-principle, fail'd of its duty, in the first Man, when at best; and more liable, sure, is it, to fail, in but some gradual renewals thereof. God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finds <hi>a fault,</hi> or defect <hi>in that first-Covenant-state</hi> of Life, as to Mans steddy, well-pleasing obedience to him, or true happiness to

himself. So, offers a second; <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6-13. This is <hi>the better</hi> (the new and everlasting) <hi>Covenant.</hi> The Gospel-spirit of God, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the performance of all obedience in Men, when it becomes the principle of life, desire, thought and action, in them; which can never sin, err, or miscarry; deceive, or be deceived. In this new-Covenant Spirit or Principle, God becomes their God, and they his people, for ever. <hi>He will never depart</hi> from them, <hi>nor they, from him;</hi> Jer. 32. 38-41. The undispensable condition, on man's part, for entring into the second covenant with God, is the obedient giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in Sacrifice to him, all the fading life and things, received from his own hand, in the first. When convinc'd of this twofold differing covenant-principle, with the methods of God's Wisdom, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings from them, as also with the unspeakable advantages of quitting the first for the second, then are they bound to vow the sacrifice of their Life in the former, and not to be slack in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the said vow. If we be not slack in that our part, for entring into the new or second Covenant with God, <hi>he will not be slack concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his promise; the promise of the father,</hi> even the Spirit of the Son, will, by the Son, be set up in our hearts, which is the Gospel-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Apostles were commanded by Christ, after his resurrection, to wait in their earthly-Jerusalem-state, for; <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 4. and <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49. Both these testimonies are given by the same hand; <hi>Luke.</hi> Man is to part with all, call'd his own; his Life, Wisdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and all the things of man, in his first make; and then, God will give to him, and set up in him, what he call's his own, by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>second; his Life, Wisdom, Righteousness, the things of God. All the Life of Man's Spirit, with the free will, and rational Powers thereof, must go, in Sacrifice to God, as our true free-will Offering and <hi>reasonable Service;</hi> Rom. 12. 1.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:37441:118"/>
should pull down and destroy the Work of his own hands. And, when he has thus steel'd them with arguments, for self-defence, and keeping up themselvs in their own native Countrey, and Father's House, the restor'd life of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> the image of the earthy, as a most desireable land, or state; then fall's he to work, the other way, to bring a false and evil report on God's Countrey, the new-creation land of promise or state of life. This is the <hi>Far Countrey,</hi> the man Christ is gone into, where he lives for evermore. This Far Countrey (even a heavenly, that God engages, as his part, in the new Covenant, to bring men into, on their obedient, speedy departure out of their own) does Satan bring an evil report, upon. First, say's he, you have but a report, a hear-say of it, you have no certain knowledg or experience of it. And then, 'tis <hi>a Land that eateth up the Inhabitants</hi> thereof (as the spies, doing his errand therein, said of the litteral, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 32) your destruction and very death it self, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and declared terms, on which only ye can enter into the possession of it. So, when brought by Christ's Spiritual Light, to the very borders of the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> by and with his evil apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and spies (ministers of his Gospel, that's no Gospel) are they easily perswaded &amp; induced to start aside, and fly off, as offended at both the promised land or life it self, they should enter into; and also, at the loss oftheir own, with all their mystical riches &amp; large possessions, therein. So, in stead of speedily performing the commanded and vow'd sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of their old nature, in order to enter into (and take possession of) the said new land of promise, they peremptorily and conclusively refuse the terms, and consult with Satan and one another, about a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back, rather into Egypt (litteral, or mystical, corrupt or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature) and there fix and establish themselvs, in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, land, or Countrey, in unchangable enmity to God's. This, the rebellious fleshly <hi>Israel</hi> was at, in letter and figure. If holy flesh, a righteous natural State; and strict, holy walking therein, won't do't for salvation, they'l not be saved. This desperate resolution is a crime of a dangerous, destructive complexion, of an Ethiopian hiew. 'Tis the <hi>Leopards spot, never the spot of Gods Children,</hi> Spiritual Saints. Tis the highest folly, imaginable. If they'l never obediently come out of their own land, the fading life of their own nature, they'l never enter his, even the life of his Spirit of Grace. If they'l not suff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:37441:119"/>
and die with Christ, in the former; they'l never <hi>live and reign</hi> with him, in the latter. If they'l not follow his suffering steps, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come where he is. They prefer the earthy life and Countrey of the Creature, to the heavenly life of the Creatour, Blessed for ever. The issue of (and for) this disobedience, matters come to, is this. God will strip them of, and take from them, all the fading good they are possess'd of, in the mystical earthly Countrey, or land of their own restor'd enlighten'd nature, as wilfully retain'd in a known rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against him. The very same Mystical Sword (or new-Creation Spirit of Christ and God) will be drawn against them, in final wrath, to destroy them for ever, which they so fear'd, startl'd at, and turn'd from, when offer'd to be brought upon them, in love, to give them a kindly and right death-pass, into the true land of promise. Had they willingly obey'd it, they had enter'd, and <hi>eaten the good of the</hi> true <hi>land</hi> of promise. But having absolutely and conclusively refused it, and rebell'd against it, <hi>they'l be devour'd by the same sword,</hi> or Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual cross upon them, for ever. <hi>The mouth of the Lord</hi> (the living word of God, Christ himself) <hi>hath spoken it. Isa.</hi> 1. 19, 20. Obediently lose the fading <hi>life</hi> of nature, and enter. Rebelliously <hi>save,</hi> pitty, spare your own <hi>life,</hi> and ye <hi>lose all,</hi> for ever, in eternal death, under final wrath. This is Christ's doctrin; <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 25. And this, Christ presently deliver'd, on Satan's contrary doctrin, by an Apostle, with the perswasive (and seeming friendly) words of his wisdom. When he had spoken of his sufferings, <hi>Peter</hi> rebuk'd him, and preach'd the self-same doctrin to him, the Old Serpent preach'd to <hi>Eve,</hi> and by her, to <hi>Adam. Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee;</hi> that is, thou shalt not suffer, or die, at all. This Spotless righteous law-life, in holy flesh, is eternal life; no dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death. The Gospel-Riddle, uninterpretable by Man's Wisdom, is this; die must nature, or all's lost; nature and grace too; all good, in first or second covenant, changable or unchangable. And what succeeds? unchangable evil of sin and punishment. The obedient death of nature, under the cross; the full, sevenfold purifying of it in the fiery furnace thereof, from all <hi>dross, tin, and reprobate silver,</hi> all filth of flesh and Spirit too, renders man <hi>clean every whit; Jo.</hi> 13. 10. This delivers him for ever, from all captivities, bondages, enemies, dangers, and death's, litteral and mystical <hi>Sodom, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:37441:119"/>
the life of nature, corrupt or righteous, both of which are a state of enmity to God, and death to man, if fix'd in. <hi>Thou shalt never wash my feet,</hi> said <hi>Peter;</hi> No? say's Christ, then, thou wilt have no part in me. Oh then, not my <hi>feet only, but hands, and head,</hi> said <hi>Peter;</hi> If <hi>feet</hi> be wash'd, 'tis enough, say's Christ, there need's no more, to make perfectly clean, every whit whole, and spiritually sound. If the feet (the will and understanding, the two mystical feet on which man walks, in his esteem, judgment, thought of, and desire after things; if these) be Spiritual, Heavenly, Gospel-feet, the discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and desiring powers of the Gospel-Spirit and principle, all will go right. Heavenly things, never-perishing meats, will be wholly and only esteem'd, desir'd, and fed upon, in this bottom-principle. All will be right a-top, in all Holy, Gospel-Conversation, when all's right at bottom. A Spirit <hi>greater then he that's in the World,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, in which 'tis impossible to displease God (Sin, erre, miscarry, deceive, or be deceived) must needs ever do all things well, and man be truly <hi>blessed in the deeds thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The extream folly then of man, in not only deferring, but finally refusing to pay his engaged, commanded vow, for giving up his whole nature, or Spirit (the devoted thing) in sacrifice, by death, unto God, is unpardonable. And then, God will be <hi>extream</hi> (and that most justly) <hi>in marking all, done amiss</hi> by him, in his self-chosen nature and life. He will call him to an account, for every thing, done therein, from first to last. This great transgression, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous unpardonable <hi>sin unto</hi> eternal death, will bring all other sin's at its heels, to be answer'd for, as creditors come upon a man, for lesser debts, when clapt up in prison, for a great one. And then will every Spiritual conviction, offered men (in the day of their trial, and God's patience towards them) be reviv'd in them (and stare them in the face) to witness against them, judg, and condemn them, in harmony with God himself. When man's trial is over, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death irrevocably past upon him; God will not repent or change from his dispensation of wrath, and man cannot repent or change from his rebellious mind of enmity against God. <hi>Repentance will be hid from God's eyes,</hi> and man's, on all hands. Unchangable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, lay's man under the unchangable wrath of God; thrust's him out of all distance, as to any favour, for ever, or benefit
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:37441:120"/>
by Christ's sacrifice or intercession. Christ died not, nor will intercede for the pardon of unchangable enmity to God and him. And God will revive his formerly given Spiritual light, to testify for him, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, in their own consciences; the evidence whereof, can never be silenc'd, extinguish'd, or denied by them. The irresistible testimony of it, will be a perpetual condemner of them, and justifier of God, in his most wrathfull proceedings against them.

Both were brought to feed on dust, or the perishing vanities of this World, or Worldly state, having turn'd their Backs on God's never-perishing Life and Meats, figured in the Tree of Life, and offered to them both and all. They forth-with forfeited and lost the paradisical-state of their corruptibly perfect natural, in Subjection to that Light that shew'd and offer'd them God's incorruptibly perfect spiritual crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Life, State, and Meats, which was their <hi>first habitation</hi> or state of Innocency.

And, when actually recovered into, and set up afresh, therein, if he, as wilfully, against conviction, abuse it again (in sinning against, and rejecting God's more excellent new-creature, Gospel-Life, at first represented in the Tree of Life) he is gone for ever, as fallen Angels, at first, were. Yet, is he left, for a season (after so irrecoverably and unpardonably gone) to the self-confident exercise of his restor'd changable righteous first-covenant Law-Life, and feeding on the meats and fruits thereof, handed now to him from the Evil Angel, that's higher than he, in that fading Life and Meats.

The mystical rich man delightfully contemplat's the Beauty, Fruitfulness, and Riches of his own enlight'ned nature, and too oft arrivesat this highest point of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wickedness, as the result of his own wisdom, to strike up an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting-covenant-union with the Devil. He agrees to receive, by his transforming Hel-fire-Baptism, an advance of his own nature, out of a narrower changably evil humane capacity, into a wider and unchangably evil angelical. This, by suffering Satan to fill his Heart with his Spirit of unchangable enmity to God. This is the making man's mystical House or <hi>Barns, greater</hi> (Luk. 12. 18) the enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and heightning his natural capacity, by a kind of mystical death (through Satan's false cross-work, or counterfeit mortification, for the death of man's Spirit of nature) on his engagement by covenant, and satisfying assurance, that he will raise and catch him up, out of that mystical Grave, into his higher, wiser, stronger, more excellent and capacious angelical nature. Thus, by bargain, does he touch man's Spirit, with the transforming, alterative, assimilating touch of his, and translate him out of his narrower humane, into his larger angelical capacity, of the first-creation sort. Man rather chooses this heightning and enlargment, in his own way, and after his own heart (in the first-creation state of nature, which renders him a man after the Devil's own Heart, in unchangable enmity to God) then such <hi>destruction of his fleshly</hi> nature (or whole natural state and life, at best) as leaves him no hopes of ever finding himself in a single natural first-creation-life, more, for ever; but, in a spiritual and heavenly, by a new-creation, in the new &amp; everlasting covenant Gospel-principle, God's Spirit of Grace and Truth. The assimilating, transforming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of Christ's Spiritual Cross, or heavenly fire-baptism upon man, would translate him (if obediently submitting thereto, and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant therewith) into the life of God's sacrificing Gospel <hi>high-Priest of our Profession,</hi> or of that very Spirit and <hi>fiery law of liberty</hi> (Deut. 33. 2.

This is the top-stone of his mystery <hi>of iniquity;</hi> the strongest delusion, by which this most subtle old Serpent, Dragon, and roaring Lion, deceives and devours men when and where God permitt's, for his own most wise and holy ends. Think, what this choice of man, under Gospel-conviction-Light, to joyn unchangably with the Devil, rather than with God, deservs. In order to secure their beloved natur's head, from the Gospel-Sword, and Fire of the Cross or Spirit of Christ, do men mount up into supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour first-creation strength, subtlety, and power, to oppose and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify themselvs against Christ and God, <hi>that they may be deliver'd from the power of evil,</hi> even from the wrath of God; <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 9.

               <p>In this verse and the two former, have we a true description of man's doleful state, after the largest possessions, litteral or mystical, that can fall to his lot, in first-creation life. He huggs but a <hi>wind,</hi> phantome, shadow, or self-pleasing Dream. All's nothing; and, he comes to worse than nothing, unspeakable misery and confusion, without the least relief, for ever, under unquenchable wrath. Man is born in a naked condition of Body, and <hi>dead in Sin,</hi> as to his Soul. When re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd and Cloath'd again by Christ, as to some measure of his restor'd lost Life and Righteousness, in the first-covenant; by keeping up that, in enmity (to an everlasting Life and Righteousness, offer'd him by Christ, in the second, and so, <hi>sinning after the similitude of Adam'</hi>s first <hi>transgression</hi>) he is worse than ever; <hi>his latter end worse than his beginning,</hi> a state of unchangable, incurable evil, sorrow, naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, poverty, and death. His whole man, after all possible revival, comsort, flourish, or fruitfulness in the mortal first-covenant Life of his Spirit, or sensual Life of his Body, <hi>goes</hi> destitute of all good or comfort, <hi>naked out of the World,</hi> as he came into't. <hi>He takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> of the fading Glory of his reviv'd Spirit (any more than out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward riches and comforts, relating to his Body) <hi>away with him,</hi> at the death of the Body. All goes. <hi>In all points,</hi> on all accounts, <hi>he goes as he came;</hi> stark naked; strip'd of all comfort or goodness. All fruits and labours of his Spirit and Body, go together; all vanish. They that obediently part with all such fading Life, and but things of man, in their Spirit, before the death of their Body, <hi>find their own</hi> again <hi>with usury,</hi> for ever, in the everlasting Life, Wisdom, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and <hi>things of God,</hi> in the Gospel-Spirit or Principle of the new and everlasting Covenant. This is the unspeakable Gift of God, offer'd all, on obedient surrender of their fading Life and things, in the first-covenant, for his everlasting, in the second. They that refuse this surrender (as most do) lose all good, in both Covenants, for ever; and fall under the positive inflictions of wrath, for ever.

Then, they seek to pick something out of his own mouth, to do their work. For this, the High-Priest ask's him; <hi>Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? Tell us,</hi> in a word. Jesus said, <hi>I am.</hi> Oh! now we have him, here's enough <hi>out of his own mouth,</hi> to condemn him; <hi>what need we any further witnesses? ye have heard the Blasphemy, what think ye?</hi> Guilty of Death, say they, as a cursed Jury of Rebels: All's of a batch, Judges and Jury, against Christ and his Followers. <hi>They all condemned him, as worthy of Death.</hi> They never examine his Doctrine, but cry, tell us in a word, this or that, and lie at catch for an answer; and then, in another word, condemn him for witnessing an infallible truth; that's their next word. <hi>Then they spit on him, buffet, mock him,</hi> and so on, to his Crucifixion and Death, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 61. 65.

No getting out of the sphere of Vanity, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the first creation. No goodness in Man or Angel, but what's a perishing Vanity. This hath already so bin named, or called by its right name, <hi>Vanity.

The Spiritual Saint, weighing all, in the ballance of the new-creation-sanctuary-spirit, calculates and finds out the total sum, or comprehensive <hi>number</hi> of all first-creation goodnesses, and excellencies, represented in all the several parts and distinct Glories thereof, and finds all <hi>Vanity.</hi> All, therein, are found <hi>wanting,</hi> with <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> and <hi>too light,</hi> by this <hi>Mene Tekel,</hi> as having nothing conducible to true blessedness, about them; or of any avail, towards it: but indeed, as to that new-creation Spirit of everlasting life, Glory, Wisdom, and Righteousness, wherein true happiness is

Changeableness, and now, enmity, the great defects in the first-creation state of Angel or Man, can neither be cured nor found out by the single first-creation wisdom and light of either. 'Tis utterly impossible. Nor therefore does God require it, of them. But, he requires of both and all, to be beholden to him, for his unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able new-creation gift and wisdom, whereby, all may be done. For this, must they submit to his terms of receiving it, the free parting with, and giving up their first-creation life of vanity, with all the things thereof, in sacrifice to him, by a holy death, under his cross, or Gospel-sword. First-creation life, in Man and Angel, was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to them both, by the Tree of that <hi>Knowledg</hi> or Wisdom <hi>that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But, by convincing spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual light, both had the conviction-sight of it, in their higher and lower spheres. The Angels higher natural capacities fitted them for stronger and clearer conviction-sight thereof, which render'd their
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:37441:150"/>
resusal to submit to the terms of receiving it, absolutely unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, at first. Man's, through mercy, was not so. But, 'twas the fault of both, to lean to their own fallible understanding, rather than fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and obey God's spiritual convictions and commands to them, forbidding them, so to do. The sad consequence of such foolish choice, will the fallen Angels experience, to eternity. And, so will as many Men, as fix there. Man's true concern, for preventing all this, is, to listen to that voice of true Wisdom, which declares the vanity of all natural, first-creation life; and then, also, another life, above and beyond that, a life of everlasting Righteousness and Truth. This brings with it durable riches and goodness, <hi>delights of the Sons of God;</hi> and so, takes Man off, from his wandring desires and pursuits after first-creation vanities, <hi>the delights of the Sons of Men,</hi> where 'tis impossible for them, ever to find any true rest or satisfaction. All such seeking for a happiness, tends to everlasting torment and vexation of spirit.</p>

Renew'd nature, call'd Grace; the renew'd old or natural Man (with his first Covenant righteous Life and Name) call'd the new-creature, the spiritual Saint, with the new Covenant-Life, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Name; all these are dangerous, destructive lies. In sum, <hi>the good Name and precious Oyntment,</hi> here, are the differing characters of first and second-Covenant Life. The former, through the said mistake, <hi>Paul</hi> found to be <hi>a body, a law,</hi> a state <hi>of sin and death</hi> (Rom. 7. 24. &amp; 8. 2.) which the new-covenant <hi>law of the Spirit of life, in Christ Jesus freed him from,</hi> by putting his nature, therein, to death. The Spirit of life is the death of death, when it puts the law-spirit of Enmity and Death, to death, in the Saint; utterly abolishing all the Anointings, or said <hi>precious Ointment,</hi> receiv'd in the natural state; and giving all again, <hi>with usury,</hi> in the unchangeable life and transcendently more precious anointing of the spiritual Man. Man, in restor'd first-Covenant Law-life, is apt (<hi>as Paul once</hi>) to despise and reject all Gospel-Tydings or witness of the second. The <hi>good Name,</hi> imports a transcendently higher and better anointing, then <hi>the precious Oyntment,</hi> here, can signify. For, then the spiritual, there is no better kind of precious ointment, receivable by, or communicable to, Man. This true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghost, in <hi>Solomon,</hi> as to this former, will much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to, and facilitate the opening of the latter clause of this verse.</p>
               <q>— And the day of Death, then the day of one's Birth.</q>
               <p>The stress of these words can't lie in the literal sence, which cannot hold, generally, nor mostly, true. For, the literal death of the vast number of wicked men, is abundantly worse, then the day of their litteral birth, and life, in this World. Man, though <hi>born dead in Sin,</hi> is capable of a restauration-birth of a first-Covenant life in his Spirit, which puts him under hopeful advantages, and possibilities of a new-creation-birth of an everlasting righteous Life. These hopes are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly cut off, from all that <hi>die in their Sins,</hi> as all that die, in a state of enmity to God, and his Spirit of Grace and everlasting Life, do.
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:37441:154"/>
This necessitates the allowing a mystical meaning to these Words; which is this. The death of Man's Spirit (as to all natural first-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation life, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For, now is he much forwarder on his way, in the right method and death-pass, towards an everlasting righteous new-Covenant life. <hi>Paul</hi> counted the former <hi>dung,</hi> to the latter, and <hi>suffer'd the loss of all</hi> therein, <hi>for it.</hi> Phil. 3. 7, 8. If Man submit not to the terms and ways of arriving at this new birth, for <hi>a newness of life,</hi> he will come to <hi>a latter end worse then his beginning</hi> (in either of his two former Births, litteral or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical, of bodily or first-Covenant life) eternal death. By obediently losing and quitting the former, natural, or Law-life, for a spiritual, Gospel-one, he comes to a latter end, better then any of his beginnings (in <hi>Adam,</hi> before the fall; or since, in his own said twofold personal birth) <hi>eternal life.</hi> A rebellious pitying and sparing our own nature in the first-covenant life thereof, loses all, for ever. An obedient giving it up, to death, and right losing it, saves all; <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 25. The Spirit, or inner natural Man, when crucified, and raised into Christ's spiritual life; the death, or dissolution of the body, is not fear'd but desir'd; as by <hi>Paul.</hi> He earnestly long'd and <hi>groan'd after</hi> the shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and being perfectly rid of the dusty, mortal, perishing <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life</hi> and state, of his whole natural Man, body and spirit (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, — 4.) and so, <hi>to be</hi> wholly <hi>at home with the Lord</hi> (ver. 6.) in the intire, single, uninterrupted exercise of spiritual life, amongst the best company, the pure, unchangeable Friends of that life, blessed Angels, and Saints departed. In this World, the Saint is surrounded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Enemies thereof; very burdensome, ill, unpleasing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to him. In the birth and utmost flourish of a first-covenant Law-life, we are still under Satan's power, and delusive influence. He can deceive us, into the same perdition with himself, by that very righteous life. By inducing Men, to over-value, and and rest in it and on it, for Salvation, he brings them into unchangeable Union with himself, in Enmity to God. When perfectly crucified, as to the life of the Law, &amp; raised into the life of the Gospel, <hi>we are not under the

We wholly cease and are freed from both and all; all enemies, and dangers, whatsoever; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 7, -14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1. The birth of a first-Covenant life, gives not full victory over Satan: the right death of Nature, and loss of it, does. Therefore, better, on all hands, as the only way to free us from death, and set us up in eternal life. The right, full death, of Man's Law-spirit of bondage, delivers him from all <hi>bondage and fear of death,</hi> for ever; <hi>which, all their</hi> first-Covenant <hi>life-time, Men are</hi> continually <hi>subject to;</hi> Heb. 2. 15.</p>

               <p>For preventing, or, at least, allaying the cammon evil, and general calamity, under the oppressive outward Governments of this World, God gives Laws, and enables wise Men (in moral Heathenism, or but legal-Christianity, <hi>by the knowledg of Christ,</hi> only, <hi>after the flesh</hi>) to make Laws, prohibiting all, in places of government or judicature, to take gifts. The reason, alledg'd for this (<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 8.) is, because <hi>a gift blinds the Eyes of the Wise,</hi> (Heb. <hi>Seeing</hi>) <hi>and perverts the words of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> So, they pass sentence, contrary to their own discerning, Light, Thought, and Conscience. This brings unreasonable oppression up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the innocent. A foundation is laid, and occasion given to this oppression, in selling places of Judicature. Whoever buy such places, are under a temptation, on that very account, to sell Justice; that they may reimburse themselves, as to their own bribe for the place, by taking bribes of others, in it. In the counsel of <hi>Jethro,</hi> to his Son in law, <hi>Moses,</hi> approved by God, we find the right qualifications for Men, in such places; that they be <hi>able Men, fearing God, Men of truth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

They were to be <hi>wise, understanding</hi> Men, such as should not <hi>respect persons, in judgment; nor fear the face of Man, but hear</hi> (and do justice to) the <hi>small as well as great;</hi> Deut. 1. 13, -17. Thus did Job. <hi>I put on righteousness; deliver'd the poor and fatherless, that had none to help them. I caus'd the Widows heart to sing for joy.

               <p>So, of the literal; now, to the mystical meaning of these Words. A deeper and sorer evil among Men, (because a greater sin against God) then the former, is here pointed at, as the principal intendment. The truly wise Man, is the spiritual Saint. By the oppression of him, are signified the additional ingredients and aggravating circumstances of bitterness, by Satan's wiles, put into the cup of suffrings, given his natural Man, to drink. In the weakness and barrenness thereof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the demolishing work of the cross, causing an hour and power of darkness (all the former flourish and fruitfulness, joy and feasting thereof, in the first-covenant, is turn'd into) comes <hi>the roaring Lion,</hi> the Prince of darkness, to oppress, <hi>devour,</hi> and sink <hi>him,</hi> quite. Till brought to the test, under the cross, he accuses him to God (be he never so faithful to his first-covenant Light) that all his obedience is but mercenary (from a self-interest, wherein gratified, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most) and not, at all, from any regard or love to God. <hi>Put forth thy hand,</hi> and <hi>touch all he has, and he will curse thee to thy face,</hi> says he, of <hi>Job,</hi> to God. Let me be thy hand, or employ'd instrument here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and see where <hi>Job</hi> will be, then. <hi>All he has is in thy</hi> hand, or <hi>power,</hi> says God. <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 9, — 12. When this dispensation of the cross (and trial of <hi>Job,</hi> thereby) was begun, Satan wind's about, and employs his Serpentine craft and malice, against both God and <hi>Job,</hi> another way. He endeavours to bring <hi>Job,</hi> to espouse his quarrel, against God, as dealing most injuriously with him. He represents to <hi>Job,</hi> the cross-blows on his righteous natural man, body and spirit (which himself was the permitted hand and commission'd manager of, upon him) as a most unreasonable oppression. And, by thus casting all the seeming oppressing-work, upon God, does he hide his own real oppression, wicked counsel and suggestions, from <hi>Job'</hi>s natural Man, now brought into darkness, and not knowing what matters would come to; what God would do with him, or what would become of him. Till new spiritual day-light was caused to spring up in him, he could not interpret the riddle of the cross; how this devourer of a fading life, goodness, clothing, belly and meats, should be the very
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:37441:164"/>
means of giving all again with usury, in a <hi>more excellent</hi> life and <hi>way. Samson'</hi>s riddle was the type of this. <hi>Out of the eater came meat, and out of the strong, sweetness</hi> (Judg. 14. 14.) <hi>hony out of the Lion,</hi> by him kill'd, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Samson</hi> (as a type of the Priestly Spirit of Christ, in its crucifying, sacrificing-work upon nature) <hi>rent that Lion, as a Kid;</hi> which was a usual sacrifice to God, under the Law. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man of the Saint, while in the dark, under the cross, is ready to strike in with Satan, against God. The Devil stirr'd up <hi>Job'</hi>s three Friends, far inferiour to what he had bin, in the Light, Wisdom, and Righteousness of a restor'd first-covenant Life. His mistaking self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confident Friends (under Satan's management of them, to oppress him, by adding to his afflicton) deny the reality of his first-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Righteousness, and reckon him but a hypocritical pretender thereunto; and now, under the punishing hand and manifested displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God upon him, for his hypocrisy and wickedness. <hi>Job,</hi> in his dark house of mourning, was sorely put to't, as to what way he should go about to defend himself against their most false and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous chargings of him with falshood and deceit, in all his former life and practice. He did find all that life and goodness going to wrack, in him, under the Cross; and knew not why; nor, what he should have in the room thereof, as God's design in all. Yet did he stem the tide, through all difficulties and enemies (with which, on all hands, surrounded and encountred) till safe landed in the wished haven, the true Land of promise, state of true Life, and Blessedness; <hi>a newness of life.</hi> His own conscience, yea, God himself, were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his integrity in those first-Covenant Principles, they charg'd him with Hypocrisy, in; <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 1, 8. &amp; 2. 3. Their charging him therefore with falshood, was an unreasonable oppression, and added great bitterness to God's afflicting trial of him, stirring up his muddy earthy part; raising all the dust, and causing all the unadvised speeches, that in a long debate of his case, with them, pass'd out of his mouth. After all, the Devil or his Wife could do or say, 'tis said, <hi>he sinn'd not with his Lips;</hi> Job 2. 10. Some few questionable words, he had (in his great Agony and consusion) utter'd (Chap. 3.) that seem to have introduc'd (or given some occasion to) the following discourse of his three Friends. When Satan finds the Saint's natural Man, under the Cross (for a removal out of first, into the second Covenant-Principle)
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:37441:165"/>
he puts him on a vindication of his own faithfulness, in the first, so as strenuously to engage in a self-defence, against the cross-work of the second, upon him. So, makes he the Saint himself, instrumental to the heightning and aggravating of that mystical <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, which tends to the making him, mad.</hi> Saints therefore (and others too, under like trial, that apostatize) are forbidden to take that <hi>gift which destroys the heart.</hi> This gift is that, Satan offers, to bribe them off, from God, or obedience to his Cross. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Beginning and end,</hi> here, signifie God's twofold gift of first and second-Covenant life, and principles of two differing sorts, of righteous fruits, works, duties, and performances, towards God or men. The method of God's Wisdom (in giving, first, the natural or first-Covenant life; and afterward, the spiritual or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 46.) is not to be question'd, or disputed against, by Man's.

All Men and Angels, as under this tryal, they make a right or a wrong choice, find eternal life or death, the better or worse end than their beginning. All that make the right choice, <hi>have the praise of God,</hi> but lie under the utmost dispraise and malice of Man, all along this World, under Satan's reign, and the day of Man's orthodox judgment, or Wisdom.

Man does not judg nor inquire a right, as wisely considering and discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this thing. Fallen Angels indeed, were gone, without remedy, on their first sin. But 'tis not so with Man. For, God has over-rul'd his fault and punishment, to the farther magnifying of his Free-Grace, by which, he is offer'd better things, and greater advantages than were given him, in his first creation. God has found a way for restoring him to some measure of his lost righteous life. And, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal experience of mankind, as to the fading nature of that life, by the first sin, and fall from it, and by a world of faithful warnings from God (and multiplied instances of Apostates, after renewed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) do make up an advantage to them, beyond what <hi>Adam</hi> had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall.

If his saying, <hi>Ye shall not die at all,</hi> be not sufficiently refuted by the death of all Men (as to that righteous life, set up in the first-creation make of <hi>Adam</hi>) when will it? or, what will undeceive men?

The same sin, willfully repeated in any man, is absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable. If that of <hi>Adam</hi> (and all men in him) had bin so, who could have bin saved? What Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> has done for all Men, leaves no Men capable of defending or excusing themselves, by that worn Proverb, a fleshly first Covenant <hi>Israel</hi> or people of God, had got in their mouth's; that <hi>our</hi> first <hi>Parents ate sowr Grapes, and their, Childrens Teeth are</hi> thereby <hi>set on edge;</hi> Ezek. 18. 2.

All are capable of such life, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication therein, as <hi>Adam</hi> had, before his fall. And, all are capable of a new trial, for the obedient exchange of that life, for a better, an everlasting; which <hi>Adam,</hi> at first, fail'd in.

This question imports an utter impossibility of making it straight; <hi>Eccle.</hi> 1. 15. Tis therefore, peerless folly and madness in Man or Angel, to attempt it; or, to establish themselves in it, for hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. There's no way possible for either, to be happy, but by the death and loss of all <hi>their own,</hi> there, for <hi>God's own,</hi> which they can only arrive at and attain, by the death of their spirit of nature, and so, a resurrection into the life of his <hi>spirit of Grace.</hi> God positively requires both and all of them, to part with their crooked change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, first-creation thing or things, for his unchangeably straight and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptibly perfect new-creation life, and things.

               <head>Vers. 14. <hi>In the day of Prosperity, be joyful; but, in the day of Adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, consider: God also, hath set the one over against the other, to the end that Man should find nothing after him.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The good and evil day, in the original, are here translated, <hi>the day of Prosperity and Adversity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here's a two-fold day, for Man, in God's wise method and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, set, one over against the other, which 'tis man's duty and concern, to take notice of, and comply with, recoycing in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and duly considering the yet greater advantages to him, in the latter. To follow the Lord's counsel, in both, is his best course. The spiritual mystery of these Words is the principal intendment. But, first, in the litteral sence; the greatest content, joy, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, man can find in the greatest outward Prosperity (when sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a confluence of all visible desireables in this World) he must come to experience the loss of all, first or last, which he ought to consider. In the perishable nature of all such enjoyments, is discernably writ out a day of adversity, over against his utmost prosperity, therein. The perishing nature, also, of that life and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in him, that's gratified by such things; <hi>the belly that's for</hi> such <hi>meats,</hi> does farther preach the same doctrine to him, cautioning against the placing his happiness in such slippery, uncertain things. Death puts a full period to all such desires, as are answer'd by such desireables. Vanity on all hands, proclaims <hi>a day of Adversity</hi> and darkness, <hi>set over against the day of such Prosperity.</hi> Unwarrantable over-value for, love to, and delight in such worldly things, will cause <hi>a destructive worldly sorrow</hi> to man, if he out-live them. When run down into a despicable state of misery and want, he knows not how to bear it, or what to do with himself. Life grows a burden. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he makes away himself, as weary of it.</p>
               <p>But now, as to the mystical, principal sense of these words; Here's a most concerning caution to man, in the utmost flourish, fruitfulness and inward mystical riches of his nature, in a first-covenant righteous life, where <hi>belly and meats,</hi> desires and desireables, root and branch, tree and fruits, principles and operations, <hi>are</hi> all but a higher sort of <hi>perishing</hi> vanities, sigur'd out by the former. All this yet, is but a
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:37441:171"/>
                  <hi>vain shew,</hi> a dream, a fools Paradise, a shadow, <hi>an image</hi> only of true durable life and substantial riches, in the heavenly creature-image of the second <hi>Adam. Man, at best,</hi> in all this fading glory and <hi>honour</hi> of his own nature, <hi>is altogether vanity. Ps.</hi> 39. 5, 6. The first <hi>Adam</hi> was made in but the earthly, shadowy Image of God: the heavenly, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial, creature-image of the infinite Divinity is found only in the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and his spiritual descendents, by a new birth, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond creation. <hi>A day of adversity,</hi> then, is written out, in the perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature of all such inward, as well as outward prosperity, over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the highest prosperity, therein. All such mystical, soul-riches, life, food, clothing, glory, honour, wisdom, righteousness, all will be gone again, most <hi>certainly make themselves wings and flee away;</hi> Prov. 23. 5. While then, <hi>Man sets his eye</hi> or heart <hi>on</hi> such <hi>things,</hi> which God says, <hi>are not,</hi> he is sure to meet with an amazing disappointment. By new-creature things, <hi>things of God,</hi> (which God's Wisdom reckon's the only <hi>creature-things that are;</hi> man's wisdom, <hi>things that are not</hi>) <hi>will God bring to nought all those things of man,</hi> which his foolish wisdom reckon's the only <hi>creature-things that are;</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 28. <hi>In the day of</hi> man's <hi>prosperity</hi> in the restor'd first-Covenant righteous life of his own nature (under the cherishing, impregnating influencings of Christ, as <hi>a fleshly Bridegroom,</hi> or Husband, rendring him fruitful in such births, fruits, works of righteousness and duties to God and Man, as are producible and performable therein) should <hi>he be joyful,</hi> and thankful to God, for mercifully restoring to him, the proper life, food and clothing of his dead, desolate nature, lost by the fall. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 3, -14. This is the common Salvation, or general deliverance, all men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, from Christ's General-Redemption-Purchase. This, by his putting our nature, at best, in himself, to death, as to this very life, he offer's, thereby, to restore in all men. And thereby, has he shew'd them the right use of such life, when restor'd, even to give it up, in Sacrifice to God, as he did, in order to receive from him, that spiritual, new-creation life, in the image of the Heavenly, into which, he has exalted our nature in his own Person, in which <hi>he lives,</hi> and in which, we may (on like obedience, as thorow-followers of his suffering-steps) <hi>live with him, for evermore;</hi> Rev. 1. 18. A twofold day of adversity and house of mourning then, will infallibly succeed a twofold day of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity and feasting, in all possible outward or inward Riches of this
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:37441:172"/>
World. In the day of the said utmost twofold Prosperity, then, is it man's important concern, to have in his eye, thought, and due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, the approaching twofold <hi>day of Adversity.</hi> Such a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration may keep him from a sinful over-value of, and over-rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or trusting in his fading enjoyments, and <hi>uncertain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

On obedient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the appointed death-pass <hi>into the Glory that follows, excels, and remains</hi> for ever, does Christ stand ready, to perform the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Father</hi> (Act. 1. 4.) in giving Men durable Life, Riches, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-perishing food and clothing. So, follows a day of everlasting Prosperity and feasting, to them. <hi>They must suffer and die with Christ,</hi> as to the fading, first-covenant law-life of Nature, <hi>that they may live and reign with him</hi> for ever, in the Gospel-life of his <hi>Spirit of Grace and Truth;</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 11, 12. God sets all this, before Man; declares his whole counsel to him, with the advantages of his compliance with, and disadvantages of his rebellion against him, as to absolute Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the one hand; or final damnation, on the other. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 19, 20. All this, fairly declar'd, man may run and read, what's like to become of him, for ever, as wilfully running after Satan's lie, or obediently complying with God's Spirit of Truth.

               <p>Man is righteous over-much, or long, in the first-Covenant, when he over-much values it, and lay's to great a stress upon it; when he trusts, rest's in, and builds upon the changeable, fallible principles thereof, for Salvation. On this mistake, he refuses Christ's heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call to him, to come up, out of the life and image of the earthy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heavenly; out of the perishing life, wisdom, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of man, in the first-covenant principle, into the everlasting Life, Wisdom and Righteousness of God, in the second. An overvalue for, and unwarrantable security in the first, endangers man's shutting the door of his heart, and deafning his ear to Christ, against his gracious offer of (and invitation into) the second.

And, when Man has thus presumptuously pitch'd upon things, beyond the reach of his own wisdom, he is ready to complain of, and dispute against God, that he has reserv'd things of highest concern to him, out of his sight; all spiritual, heavenly, new-creation things, Wisdom, Life and all, in which found; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7. This does Man, in stead of yielding to the terms of receiving that wisdom (wherein he might reach, see or know <hi>all things</hi>) the loss of his own; Life, and all.

The Scriptures are <hi>a Book seal'd,</hi> as to all the spiritual truths thereof, from the highest wisdom of Man; <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 11. The professing learned Jews; yea, the very Apostles knew not what to make of Christ's Gospel-words, New-covenant doctrine, while they were but in old or first-Covenant Wisdom. <hi>The Bread I give, is my flesh,</hi> says Christ. <hi>How can this be?</hi> say the Jews; <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 51, 52. <hi>A hard saying, who can hear</hi> (or understand) <hi>it? say his very Disciples;</hi> ver. 60.

Hence, man thinks, or <hi>says in his heart, Who shall ascend to Heaven, to bring down Christ to me,</hi> in that new-creation Life and Wisdom, you talk of, that's above my understanding, and out of the reach of my Wisdom? Vain Man suspects not his own wisdom, as to its sufficiency, for the reaching any thing that concerns him; and so, concludes, all the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, heavenly Truths and mysteries, the Saint speaks of, are just nothing. So, all the spiritual sense of Scripture, all Gospel-Truth is rejected, to a tittle. The death and loss of that first-covenant life, wisdom, and all the things thereof, for the Life, Wisdom, and <hi>things of God,</hi> in the second, is the only way for man to understand all <hi>the mysteries of the Kingdom of God, the whole counsel of God,</hi> the methods

of his Wisdom, and contrivances of his infinite Understanding, about the Salvation of his Creatures. The death of Man's Law-spirit of nature, at best, and resurrection into Christ's <hi>Gospel-Spirit of Grace,</hi> is the only way, by which he can <hi>enter into, or</hi> so much as <hi>see the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> and things thereof; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3, 5.

               <p>The Mystery, here, lies in the Woman, figured out by the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, inticing practices of the literal. Interpretation is properly the discovering the hidden, unknown, mystical Truth, signified in the Scriptures of Truth, by literal shadows. The Mystery here, is the practice and way of the womanish, changeable first-creation spirit or natural state, in all its variety, throughout Satan's whole mystery of iniquity, falshood, and deceit, from the beginning, to the end of this World. What tumults and confusions, the literal Woman is made the occasion of, in States, Families, and all worldly Societies (thro' her deluding Arts, and Men's foolish dotings on her, in the <hi>vile,</hi> womanish spirit of nature, on all hands, in both Sexes) is no news to the common light of Nature in all mankind. But, God's Words of counsel and instruction, signify Mysteries, hidden from the best Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of learned Man. The literal sense, here, is obvious to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. To the Mystery then, of this Woman, <hi>Solomon</hi> here reflects upon, and sum's up his whole Experience in the Life and Wisdom of his natural state (after all the sore mistakes he had bin involved in, with his fellow-sinners and mortals) calling that changeable state, in Man and Angel, <hi>Woman.</hi> This mystical Woman, in both Man and Angel, is here consider'd, as fix'd in unchangeable enmity to God, and the true Spiritual, New-creation Man, or Heavenly creature-Life and <hi>Image of God,</hi> in Christ, blessed Angels, and Saints. The ring-leading Head of all, thus fix'd, is the Devil. This Head, as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative of the whole party of incorrigible wicked Angels and Men, and comprehending them all, is the Woman here, the mystical Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish-strumpet, guilty of unpardonable Adulteries and spiritual wickednesses, against Christ, the true Spiritual Lord and Husband of Angels and Men, whom they ought all, to obey, and be eternally sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, in every thing. The very person of the Devil, as possess'd of the highest natural glories and excellencies, by the first creation, was, therein, the supream first-Covenant Spouse of Christ. But, this Spouse,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:37441:183"/>
soon apostatiz'd, and became the grand mystical <hi>strange Woman and Adulteress,</hi> that did, from the date of her first sin and fall, set herself to draw as many Angels and Men as she could, into the same adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and murderous mind of enmity against Christ, that spiritual Lord and Husband, they all ought to submit to his terms of being married to, for ever, in the new and everlasting Covenant. All that rebelliously keep up their <hi>own</hi> life and <hi>beauty,</hi> in the first, against him and the second, will be judg'd, as mystical <hi>Wedlock-breakers, Murderers,</hi> and most criminal Idolaters; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 15, 38. The Devil, by this practice, in the top-excellency of first-creation life, has render'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a bottomless pit of deceits, and all sorts of spiritual wickedness, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring (and abundantly prevailing, through God's permission and Men's wilful folly) to corrupt their spirits, and fill their hearts with the same unchangeable enmity to Christ and God, with himself. By the Workmanship of this mystical Woman, are Men rendered tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of her unchangeable evil Spirit. <hi>The mouth of this strange woman, is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the Lord, shall fall therein.</hi> This have we, from <hi>Solomon,</hi> also; <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>But, whoso pleases God, shall escape her.</hi> Thus, gives he a true account of the said bottomless pit, with the sad condition of all that fall therein; and the blessed priviledges of them that escape her. <hi>All blind leaders, with their followers,</hi> in the first-creation-state, excluding Christ and the second, <hi>tumble</hi> together <hi>into this</hi> deep <hi>ditch</hi> or bottomless pit of unchangeable wickedness; <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 39. The very spirit of the Devil is this ditch, or bottomless pit; <hi>the mother of all mystical Whoredoms,</hi> and spiritual <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Earth</hi> (Rev. 17. 5.) Or in the earthly, natural state; <hi>lying in wait, as a robber, for a prey, and encreasing the transgressors among Men;</hi> Prov. 23. 27, 28. All, that in their renew'd spirit of Nature, righteousness of Man, or <hi>Form of Godliness</hi> in the first-Covenant, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>deny</hi> and reject <hi>the Power of Godliness,</hi> the New-creature-life, Wisdom, and <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> in the second, are fallen into this bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless pit of deceits. All fix'd first-creation builders on the Sand, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely reject, exclude, and deny that Spirit of Grace, that's the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-stone and rocky foundation of the true Church. The Woman, here, is, indeed that <hi>strong,</hi> powerful <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> or Son of Perdition, that by his superiour angelical strength and subtilty, when faln, was too hard for Man, at best, in innocency. By the obedient death only, of Man's

spirit, at best, can he receive the life of that new-creation <hi>spirit</hi> of Christ, <hi>that's greater,</hi> stronger and wiser <hi>then he;</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 4. Then, he is an over-match for the Devil; able to fight, and run down all evil angelical <hi>principalities and powers,</hi> those wicked spirits, with all their <hi>spiritual wickednesses, in high places,</hi> or counterfeit heavenly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 10, -13.

Man, <hi>wise, strong, and honourable in Christ,</hi> but by first-covenant communications (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10.) Satan is too strong for, and can spoil all he has, or is. <hi>All that is in his power;</hi> Job 1. 12. So, let Man want the Spirit, stronger than Satan, he'l fall under him, and be <hi>led captive at his will,</hi> in and by that very first-covenant life, he reckons to be saved in; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. The wisdom of it, cannot discover his snares; nor the strength of it, withstand his power. All's but as <hi>straw and rotten wood,</hi> to his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Angelical Wisdom, Strength and Armour; <hi>Job</hi> 41. 27. <hi>Flesh and Blood;</hi> Man, at best, is so far from being fit <hi>to wrestle against evil Angels,</hi> that they can make all that, in Man, serviceable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, for destroying him; as on their side; their friend, in him. In Christ's Spirit of life, are Saints only fit to fight down both; both Flesh and Blood, the natural spirit, at best, and evil Angels at the back of it, to strengthen that <hi>Foe of their own house,</hi> that, with them, in all its <hi>affections and lusts, fights and warrs against</hi> God, and the true interest of <hi>their own souls.</hi> The compleat death of this home-bred Foe, but pretending Womanish <hi>Friend</hi> and Counseller <hi>in the Saint's own bosom,</hi> (Mic. 7. 5.) is his full deliverance from all <hi>Satan's nets and snares.</hi> For, then <hi>he finds no part in him,</hi> that he can tempt or touch, please or hurt, <hi>John</hi> 14. 30. When the Saint is crucified, as to all worldly desires in him, to all worldly desirables without him, <hi>the God of this World finds nothing in him;</hi> his Belial-party, the enemy of God, is extinguish'd and abolish'd.

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:37441:184"/>
in all men, may fence against the literal: but the best Wisdom and Strength of first-Covenant holy Men, is no defence against this mystical Woman's practices, upon them. Yea, she turn's that very Wisdom and Strength, with <hi>the perishing meats,</hi> they feed on, therein, <hi>at Christ's earthly table</hi> (and fruits, they bring forth, under Christ's Husbandly influence, as <hi>a fleshly Bridegroom</hi>) into so many Snares, by which, she catches them. While she keeps them confident in holy flesh, or <hi>knowledg of Christ after the flesh,</hi> she renders them wholly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of his holy Gospel-spirit, and words thereof, save to oppose, contradict and blaspheme all. <hi>When Men give up themselves with Christ's</hi> first-Covenant gift of life, and second-Covenant enlightning gifts, (and thereby <hi>a taste-of his new-Wine</hi> (Hos. 2. 8.

The words of Man's and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's wisdom's, joyntly hand forth another (pretended) Gospel, in flat opposition to every word of Christ's; clothing all their falshoods with the misapplied letter of his words of truth.

The language or thought of all natural hearts, God declar's to be this; <hi>Prophesie not unto us, right things:</hi> speak unto us, smooth things; prophesie deceits (<hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 10.) and Satan finds false Prophets enow, in a readiness, to gratify them; so, as to keep true <hi>Seers</hi> out of all hearing or regard, all whose words lie cross to the will, palat, and desire of humane nature, corrupt or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, in all mankind. They preach the Cross and death to it, in all, as necessary to the Salvation of any. This, Satan represents as the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:37441:185"/>
greatest loss and prejudice imaginable, to them; indeed, their utter ruine. He advises them to hold fast their own, decrying the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended advantages of <hi>suffering and dying,</hi> (even <hi>a living and reigning with Christ</hi>) as meer delusive fictions. All men, in their natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, corrupt or righteous, stand ready for receiving Satan's doctrin, <hi>the doctrine of Devils,</hi> pleasing to Nature, in all variety of condition, it can be found in. No man, in that worldly nature and spirit, receives Christ's Gospel-Testimony; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 22. &amp; 14. 17. This must needs make a vast difference between the numberless flockers after Satan's Gospel, and the few or next to no listners after Christ's. When Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan has lock'd up men in a double prison, the will of their own fixed spirit of bondage, and his will upon that; in this firm union of these self-embondaging spirits and wills, are they invincibly hardned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all <hi>the words of God's Wisdom.</hi> And then, the whole counsel of the Devil, in his <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> passes currant with them, for the whole Counsel of God, in his <hi>mystery of Godliness.</hi> Solomon, Paul, and other awaken'd spiritual Saints, can find out all these depths, wiles, devices, <hi>snares, and nets</hi> of this <hi>Woman,</hi> that they see their fellow mortals, even the professing party, so generally involv'd, entangled, and caught in. <hi>This Woman is more bitter than death; her heart</hi> being <hi>full of snares and nets,</hi> So subtilly contriv'd and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz'd, as most certainly to catch, all that refuse (and so, are destitute of) the new-creation <hi>wisdom of God, which alone can</hi> enable to <hi>number</hi> and find out <hi>the name</hi> and nature of this first-creation <hi>Beast</hi> (Rev. 13. 18) with all her natural perfections, disguis'd and gilded over by her whorish paint and transforming skil, with counterfeit resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of spiritual, in order to give the utmost shock of opposition to what is so.

In a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, prerogative-sence, Christ himself is <hi>the one Man among a thousand,</hi> even thousands of thousands of his Spiritual Saints and Angels, as the fountain of that Life, they are all partakers of. <hi>He never fails to give it, in the distinct measures</hi> and seasons, <hi>appointed by his Father, to all, the Father has given him;</hi> Joh. 17. 2. All the things of the Man, here, are eternal: of the Woman, temporal. Eternal Life and Death are set before us, in these two Spirits, the manly second, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish first-Creation Spirit. <hi>All that hate Christ,</hi> in the second, <hi>love</hi> and chuse their own eternal <hi>Death,</hi> in the first; <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 36.

               <p>HEre are too questions; the latter, implying an answer to the former: and then, a declaration of the valuable priviledges of the truly wise man. <hi>The wisdom of man</hi> is nothing in the case. <hi>The words of God's Wisdom,</hi> his oracles, whether given in <hi>Dreams, Visions, or by</hi> his true <hi>Prophets,</hi> are too hard for that interpreter. The new-creature <hi>wisdom of God, in</hi> Daniel <hi>and the three Children, was ten times better than that, in all the Magicians (or wise men) in the Realm.</hi> Dan. 1. 20. In this, <hi>could</hi> Daniel <hi>tell both the</hi> oraculous <hi>dream of</hi> Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, <hi>and the interpretation: those wise men, neither;</hi> Dan. 2. <hi>The great</hi> prophetical <hi>Image</hi> of worldly Monarchy, from that day to the end of this World, Man's day, and Satan's reign, was the matter of the Dream. Then, <hi>the Dream of the great &amp; high Tree, which</hi> more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>related to</hi> Nebuchadnezzar himself, <hi>was interpreted by Daniel,</hi> also; <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 22. And, after this, in the reign of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> grandchild to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, did</hi> the same <hi>Daniel interpret the Mene Tekel,</hi> on the Palace-Wall, <hi>none of the wise Men of Babylon knew</hi> what to make of; <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 15. and v. 25, - 28, <hi>Daniel,</hi> as an awakened spiritual Saint, <hi>knew the interpretation of the thing, or word,</hi> no wisdom of Man could interpret. Yet, does the but restored righteous first-covenant Saint, <hi>Wise, Strong and Honorable in Christ, there,</hi> (figur'd by <hi>the wise Men of Babylon,</hi> Egypt, and <hi>the King of Tyre,</hi> presumptuously <hi>reckon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wiser then</hi> Daniel, or <hi>Paul;</hi> Ezek. 28. 3. 1 Cor. 4. 10. <hi>The Queen,</hi> recommending <hi>Daniel,</hi> to frighted, amaz'd King <hi>Belshazzar</hi> (when she saw <hi>his thoughts trouble him, and Countenance chang'd)</hi> said, <hi>there's a man in thy Kingdom, in whom is the Spirit of God, an excellent Spirit, having the light, understanding and wisdom of God in it; by which he had knowledge and understanding, for interpreting dreams, shewing hard sentences, and dissolving doubts,</hi> or <hi>untying knots,</hi> as the Chaldee reads.

                  <hi>Daniel interprets the Mene Tekel,</hi> and the execution was speedy; For, <hi>that night was King</hi> Belshazzar <hi>slain, by the Medes and Persians,</hi> who, after two years siege, then enter'd the Town, by diverting the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> Dan. 5. 5, --31.

His Wisdom consists in, and is evidenced by a right interpreting of Parables and dark sayings, of important concern, in their significancy, but too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and difficult for man's wisdom, at best, to deal with, or unrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Neither literal, nor mystical Magicians, Men or Angels, in any first-creation understanding, or learning, can interpret them. Such another as <hi>Daniel,</hi> was <hi>Joseph,</hi> long before. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had two Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Dreams, that by their impression upon his mind, signified, that they signified some important thing, to him and his people: but what, he could not tell. This was left for the true interpreting Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in <hi>Joseph,</hi> to declare. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> knew, tho' <hi>his Dream was slipp'd from him,</hi> that 'twas an Oracle from God, and had a concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing significancy, <hi>so his spirit was troubled,</hi> as <hi>Pharoah'</hi>s in like case, <hi>till they both knew what their Dreams meant;</hi> Dan. 2. 1. Gen. 41. 8. They were both perfect puzzlers to the wisdom of man. <hi>None of the wise men in</hi> Egypt <hi>or</hi> Babylon, <hi>could interpret either of these Kings Dreams. Pharoah's doubled Dream,</hi> in two distinct Sleeps, signified the same things, seven years Plenty, and then seven of Famine. <hi>The fat and lean Kine coming out of the River</hi> Nile, signified the same cause of the Plenty and Famine; of the Plenty, by its wonted overflowings; and of the Famine, by failing therein. The two Kings, for the signal benefits they received by the hand of these two choice Saints, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd them to great worldly dignities, in their several Kingdoms and days. The Reason given, was, <hi>because the Spirit of God was in them;</hi> Gen. 41. 38. Dan. 2. 48. &amp; 5. 11. Is this a qualification for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment with Kings, now a-days, tho' call'd Christian, that these two Heathen Princes preferr'd <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> for?

whole Counsel of God,</hi> about the Salvation of men. Such Wisdom, as reaches the <hi>deep things of God's</hi> very Divinity, and most excellent spiritual creature-things of Christ and God; sure, natural, the lowest general rank of things, in Man and Angel's first-creation-make, can't lie hid, from. <hi>The</hi> divine and spiritual <hi>things of God, knoweth no Man</hi> or Angel, in their single, natural make or state; <hi>but in the Spirit of God,</hi> the new-Creature Gospel-spirit of Christ, becoming the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of their Life and discerning, by a new-Creation of them; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, — 15. <hi>Such Wisdom is not found in the</hi> first-creation <hi>Land of the living,</hi> or State of Life. Visible or invisible natural things, first-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Vanities, are the bounding (utmost immediately discernable) objects of the highest Wisdom, in that state. <hi>No fowls of the Air,</hi> Angels, by their mystical <hi>Vultur's Eye,</hi> or quickest, clearest natural sight, do so much as reach that place or spiritual state in Christ, <hi>where</hi> true <hi>Wisdom, and Understanding are found.</hi> Job 28. 7, 12, 13, 20, 21. Spiritual Light, darted on the natural Understanding of Man or Angel, may convince them both, that there are, not only Divine, but Spiritual, new-Creature things, which are quite out of the reach of their bare natural Understandings. And, that 'tis in the awak'ned principle of spiritual Life, only, they can properly and fully see and enjoy such things. All then, that undertake to handle the written Oracles or Word of God, without this only Key, or true interpreting Wisdom of God, communicated to them, in his <hi>Creature-Spirit of Grace,</hi> we may easily judg what work they are like to make on't, or what recompence they'l have for their pains. How Men, that handle the written Word of God, in a Wisdom and Spirit, that's foolishness and enmity to the living Word, Spirit, and Wisdom of God, will be handled by that living Word, at last, may easily be guess'd. Man, in all first-Covenant Life, Light, Wisdom, Righteousness, Holiness, is but <hi>holy flesh: wise, strong, and honourable in Christ;</hi> yet, but <hi>the natural Man, that can't receive the things of God; for, they are foolishness to him:</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> or any true Spiritual Saint, is reckon'd a fool, for owning or asserting any such things; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. &amp; 4. 8, 10. They are not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the natural understanding, <hi>are only spiritually discern'd.</hi> And he is offended, and <hi>stumbles at the cross-doctrine</hi> of death to his natural state, as undispensably necessary to his coming at true Wisdom, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Understanding. Such doctrine, he reckons <hi>folly and madness;</hi>

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>Hos.</hi> 9. 7, 8. First then, negatively, where is true Wisdom not to be found? <hi>not in the</hi> first-Creation <hi>Land of the living.</hi> Then, affirmatively, where is it to be had? In the new-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Land of the living,</hi> or spiritual, Gospel-state of life. <hi>The Wisdom of Man, that can't discern spiritual Things or Truths,</hi> how should it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the words of God's Wisdom,</hi> that means only such things, by all first-creation shadows, figures, and similitudes? All Scripture, as to the true spiritual intent and meaning of God, is <hi>a Book seal'd</hi> to the highest natural Wisdom of Angel or Man; <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 11. All divine and spiritual things of God, meant in the Scripture, are <hi>mysteries, fast lock'd up from that</hi> sort of <hi>Understanding, in learned, or unlearned Man.</hi> Man then, going to work, with that, which discerns no things of God, shuts out all those things, that are shut up from him, out of his humane Divinity, so call'd; and so, <hi>shuts up the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> in stead of opening it, to his Hearers.

Yea, worse; he is a direct enemy to all such Truths or Things, when declared; he hates and detests them, as blasphemous Fictions. So, <hi>shutting up the Kingdom of God,</hi> runs down himself and his <hi>blind Followers</hi> to <hi>the Chambers of death. In a lying</hi> humane <hi>spirit of Divination,</hi> back'd with Satan's lying evil angelical spirit, do Men come forth, to declare the Truths of God, <hi>and say, the Lord saith;</hi> Ezek. 13. 6. God signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his divine and spiritual things, to Men (which lie quite out of their natural discerning and reach) by such earthly shadows and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, as are discernable to them; and they lay hold on those shadows, denying all allegorizing, or interpreting them into God's Spiritual, Heavenly truths, or things. God's things can be no otherwise spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to man, then <hi>in parables,</hi> or by such things as are discernable to him; Mat. 13. 34. <hi>The truly wise spiritual Saint, only, understands the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> or, mysterious things of God, signified in the Scripture; v. 11.

The exchange of that, by the obedient death of nature, for God's unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gift of spiritual Life and Wisdom, is his only possible way of coming at any right and full understanding of the Scriptures. Man swells and puffs at any thing, his understanding can't reach, and his Will hates: so, scoffs at allegorizing the Scriptures, or interpreting them, into some other, farther things, then the literal shadow or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; lest something should, by so deep dipping into it, be turn'd up for Truth, that's above his understanding, and not pleasing to his Will. In love to his own Wisdom, he denies there is any other but God's purely divine, no spiritual Creature-Wisdom. And, if any pretend to that, he censures them, for <hi>Luciferian</hi> Presumption. He denies that superiour Creature-wisdom, Saints are partakers of, which is call'd also, <hi>the Wisdom of God;</hi> and then, most falsely taxes them with pretending to the very infinite divine Wisdom.

the very advice given, in them. For, literal Kings oft require what's contrary to <hi>the Oath of God;</hi> yea, to the common light of Nature. Both the moral Heathen, faithful to his first-Covenant light or Law of rational Nature; and the Jew or Christian, possess'd of first-Covenant Life, also; both these are to <hi>keep the Command of the King,</hi> here meant, who gave them both the said Light and Life; as <hi>the enlightner of every man that comes into the World;</hi> Joh. 1. 9. As fast as Christ set up in <hi>Paul,</hi> one light after another (light of Nature, light and life of the Law, and then light and life of his Gospel-Spirit) he walk'd faithfully, in obedience to him; <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 1.

Man, in all variety of light, ought to be faithful to that King, that gives all; following that light, as his Law, in and to him, for directing his steps, in desire, thought, word, and action. Now, a literal King, oft establishes mischief by an evil Law, or commands things contrary to establish'd good Laws, and wants not for Flatterers, that will tell him, all are bound to obey such his personal Commands, under pain of damnation, from that of (<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2.) most falsly interpreted, in a perfect contrariety to God's meaning, in it. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> swore Allegiance to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who gave him that name, signifying, <hi>the Oath of God,</hi> to mind him of his Covenant.

The ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute King, here, is Christ, over all the Earth; <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 6, -8. This, not in the spirit and life of the Law, as the <hi>Jews</hi> would have made him (Joh. 6. 15.) but, of the Gospel, into which he rais'd our nature, in himself. In his resurrection-state, is the Man Christ, the universal Monarch; as <hi>Paul</hi> interprets <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 33. By love or force, <hi>shall every knee bow to, and tongue confess</hi> this King. All friends and foes must and shall pay homage to him, <hi>when he takes to himself his great reigning Power;</hi> (Rev. 11. 17) or actually comes forth in the visible exercise thereof. None shall be able to hurt or hinder him, or his true subjects, in his peaceable Reign over all. <hi>He will dash enemies in pieces, like a Potters Vessel, with his Iron Rod</hi> or Scepter; Psal. 2. 9. Isa. 11. 1, — 9. In that all-powerful new-creation life and name, into which he has raisd our nature, will he do all this, to foes: <hi>Nor is there Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any other name</hi> or life, for friends; not in his partaken-of Law-name or life, by the <hi>knowledg of him after the flesh,</hi> or conformity to him in that perfect changeable first-covenant life of the Law, he took, as <hi>born of a Woman;</hi> but that, into which rais'd out of the death of that; <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 10, - 12. He says, that <hi>of himself,</hi> in his Law-life, <hi>he could do nothing.</hi> The obedience he had to perform in that, was passive, as commanded of his Father, <hi>John</hi> 10. 17, 18. This suffering obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, appointed by the Father, when finished, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4.) our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him, was glorified and exalted by the Father, into a life, wherein <hi>he can do all the Father doth;</hi> Joh. 5. 19, - 27. So, <hi>Saints can do nothing of themselves;</hi> or, in their own Law-life, towards Salvation; but, on the obedient surrender of that, in Christ's Gospel-life <hi>can they do all things;</hi> Phil. 4. 13. <hi>God,</hi> then, <hi>works all in or for them, and they work all their works in him.</hi> Isa. 26. 12 Phil. 2. 13. Joh. 3. 21. But, consider how great this Man, the King of Saints, &amp; Ruler of all, is; <hi>He is anointed above all his fellow-Brethren</hi> (<hi>that are Co-heirs with him, of God</hi>) in the transcendent prerogative of his fountain-creature-life of everlasting righteousness, and also of his infinite divine life; <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17:

reign in him, can it, in us; a change by death, for his unchangeable creature-Life, that's spiritual and eternal. The Man Christ, <hi>the King of Kings,</hi> in infinite divine and irresistible Creature-power, exercises a universal kingly and priestly Authority, in Love or Wrath, over all Angels and Men, good or bad. He will sacrifice changeable nature, as to any goodness thereof, in them all; in the incorrigibly wicked, to God's revenging Justice.

               <p>The acknowledg'd literal, gives aim at the mystical sence.

This may and ought to be, without any sinful compliance with such abused Power. Even Saints must suffer, as a passive owning that power, so ill manag'd, they can't actively obey. <hi>All ought to keep their place</hi> of subjection to it, so as not to rise up against, dispute, or deny the Rulers place and office, however abus'd. Such demeanour is the only safe way, to pacify the Ruler's unjust wrath, against them. t. <hi>For yielding pacifieth great offences.</hi> Yea, Devils are not to be denied their invisible evil Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principality and Power, permissively <hi>given them,</hi> in and <hi>over this World;</hi> Luk. 4. 5, 6.

this</hi> Supream <hi>Ruler,</hi> over all, as our true interest, and safety.

               <p>Here's a confirmation of the said spiritual Truth. <hi>In the morning</hi> (or, under Christ's first and earliest spiritual Convictions, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations or Discoveries of himself to thee, in his spiritual Life) <hi>sow thy Seed;</hi> or, readily use all diligence to make way for Christ's speedy influencing and quickning up his own <hi>Incorruptible Seed</hi> of Spiritual Life in thee. Let not thy earthy, natural, <hi>carnal mind,</hi> be hard'ned against Christ, but break, and kindly melt away under him; that what hinders, being removed, his spiritual Seed may spring up, in thee.

For, this is it, hinders the spiritual Seed from springing up, towards an hopeful Harvest.

Then is he upon his trial, for Eternal Life or Death, as obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or disobedient to the said spiritual Light.

So, there will be a joynt birth of life, springing up in the whole person of the Saint, from the quickned spiritual Seed, and both crucified and quicken'd earthly.

Saints, over and above all this, receive from him, a spiritual, everlasting righteous life, and are made spiritual Vessels, or sitted receptions thereof, by his second or new-Creation-workmanship. The fountain of this being and life, is also in himself, as <hi>head of the Church;</hi> Col. 1. 18. <hi>The incorruptible seed</hi> (1 Pet. 1. 23.) of this new life, was cast into their Spirits, from the date of their radical existing in the invisible creature-womb of himself, <hi>the parent of Spirits,</hi> in pursuance of the free thought and purpose of the divine mind. The actual quickning up this Seed, or <hi>giving them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life,</hi> is, what Christ purchas'd for them, (by the obedient death and sacrifice of his own assumed perfect, spotless, but changeable first-creation state) and is the builder of them up, in.

               <p>In reference to both these Creations, or Worlds, first and second, natural and spiritual (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2.) <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>remember Christ,</hi> as both <hi>thy</hi> natural and spiritual <hi>Creatour,</hi> bringing thee forth, according to the methods of God's Wisdom, <hi>first, in a natural state,</hi> by a first-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; <hi>and afterwards, in a spiritual,</hi> by a second; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 46. This twofold Creation, <hi>David acknowledg'd, too wonderful</hi> and oversetting to his understanding, as to the taking any right measures thereof, or putting any meet value, upon. <hi>When he consider'd the thoughts of God,</hi> in reference to the single first-creation of all; and then, his twofold-creation of Saints; he concludes <hi>the sum of them to be too great, to take or give a distinct and full account of.

Since the fall, has Christ, as Redeemer,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:37441:235"/>
laid a yet farther and greater Weight of obligation upon Men, <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him, as their Creatour,</hi> so as to yield a ready, universal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his spiritual Law, which always was the undispensable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Angel and Man, before the fall, as well as since. By that Law, is the life of Nature, at best, or in whatever condition, to be given up in sacrifice to God, by his priestly hand, that has, from all the said rights and obligations, a title thereunto. Since our fall, we receive our lost righteous natural Life or State, afresh, by his Redemption-Work, as a first benefit of his death. So are we bound to use our whole beings, <hi>bodies and spirits,</hi> in such restor'd Life, and then death and loss of it for a better, <hi>in obedience to his command, and conformity to his example. We must not live in, or do our own will, but his (that died for us</hi>) by the death of ours; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>Christ, now, is to be remembred as Redeemer, as well as Creatour;</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 8. By the death of nature in himself, he has purchas'd the lost righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life of it, for us. Hereby are we a-new put on the trial, for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient surrender thereof, for his spiritual, Resurrection-life, as the full benefit, and principal design of his death. <hi>Man, then, is so to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Creatour</hi> and Redeemer, as to make the right use of his restor'd natural State, by yeilding up his old, for Christ's <hi>newness of Life. This is the</hi> only way of <hi>putting away all evil from his flesh,</hi> or rooting out all enmity to God's Spirit, that's now inseparable from the life of nature, at best.</p>

               <p>These expressions do represent the weak, decay'd state of Man, in old age, which brings sorrow and darkness upon him, and, at length, a period to his bodily life, and all sensual delights. And, this figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively points at the like mystical decay, gray hairs, old age, and death, brought, as God's displeasure, on the most righteous, fruitful life of Man's spirit, under the Cross. But, all these marks of God's displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, on our natural body and spirit, as found in enmity to him, are the effects of his everlasting kindness to obedient Saints, as the very means and way of translating them into his everlasting righteous, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual creature life. For a season, Saints rejoyce in their enlighten'd nature, <hi>as Law-servants,</hi> finding delight in the literal and mystical <hi>Sun, Moon, and Stars</hi> of this World. But, they are made obedient to God's dispensation <hi>of turning the light of this mystical Sun, Moon, and Stars,</hi> as well as literal, <hi>into darkness,</hi> to their spirits, as well as bodies, in both which, <hi>there's a time appointed for all Men once to die;</hi> Heb. 9. 27. The mystical death of the spirit, and all decays, of a tendency thereunto, does <hi>Solomon</hi> figure out, here, by the decays of the body, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining age thereof. <hi>The keepers of the House that will tremble; and the strong Men, that shall bow themselves,</hi> outward limbs and parts of the Body, sigure out the inward Senses and intellectual Powers of the natural spirit, as operating by the Organs of the Body. The decays of bodily life, in all the parts and powers thereof, are felt and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd also by the inward faculties and powers of the Spirit, that are exercis'd by them. Hence, old Men grow weak, feeble, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect in the operations thereof; and so, are brought back again, into the condition of Children. Inward and outward Powers and Senses of body and spirit, <hi>tremble and bow themselves,</hi> in the literal
