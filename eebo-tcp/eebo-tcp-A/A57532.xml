            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Such therefore as are thy inferiours, will follow thee but to eate thee out, and when thou lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest to seed them, they wil hate thee; and such kind of men, if thou preserve thy estate, will always be had: And if thy friends be of better quality than thyself, thou mayest be sure of two things: the first, That they will be more carefull to keep thy counsel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have more to loethen thou hast: the second, They will esteem

Remember secondly, that if thou marry for Beauty, thou bindest thy self for all thy life for that, which perchance will neither last nor please thee one year; and when thou hast it, it will be to thee of no price at all, for the degree dieth when it is attained, &amp; the affection perisheth, when it is satisfied.

dost not marry an uncomely Woman for any respect; for comelinesse in Children is riches, if nothing else be left them. And if thou have care for the races of horses, and other beasts, value the shape and comelinesse of thy Children, before alliances or riches: have care therefore of both together, for if thou have a fair Wife, and a poor one, if thine own estate be not great, assure thy self that Love abideth not with want; for she is thy companion of plenty and honour, for I never yet knew a poor Woman exceeding fair, that was not made dishonest by one or other in the end.

nor precept.

But howsoever it be, or whatsoever thou find, leave thy wife no more than of necessity thou must, but onely during her wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood; for if she love again, let her not enjoy her second love in the same bed wherein she loved thee, nor fl<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

earth whilest it lasteth. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Wives were ordained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the generation of men, not to transferre them, and diminish them, either in continuance or ability; and therfore thy house and estate, which liueth in thy son, and not in thy wife, is to be preferred. Let thy time of marriage be in thy young and strong years; for believe it, ever the young wife betrayeth the old husband, and she that had thee not in thy flower, will despise thee in thy fall, and thou shalt be unto her but a captivity and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Thy best time will be towards thirty, for as the younger times are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, either to chuse or to govern a wife and family; so if thou stay long, thou shalt hardly see the education of thy Children, which being left to strangers, are in effect lost, and better were it to be unborn, than ill bred; for thereby thy posterity shall either perish, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a shame to thy name and family. Furthermore, if it be late ere thou take a wife, thou shalt spend the prime and summer of thy life with Harlots, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy thy health, impoverish thy estate, and endanger thy life; and be sure of this, that how many Mistresses soever thou hast, so many enemies thou shalt

purchase to thy self; for there never was any such affection, which ended not in hatred or disdain. Remember the saying of <hi>Solomon, There is a way which seemeth right to a man, but the issues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are the wages of death</hi>; for howsoever a lewd woman please thee for a time, thou wilt hate her in the end, and she will study to destroy thee. If thou canst not abstain from them in thy vain and unbridled times, yet remember that thou sowest on the lands &amp; dost mingle the vital bloud with corruption, and purchasest diseases, repentance, and ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tred onely. Bestow therefore thy youth so, that thou mayest have comfort to remember it, when it hath forsaken thee and not sigh and grieve at the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof: whilest thou art young thou wile think it will never have an end; but behold, the longest day hath his evening, and that thou shalt enjoy it but once, that it never turns again, use it therefore as the Spring time, which soon departeth, and wherein thou oughtest to plant, and sow all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for a long and happy life.</p>

                     <p>TAke care thou be not made a fool, by flatterers, for even the wisest men are abused by these. Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that flatterers are the worst kind of Traitours; for they will strengthen thy imperfections, encourage thee in all evil, correct thee in nothing, but so shadow and paint all thy vices, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as thou shalt never, by their will, discern evil from good, or vice from virtue. And because all men are apt to flatter themselves, to entertain the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of other mens praises is most perillous. Do not therefore praise thy self, except thou wile be counted a vain glorious fool, neither take delight in the praises of other men except thou deserve it, and receive it from such as are worthy and honest, and will withall warn thee of thy faults; for flatterers have never any virtue, they are ever base, creeping, cowardly persons. A flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer is said to be a beast that biteth smiling, it is said by <hi>Isaiah</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:

But it is hard to know them from friends, so are they obsequious and full of protestations; for as a wolf resembles a dog, so doth a flatterer a friend. A flatterer is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to an Ape, who because she cannot defend the house like a dog, labour as an ox, or bear burdens as a horse, doth therefore yee play tricks, and prouoke laughter: Thou mayest be sure that he that will in private tell thee thy faults, is thy friend, for he adventures thy mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and doth hazard thy hatred; for there are few men that can endure it, every man for the most part delighting in self-praise, which is one of the most uniuersall follies which bewitcheth mankind.</p>

If thou therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, or discourse in argument; let it be with wise and sober men, of whom thou mayest learn by reasoning, and not with ignorant persons, for thou shalt thereby in trust those that will not thank thee, and utter, what they have learned from thee, for their own.

                     <head>CHAP. V. Three Rules to be observed for the preservation of a mans estate.</head>
                     <p>AMongst all other things of the World, take care of thy estate, which thou shalt ever preserve, if thou observe three things; First, that thou know what thou hast, what every thing is worth that thou hast, and to see that thou art not wasted by thy Servants and Officers. The second is, that thou never spend any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou have it; for borrowing is the canker and death of every mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. The third is, that thou suffer not thy self to be wounded for other mens faults, and scourged for other mens offences; which is, to be surety for another; for thereby millions of men have been beggered and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, paying the reckoning of other mens riot, and the charge of other mens folly and prodigality; if thou smart, smart for thine own sins, and above all things, be not made an Ass
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61340:58"/>
to carry the burdens of other men: If any friend desire thee to be his surety, give him a patt of what thou hast to spare, if he press thee farther, he is not thy friend at all, for friendship rather chooseth harm to it self, than offereth it: If thou be bound for a stranger, thou art a fool; if for a merchant, thou puttest thy estate to learn to swim: if for a Church-man, he hath no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: if for a Lawyer, he will find an evasion by a syllable or word, to abuse thee: if for a poor man, thou must pay it thy self: if for a rich man, it need not: therefore from Sureti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as from a Man slayer, or Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, bless thy self; for the best profit and return wil be this, that if thou force him for whom thou art bound, to pay it himself, he will become thy enemy, if thou use to pay it thy self, thou wilt be a beggar; and believe thy Father in this, and print it in thy thought, that what virtue soever thou hast be it never so manifold, if thou be poor withall, thou, and thy quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties shall be despised: Besides, pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is oft times sent as a curse of God, it is a shame amongst men, an impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment of the mind, a vexation of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61340:59"/>
every worthy spirit; thou shalt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help thy self nor others, thou shalt drown thee in all thy virtues, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no means to shew them, thou shalt be a burthen, and an Eye-sore to thy friends, every man will fear thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, thou shalt be driven basely to beg, and depend on others, to flatter unworthy men, to make dishonest shifts; and to conclude, poverty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes a man to do infamous and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted deeds: Let no vanity therefore, or perswasion draw thee to that worst of wordly miseries.</p>
                     <p>If thou be rich, it will give thee pleasure in health, comfort in sickness, keep thy mind and body free, save thee from many perils, relieve thee in thy elder years, believe the poor, and thy honest Friends, and give means to thy posterity to live, and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and thine own fame, where it is said in the <hi>Proverbs, That he shall be sore vexed that is surety for a stranger, and he that hateth suretiship is sure.</hi> It is further said, <hi>The poor is hated even of his own neighbour, but the rich have many friends.</hi> Lend not to him that is mightier than thy self, for if thou lendest him, count it but lost;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61340:59"/>
be not surety above thy power, for if thou be surety, think to pay it.</p>

I my self have thereby lost more than I am worth.

                     <p>TAke especiall care that thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in Wine, for there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any man that came to honour or preferment that loved it; for it transformeth a man into a beast, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth health, poisoneth the breath, destroyeth naturall heat, brings a mans stomach to an artificiall heat, deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the face, rotteth the teeth, and to conclude, maketh a man contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, soon old, and despised of all wise and worthy men; hated in thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, in thy self and companions; for it is a bewitching and infectious vice, And remember my words, that it were better for a man to be subject to any vice, than to it, for all other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and sins are recovered, but a Drunkard will never shake off the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of beastlinesse; for the longer it possesseth a man, the more he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, and the elder he groweth,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61340:61"/>
the more he shall be subject to it; for it dulleth the spirits, and destroyeth the body, as Ivie doth the old Tree; or as the worm that engendereth in the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Nut.</p>
                     <p>Take heed therefore that such a curelesse Canker possesse not thy youth, nor such a beastly infection thy old age; for then shall all thy life be but as the life of a beast, and after thy death, thou shalt only leave a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full infamy to thy posterity, who shall study to forget that such a one was their Father. <hi>Anacharsis</hi> saith, <hi>The first draught serveth for health, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond for pleasure, the third for shame, the sourth for madnesse</hi>; but in youth there is not so much as one draught permitted; for it putteth fire to fire; and wasteth the naturall heat and seed of generation. And therefore, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou desire to hasten thine end, take this for a generall rule, That thou never add any artificiall heat to thy body by Wine or Spice, untill thou find that time hath decayed thy natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat, and the sooner thou begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Whosoever loveth Wine, shall not be trusted of any man; for he cannot keep a secret. Wine maketh a man not onely a beast, but a mad man; and if thou love it, thy own Wife, thy Children, and thy friends will despise thee. In drink men care not what they say, what offence they give, they forget comliness, commit disorders; and to conclude, offend all virtuous and honest company, and God most of all; to whom we daily pray for health, and a life free from pain: and yer by drunkenness, and gluttony, (which is the drunkenness of feeding) we draw on, saith <hi>Hesiod,</hi> a swift, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, untimely, cruel, and an infamous old age. And S. <hi>Augustine</hi> describeth Drunkenness in this manner: Ebrietas est blandus Doemon, dulce venenum

                     <p>Drunkenness is a flattering Devil, a sweet poison, a plea ant sin; which whosoever hath, hath not himself, which whosoever doth commit, doth not commit sin, but he himself is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sin.</p>

The young man may die quickly, but the old man cannot live long: the young mans life by casualty may be abridged, but the old mans by no phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick can be long adjourned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if green years should sometimes think of the grave the thoughts of old age should continually dwell in the same.</p>
                  <p>The prerogative of Infancy is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; of Child-hood, reverence; of Man-hood, maturity; and of old age, wisdom.</p>

To serve the world you are now unable, and though you were able, yet you have little cause to be willing, seeing that it never gave you but an unhappy wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, a hurtfull entertainment, and now doth abandon you with an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate fare-well.</p>
                  <p>You have long sowed in a field of flint, which could bring nothing forth but a crop of cares, and afflictions of spirit, rewarding your labours with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse, and affording for your gain, eternal danger.</p>
                  <p>It is now more than a seasonable time to alter the course of so unthri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a husbandry, and to enter into the efild of Gods Church, in which, sowing the seed of repentant sorrow, and watering them with the tears of humble contrition, you may hereafter reap a more beneficial harvest, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>Be not carelesse (saith Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>) though our loving Lord bear long with offenders; for the longer he stays, not finding amendment, the sorer he will scourge when be comes to Iudgement: And his patience in so long forbearing, is only to lend us respite to repent, and not any wise to enlarge us leisure to sin.</p>
                  <p>He that is tossed with variety of storms, and cannot come to his desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Port, maketh not much way, but is much turmoyled. So, he that hath passed many years, and purchased lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle profit, hath a long being, but a short life: For, life is more to be measured by well doing, than by number of years; Seeing that most men by many days do but procure meny deaths, and others in short space attain to the life of infinite ages; what is the body without the soul, but a corrupt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasse? And what is the soul without

                  <p>If God be the Way, the Life, and the Truth, he that goeth without him, strayeth; and he that liveth without him, dieth; and he that is not taught by him, erreth.</p>
                  <p>Well (saith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) God is our true and chiefest Life, from whom to revolt, is to fall; to whom to return, is to rise; and in whom to stay, is to stand sure.</p>
                  <p>God is he, from whom to depart, is to die; to whom to repair, is to revive; and in whom to dwell, is life for ever. Be not then of the number of those that begin not to live, till they be ready to die: and then after a foes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, come to crave of God a friends entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Some there be that think to snatch Heaven in a moment, which the best can scarce attain unto in the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of many years; and when they have glutted themselves with worldly delights, would jump from <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Wherefore, good SIR, make no longer delays; but being so near the breaking up of your mortall house, take time before extremity, to pacifie Gods anger.</p>
                  <p>Though you suffer the bud to be blasted, though you permitted the fruits to be perished, and the leaves to drie up; yea, though you let the boughs to wither, and the body of your tree to grow to decay, yet (alas) keep life in the root, for fear left the whole tree become fewel for hell fire;

These great differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cannot but cause a divers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary temperament, and qualitie in those creatures, and consequently, a great diversity in their phantasie and conceit; so that they apprehend one and the same object, yet they must do it after a divers manner: for is it not absurd to affirm, That creatures dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer so much in temperature, and yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in conceit concerning one and the same object?</p>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61340:76"/>
which, saith the same Philosopher, is as it he reasoned thus, the Beast must be gone either this, or this, or the other way; but neither this nor this; <hi>Eage,</hi> the third: and so away he runneth.</p>
                  <p>If we consider his skill in Physick, it is sufficient to help himself: if he be wounded with a dart, he useth the help of his Teeth to take it out, of his Tongue to cleanse the wound from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: he seemeth to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Precept of <hi>Hipp<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

The Dog then we see is plentifully furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inward discourse.</p>
                  <p>Now outward speech is not needfull to make a creature Reasonable, else a dumb Man were an unreasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>And do not Philosophers themselves reject this as an enemie to knowledge? and therefore they are <hi>silent</hi> when they are instructed; and yet even as Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and strange people of speech, but we understand it not, neither do we
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61340:77"/>
perceive any great difference in their words: but a difference there seemeth to be, and they do expresse their thoughts and meanings one to another by those words. Even so those creatures, which are commonly called unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, do seem to parlie one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and by their speech to understand one the other. Do not Binds by one kind of speech call their young ones, and by another cause them to hide themselves? Do they not by their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall voices expresse their severall passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of joy, of grief, of fear in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that their fellows understand them? Do they not by their voice fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew things to come? But we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to that creature we first did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in. The Dog delivereth one kind of voice when he hunteth, another when he howleth, another when he is beaten, and another when he is angry. These creatures then are not void of outward speech.</p>
                  <p>If then these creatures excell Man in sense, and are equall to him in inward and outward discourse, why should not their conceits and imaginations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh the outward object in as true a manner as ours? and if so, then seeing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61340:77"/>
their imaginations are divers, and they conceit it diversly according to their divers temperaments, I may tell what the outward object seemeth to me; but what it seemeth to other creatures, or whether it be indeed that which it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me, or any other of them, I know not.</p>
                  <p>But be it granted, that the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Man in this case, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Iudgement of Beasts; yet in Men there is great difference; both in respect of the outward shape, and also of the temperature of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: For the bodie of the <hi>Suth an</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth in shape from the bodie of the <hi>

                     </hi>: the reason of it ariseth (say the Dogmaticks) from a predominan use of humours in the one more than in the other; and as severall humours are predominant, so are the phantasies and conceits severally framed and effected. So that our countrey-men delight in one thing, the <hi>Indian</hi> not in that, but in another which we regard not. This would not be, if their conceits and ours were both a like; for then we should like that which they do, and they would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that which we would dislike.

                  <p>If then it be so, that there be such differences in Men, this must be by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the divers temperatures they have, and divers disposition of their conceit and imagination; for, if one hate, and another love the very same thing, it must be that their phantasies differ, else all would love it, or all would hate it. These Men then, may tell how these things seem to them good, or bad; but what they are in their own Nature they cannot tell.</p>
                  <p>If we will heathen to mens opinions, concerning one and the same matter, thinking thereby to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, we shall find this to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; for, either we must believe what all men say of it, or what some men only say of it. To believe what all men say of one &amp; the same thing, is not possible; for then we shall believe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties; for some men say, that that very thing is pleasant, which other say is displeasant. If it be said, we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve onely some men, then let it be shewed who those some men are; for the <hi>Platonists</hi> will believe <hi>Plato,</hi> but the <hi>Epicures Epicurus,</hi> the <hi>Phytagorians Pythagoras,</hi> &amp; other Philosophers the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61340:79"/>
masters of their own Sects: so that it is doubtfull, to which of all these we shall give credit. If it be said, that we must credit the greatest number; this seemeth childish: for there may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other Nations a greater number which denie that very point, which the greatest number with us do affirm: so that hereof nothing can certainly be affirmed.</p>
                  <p>This Argument seemeth to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed, if the differences of the Senses of <hi>Hearing, Seeing, Smelling, Touching,</hi> and <hi>Tasting</hi> be considered; for that the Senses differ, it seemeth plain.</p>
                  <p>Painted Tables (in which the art of Slanting is used) appear to the Eye, as if the parts of them were some higher, and some lower than the other, but to the Touch they seem not to be so.</p>
                  <p>Honey seemeth to the Tongue sweet, but unpleasant to the Eye: so Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth recreate the Smell, but it offendeth the Tast. Rain-water is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Eyes, but it hurteth the Lungs. We may tell then, how these things seem to our severall senses, but what they are in their own nature we cannot tell: for why should not a man
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61340:79"/>
credit any one of his senses as well as the other?</p>
                  <p>Every object seemeth to be presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted diversly unto the severall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sense. An Apple to the Touch seemeth smooth, sweet to the Smell, and to the Eye yellow; but whether the Apple have one of these qualities onely, or more than these qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, who can tell? The Organ hath many Pipes, all which are filled with the same blast of wind, varied accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the capacitie of the severall Pipes which receive it: even so the qualitie of the Apple may be but one, and this one quality may be varied, &amp; seem yellow to the Eye, to the Touch smooth, and sweet to the Smell, by reason of the divers instruments of the Sense, which apprehend this one quality diversly.</p>
                  <p>It may be also, that an Apple hath many qualities besides; but we are not able to conceive them all, because we want fit means and instruments to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them. For suppose that some Man is born blind, and deaf, and yet can touch, smell, and tast; this man will not think that there is any thing, which may be seen or heard, because he wanteth the Senses of hearing and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61340:80"/>
seeing; he will onely think there are those qualities in the object, which by reason of his three Senses he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth: Even so the Apple may have many more qualities; but we cannot come to know them, because we want fit instruments for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>If it be replied, that Nature hath ordained as many instruments of Sense, as there are sensible objects; I demand, What Nature? for there is a confused controversie about the very Essence of Nature. Some affirming it to be one thing, others another, few a greeing: so that what the quality of an Apple is, or whether it hath one qualitie or many, I know not.</p>
                  <p>Let a man also consider, how many things that are separated, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, appear to differ from that which they seem to be, when they are in a mass or lump the scrapings of the Goats horn seems white, but in the horn they seem black, but in the lump white. The stone <hi>Toenaru,</hi> being polished, seemeth white, but unpolished &amp; rough it seemeth yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Sands being separated, appear rough to the Touch, but a great heap, soft. I may then report, how these things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but whether they are so indeed, I know not.</p>

                        <salute>Honourable SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Was lately perswaded, by two Gentlemen, my anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Friends, to acquaint your Honour with some offers of mine, made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore for a Journey to <hi>Guiana,</hi> who were of opinion, That it would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understood now, than when it was first propounded, which advice having surmounted my dispair, I have presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to send unto your Honour the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of those Letters which I then wrote, both to his Majestie, and to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer <hi>Ceuill,</hi> wherein as well the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61340:91"/>
that first moved me are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, as the objections by him made are briefly answered.</p>
                     <p>What I know of the riches of that place, not by hear say, but what mine eyes hath seen, I have said it often, but it was then to no end: Because those that had the greatest trust, were resolved not to believe it, not because they doubted the Truth, but because they doubted my Disposition towards themselves; where (if God had blessed me in the enterprise) I had recovered his Majesties favour and good opinion. Other cause than this, or other suspition they never had any. Our late worthy Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was extream curious in searching out the Nature of my offences, The Queens Majestie hath informed her self from the beginning. The King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark at both times of his being here was throughly satisfied of my innocencie, they would otherwise ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have moved his Majestie on my behalf.</p>
                     <p>The Wife, the Brother, and the Son of a King, do not use to sue for men suspect; but Sir, since they all have done it out of their charitie,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61340:92"/>
and but with references to me alone. Your Honour (whose respect hath one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relation to his Majesties service) strengthened by the example of those Princes, may with the more hardnesse do the like, being Princes to whom his Majesties good estate is not lesse dear; and all men that shall oppugne it, no lesse hatefull, then to the King himself.</p>
                     <p>It is true Sir, That his Majestie hath sometimes answered, That his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel knew me better than he did; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning some two or three of them, And it was indeed my infelicitie; for had his Majestie known me, I had never been here where I now am: or had I known his Majestie, they had never been so long there where they now are. His Majestie not knowing of me hath been my ruine, and his Majestie mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing of them, hath been the ruine of a goodly part of his estate: but they are all of them now, some living and some dying, come to his Majesties knowledge. But Sir, how little soever his Majestie knew me, and how much soever he believed them, yet have I been bound to his Majestie both for my Life, and all that remains, of which,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61340:92"/>
but for his Majestie, nor Life, nor ought else had remained. In this respect Sir, I am bound to yield up the same life, and all I have for his Majesties service; to die for the King, and not by the King, is all the ambition I have in the world.</p>

forced to charge them, and soon after beat them out of the Town. In the Assault, my son (more desirous of honour than safetie) was slain, with whom (to say truth) all the respects of this world have taken end in me.

the <hi>Indies</hi> since his Majesties time knew that the Spaniards have flayed alive all the poor men which they have taken, being but Merchant men, what death and cruel torment shall we expect if they conquer us? certainly they have hitherto failed grosly, being set out thence as we were, both for number, time, and place.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, to make an Apologie for not working the Myne, (although I know his Majestie expects) whom I am to satisfie so much, as my self, having lost my son, and my estate in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, yet it is true, that the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards took more care to defend the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage leading unto it, than they did the Town, which by the Kings instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s they might easily do, the Countreys being <hi>Aspera &amp; Nemosa.</hi>

He, to wit, <hi>Kemish,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own advice, thought that it was in vain to discover the Myne; for he gave me this for an excuse at his return, that the Companies of English in the Town of S. <hi>Thome</hi> were not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, against the daily and nightly assaults of the Spaniards, that the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages to the Mynes, were thick and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passable woods, and that the Myne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discovered, they had no men to work it, did not discover it at all: for it is true, the Spaniards having two gold Mynes near the Town, the one possessed by <hi>Pedro Rodrigo de Paran,</hi> the second by <hi>Harmian Frotinio,</hi> the third of silver, by Captain <hi>Francisco,</hi> for the want of <hi>Negroes</hi> to work them: for as the <hi>Indians</hi> cannot be constrained by a Law of <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth, so the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> will not, nor can endure the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of those Mynes, whatsoever the Bragadochio, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor saith. I shall prove under the Proprietors hand, by the Custom-Book, and the Kings Quinto, of which I recovered an Ingot or two: I shall also make it appear to any Prince or State that will undertake it, how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily those Mynes, and five or six more
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:61340:98"/>
of them may be possessed, and the most of them in those parts, which never have as yet been attempted by any, nor by any passage to them, nor ever disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the English, French, or Dutch. But at <hi>Kemish</hi> his return from <hi>Orinoque,</hi> when I rejected his counsel and his course, and told him that he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done me; and wounded my credit with the King past recovery, he slew himself: for I told him, that seeing my son was slain, I cared not if I had lost an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more in opening of the Myne, so my credit had been saved: for I protest before God, had not Capt. <hi>Whitney</hi> (to whom I gave more countenance than to all the Captains of my Fleet) run from me at the <hi>Granadoes,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried another ship with him of Captain <hi>Woldestons.</hi> I would have left my body at S. <hi>Thomes</hi> by my sons, or have brought with me out of that or other Mynes, so much Gold oar, as should have satisfied the King. I propounded no vain thing; what shall become of me I know not, I am unpardoned in <hi>England,</hi> and my poor estate consumed, and whether any Prince will give me bread or no I know not.

and Sir <hi>John Hawkins</hi> died heart bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken when they failed of their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, I could willingly do the like, did I not contend against sorrow for your sake, in hope to provide somewhat for you and to comfort and relieve you. If I live to return, resolve your self that it is the care for you that hath strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my heart. It is true that <hi>Kemish</hi> might have gone directly to the Myne, and meant it, but after my sons death, he made them believe he knew not the way, and excused himself upon want of water in the River, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter feiting many impediments left it unfound. When he came back, I told him he had undone me, and that my credit was lost for ever; he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That when any son was lost, and that he left me so weak, that he resolved not to find me alive, he had no reason to enrich a companie of Rascals, who after my sons death made no account of him. He further told me that the English sent up into <hi>Guiana,</hi> could hardly defend the Spanish town of S. <hi>Thome</hi> which they had taken, and therefore for them to passe through thick woods it was impossible, and more impossible to have victuall brought

I say five of them slain in the enterance of the Town, the rest went off in a whole bodie, and took more care to defend the passages to their Mynes (of which they had three within a League of the Town, besides a Myne that was about five miles off) than they did of the Town it self. Yet <hi>Kemish</hi> at the first was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to go to the Myne; but when he came to the banck-side to Land, and had two of his men slain outright from the bank, and six other hurt, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Thornix</hi> shot in the head, of which wound, and the accident thereof, he hath pined away those twelve weeks.</p>
                        <p>Now when <hi>Kemish</hi> came back and gave me the former Reasons which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him not to open the Myne, the one the death of my son, a second the weaknesse of the English, and their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities to work and to be victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; a third that it were a folly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it for the Spaniards; and lastly my weaknesse and being unpardoned;

and that I rejected all these his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and told him, that I must leave him to himself to resolve it to the King and State, he shut up himself into his Cabbin, and shot himself with a poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Pistol which broke one of, his ribs, and finding that he had not prevailed, he thrust a long Knife under his short ribs up to the handle and died. Thus much I have written to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Secretarie, to whose Letters I refer you to know the truth.

He replyed, that the grant to me was to no man, <hi>non

                        <salute>Most excellent Prince,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>IF the Ship your Highness intends to build, be bigger than the <hi>Victorie,</hi> then her beams, which are laid over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart from side to side will not serve again, and many other of her timbers and other stuff, will not serve, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if she be a size less, the timber of the old Ship will serve well to the building of a new.</p>
                     <p>If she be bigger she will be of less use, go very deep to water, and of mightie charge, our Channels decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every year, less nimble, less man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable, and seldom to be used <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Navio grande satica</hi> saith the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</p>
                     <p>A Ship of six hundred Tuns, will carrie as good Ordinance as a Ship of twelve hundred Tuns, and where the greater hath double her Ordinance, the less will turn her broad side twice, before the great Ship can wind
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61340:107"/>
once, and so no advantage in that over-plus of Guns. The lesser will go over clear where the greater shall stick and perish; the lesser will come and go, leave or take, and is yare, whereas the greater is slow, unmanyable, and ever full of encumber.</p>
                     <p>In a well conditioned Ship, these things are chiefly required.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That she be strong built.</item>
                        <item>2. Swift in sail.</item>
                        <item>3. Stout-sided.</item>
                        <item>4. That her Ports be so laid, as that she may carry out her Guns all weathers.</item>
                        <item>5. That she hull and trie well.</item>
                        <item>6. That she stay well, when board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or turning on a wind is required.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>To make her strong, consisteth in the care and truth of the work-man; to make her swift, is to give her a large Run, or way forward, and so after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, done by act and just proportion, and that in laying out of her bowes before, and quarters behind; the Ship-wright be sure, that she neither sink nor hang into the water, but lie clear and a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> called a good sea-Ship, there are two things principally to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the one that she have a good draught of water, the other that she be not overcharged: And this is seldom done in the Kings Ships, and therefore we are forced to lye, or trie in them with our main Course and mizen, which with a deep keel and standing streak, she would perform.</p>
                     <p>The extream length of a Ship makes her unapt to stay, especially if she be floatie and want sharpnesse of way forward. And it is most true, that such over-long Ships, are fitter for the narrow Seas in summer, than for the Ocean, or long voyages: and therefore an hundred foot by the Keel, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie five foot broad is a good proportion for a great Ship.</p>
                     <p>It is to be noted, that all Ships sharp before, not having a long floar, will fall rough into the sea from a
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61340:108"/>
billow, and take in water over head and ears; and the same quality have all narrow-quartered ships to sink after the tail. The high Charging of ships, is that that brings many ill qualities, it makes them extream Lee-ward, makes them sink deep into the seas, makes them labour sore in foul weather, and oft-times overset. Safety is more to be respected than shews, or nicenesse for ease; in sea journeys both cannot well stand together, and therefore the most necessary is to be chosen.</p>
                     <p>Two Decks and an half is enough, and no building at all above that, but a low Masters Cabbin. Our Masters and Mariners will say, that the ships will bear more well enough; and true it is, if none but ordinary Mariners served in them. But men of better sort, unused to such a life, cannot so well endure the rowling and tumbling from side to side, where the seas are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little grown, which comes by high Charging. Besides those high Cabbin works aloft, are very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in sight, to tear men with their splinters.</p>
                     <p>Above all other things, have care that the great Guns be four foot clear
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61340:108"/>
above water when all lading is in, or else these best pieces are idle sea: for if the Ports lie lower, and be open it is dangerous; and by that default was a goodly Ship, and many gallant Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen lost, in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eigth, before the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> in a Ship called by the name of <hi>Mary-Rose.</hi>

His Attire was a wrought Night-cap, a Ruff band, a hair-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Sattin Doublet, with a black wrought Waste-coat under it, a pair of black cut Taffery Breeches, a pair of ash-coloured Silk Stockings &amp; a wrought black Velvet Night gown; putting off his Hat, he directed his Speech to the Lords present, as followeth.

                        <p>My honourable Lords, and the rest of my good friends that come to see me die, Know, that I much rejoyce that it hath pleased God to bring me from darknesse to night, and in freeing me from the Tower, wherein I might have died in disgrace, by letting me love to come to this place, where though I lose my life, yet I shall clear some false accusations, unjustly laid to my charge, and leave behind me a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of a true heart, both to my King and Country.</p>

                        <p>Another suspition is had of me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I did labour to make an escape from

                           <hi>Plymouth</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> I cannot deny, but that willingly, when I heard a rumour, That there was no hope of my Life upon my return to <hi>London,</hi> I would have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped so the safeguard of my Life, and not for any ill intent or conspiracie against the State.</p>
                        <p>The like reason of suspition arose, in that I perswaded Sir <hi>Lewis Steakly,</hi> my Guardian, to flee with me from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> but my answer to this is, as to the other, That onely for my safeguard, and thought else, was my intent, as I shall answer before the Almightie.</p>
                        <p>It is alleadged, That I seigned my self sick and in art made my body full of bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters when I was at <hi>Salisbury.</hi> True it is, I did to; the reason was, because I hoped thereb<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Concerning the second Imputation laid to my charge, that I should speak scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and reprochfull words of my Prince, there is no witnesse against me but onely

one, and he a Chimicall <hi>French</hi> man, whom I entertained, rather for his Iests than his Iudgement: this man to incroach himself into the favour of the Lords, and gaping after some great reward, hath falsely accused me of Seditions speeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Majestie; against whom, if I did either speak, or think a thought hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or prejudiciall, the Lord blot me out of the book of Life.</p>
                        <p>It is not a time to flatter or fear Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for I am a subject to none but Death? therefore have a charitable conceit of me.

                        <p>As for other objections, in that I was brought perforce into <hi>England,</hi> that I carried sixteen thousand pounds in money out of <hi>England</hi> with me, more than I I made known; that I should receive Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>and such like, with many Protestations he utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied.</hi>

                  <p>THose that are supprest and helpelesse are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly silent, wishing that the common ill in all sort might be with their particular misfortunes: which disposition, as it is uncharitable in all men, so would it be in me more dogge-like then man-like, to bite the stone that strooke me: (to wit) the borrowed authority of my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne misinformed, seeing their armes and hunds that flang it, are most of them already rotten. For I
<pb facs="tcp:61340:116"/>
must confesse it ever, that they are debts, and not discontentments, that your Majesty hath laid upon me; the debts and obligation of a friendlesse adversity, farre more payable in all Kinds, then those of the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: All which, nor the least of them, though I cannot discharge, I may yet endeavour it.</p>
                  <p>And notwithstanding my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint hath retrenched all wayes, as well the wayes of labour and will, as of all other imployments, yet hath it left with me my cogitations, then which I have nothing else to offer on the Altar of my Love.</p>
                  <p>Of those (most gracious Soveraigne) I have used some part in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dispute, between a Counsellour of Estate, and a Iustice of Peace, the one disswading, the other perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the calling of a Parliament. In all which, since the Norman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest (at the least so many, as Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories have gathered) I have in
<pb facs="tcp:61340:116"/>
some things in the following Dia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logue presented your Majesty with the contentions and successes.</p>
                  <p>Some things there are, and those of the greatest, which because they ought first to be resolved on, I thought fit to range them in the front of the rest, to the end your Majesty may be pleased to examine your own great and Princely heare of their acceptance, or refusall.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that supposition, that your Majesties Subjects give nothing but with adjuction of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, interlacing in one, and the same act your Majesties reliefe, and their own liberties; not that your Majesties piety was ever suspected, but because the best Princes are ever the least jealous, your Majesty judging others by your self, who have abused your Majesties trust. The fear'd continuance of the like abuse may perswade the provision But this caution, how ever it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:61340:117"/>
at first sight, your Majesty shall perceive by many examples follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but frivolous. The bonds of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Kings should alwayes be wrought out of Iron, the bonds of Kings unto Subjects but with Cobwebs.</p>
                  <p>This it is (most renowned Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne) that this trafficke of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances hath been often urged, of which, if the Conditions had been easie, our Kings have as easily kept them; if hard and prejudiciall, either to their honours or estates, the Creditours have been paid their debts whith their own presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                  <p>For all binding of a King by Law upon the advantage of his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, makes the breach it self lawfull in a King, His Charters and all other instruments being no other then the surviuing witnesses of unconstrained will: <hi>Princeps non subjicitur nifi sua volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb facs="tcp:61340:117"/>
libera, mero motu &amp; certa Scientia:</hi> Necessary words in all the grants of a King witnessing that the same grants were given freely and knowingly.</p>
                  <p>The second resolution will rest in your Majesty, leaving the new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, all Monopolies, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grievances of the people to the consideration of the House, Provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that your Majesties revenue be not abated, which if your Majesty shall refuse, it is thought that the disputes will last long, and the is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues will be doubtfull: And on the contrary if your Majesty vouchsafe it, it may perchance be stiled a yeelding, which seemeth by the sound to brave the Regalty.</p>
                  <p>But (mose excellent Prince) what other is it to th' eares of the Wise, but as the sound of a trumpet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving blasted forth a false Alarme, becomes but common aire? Shall the head yeeld to the feete? certainly it
<pb facs="tcp:61340:118"/>
ought, when they are grieved, for wisdome will rather regard the commodity, then object the disgrace, seeing if the feet lye in fetters, the <hi>head</hi> cannot be freed, and where the feet feele but their own paines, the head doth not onely suffer by participiation, but withall by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the evill.</p>
                  <p>Certainly the point of honour well weighed hath nothing in it to even the ballance, for by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties favour, your Majesty doth not yeeld either to any person, or to any power, but to a dispute onely, in which the Proposition and Minor prove nothing without a conclusion, which no other person or power can make, but a Majesty: yea this in <hi>Henry</hi> the third his time was called a wisedome incomparable. For, the King raised again, recovery his authority: For, being in that extremity as he was driven with the Queen and his Children, <hi>Cum
<pb facs="tcp:61340:118"/>
Abbatibus &amp; Prioribus satis humilibus hospitia quaerere &amp; prandia</hi>: For the rest, may it please your Majesty to consider that there can nothing befall your Majesty in matters of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires more unfortunately, then the Commons of Parliament with ill successe: A dishonour so perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and adventurous as it will not onely find arguments; but it will take the leading of all enemies that shall offer themselves against your Majesties estate.</p>

                     <p>You know that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had no formal Parliament till about the 18. year of <hi>Hen.</hi> the first, for in his 17 year for the marriage of his Daughter, the King raised a tax upon every hide of land by the advice of his privy Councell alone.

                     <p>You say well, but it was after the establishment of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by colour of it, that they had so great daring, for before that time they could not endure to hear of Sr. <hi>Edwards</hi> lawes, but resisted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in all they could, although

                     <p>Yet for all that, restraint is imprisonment, yea, fear it self is imprisonment, and the King was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to both: I know there is nothing more Kingly in a King than the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his word; but yet of a word freely and voluntarily given. Neither was the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the first so published, that all men might plead it for their advantage but a <hi>Charter</hi> was left (<hi>in deposito</hi>) in the hands of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for the time, and so to his successours. <hi>Stephen Langthon,</hi> who was ever a Traytor to the King, produced this <hi>Charter,</hi> and shewed it to the Barons,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61340:123"/>
thereby encouraging them to make war against the King. Neither was it the old <hi>Charter</hi> simply the Barons sought to have confirmed, but they presented unto the King other articles and orders, tending to the alteration of the whole commonwealth, which when the King refused to signe, the Barons presently put themselves into the field, and in rebellious and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious fashion sent the King word, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he confirmed them, they would not desist from making war against him, till he had satisfied them therein. And in conclusion, the King being betrayed of all his Nobility, in effect was forced to grant the Charter of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta de Forestis,</hi> at such time as he was invironed with an Army in the Meadowes of <hi>Staynes,</hi> which <hi>harters</hi> being procured by force, Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> afterward disavowed, and threatned to curse the Barons if they submitted not themselves as they ought to their Soveraigne Lord, which when the Lords refused to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, the King entertained an army of strangers for his own defence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with having mastered and beaten the Barons, they called in <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>France</hi> (a most unnaturall resolution) to be

                     <p>It is true my good Lord, that a subsidie was then denied, and the reasons are delivered in <hi>English</hi> Histories, and indeed the King not long before had spent much Treasure in aiding the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> to no purpose; for he drew over the King but to draw on good conditions for himself, as the Earle of <hi>March</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law now did: As the <hi>English</hi> Barons did invite <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>France</hi> not long before, as in elder times all the Kings and States had done, and in late years the Leaguers of <hi>France</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Protestants and Netherlands, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> not with any purpose to greaten those that aide them, but to purchase to themselves an advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous peace. But what say the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to this denyall? They say, with a world of payments there mentioned, that the King had drawn the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty drie. And besides, that whereas not long before great summes of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61340:131"/>
Church for 3 years, and three marks of every Knights Fee throughout the Kingdome, upon his promise and oath upon the observing of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> but in the end of the same year, the King being then in <hi>France,</hi> he was denyed the aides which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. What is this to the danger of a Parliament? especially at this time they had reason to refuse, they had given so great a summe in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the same year. And again; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was known that the King had but pretended war with the King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile,</hi> with whom he had secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted an alliance, and concluded a Marriage betwixt his Son <hi>Edward</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elenor.</hi> These false fires do but fright Children, and it commonly falls out, that when the cause given is known to be false, the necessitie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended is thought to be fained. Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dealing hath evermore Royall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: and as the King was denyed in the eight and thirtieth year, so was he denyed in the nine and thirtieth year, because the Nobilitie and the people saw it plainely, that the K. was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Pope, who as well in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite to <hi>Manfred</hi> bastard Son to the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the second: as to

Now, my good Lord, the wisdome of Princes is seen in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then in their enterprises.

A contrained consent is the consent of a Captive and not of a King and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was nothing done their ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther legally or royally. For if it be not properly a Parliament where the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is not free, certainely it can be none where the King is bound, for all Kingly rule was taken from the King, and twelve Peeres appointed, and as some Writers have it 24.

forty shillings upon every sack of Wooll, and for every 30 wooll fels forty shillings, for every last of leatherne, as much, and for all other merchandizes after the same rate. The King promising that this years ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering ended, he would thenceforth content himself with the old custome, he had over and above this great aide the eight part of all goods of all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens and Burgesses; and of other as of forreigne Merchants, and such as lived not of the gain of breeding of sheep and cattell the fifteenth of their goods. Nay my Lord: this was not all, though more then ever was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any King, for the same Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment bestowed on the King the ninth sheaf of all the corn within the Land, the ninth fleece, and the ninth lambe for two years next following; now what think your Lordship of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>

                     <p>The Charters were obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as before, and so they will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the other petition was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, the King being pleas'd, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, that the great Officers, should take an oath in Parliament to do Iustice. Now for the Parliament of <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the 17th year of the King, the King had three markes and a half for every sack of Wooll, transported; and in his 18th he had a 10th of the Clergie, and a 15th of the Laity for one year. His Majestie forbare after this to charge his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with any more payments, untill the 29th of his reigne, when there was given the King by Parliament 50 for every sack of Wool transported for six yeares, by which grant, the King received a thousand markes a day, a greater matter then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds in these dayes, and a 1000l. a day amounts to 365000l. a year, which was one of the greatest

For besides the cheape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all things in that age, the Kings souldiers had but 3d. a day wages, a man at armes 6d. a Knight but 2s.

                     <p>I will with patience answer your Lordship to the full, and first your Lordship may remember by that which I even now said, that never King had so many gifts as this King had from his subjects, and it hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grieved the subjects of <hi>England</hi> to give to their King, but when they knew there was a devouring Lady, that had her share in all things that passed, and the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was as scraping as shee, that the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour did eat up the people as fast as either of them both. It grieved the subjects to feed these Cormorants.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61340:144"/>
But my Lord there are two things by which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been prest, (to wit) by their subjects, and by their own necessities. The Lords in former times were farre stronger, more warlike, better followed, living in their Countries, then now they are. Your Lordship may remember in your reading, that there were many Earles could bring into the field a thousand Barbed horses, many a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron 5. or 600. Barbed horses, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now very few of them can furnish twenty fit to serve the King. But to say the truth my Lord, the Iustices of peace in <hi>England,</hi> have oppos'd the injusticers of war in <hi>England,</hi> the Kings writ runs over all, and the great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> with that of the next Constables will serve the turn to affront the greatest Lords in <hi>England,</hi> that shall move against the King. The force therefore by which our Kings in former times were troubled is vanisht away. But the necessities remain. The people therefore in these later ages, are no lesse to be pleased then the Peeres, for as the later are become lesse, so by reason of the trayning through <hi>England,</hi> the Commons have all the weapons in their hand.</p>

In the beginning of his fourth year, a tenth with a fifteen were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon condition, that for one whole year no subsedies should be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but this promise was as suddenly forgotten as made, for in the end of that year, the great subsedy of Poll mony was granted in the Parliament at <hi>Northampton.</hi>

                     <p>No my Lord, it was to have the oversight of those Officers, which (saith the story) had imbezeled, lewdly wasted, and prodigally spent the Kings Treasure, for to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to those Lords, or to any six

of them, joyn'd with the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, was one of the most royall and most profitable that ever he did, if he had bin constant to himself. But my good Lord, man is the cause of his own misery, for I will repeat the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the commission granted by the King, and confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, whether it had bin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the King to have prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, your Lordship may judge. The preamble hath these words: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Sovereigne Lord the King percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by the grievous complaints of the Lords and Commons of this Realme, that the rents, profits, and revenues of this Realme, by the singular and insufficient Councell and evill government, as well of some his late great Officers and others, &amp;c. are so much withdrawen, wasted, given, granted, alienated, destroyed, and evill dispended, that he is so much impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verished and void of treasure and goods, and the substance of the Crown so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished and destroyed, that his estate may not honorably be sustained as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth. The <hi>King</hi> of his free will at the request of the Lords and Commons, hath ordained <hi>William</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> and others with his Chancellour, Treasurer, keeper of his privy seal, to

survey and examine as well the estate and governance of his house, &amp;c. as of all the rents, and profits, and revenues that to him appertaineth, and to be due, or ought to appertain and be due, &amp;c. And all manner of gifts, grants, alienations and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by him of lands, tenements, rents, &amp;c. bargained and sold to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of him and his Crown, &amp;c. And of his jewels &amp; goods which were his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers at the time of his death, &amp;c. and where they be become.</p>
                     <p>This is in effect the substance of the commission, which your Lordship may read at large in the book of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, this commission being enacted in the tenth year of the Kings reigne. Now if such a commission were in these dayes granted to the faithfull men that have no interest in the sales, gifts nor purchases, nor in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the jewells at the Queens death, nor in the obtaining, grants of the Kings best lands, I cannot say what may be recovered, and justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and what say your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, was not this a noble act for the King, if it had been followed to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</p>

                     <p>Because these, against whom it was granted, perswaded the King to the contrary: as the Duke of <hi>Ireland, Suffolk,</hi> the chief Iustice <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silian,</hi> and others, yea, that which was lawfully done by the King, and the great Councell of the kingdome, was (by the mastery which <hi>Ireland, Suffolk,</hi> and <hi>Tresilian</hi> had over the Kings affections) broken and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed. Those that devised to relieve the King, not by any private inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by generall Councell, were by a private and partiall assembly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged traitors, and the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Iudges of the land, enforced to subscribe to that judgement. In so much that Iudge <hi>Belknap</hi> plainly told the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> when he was constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to set his hand, plainly told these Lords, that he wanted but a rope, that he might therewith receive a reward for his subscription.

In the Eleventh year of this King, wherein the fornamed Lords, the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> and the rest, were condemned and confiscate, the Chief Iustice hanged with many others, the rest of the Iudges condemned, and banisht, and a 10. and a 15. given to the King,</p>

And it is so judged upon good reason, for every unlawfull and ill action is supposed

In his eleventh year the commons did again presse the King to take all the temporalities of the Church men into his hands, which they proved sufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 150.

                     <p>As for the notorious Prince, <hi>Henry</hi> the fift, I find, that he had given him in his second year 300000. markes, and after that two other subsedies, one in his fifth year, another in his ninth, without any disputes.</p>
                     <p>In the time of his successor <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, there were not many subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. In this third year, he had a subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Tunnage and poundage. And here (saith <hi>Iohn Stow</hi>) began those payements, which we call customes, because the payement was continued, whereas before that time it was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but for a year two or three, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Kings occasions.

the conveying of the Queen out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England.</hi> In the twenty eight year of that King was the act of Resumption of all honours, towns, castles, Signeuries, villages, Manors, lands, tenements, rents, reversions, fees, &amp;c.

were made void by the Duke of <hi>York</hi> when he was in possession of the Kingdome by Parliament. So in the time of <hi>K.

The Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> do alwayes serve the King in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. It served <hi>Rich.</hi> the second to condemne the popular Lords.

And it did the like for <hi>H.</hi> when <hi>Edw.</hi> was driven out. The Parliaments are as the friendship of this world is, which alwayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth prosperity. For King <hi>Edw.</hi> the 4. after that he was possessed of the Crown, he had in his 13. year a subsedy freely given him: and in the year following he took a benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence through <hi>England,</hi> which arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary taking from the people, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that ambitious traytor the Duke of Bucks.

                     <p>To Impose upon all things brought into the Kingdome is very ancient: which imposing when it hath been continued a certain time, is then called Customes, because the subjects are accustomed to pay it, and yet the great taxe upon wine is still called Impost, because it was imposed after the ordinary rate of payement, had lasted many years. But we do now a dayes understand those things to be impositions, which are raised by the command of Princes, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Common-wealth, though (as I take it) much of that which is now called custome, was at the first imposed by Prerogative royall: Now whether it be time or consent that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes them just, I cannot define, were they just because new, and not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied yet by time, or unjust because they want a generall consent: yet is this rule of <hi>Aristotle</hi> verified in respect of his Majestie: <hi>Minus timent homines in justum pati Ã  principe quem cultorem Dei putant.</hi> Yea my Lord, they are also the more willingly borne, because all the world knows they are no new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Kings. And if those that advised his Majestie to impose
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61340:171"/>
them, had raised his lands (as it was offered them) to 20000l. more then it was, and his wards to asmuch as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, they had done him farre more acceptable service. But they had their own ends in refusing the one, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the other. If the land had been raised, they could not have se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the best of it for themselves: If the impositions had not been laid, some of them could not have their silks, other pieces in farme, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed grieved the subject ten times more then that which his Majestie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth. But certainly they made a great advantage that were the advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, for if any tumult had followed his Majesty, ready way had been to have delivered them over to the people.</p>

                     <p>But good Sir, you blanch my question, and answer me by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. I aske you whether or no in any such tumult, the people pretending against any one or two great Officers, the King should deliver them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them?</p>

                     <p>My good Lord, the people have not stayed for the Kings delivery,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61340:172"/>
neither in <hi>England,</hi> nor in <hi>France</hi>: Your Lordship knows how the Chancellour, Treasurer, and Chief Iustice, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others at severall times have been used by the Rebels: And the Marshals, Constables, and Treasurers in <hi>France,</hi> have been cut in pieces in <hi>Charles</hi> the sixt his time. Now to your Lordships question, I say that where any man shall give a King perilous advice, as may either cause a Rebellion, or draw the peoples love from the King, I say, that a King shall be advised to banish him: But if the King do absolutely command his servant to do any thing displeasing to the Common-wealth, and to his own perill, there is the King bond in honour to defend him. But my good Lord for conclusion, there is no man in <hi>England</hi> that will lay any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ether grievous or against law upon the Kings Majesty: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Lordships must share it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you.</p>

                     <p>For my part, I had no hand in it, (I think) <hi>Ingram</hi> was be that propounded it to the Treasurer.</p>

                     <p>Alas, my good Lord, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poor waiter in the Custome-house, or every promooter might have done it, there is no invention in these things,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61340:173"/>
To lay impositions, and sell the Kings lands, are poor and common devices. It is true that <hi>Ingram</hi> and his fellows are odious men, and therefore his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty pleas'd the people greatly to put him from the Coffership. It is better for a Prince to use such a kind of men, then to countenance them, hangmen are necessary in a common wealth: yet in the Netherlands, none but a hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans sonne will marry a hangmans daughter. Now my Lord, the last ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering which <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh made, was in his twentieth year, wherein he had another benevolence both of the Clergy and Laity, a part of which taken of the poorer sort, he ordained by his testament that it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored. And for King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, although he was left in a most plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full estate, yet he wonderfully prest his people with great payments, for in the beginning of his time it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite that he spent in Masking and Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Banquetting, and other vanities, before he was entred into the most consuming expence of the most fond and fruitlesse warre that ever King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook. In his fourth yeare he had one of the greatest subsedies that ever
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61340:173"/>
was granted; for besides two fifteens and two dismes, he used <hi>Davids</hi> Law of Capitation or head money, and had of every Duke ten marks, of every Earl five pounds, of every Lord four pounds, of every Knight four marks and every man rated at 8l. in goods, 4. marks, and so after the rate: yea eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that was valued but at 401 paid 12d, and every man and woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 15. yeares 4d. He had also in his sixt yeare divers subsedies granted him. In his fourteenth their was a tenth demanded of every mans goods, but it was moderated. In the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment following, the Clergie gave the King the half of their spirituall livings for one yeare, and of the Laity there was demanded 800000l, which could not be leavied in England, but it was a marvellous great gift that the king had given him at that time. In the Kings seventeenth yeare was the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion before spoken of, wherein the King disavowed the Cardinall: In his seventeenth yeare he had the tenth and fifteenth given by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which were before that time paid to the Pope. And before that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, the moneys that the King borrowed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61340:174"/>
in his fifteenth yeare were forgiven him by Parliament in his seventeenth yeare. In his 35. yeare a subsedy was granted of 4d. the pound of every man worth in goods from 20s. to 5l, from 5l. to 10l. and upwards of every pound 2s. And all strangers, denisens and others doubled this summe stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers not being inhabitants above 16. yeares 4d. a head. All that had Lands, Fees, and Annuities, from 20. to 5. and so double as they did for goods: And the Clergy gave 6d. the pound. In the thirty seventh yeare, a Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was taken not voluntary, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Commissioners, which because one of the Aldermen refused to pay, he was sent for a souldier into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> He had also another great subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of six shillings the pound of the Clergy, and two shillings eight pence of the goods of the Laity, and four shillings the pound upon Lands.</p>
                     <p>In the second yeare of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, the Parliament gave the King an aid of twelve pence the pound of goods of his Naturall subjects, and two shillings the pound of strangers, and this to continue for three yeares, and by the statute of the second and third of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, it may appear,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61340:174"/>
the same Parliament did also give a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond aid, as followeth, (to wit) of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ewe kept in severall pastures, 3d: of every weather kept as aforesaid 2d: of every sheep kept in the Common, 1d, ob. The House gave the King also 8d. the pound of every woollen cloath made for the sale throughout <hi>England</hi> for three years. In the third and fourt, of the King, by reason of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome gathering of the poly money upon sheep, and the tax upon cloath, this act of subsedy was repeal'd, and other relief given the King, and in the seventh yeare he had a subsedy and two fifteens.</p>
                     <p>In the first yeare of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> tunnage and poundage were granted. In the second yeare a subsedy was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to King <hi>Philip,</hi> and to the Queen, she had also a third subsedy in <hi>Annis</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eliz. Reg,</hi> Now my Lord, for the Parliaments of the late Queens time, in which there was nothing new, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head money, nor sheep money, nor escuage, nor any of these kinds of payments was required, but onely the ordinary subsedies, and those as easily graunted as demanded, I shall not need to trouble your Lordship with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                     <p>No, it were but time lost to speak of the latter, and by those that are already remembred, we may judge of the rest, for those of the greatest importance are publick. But I pray you deal freely with me, what you think would be done for his Majesty, If he should call a Parliament at this time, or what would be required at his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties hands?</p>

                     <p>The first thing that would be required, would be the same that was required by the Commons in the thirteenth yeare of <hi>Hen.</hi> the eight (to wit) that if any man of the commons house should speak more largely, then of duty he ought to do, all such offences to be pardoned, and that to be of record.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61340:175"/>
not; for in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, who gave freedome of speech in all Parliaments, when <hi>Wentworth</hi> made those motions, that were but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed dangerous to the Queens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, he was imprisoned in the Tower, notwithstanding the priviledge of the house, and there died.</p>

The Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty is the Naturall Lord of <hi>England,</hi> his Vassals of <hi>Scotland</hi> obey the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Laws, if they break them, they are punished without respect.

                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:61340:176"/>

It was practized in el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der times, to the great trouble of the kingdome, and to the losse and ruine of many. It was of latter time used by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, but every way to his disadvantage. When the King leaves himself to his people, they assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that they are trusted and beloved of their king, and there was never any assembly so barborus, as not to answer the love and trust of their King. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the sixt when his estate was in effect utterly overthrown, and utterly impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verished at the humble request of his Treasurer made the same known to the House: Or other wise, using the Treasurers own words.

                     <p>Perchance not my Lord; but rather with those impositions that have been by some of your Lordships laid upon the King, which did not some of your Lordships fear more then you do the impositions laid upon the Subjects, you would never disswade his Majesty from a Parliament: For no man doubted, but that his Majesty was advised to lay those impositions by his Councell, and for particular things on which they were laid, the advice came from petty fellows (though now great ones) belonging to the Custome-House. Now my Lord, what prejudice hath his Majesty (his Revenue being kept up) if the imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were laid by the generall Councell of the Kingdome, which takes off all grudging and complaint.</p>

                     <p>Yea Sir, but that which is done by the King, with the advice of his private or privy Councell, is done by the Kings absolute power.</p>

                     <p>And by whose power it is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61340:177"/>
done in parliament, but by the Kings absolute power? Mistake it not my Lord: The three Estates do but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, as the privy Councell doth, which advice if the King imbrace, it becomes the Kings own Act in the one, and the Kings Law in the other, for without the Kings acceptation, both the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private advices be but as empty Egg shels: and what doth his Majesty lose if some of those things, which concerns the poorer sort to be made free again, and the Revenue kept up upon that which is superfluous? Is it a losse to the King to be beloved of the Commons? If it be revenue which the King seeks, is it not better to take it of those that laugh, then of those that cry? Yea if all be conten to pay upon moderation &amp; change of the Species: Is it not more honourable and more safe for the King, that the Subject pay by perswasion, then to have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained? If they be contented to whip themselves for the King, were it not better to give them the Rod into their hands, then to commit them to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner? Certainly it is farre more happy for a Soveraigne Prince, that a Subject open his purse willingly, then that the same be opened by violence.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:61340:177"/>
Besides, that when impositions are laid by Parliament, they are gathered by the authority of the Law, which (as aforesaid) rejecteth all complaints, and stoppeth every mutinous mouth: It shall ever be my prayer that the King embrace the Councel of Honour and safety, and let other Princes imbrace that of force.</p>

                     <p>If your Lordship would pardon me, I would say then, that your Lordships objection against Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is ridiculous. In former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments three things have been supposed dishonour of the King. The first, that the Subjects have conditioned with the King, when the King hath needed them, to have the great Charter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: The second, that the Estates have made Treasurers for the necessary and profitable disbursing of those sums by them given, to the end, that the Kings, to whom they were given, should expend them for their own defence, &amp; for the defence of the Common-wealth: The third, that these have prest the King to discharge some great Officers of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61340:178"/>
Crown, and to elect others. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first my Lord, I would fain learn what disadvantage the Kings of this Land have had by confirming the great Charter, the breach of which have served onely men of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships rank, to assist their own passions, and to punish and imprison at their own discretion the Kings poor Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Concerning their private ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, with the colour of the Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for the Kings Majestie take no mans inheritance, (as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) nor any mans life, but the Law of the Land, according to the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Neither doth his Majesty imprison any man (matter of practice, which concerns, the preservation of his estate excepted) but by the law of the land. And yet he useth his prerogative as all the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have ever used to: for the supream reason cause to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise many things without the advice of the law. As insurrections and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, it useth the marshall, and not the common law, without any breach of the Charter, the intent of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter considered truely. Neither hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Subject made complaint, or been grieved, in that the Kings of this land, for their own safeties, and preservation
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61340:178"/>
of their estates, have used their Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, the great Ensigne, on which there is written <hi>soli Deo.</hi> And my good Lord, was not <hi>Buckingham</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Byron</hi> in <hi>France</hi> condemned, their Peers uncalled? And withall, was not <hi>Byron</hi> utterly (contrary to the custome &amp; priviledges of the <hi>French</hi>) denyed an advocate to assist his defence? For where lawes forecast cannot provide remedies for future dangers, Princes are forced to assist themselves by their <hi>Prerogatives.</hi> But that which hath been ever grievous, and the cause of many troubles, very dangerous is, that your Lordships abusing the reasons of state, do punish and imprison the K. Subjects at your pleasure. It is you my Lords, that when Subjects have sometimes need of the Kings preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, do then use the strength of the Law, and when they require the law, you afflict them with the prerogative, and tread the great Charter (which hath been confirmed by 16 Acts of Parliament) under your feet, as a torn parchment or waste paper?.</p>

your Lordship knows, that then there were nothing so dangerous for a K as to be without money: A Parliament cannot assemble in haste, but present dangers require hasty remedies. It will be no time then to discontent the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by using any unordinary wayes.</p>

And if the King be driven into any extremity, we can say to the King that because we found it extremely unpleasing to his Majesty to hear of a Parliament, we thought it no good manners to make such a Motion.</p>

But for the second, where you say you can excuse your selves upon the Kings own protesting against a Parliament, the King upon better consideration may encounter that fineness of yours.</p>

In which respect, and because you come short in all your projects, &amp; because it is a thing most dangerous for a King to be without treasure, he requires such of you, as either mislike, or rather fear a Parliment, to set down your reasous in writing, which you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mislike, or feared it.
