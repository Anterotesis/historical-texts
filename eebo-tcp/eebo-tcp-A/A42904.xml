            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Peninsula</hi> of <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> (now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Morea</hi>) was at first ruled by certain <hi>Kings,</hi> until the Sons of <hi>Ogygus</hi> came to the Government; they happening to practise such a <hi>tyranny</hi> as rendered them insupportable to their Subjects, several of the Cities determined to free themselves, and associate into <hi>one Republick:</hi> thus <hi>twelve</hi> of them united into one <hi>Democracy.</hi> This <hi>Vnion</hi> continued until the times of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and his Son <hi>Alexander:</hi> then the puissance of <hi>Macedonia</hi> growing <hi>great</hi> and <hi>terrible,</hi> this <hi>Vnion</hi> began to <hi>dissolve,</hi> the <hi>Macedonians</hi> by sundry artifices sowing <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions</hi> betwixt the <hi>Cities;</hi> whereupon some of them sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the prevailing <hi>Macedonians,</hi> others fell under the dominion of sundry <hi>Tyrants.</hi> But they were soon sensible of the miseries which <hi>their dissensions</hi> had brought upon <hi>them,</hi> and the departure of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> having given <hi>them</hi> an opportunity to <hi>revolt,</hi> they ejected the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55325:4"/>
               <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and re-established their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Ten</hi> of them formed such a <hi>Republick,</hi> with so great <hi>Vnanimity</hi> and <hi>Friendship,</hi> that nothing could seem more <hi>firm,</hi> or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>regulated.</hi> Though their <hi>Cities</hi> were separate, yet they had but <hi>one Government,</hi> and each did heartily contribute to the support of the <hi>rest.</hi> They were renowned for their <hi>Great Justice</hi> and <hi>Moderation;</hi> several Commonwealths borrowed from them the <hi>Model</hi> of their Government; and upon emergent Controversies, their Neighbours would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the decision thereof unto the <hi>Achaeans:</hi> not by reason of their <hi>Great Power,</hi> (for they were hardly considerable thereupon amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi>) but for their singular <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> and <hi>Probity,</hi> the which procured them an universal <hi>Reverence,</hi> and made others desirous to contract Amity with a People famed for all those Vertues which beget <hi>Esteem,</hi> but not <hi>Terrour,</hi> in their Neighbours. There was a perfect <hi>Equality</hi> betwixt all the <hi>Vnited Cities;</hi> all were equally capable of <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Employments</hi> in the <hi>State:</hi> They sought not to enlarge <hi>their Territories,</hi> by the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>their Neighbours:</hi> The Aids they gave at any time, were <hi>un-interessed;</hi> and all the Advantages they derived <hi>thence,</hi> was, to have relieved the <hi>Distressed,</hi> and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored the <hi>General Peace.</hi> These <hi>Maxims</hi> made several up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sundry occasions to seek <hi>Their Friendship,</hi> as the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Macedon, Pergamus, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Syria;</hi> and at length the <hi>Romans</hi> courted them into a <hi>Confederacy,</hi> which proved in the issue destructive to their <hi>Republick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Principal Authority</hi> at first was fixed in <hi>Two Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> and a <hi>Secretary of State;</hi> But after some time, they thought it more expedient for the Administration of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that the Executive Power should be lodged in one <hi>State-holder</hi> or <hi>General,</hi> whom they termed <hi>Strategus,</hi> who was chosen indifferently from out of any of the <hi>Cities,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Extraordinary Worth;</hi> and his Government continued but <hi>one year,</hi> unless it were anew confirmed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. They held a <hi>General Assembly</hi> of the <hi>States</hi> twice each year, in the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumn,</hi> at a certain place in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55325:4"/>
the middle of their Territories called <hi>Aeglum,</hi> the most populous and rich of all the <hi>Confederate</hi> Cities: The <hi>States</hi> assembled in a certain <hi>Grove</hi> dedicated to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appertaining to War and Peace, all Laws and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances were dispatched there; the <hi>State-holder,</hi> with <hi>Ten Adsessors</hi> (called <hi>Demiurgi</hi>) presiding therein.</p>
            <p>Amongst <hi>their Laws,</hi> these, not to name others, were esteemed to be very prudential. <hi>That no Assembly should continue above three days, but the</hi> States <hi>should come to their final Resolution within that time:</hi> Whereby all long Debates and Quarrels were prevented, and all opportunities cut off whereby their Counsels might be retarded, or Factions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced. Another was, <hi>That no Foreign Embassador could have Audience in the</hi> States, <hi>without communicating his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage first, to the end that the</hi> States <hi>might know wherefore they were assembled.</hi> Whereby they secured themselves against all such Projects as might tend to the overthrow of the State, and had time to weigh things maturely and <hi>dis-pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonately</hi> before the Session. Also, <hi>That none of the Vnited Cities should send abroad any Publick Embassies, but with the participation of the rest.</hi> They did think it fundamental to their preservation, that all things should be managed by <hi>Joynt Consent,</hi> and no room be left for <hi>separate Counsels:</hi> That all the <hi>Cities</hi> should have the <hi>same Alliances,</hi> and move by the <hi>same Maxims.</hi> So tender were they of <hi>this Law,</hi> that they expresly provided for it in their Treaties with the <hi>Romans;</hi> cautioning that the <hi>Romans</hi> should not make any Addresses to any of <hi>their Cities</hi> privately, but to the <hi>Publick:</hi> And the Authority of the Republick seemed rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> did by his Artifices prevail with the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to give him a private and <hi>separate Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:</hi> whence arose <hi>Dissentions</hi> betwixt the <hi>Confederates,</hi> and many began to pursue their <hi>proper Interests</hi> and <hi>Respects,</hi> to the overthrow of the <hi>Republick.</hi> Against <hi>Bribes</hi> they had this most Renowned Constitution, <hi>That none should receive any Gifts or Pensions from any Foreign Prince.</hi> And this was so rigorously observed, and such a sense imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55325:5"/>
               <hi>in the</hi> Achaeans <hi>thereof, that when King</hi> Eumenes <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them</hi> one hundred and twenty Talents, <hi>with the</hi> Interest <hi>whereof, the charges of such as came to the</hi> General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>should be defrayed; they</hi> generously <hi>refused it, and were inclined to renounce all</hi> Amity <hi>with him, for making such an Overture.</hi> Apollonius <hi>the</hi> Sicyonian <hi>thus argued against the Proposition:</hi> The money which is frankly offered by the King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> is so considerable in it self, that it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Regards of the <hi>Achaean</hi> Republick; but if we look upon the Intention of the Donor, to accept thereof is Bribery and Corruption repugnant to the Law: Single Persons were prohibited to take any Bribe or Present, and should the Whole Republick at once make it self obnoxious? It would be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual shame, and most ignominious to be said, That the States General of <hi>Achaia</hi> were maintained by the King of <hi>Pergamus;</hi> and that the Councils of the Vnited Cities were managed by such as eat the Bread of a Foreign Potentate. If this President were admitted of, others would imitate his Example, and the Liberty of the Republick would be exposed to sale. That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies were apt to arise betwixt States, and their Ends and Interests might in time prove opposite to those of the Republick: If such Donatives and Presents as these were tolerated, the <hi>Achaeans</hi> would infallibly run into this perplexity sooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, either to be ungrateful to their Benefactors, or of betraying their proper Liberties and Interests, to avoid that Imputation. In fine, there was nothing of advantage in present, that could countervail the fatal Inconveniencies which would ensue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>By these and such-like Constitutions the <hi>Achaeans</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served their Republick in a flourishing condition: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their <hi>Vnion</hi> drew upon them the <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> of their Neighbours, yet did they support themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Attempts of the <hi>Aetolians, Lacedemonians, Eleans,</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> which Nations, either <hi>separately,</hi> or in <hi>conjunction,</hi> did make War upon them: But at length the <hi>Romans,</hi> partly by <hi>Artifice,</hi> and partly by <hi>Force,</hi> subdued this <hi>Little Republick,</hi> which proved too <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55325:5"/>
to subsist against the <hi>subtilties</hi> and <hi>clandestine frauds</hi> of the <hi>politick and ambitious Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> having rendred themselves Masters of <hi>Italy, Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Corsica,</hi> having carried their Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ensigns into <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and triumphed over <hi>Carthage</hi> in the second <hi>Punick War;</hi> they seemed now qualified for any great Attempt, and to be able to carry every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; their <hi>strength at Sea</hi> being as redoubtable as their Puissance by Land. When <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in one, they either find or create Occasions whereon to work.

            <p>Whilst the Affairs of <hi>Achaia</hi> were in this troublesome and dangerous posture, there happened an occasion for <hi>them</hi> to regain their <hi>former Liberty;</hi> but the State-holder, and too many others were so <hi>devoted</hi> to their <hi>Great Allies</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did so magnifie the advantages of their <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> and the dangers imminent from their <hi>enmity,</hi> that they lost this <hi>last</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> opportunity. <hi>Perseus</hi> King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi> had recollected the Spirits of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> had broken by vanquishing his Father <hi>Philip;</hi> and having formed such a strength as might alone dispute the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> with the <hi>Romans,</hi> he animated the several <hi>Republicks</hi> to assert their common Liberties, and joyntly to recover that Glory which their Countrey had lost by pursuing of <hi>private</hi> and <hi>separate Ends:</hi> He made particular overtures to the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and desired they would lay aside all enmity against him, and forbear those <hi>Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies</hi> which had been so destructive to <hi>Greece;</hi> that they would no longer remember the Injuries his <hi>Father</hi> did them, nor think Him to have succeeded <hi>Philip</hi> in his <hi>Passions</hi> as well as <hi>Kingdoms:</hi> the flourishing Estate of the Realm <hi>was</hi> indeed such that it transported the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to a design of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their Bounds by the Universal Conquest of <hi>Greece;</hi> but they were now reduced to other terms, and enforced to contrive now <hi>their own safety</hi> instead of the <hi>Ruine</hi> of their <hi>Neighbours:</hi> that the same <hi>motives</hi> which induced <hi>them</hi> to renounce the <hi>ancient amity</hi> contracted with the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> ought to prevail much more with them to abandon this <hi>new</hi> and <hi>perilous Confederacy</hi> with the <hi>imperious Romans.</hi> Some there were who thought the Proposition reasonable; others suggested a <hi>Neutrality,</hi> and that the <hi>Achaeans</hi> should assist neither <hi>Rome</hi> nor <hi>Macedon</hi> in the War, but form their

councils according to the event of things; since by taking either side they should draw upon them the indignation of the other, and render <hi>their Ally</hi> if victorious, <hi>too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> But those which favoured the <hi>Romans</hi> did overrule the rest, so that all <hi>audiance</hi> was refused unto <hi>Persius,</hi> and 'twas resolved effectively to assist the <hi>Romans,</hi> of whom they now stood in so great aw, that they were extremely perplexed lest the <hi>Senate</hi> should know that such points had ever been debated in the <hi>General Assembly.</hi> Within four years the <hi>Romans</hi> did totally subdue the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and reduced the <hi>Kingdom</hi> into a <hi>Province,</hi> the <hi>Achaeans</hi> heartily <hi>congratulating</hi> them for these victories which they had helped to atchieve; and receiving from the <hi>Senate</hi> the publick thanks and praises due to so <hi>faithful Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</hi> The whole world stood amazed at this prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous success of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and yielded generally to that <hi>power</hi> which they saw to be <hi>irresistable:</hi> nor did men less admire the counsels and maxims by which the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Achaia</hi> had steered in that juncture, since that they could not expect to subsist long in their present condition; for insatiate <hi>ambition</hi> distinguisheth not betwixt <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>foes,</hi> and despiseth the vulgar <hi>niceties</hi> as obstacles to <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> There being nothing of force in <hi>Greece</hi> to check the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms, nor any powerful <hi>Confederate</hi> to be sought unto after the conquest of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> left off their former <hi>artifices,</hi> and clandestine practices upon the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Achaia,</hi> and began openly to manifest their intentions. The <hi>Senate</hi> drew to its cognisance those cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which usually were decided in the generall Assembly of the <hi>Amphictyones:</hi> that <hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Diet</hi> received the complaints of the several States and Principalities of <hi>Greece;</hi> the proud <hi>Roman</hi> thought that <hi>shadow</hi> of <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> and <hi>Vnion</hi> might in time prejudice his Affairs, and facilitate some <hi>League</hi> against the <hi>new</hi> Conquerour: seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the best and wisest in <hi>Achaia</hi> were sent for to <hi>Rome,</hi> and falsly traduced to have privately favoured the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Macedonian,</hi> and <hi>without hearing</hi> they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetual imprisonment in <hi>Tuscany.</hi> The

               <hi>Achaeans</hi> thereupon found the falsehood of the measures which they had taken, and that <hi>their Liberty</hi> was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely overthrown, nor could they tell which way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themselves, or prevent the evils that threatned them: They sent sundry <hi>Embassies</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> desiring that those which were committed might be brought to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick trial, either at <hi>Rome,</hi> or before their <hi>Superiors</hi> in <hi>Achaia:</hi> but all these sollicitations proved vain and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, the <hi>Romans</hi> proceeding to tell them, that <hi>they were dangerous persons,</hi> and <hi>not to be trusted at home,</hi> and that the <hi>Achaeans</hi> themselves seemed to have <hi>this opinion</hi> of them, when <hi>they</hi> sent them prisoners unto <hi>Rome:</hi> that the <hi>Senate</hi> would never detein them, but for the <hi>welfare</hi> of <hi>Achaia,</hi> which would be embroiled should these <hi>angry</hi> and <hi>enterprising</hi> persons return thereto.

            <p>The ruine of this <hi>Common-wealth</hi> hath given occasion to sundry Writers of <hi>Politics,</hi> as <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Jacobus Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thofredus,</hi> to condemn <hi>their proceedings.</hi> The <hi>success</hi> of humane affairs is so <hi>various,</hi> and <hi>wars</hi> are managed with <hi>such uncertainty,</hi> and such circumstances do oftentimes befal <hi>Republicks</hi> that 'tis not in their power to pursue the <hi>most safe counsels,</hi> and sometimes an <hi>high,</hi> though no <hi>assured hope</hi> ought to be preferred before the <hi>more caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> if more <hi>humble thoughts.</hi> It is easie to determine the <hi>immediate causes</hi> of the subversion of <hi>that Republick;</hi> but if the <hi>wisest</hi> of those which condemn <hi>their League</hi> with <hi>Rome,</hi> had lived in <hi>those daies,</hi> and were to form their counsels upon the posture affairs were <hi>then</hi> in, and not upon <hi>that prospect</hi> which <hi>un-concerned posterity</hi> hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, perhaps they would have embraced <hi>those resolutions</hi> which they now reprove.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Achaeans</hi> had indeed a very <hi>ancient League</hi> with the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> they were of the <hi>same Continent,</hi> and as it were of the <hi>same Language</hi> and <hi>Consanguinity:</hi> they had received many benefits by the <hi>Macedonian</hi> amity, and <hi>Philip</hi> himself had aided them against their Enemies of <hi>Lacedaemon.</hi> But this <hi>amity</hi> with <hi>Philip</hi> had very many circumstances whereupon it might be questioned <hi>for the future.</hi> For the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were a warlike people, of <hi>great strength,</hi> famed for their <hi>invincible Militia,</hi> they had long aimed at the <hi>Vniversal Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> they had <hi>now</hi> extended their conquests far into <hi>Thracia,</hi> and had subdued in a manner all <hi>Greece,</hi> but <hi>Peloponnesus:</hi> the sense
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55325:16"/>
of those Benefits which the <hi>Achaeans</hi> had received from the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> was much <hi>effaced</hi> by the late deportment of <hi>Philip,</hi> who had not only dilated his Acquests unto their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines,</hi> (besieging <hi>Athens,</hi> and oppressing the sturdy <hi>Aetoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) but aided <hi>them</hi> against <hi>Lacedemon</hi> with so slender For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as if he intended not the <hi>preservation</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> of his <hi>Allies,</hi> but by <hi>such artifices</hi> to reduce all <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> under his <hi>subjection</hi> at last. These things duly considered, it may seem to have been well done of the <hi>Achaeans</hi> to call in the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to prevent their <hi>apparent Ruine</hi> by joyning with a <hi>Foreigner,</hi> whose strength might <hi>counterpoise</hi> that of <hi>Philip,</hi> and bring them less of <hi>terrour,</hi> since the remoteness of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Contingencies of War by <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> the puissance of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> might bring <hi>both Parties</hi> into such a condition as not to be able to molest or invade the <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Neighbourhood.</hi> The effects of these Counsels proved happy <hi>at first,</hi> for immediately <hi>Philip</hi> courted their <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> restoring them <hi>some Towns</hi> which he detained from them; their <hi>coldness</hi> towards the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened the <hi>Romans</hi> to begin a War, which by reason of the other with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they could not <hi>well prosecute:</hi> So that the <hi>Achaeans</hi> had, without <hi>Expence</hi> or <hi>Trouble,</hi> abated much of the <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ambition</hi> of <hi>Philip.</hi>

            <p>After that the <hi>Romans</hi> had put an happy end to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond War</hi> with <hi>Carthage,</hi> they began to cast a jealous Eye upon the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empire: they saw their <hi>Allies</hi> of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia</hi> subdued by <hi>Philip,</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Asia</hi> ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a <hi>Defensive League</hi> against <hi>them.</hi> The <hi>Consuls</hi> anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>People</hi> to invade <hi>Macedonia,</hi> shewing the <hi>intrinsick power</hi> of that Kingdom, the <hi>Alliances</hi> with which it was fortified; how easie it would be for <hi>Philip</hi> to attempt <hi>Italy,</hi> as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had done; how prone men were, after they had provided against <hi>known Dangers,</hi> to pursue <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Hopes,</hi> and <hi>not to stop where they begun.</hi> The <hi>War</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing resolved upon, they sent to solicite the several <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Republicks</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> to joyn with them against <hi>Philip;</hi> and after they had given a <hi>Reputation</hi> to their Arms by some

Exploits against the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> they send their <hi>Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,</hi> and withal their <hi>Fleet,</hi> unto <hi>Achaia,</hi> offering them a <hi>perfect amity</hi> if they would <hi>actually</hi> joyn with them, but would not acquiesce in any <hi>Neutrality.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>States General</hi> were perplexed, they saw those <hi>Naval Forces</hi> on their Coast which were able to vanquish them before they could receive any assistance from <hi>Macedonia;</hi> the <hi>goodness of their Ports</hi> did but facilitate their <hi>Conquest,</hi> since the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were <hi>Masters at Sea.</hi> They must either draw the War upon themselves, who were not able to undergo it, or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it into <hi>Macedonia.</hi> Their Condition admitted of no <hi>middle</hi> Counsels, and of the <hi>Extreams</hi> the latter was the best. The <hi>miscarriages</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> in the beginning of the War, as to <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Valour,</hi> made them see which side had the advantage of the other: and they had reason to confederate with those who were then able to <hi>distress them,</hi> and would in the end bear away the <hi>Victory.</hi> By preserving their Country <hi>entire</hi> at present, and contributing onely a <hi>part</hi> of their strength to the aid of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they should still be in a posture considerable to mediate <hi>in time</hi> for a <hi>peace,</hi> and render other courtesies to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> the depressing of whose <hi>puissance</hi> was becom their <hi>present Interest,</hi> as it would be their <hi>future</hi> to rescue it from <hi>utter ruine.</hi>

            <p>Hitherto the Counsels of <hi>Achaia</hi> seemed prudential; the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were reduced to their ancient Confines, all <hi>Greece</hi> was restored to its <hi>Pristine Liberty;</hi> nothing accrued to the <hi>Romans</hi> by this War, but the <hi>Glory</hi> of having deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Greece,</hi> and weakened the Realm of <hi>Macedonia</hi> that it was no longer formidable to its <hi>Neighbours.</hi> But the <hi>Romans</hi> had further ends, and made use of that <hi>specious Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity</hi> onely to insinuate themselves into the affection of the credulous <hi>Greeks,</hi> who neither understood how hard a thing it was for a <hi>City</hi> to preserve its <hi>Liberty</hi> after it hath <hi>recovered it;</hi> nor how it was impossible for <hi>Greece</hi> to unite for the <hi>general Defence,</hi> when they were <hi>cantonized</hi> into so many petty <hi>Republicks.</hi> The <hi>Achaeans</hi> were become the most <hi>united</hi> and <hi>potent</hi> Republick in <hi>Greece;</hi> they had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
