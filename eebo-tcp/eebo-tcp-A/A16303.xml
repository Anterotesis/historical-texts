            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Sr.</hi> If I should send you ouer the Relations both in <hi>Latin, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> which come to this Towne concerning the variety of Newes about the troubles of <hi>Europe,</hi> I should weary you with the multiplicity of Bookes, and my selfe with the cunning of transportation: Besides, I am sure to bee preuented in sending you Newes, because it will bee stale ere it come to your handes by my meanes: Therefore I desist from either troubling you or my selfe in that kinde, and yet haue I chanced on something, which I am sure none can helpe you to, but by my meanes: So it is then, that there, came to my hands two seuerall Coppies of seuerall Letters, one from <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> as the summe of an Embacy from the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his Desertion of the King in these tumultuous times: another from Mr. <hi>Fodringham</hi> in <hi>Vienna,</hi> written by the <hi>Pope</hi> to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> concerning the pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Troubles, and admission of a Peace (if the motiue might bee correspondent to his Honour) rather then aduenture to bee terrified with so much effusion of Blood, or hazard the Dignity of the <hi>Empire,</hi> by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Warres goe forward. And these as you see I haue Printed heere in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and they are so pleasing to the Inhabitants heere, that I presume, they will bee as

            <p>RVmor hauing played a true womans part through the Citty of <hi>Prague,</hi> concerning the Duke of <hi>Bauaria's</hi> comming to <hi>Lintz,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Saxonyes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratiue Letters to the Emperour, that the Marquesse <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> was approaching with a formidable preparation to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist him, and hee himselfe would not be behinde in any duty, which belonged to his obseruation, or the Dignity of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: thrust herselfe at last into the presence of the King, and the greatest Councellors of Estate, but in such a manner, as if she durst iustifie her lauish tongue, and tooke a pleasure in the ampliation, which yet briefly had these maine passages:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> First, that <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Bauaria</hi> combined themselues to illustrate the glory of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and by no meanes to leaue either Emperour, or Empire in the cruell hands of reuolters, if either they could procure their deliuery, or by any prouidence conserue their renowne:</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> That the Marquesse <hi>Spinola</hi> had more forcible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in his approaches, as resoluing to reduce the Subiects of <hi>Bohemia</hi> (whom hee termed Rebels to the Emperour) to their pristinate obedience, wherein if hee found any retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, hee would shew them the angry faces of <hi>20000.</hi> men, so prouided out of the storehouse of Power and Pollicy, that the world should record it as a remarkable president, and they be confounded to vnderstand, what their wilfulnes had incurred.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> That presently <hi>Don Lewis de Velasco,</hi> hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified <hi>Wesell,</hi> and left a sufficient Garrison both in it and other Townes subiect to surprises vpon the aduantage of his
<pb facs="tcp:2915:4"/>
absence, should follow him, as a second in the prosecution of greater Designes.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4</hi> That the Catholicke Bishops, and other secular Princes, would fill vp this well bound sheafe with their Arrowes, and make the <hi>Hierogliphick</hi> an absolute resemblance of indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solluble and vnresistable strength.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5</hi> That these free Cittyes of the Empire would open their Gates, yea breake downe their walles, rather then this <hi>Sinons</hi> Horse should stand without, and not offer sacrifice in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Pallas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was this <hi>Mattachene</hi> of report danced euen in the Kings Castle and Pallace, and if mischiefe had had a tricke to affright them indeed, or startle their resolutions from standing in their firmnesse, it so fell out, that it ranne like a voyce of Thunder, and meant to follow one another in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But it should seeme, no arme of Flesh could turne the frame of Heauen about: and there was a stronger hand ready to throw a stone to strike <hi>Nabuchadnezars</hi> Image in peeces: For they were all so farre from being daunted, or terrified with imposturing apparitions, that they were rather exasperated, and encouraged to Opposition: Yea it is saide, that the inuincible and Heroyick Queene kneeled downe with lifted handes to Heauen, desiring God to accept of her, as a propitiary Sacrifice, rather then his Iustice might not haue her prosperous course in the punishment of sinnes, or the now glory of her Husband suffer diminution, or so much as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll from the Enemies of the Gospell, and aduersaries of the Kingdomes prosperity: To this (besides the admiration at her magnanimity) both King and Nobles, Cittizens and Commons, Gent. and Souldiers, Protestants and Papists, Priests and Cleargie men, yea all that had participated with
<pb facs="tcp:2915:4"/>
the particulars, combined themselues to shake off these drops of threatning rumor, and be sheltred from the greater storme of a publike Enemy.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding it was thought conuenient to send an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy to <hi>Iohn George</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and Prince Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, to put him in minde of the auncient League and amitie, which euer continued betweene the <hi>Bohemian</hi> State and the House of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and to knowe from a personall infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, how he stood affected in this Warre, or disposed to the assignation of his Forces, or what might bee the cause of his desertion in this so great a busines, which concurred with the propagation of the Gospell, and the Liberty of oppressed people. Whereupon there were two out of each of the three States of <hi>Bohemia</hi> deligated to this imployment with an orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of attendants, besides a Secretary of eminency, who came in good time to <hi>Presula,</hi> and there found the Duke.</p>
            <p>It is said, that at the first, there was some difficulty in their entertainment and admission, as from a King indeed: For <hi>1.</hi> whether priuate emulation against the <hi>Palsgraues</hi> aduancement, whom before hee held in equall rancke with himselfe. <hi>2.</hi> Or sinister occasions like vntoward weedes cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp the growth of better Corne, <hi>3.</hi> Or neernesse of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity drawing his loue to the Emperour. <hi>4.</hi> Or a iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie concerning the diminution of the greatnesse of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, beeing thus dilacerated and diuided. <hi>5.</hi> Or a superstitious blindnes in the case of the Roman Religion wrought him out of the possession of better thoughts, or diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him from that respect so meritorious a Prince excited, I will not now dispute: onely I am sure hee would neither wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly allow them the titles of such a Kings Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; nor affoord them that audience, which their message
<pb facs="tcp:2915:5"/>
both imported and deserued, till at last his Councell beeing most of them well affected to the King, and his Religion, ouer wrought him to condiscend to the Law of Nations and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of all royall Prouinces: So they had a Day of audience, and the Duke for all his minde was intangled with an intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate businesse, and farre reaching Proiects, yet heard them the sooner, the sooner to bee ridde of them, and so the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary thus began:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FREDERICKE</hi> by the grace of God King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> Palatine of the <hi>Rhine</hi>: and so as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Maiesties iust Titles, with the three States of the Common-wealth of <hi>Prague,</hi> and Protectors of the Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <hi>Prouinces,</hi> sendeth greeting to the High and Mighty Prince <hi>IOHN GEORGIVS,</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony, Iuliers,</hi> and <hi>Cleues,</hi> Elector of the Sacred <hi>Empire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>As for the particulars of the Kingdome, &amp; all our suffrages in this so well contriued <hi>Election,</hi> I hope you expect not more at our hands now, then you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued diuers times by priuate Letters, or daily read out of iustifiable Treatises: As for the secret of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which comes from instinct of nature, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manumition of distracted subiects; I hope you make no question of the lawfulnes, &amp; necessitie of our well begun Courses. As for the grieuances of the Commons, and convulsions of the Prouinces, wherin no man liued secure, while the tyrannie of our Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours lasted: The opening of our graues, the disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting of buried soules, the displacing of setled offices, the teares of Widowes, the cryes of Orphanes, the wringing hands of Matrons, the rauishing of Virgins, the outrages in euery Citie; and in a worde, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of rich and poore haue long before this, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed in your Eares, &amp; drawne commiseration from your Hart.</p>
            <p>As for the secrets of Gouernment, what can be more implyed out of all prescription, then the glory of God, 2. The honor of a Kingdome, 3. The good of the People, 4. And the renowne of the Prince. In
<pb facs="tcp:2915:6"/>
all which, it is well knowne our Princes haue fayled; As 1. dishonouring God by a manifest approbation of thinges contrary to his worde, 2. Disgracing the Kingdome, by violating her Lawes, abrogating her Priuiledges, threatning her Peace, subiecting her to strangers, and tying her as it were to the whipping-Poasts of crueltie and injustice, 3. Abusing the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by affrighting them with the rages of exorbitant actions, and suffring no man in the securitie &amp; benefit of his owne possessions, 4. As defaming themselues, by the scandalous Imperiousnesse of wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, and weaknes of Iudgement to be ouer-awed in all their actions, by the passionate wilfulnes of such as were enemies to God and men.</p>
            <p>As for the cause of Religion, Remember I pray you what the Statist <hi>Steephen</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> was wont to say, That he was a King of men, but not of Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; A Commaunder of bodies, but not of soules: And what vnheard-of mischiefs haue the <hi>Iesuites</hi> bred, the <hi>Inquisition</hi> procured, the Pope contriued, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors continued; and all long of that terrible Vow the <hi>Iesuites</hi> caused him to make; rather to loose the Dignitie of his Tytle, the benefit of his Diademe, and the comfort of his Life, then a <hi>Protestant</hi> should enioy the liberty of his Conscience, or a Church publiquly opened for the exercise of true Religion.</p>
            <p>As for the Emperor himselfe, if your Loue were neuer so great, or your passion transported beyond limitation; what gouernment did euer admit of the Vsurpation of strangers? and how dangerously haue the hartes of all Kingdomes beene eaten vpon by

the hungry teeth of mercinary Souldiers?</p>
            <p>Were not the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandales</hi> brought in as auxiliary to the Emperors of the East, and when they learn'd their Discipline, and had possession of their Armes, they learn'd also to turne their Pikes into the brests of the weaker side, and so was <hi>Europe</hi> subiected? Thus againe was <hi>Brittany</hi> diuers times Conquered, <hi>Spayne</hi> ouer-runne by the <hi>Mores,</hi> and the rest brought vnto all vnrest by this course.</p>
            <p>For what can we expect lesse then desolation and dissolution of Gouernment &amp; Religion?

            <p>As for reputing vs Rebels, or the diminution of the Emperors Tytles and glory of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Famely, we haue only from being slaues, made our selues sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a Lawfull Prince, wherein the proofes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant from all times and authoritie; and neither that, nor any thing heere spoken, need illustration from the Lawes of our Country, or the credit of Authors, who haue diuers times seene a King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> a King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and an Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> in seuerall dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inct Persons: Nor doe we see why <hi>Austrias</hi> few yeares of possession, should debarre all other Famelies from the Empire it selfe, especially damme vp our encloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, that we shall not giue libertie to our owne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and Priuiledges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2915:7"/>And therfore is there neither such cause of repining in you, nor cruelty in him. For alas, what must be the end of these dissentions, but the pulling of <hi>Germaines</hi> peace &amp; prosperity in peeces, and the filling our fields with the slaughtered Carkasses of Innocents, whose Fatherlesse Children will crye for vengeance, till the heauens powre it downe vpon the heads of the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents.</p>
            <p>As for any thing else, which either you haue, or can obiect; it hath bene long since answered: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Princes neede not giue an account of their actions, yet haue wee published our iustifications, and written both to your selfe, the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaria:</hi> So that if the warre continue, God knowes, we are meere defendants, and our King is his substitute for Religion and the Common-wealth, and would bee loath to see you bring fuell to the flames of this disturbance, or make the tyranny and ambition of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other a pitt to praecipitate your selfe in without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>(Most Illustrious Prince)</hi> seeing these thinges are so, and autentically approued by all suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency; why should your disallowance either mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest a willingnes to infringe the amity, and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with the <hi>Bohemian</hi> State: or show a tumor of some priuate passion against an immaculate Prince, and louing Neighbour, or the Vnion of other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who haue combined themselues to withstand a publicke Enemy.</p>
            <p>So that if neither the generall cause of the Empires peace; the blessed worke of the Propagation of the
<pb facs="tcp:2915:7"/>
Gospell; the priuate respect of our grieuances; the auncient combination of the Prouinces; the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary worth of our King; nor any other motiue bee the threed, to leade you out of the <hi>Laberinth</hi> of this disquiet, yea manifest seduction to eternal confusion: Remember your owne Ancestors, and the glorious actions, whereby they haue shined like faire mouing <hi>Planets</hi> in perspicuous <hi>Orbes,</hi> from whose influence could proceed nothing but sweet presages.</p>
            <p>O what a Story is registred of your FREDERICKE Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> about the yeare 1520. for <hi>Luthers</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and defence against the then malicious aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of the Ghospell! euen when the <hi>Popes</hi> indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Pardons brought remission of sinnes, and ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary freedome out of <hi>Purgatory</hi>! when the Dragon watched the woman, that her birth might bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured! when fire and vengeance was threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Heretickes,</hi> and the Emperour himselfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Churches Champion, and tooke vpon him for <hi>Romes</hi> sake, to Curse and fulminate against <hi>Zealous</hi> professors, or any innouators of the <hi>Papisticall Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did the Noble <hi>Fredericke</hi> guard <hi>Luther</hi> to <hi>Wormes,</hi> and in the presence of the Emperour demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Erasmus,</hi> whether his reasons and arguments were consonant to the word of Truth? and they might (as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did) try the Doctrine by the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Then were the Prophesies of <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> remembred and Disputed vpon, as if euen now they had their time of expiration. Then was <hi>Iohn Hilton</hi> a Monck imprisoned for discouering the abuses
<pb facs="tcp:2915:8"/>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergie, and released againe for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing constant in the case of the reformed Religion, both against the will of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Emperour,</hi> and all by a Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi> Then was <hi>Veselus, Picus Miran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula, Laurentius Valla, Erasmus</hi> of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> and many others acceptable to your Ancesters, and they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in nothing more, then the protection and patroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of such Saints of God. Then could that worthy Prince hearing of a storme, that strucke the Angell on the top of the Popes Pallace to the ground, praesage, it was an ominous signe of the fall of <hi>Babilon,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the <hi>Popes</hi> glory; and when not long after hee heard of 31. <hi>Cardinals</hi> made at a time, yea in such a time, when a Lightning &amp; Thunder struck the Childe out of the Virgins armes, and the Keyes out of <hi>Peters</hi> handes, being both Images in the Church, his Zeale and deuotion burst out, that sure God was offended with them, and would reduce their ambition, and prophane Ceremonies to a better humiliation and conformity: And this was <hi>Fredericke</hi> of <hi>Saxony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him succeeded <hi>Iohn Fredericke,</hi> of whom the Emperour was as suspitious as the other: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it were to serue him into the amity and league of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> they contriued to marry him to Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> the Emperours sister, and so thought themselues secure of him: Notwithstanding when he was sent for to beare the Sword before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour at Masse, he would not goe, till hee was resolued of diuers Diuines, whether hee might or no with a safe Conscience: I will not (saith he) make a presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of immitation of <hi>Naamans</hi> the <hi>Syrians</hi> going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:2915:8"/>
the Temple of <hi>Rimmon</hi> with the King, to pollute my selfe with an vnlawfull mixture: whereupon they resolued him, that he might goe, because he was sent for, but not endure Masse, because it was so grosse a sinne, and filthy an Idoll.</p>
            <p>I will not name the release of the <hi>Lantsgraue</hi> of <hi>Hesse,</hi> nor other disceptations against the Emperour, and all wrought by the House of <hi>Saxony,</hi> euen to make sad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the hearts of elated men, who at last grew disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with their owne glory: So that when <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. saw their resolutions to deny him a succession in the Empire for his Sonne <hi>Phillip,</hi> he tooke a calmer course, and left his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to wrastle with the <hi>Germane</hi> Protestant Princes, and went himselfe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly into a Monastery.</p>
            <p>With what a faire and euen course were the affaires of <hi>Rodulphus</hi> Emperour carryed, as aduised by your Princes to proclayme the <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Auspurg,</hi> which they had bought out with great summes of money of <hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his predecessors? whereby the <hi>Protestants</hi> had many sweet entercourses to heare the worde of God, and thought no pleasure of the world comparable to the blessed society of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but to neerer times.</p>
            <p>How carefull was your Brother <hi>Christian</hi> the 2. late Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> of the peace of the Empire, and in a manner iealious of the liberty of the Protestants, least it might fall into the handes of Violence? This made him write to <hi>Mathias</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> concerning the eleuation of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> that sure hee tooke a wrong course both with the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-welth,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:2915:9"/>
especially our selues, whome he found startling fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the obedience of a tyrannous Gouernment, and affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of vnconscionable <hi>Vsurpation.</hi> For said he, what will you get by your <hi>Spanish</hi> Garisons, and Spanish fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in those Kingdomes, but an vnwilling &amp; enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced obedience to your present Authority, and vtter rejection to your future Posterity? what will the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Inquisitiue <hi>Iesuites</hi> come to, but a plaine infatuating and imposturing of your Zeale and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and the peoples manifestation of murmurings and grudges against so fearefull a worke? what will the bringing in of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> it selfe contriue, but in the beginning, cursses and repinings from euery mans mouth, and in the end hate and rebellion in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans heart?</p>
            <p>To this effect were your Brothers Letters, and what hath followed, I neede not enlarge; seeing now the clamours of Warre on euery side eccho out the same, and our iustifications haue beene as a <hi>Bonarges,</hi> or the sound of many waters.</p>
            <p>Nay, did not Duke <hi>Iohn Ernestus</hi> not long a goe send to his owne Vniuersitie of <hi>Iena,</hi> and then they of <hi>Iena</hi> to the Vniuersitie of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> and therein to persons of name <hi>Iohn Maior Superintendent,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Gerrard,</hi> Doctors of Diuinitie for the sollution of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine difficulties in <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

               </gap> to forget Vs, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your selfe: Though you could giue way to the desertion of <hi>Bohemians</hi> amity, yet there is no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of mercy, nor the loue of God and heauen:
<pb facs="tcp:2915:10"/>
Though you could reioyce in the sincking and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of an enemy, yet be not an enemy to your owne soule, nor hazard the losse of eternall reward: For it is now Gods cause, and the people will liue and dye in the defence of their Religion: Oh that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour himselfe would hearken to the voyce, that told <hi>Saul,</hi> there was no kicking against the pricke! and if a Lightning from Heauen strucke him from his horse and made him blinde, what shall the armies of Gods Angels doe, when hee meanes to deliuer his people? Be not therefore transported to fight against God, or with the olde Gyants to begin a new warre, and throw the mountaines against Heauen. For I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that you thinke, how <hi>Antechrist</hi> is not onely discouered, but know, he shall be punished, yea laide open in this world to the hissing of all the passengers; and then woe to the <hi>Princes</hi> of the earth, that haue worshipped the Beast, and drunke of the Cup of the Strumpet, that rideth vpon the Beast.</p>
            <p>But leauing Religion, which yet will not be left out of Gods account, What stumbling blocke of offence hath bene further laide, or who hath cast these rubs in your smooth walke to amity &amp; former combination?</p>
            <p>Is it the person of our King you maligne? Oh say not so: For if euer <hi>Titus</hi> was called <hi>Deliciae generis huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> He may well be proclaymed the <hi>Prince</hi> of happines and Peace, as a man composed by Nature, ordayned of God, selected by Prophesie, confirmed by Miracle, and established by all our suffrages, as if the Dignity belonged vnto him, as a <hi>Prince,</hi> and other blessings, as a happy man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2915:10"/>Is it our reuoltings you disalow of, as if either the rejection of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> were not lawfull, or ratification of this our choyse suspencible? Why, wee haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerd it to the whole world, that when <hi>Mathias</hi> had his owne endes in the adoption and inauguration of this man to the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> for which he left him a pledge of his loue the Towne of <hi>Budwis:</hi> It was absolutely contrary to his owne Oath, and our immunities and Priuiledges. For neither did the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated <hi>Prouinces</hi> know of it, nor wee our selues condiscended to the agreement: but onely certain <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> the firebrands of Hell, ran vp and downe to set all in combustion, and with <hi>Meleagers</hi> mother tooke the torch of his Life in a rage, and held it downeward, till the flame was extinguished, and other traytors of our owne, molded to another Impression by the warming handes of <hi>Spanish Papists,</hi> and all to let out the blood of their Mother, I meane their Countrey and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, to see her languish and perish before their faces for priuate respects, or some praedestinated vengeance to fall vpon their owne heads.</p>
            <p>Is it the obseruation of the <hi>Emperour</hi> himselfe, or respect to his Family? wherein hath he deserued bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reputation, then your selfe, or other Princes of <hi>Germany</hi>? or what hath beene done these 100. yeares for the good of <hi>Christendome</hi>? or why shall this glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>meteor</hi> or exhalation darken the light of truer starres, and more radiant Planets? Hath he not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the trust committed vnto him, by betraying all your Princely liberties into the handes of Strangers, and setting vp the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Monarchy in the <hi>Westerne</hi>

world to the terrifying of all <hi>Christian</hi> Princes? For what Nation haue they not beene tampering withall, euen to the placing of Soldiers and garisons amongst them. I hope <hi>Italy</hi> hath knowne them, and the <hi>Ilands</hi> of those Seas. <hi>Ireland</hi> hath had them, and felt some endurances for them. <hi>France</hi> bin tormented by them; the <hi>Grisons</hi> haue still their <hi>forte Fuentes:</hi> The passages of some Mountaines are kept by them. <hi>Sauoy</hi> is full of them. <hi>Hungary</hi> is not yet freed of them. <hi>Austria</hi> swarms with them: our selues are but newly ridde of them, some Imperiall townes, as <hi>Wesell</hi> and others possessed by them, and euen at this instant is hee calling in of greater troopes amongst you.</p>
            <p>Is it the care of the Empire you shoot at? how can that be? when by these Warres all Gouernment must be turmoyled, and that natiue beauty of our peace and prosperity made adulterate by <hi>Iesabels</hi> paintings and the thicke laide colours of wicked pollicy, when the slaughtered Armies of <hi>Christians</hi> shall pollute your fields &amp; Cities, and fill your swolne eyes with tears for the losse of Parents, Husbands, Children, friends, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Is it the <hi>Popes</hi> Curse you are afraide of? Why thats impossible, considering that hee now resembles a fire in a painted cloath, which neither yeeldeth warmth nor lustre. For his Fulminations are now made ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, and his Cursings proue like <hi>Balaams</hi> corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who for all the King of <hi>Moabs</hi> promises, sang a Parable of blessings to <hi>Ifraell:</hi> nay you may be assured, that the time of his desolation is comming faster on then the winde, and the <hi>Prouinces</hi> are falling away like vntempered Morter from a wall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2915:11"/>Is it <hi>Spaines</hi> mightines you stand in awe of? Be not amated!

He is strong indeed, but is behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Peace of other Kingdomes, and the hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of such Nations, as make a conscience in infringing of an Oath.</p>
            <p>Is it the Marquesse <hi>Spinola's</hi> Army which terrifies you? I answer briefly with <hi>Elisha</hi> to his seruant, there are more with vs then with them: and it is but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of eyes to see Chariots and the horsmen of Heauen on the mountaine tops: But I could say thus much further, that you haue the more cause to adhaere to the Princes of the <hi>Vnion,</hi> and propulse a common enemy, of whom I will onely apply that, which <hi>Count Meloun</hi> assured the <hi>English</hi> in the later time of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> that if <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had preuailed, hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to destroy all such first, as prooued Traytors to their Countrey, and led him by the Arme to trample on the bruised body of <hi>England:</hi> So say wee euen to the <hi>Catholicke</hi> Bishops themselues, whether Warre or Peace, they will repent this hard bargaine with distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and when they see their exaltation depressed, or liberty vsurped, cry out vpon the first cause of their troubles, and name the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> as so many <hi>Incendiaries</hi> of a Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>For had they not bene better to haue continued in

their Electiue powers for the choyse of their <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> and let the Confession of <hi>Auspurg</hi> alone to the freedome of mens Consciences, and the quieting of free Citties? Then now to bee assured, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants will neuer be reclaymed, nor taught other les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then to Fight for their Religion, and the glory of the Gospell; yea to hazard their owne Liues and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: So that whether wee, or strangers preuaile, it lyes in the will and choyse of the Victors, to deale with the vanquished at their pleasures.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing else! you make a scruple of? Oh that there were nothing else, then might these <hi>Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> bee easily answered, and a iudicious man soone sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: Yet if you conceale the same, it must prooue like the Oyntments shut vp in boxes, which seldome are smelt to the refreshing of the sences, till they bee vncouered or powred out: Oh doe not therefore <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aestuate</hi> your griefes by suppression, but let the wounds be opened, and gently searched, least they grow vlce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ranckle and proue incurable! And if any impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation lye vpon vs, wee will be bolde to say (sauing the Dignity of our King) wee will easily descend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, and you shall quickly finde the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Therefore for Gods sake, for Religions sake, for your owne sake, for your Ancestors sake, for your Countries sake, let there bee a better reposednes, and recollection of those contracts of amity, which euer were betweene your House and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> yea with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster bindings, and more reciprocall obseruation, then with any other <hi>Prouinciall</hi> Prince.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2915:13"/>I could name and set downe the very manner of gratefying our King, with animating him in his best prosecutions, as if he had bene distasted with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours vaine-glorious insulting ouer vs; but they be thinges beyond our <hi>C<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Nay, wee are ready to attend you, though you exemplifie no reason at all, but a glorious Spirit to manifest your Greatnes, or wilfulnes to prepare your liberty to support whom you please? For if it be so, there may be some hope of the compassion which will follow, when necessity shall whisper preseruation in your eares, and draw commiseration from your heart to preuent the slaughters of so many <hi>Christians,</hi> and peraduenture the captiuity of your freest Citties: Whereas now there is not so much as a thought of prouidence, nor a worde of preuention, nor any <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> among whome this is <hi>Autenticall,</hi> that weake beginnings, and the worst sort of men may be instruments to set mischiefe on worke, but troubles are not pacified without iudgement, and men of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued wisdome.</p>
            <p>Therefore once againe (most Illustrious <hi>Prince</hi>) we beseech you, let vs returne to our King, as the explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators of <hi>Canaan</hi> did to the <hi>Israelites:</hi> For although tenne of them did talke of <hi>Enakims</hi> and <hi>Giants</hi> of iron gates and high walles; of strong Cities &amp; formidable

            <p>I Remember a speech of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that it was a signe of Treason, or trayterous disposition, when a <hi>Generall</hi> meant onely to write to his Enemy, when with like facillity hee might haue repulsed him by force of Armes: so may you obiect against me, that you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at a Letter, when you expected both men and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: But then you must wonder at the alteration of times too, and peraduenture the necessity of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: For it fareth not now with vs, as when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire it selfe came as it were from our donation, and the <hi>Diadems</hi> of Princes were the <hi>Vtensels</hi> of our Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold, as when <hi>Charles</hi> the Great dissipated the cloude of Vengeance, with the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> thickned against the shining sunne of our Prelacie, as when the <hi>Prouinces</hi> and Kingdomes of <hi>Europe</hi> were affraid of our Curse, and Excommunication of our Church: as when Religion was locked vp in our <hi>Conclaue,</hi> and not opened without <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes, as when a Sonne for our sakes would chastice the rebellion of a Father, and one Nation scourge another at the intercession of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat: The examples are so plentifull, that euen Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, haue gotten them in their mouthes to spit in our faces: It fareth not with vs, as when true deuotion tyed the Consciences of men to the obseruation of
<pb facs="tcp:2915:15"/>
our pleasure, and no vpstart Familist durst broach a strange Doctrine to our preiudice: When Faith was predominant in our hearts, and honest simplicity liued out our liues and actions, beleeuing onely what the <hi>Church</hi> did teach, and practising nothing but with modesty and obedience: then were the <hi>Halcion</hi> dayes of our glory, and how euer <hi>Heretickes</hi> haue characterd them with ignorance and superstition, yet question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les as in Martiall discipline Soldiers must not bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with euery secret, but simply yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their Commanders: so in the matters of the <hi>Church,</hi> men were neuer at so much peace of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as when they knew not how to trouble their soules beyond their vnderstandings: In a word, it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not with vs, as when the Vnity of Church and Common-wealths resembled a sheaue of Arrowes, strongly bound together, which was that way indissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, but diuided a sunder they were easily snapped in peeces one by one; then were the Kingdomes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> of one vnanimity, and if any vpstart <hi>Heretickes</hi> brake out, or furious <hi>Scismatickes</hi> approached to the holy Altar with violence, they were quickly enforced backe, and taught a lesson of obedience, either by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels, whereat many times 400. Bishops were gathered together, or the power of an Army, which came at our becke from all the quarters of Christendome.</p>
            <p>But now, and in your owne particular <hi>Most deare Sonne,</hi> 1. The times are altered, 2. <hi>Religion</hi> is confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, 3. And the <hi>Prouinces</hi> are deuided.</p>
            <p n="1">1 First concerning the times, you see, that Princes
<pb facs="tcp:2915:15"/>
are so iealious one of anothers Greatnes, that neither law of Marriage or Conscience can detaine them within the limites of humanity, especially Charity, as reioycing in the good one of another, but they will confederate euen with those, they hate, to cast blocks and hinderances in the way of one another, if there be but a suspition, that he runneth on too fast to Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: This began (for our moderne times) in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fift, with whome <hi>England</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Prouinces</hi> ioyned against the <hi>French:</hi> but no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was the King taken Prisoner at <hi>Pauy,</hi> but they fell backe againe to a commiseration of his affliction, and began to assist him in a new recouery. This hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued against your House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and my Sonne of <hi>Spaine:</hi> For euer since <hi>Burgundy</hi> and yee haue beene Vnited, whereby <hi>Charles</hi> left the Empire to his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother, you see the world hath cryed out, that <hi>Spaine</hi> would bee the Monarch of the <hi>West,</hi> and the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> by his assistance vsurpe the dignity of the <hi>Church,</hi> and by a new superintendency ouertop the Authority of the Papacy. This hath made seuerall Kinges op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselues against <hi>Spaine,</hi> and now seueral <hi>Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> fall from your obedience, as if the Angels prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie against <hi>Ismael,</hi> were verified; That his hand should be against euery man, &amp; euery mans hand against him. Yea this will end against the Low-Countries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, who fill the Seas with formidable Nauies, and haue such strong Citties, Ramparts, and Armies, that already they begin to be feared, and already fall vnder the hand of watching and ouerlooking. Beleeue it then, that in this point alone of suspition of your
<pb facs="tcp:2915:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Greatnes, not naming other collaterall causes of hate, Cruelty, oppression, defending our Supremacy, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching your selfe and such like, there will euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine a tricke of pollicy, if not to trip vp your heeles for running at all, yet to pull you backe as it were by the sleeue from making too much hast, so that I see no remedy, but that you must be contented to yeeld to the time, and rather to keepe somthing, then loose all: For howeuer the greatnes of your Spirit may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund obedience, and the goodnes of the cause plead possession; yet necessity is a predominant mischiefe, and they are fooles that will perish in an obstinacy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Fortune: Remember that <hi>Hanniball</hi> had possession of <hi>Italy</hi> 17. yeares, and might haue tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in <hi>Rome,</hi> if he had taken his time: but when <hi>Scipio</hi> diuerted the Warre, <hi>Carthage</hi> was besieged, and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> knew not, how to bee relieued, till <hi>Hanniball</hi> was recalled: so the great Captaine was disapointed in his Proiects, and compelled to yeeld to the <hi>Roman</hi> glory. I speake not by way of Prophesie but precept, that in all extremities the law of preseruation comes from instinct of Nature, and to preuent a greater mischiefe, men must, and may endure some inconuenience; and so much for the time.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Concerning Religion, which yet is not the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours plea, nor the Empires cause, you see the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: many good Mothers bring forth bad Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Truth begets hatred, Familiarity contempt, Charity idlenes, and Knowledge presumption, with such like. For euer since the common people haue beene licenced to reade the Scriptures, and make
<pb facs="tcp:2915:16"/>
their owne interpretations, they haue startled from the obedience of the Church, and cryed out vpon li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as though their Consciences like vntam'd Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were let loose, and they tyed vnto no rules and Lawes but of their owne deuising: this hath made so many mechanicke men presumptuous, and silenced women audacious; that a poore ignorant Cobler dare compare with a Father of the Church, and a tatling woman instead of being instructed by her Husband, take vpon her to rule both husband and family: This hath set on worke certaine strange spirits to rayle vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on order and conformity, euen in the Churches of Heretickes themselues, that they haue denyed them to be Churches, but the vnswept roomes of <hi>Antechrist,</hi> because of some enormities, and imperfections in men and Gouernment, which are, were, and shall be in this militant <hi>Church,</hi> till the comming of Christ to Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This hath deuided the Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> and taught hipocrites and foolish Libertines a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lesson of defending the Gospell of CHRIST and his Saincts, whereby they haue vaine-gloriously taken vp Armes against the Church, and their Prnces; so that if successe haue not smoothly looked vpon them, but <hi>Iustice</hi> submitted them to the punishment of <hi>Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> they haue confounded Treason and Martyrdome together, and taught their blasphemous tongues to cry out, <hi>Sanguis Martirium semen Ecclesiae,</hi> as though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery rebell and raging pesant, punished for transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, must bee therefore <hi>Charactered</hi> a Saint of God; so that this <hi>Gangren</hi> is spreading ouer the whole body, and for any thing I see remediles, vnlesse wee could
<pb facs="tcp:2915:17"/>
cut off that poysoned ioynt where it began. Againe, if their commotions and Convulsions of the Empire it selfe haue thriued with aduantages of victory, and preuailing; then haue they dared to publish the right of their Cause, and exclaime against <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Babilon,</hi> against our <hi>Holines</hi> for the man of <hi>Sinne,</hi> against our <hi>Church</hi> for <hi>Antechristian,</hi> against our Sonnes the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke</hi> Princes for the Kinges that haue drunke of the Cup of abhomination, and against your <hi>Imperiall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty,</hi> as the Beast with 10. hornes spoken of in the <hi>aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall</hi> Prophesie of St. <hi>Iohn:</hi> nay these thinges are so imprinted in the mindes of most men and Nations, that euery man is almost so farre from retraction, or a seeming sorrow of doing amisse, that (so they may haue the name of Religion in their mouthes) they are ready to take vp Armes against their natiue Lords, and thinke it a glory to colour their hipocriticall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, with maintaining the cause of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and taking part (as a new deuise of Rebellion) with the Princes of the Vnion: And so much for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Concerning the Prouinces: I cannot now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them better, then to a Wall set vp with vntempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red morter, ready to fall a sunder for lacke of cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For alas such is the impetuosity of rumor at this houre against you, that it is more fearefull and terrible, then the winde that shooke the foure corners of <hi>Iobs</hi> houses, and threw them downe on the heads of his Children. To begin with the North, if we name <hi>Saxony</hi> and his neighbour Bishops to assist you: they counterprize <hi>Denmarke, Sweden, Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,
<pb facs="tcp:2915:17"/>
Brunswick,</hi> and many of that side: If we talke of <hi>Poland,</hi> they tell you, that all that way, there is <hi>Lusatia, Silesia, Morauia,</hi> as a hedge betweene <hi>Bohemia</hi> and it; nay they drawe a longer shaft, and a stronger bowe of <hi>Hungary, Transiluania,</hi> and the <hi>Turkes</hi> confederacy and combination: If wee mention your Vnckle the <hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> or more familiarly the Marquesse <hi>Spinola</hi> his Liefetenant, they stop the gap with the Truce, with the Peace with <hi>England,</hi> or else with the Armies of the <hi>States,</hi> the affinity of the Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissoluble loue of a King to his Daughter,<note place="margin">King <hi>Iames.</hi>
               </note> which I onely feare is vnanswerable, and must needes say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be resisted, if hee either remember what a Sonne in Law he hath, or what Subiects proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Greatnes, that without imposition (if hee giue them leaue) long to be tampering with the <hi>Indyes</hi> themselues: If wee expect <hi>Collen,</hi> and the Bishops belonging to our obedience, they present vs the <hi>Lants<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue</hi> of <hi>Hesse, Franconia,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate</hi> it selfe: If we relye vpon <hi>Bauaria,</hi> they neighbour him with <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg,</hi> and other <hi>Protestant</hi> Princes: If wee resolue vpon <hi>Austria,</hi> they cry alas what is that to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the deuided Countries of your inheritance? If wee boast of money, they answer directly, there is no want in their Army, but your Soldiers repine for lacke of pay: If we whisper of <hi>France,</hi> they talke aloude, there is enough to doe to answer their owne proportions. For Queene, King, and Princes gaze vpon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the behalfe of Fauorites, factions, and people: If wee reioyce for <hi>Spaine,</hi> they depresse the insulting, with alas, what can <hi>Spaine</hi> doe? <hi>Spaine</hi> is too remote,
<pb facs="tcp:2915:18"/>
               <hi>Spaine</hi> can spare no men: <hi>Spaine</hi> hath many Garisons to tend, as so many Nurse Children to pay for: <hi>Spaine</hi> hath many yrons in the fire, but as fast as one heates, another cooles: <hi>Spaine</hi> is tyred with the multiplicity of busines, and must be more then tyr'd, if hee could come ouer the <hi>Alpes: Spaine</hi> is in hazard of loue, and good opinion in the world, as rather enuyed, then fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and maligned then obserued: In a word, <hi>Spaine</hi> hath many millions and great Treasure: but I may well compare him to a glorious Steward of a House, who must defray the charge of a 1000.l. a yeare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, but the Lord will but allow his seruant 800. toward it. If we recken vp our own <hi>Prouinces,</hi> I cannot liken them better, then to <hi>Argos</hi> his eyes, whereof the one halfe wakes, while the other sleepes. For <hi>Sauoy</hi> neither dares trust <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor truly loue vs: must keepe his Frontiers, and watch <hi>Geneua,</hi> lookes vpon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisate of <hi>Salusse</hi> with soare eyes, and vpon <hi>Prouince</hi> with a hungry heart; dares not speake aloude against <hi>France,</hi> though he whisper for some indignities recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but either to succour you, or our selues, he is both vnwilling and vnprouided. <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> runne the same course, but with slower pace, and indeed because no body regards them, as able to doe either hurt or good, they are made the wiser to looke to themselues, and not to meddle with other folkes busines. <hi>Millaine</hi> is like a bird in a golden Cage, that may sing to answer proportion with nature, but if the casement be open, shee will take the benefit of her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: so that howeuer they seeme Religious, yet hath <hi>Spaine</hi> much adoe to ouer-watch them. <hi>Genoa</hi> is not
<pb facs="tcp:2915:18"/>
worth the naming for your busines, for if it were as rich againe, it hath much a doe to pay the Marchants debts. <hi>Venice</hi> is a fearefull and polliticke <hi>State,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vse of our Religion, but loueth her owne Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes so well, that shee is both jealious of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and loathsome to Vs: for wee feare her reuolt dayly, and because she is got into the number of the Princes of the <hi>Vnion,</hi> will not number a man, nor a peece of Gold for your reliefe. <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Leuca,</hi> will lend you what money they can, but alas they haue neither men nor Gallyes, and if they had, the <hi>Venetian</hi> is so dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged he will not let them passe into the Gulph. <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicilia,</hi> could spare you men, though they want money, and many of their Nobles are willing to assist you, but to come through the <hi>Grison</hi> passages it is a long and terrible iourney, and to passe into <hi>Histria,</hi> puls the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dust into their eyes. The <hi>Swisse</hi> are very indifferent, and for money will serue either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but considering their combination, and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with the <hi>Protestants,</hi> I doe not see, how they are to be trusted, or relyed vpon. In a word wee our selues are yours, and yee shall haue our Men, if we knewe which way; our Money as it comes euery way; our Prayers as true deuotion inciteth; our Curses against your enemies, as their Contentions increaseth; our Priests amongst your Subiects, as their affection de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth; our Pardons for your sinnes, as holy Church instituteth; and our Benediction for your busines, as your affaires concurreth: Onely bee patient and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome your disasters with wisdome. For to that end were Vertues framed, or else why doe we name Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb facs="tcp:2915:19"/>
Magnanimity, Patience, Temperance, and such like <hi>Concomitants</hi> of glory and blessednes.</p>
            <p>Seeing then your case so stands, and that <hi>Bohemia</hi> hath put a tricke of reuolt vpon you. First groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon some fundamentall positions of an <hi>Electiue</hi> Prouince, making the world beleeue they haue a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to reduce it to her pristinate Gouernment.</p>
            <p>Secondly relying vpon <hi>Hungarias</hi> examples, whose vnconstancy hath yet as it were dilacerated her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and shewed the <hi>Turke</hi> a way to prey vpon her prosperity, as you shall read of <hi>Prometheus</hi> on Mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> on whose entrals a Vulture continually gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, so that he is euer dying, and euer liuing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, emboldened by <hi>Bethelem Gabor</hi> Prince of <hi>Transiluania,</hi> with whome you see the <hi>Turke</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a Truce and couenant of Peace, that he might the better make Warre against any disturbers of his friends and confederates: For when at first the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> cast themselues into his embraces, he would not close his armes, but gaue them leaue to returne to fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er holdings, and in amanner nominated the <hi>Palatinate</hi> for their Prince.</p>
            <p>Fourthly pretending some grieuances from your selfe, and <hi>Mathias,</hi> not onely that you tooke a wrong course with their obedience, playing the vnskilfull Surgeon with them, to feare, cut, and <hi>Cauterize</hi> their wounds, which might haue bene fairely healed with lenatiue <hi>Cataplasmes,</hi> but also that you ouer-stretched your owne stringes to a higher tune then the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would beare, and so presuming to command all, you came at last to enioy nothing, according to our
<pb facs="tcp:2915:19"/>
               <hi>Italian</hi> prouerb, <hi>Chitutto a braccia nessuno strenge.</hi>

            <p>Last of all, proiecting the youth, brauery, and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this man (especially that the King of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> a nominated Prince in all Prophesie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for the enemie to Papistrie) would neuer stand still, and looke vpon those rude hands, which should pull downe the frame of so goodly a building, they came at last to this maine point of reiection of you; which must needes be their fault, and electing him, which cannot chuse but be his fortune: so that in a word considering what I haue said, Beleeue it, they that dared once to conceit the starting aside fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your authority, were not so barren of vnderstanding, but to consider what might happen, either war or peace, and so haue prepared both to shut you out of their walks of their loue and submission, &amp; to keepe you off as far as they can by a steely arme and forcible detention, wherat you cannot be dismayed, for this maine reason, that they which wil confesse themselues aduersaries to God, care not to professe themselues enemies to men.</p>
            <p>Now in this point alone all our hopes are disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: For first, they haue traced our supremacy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Luthers</hi> owne steps, and placed the stout Hereticks: that though with <hi>Hercules</hi> in his Cradle they did not strangle the Serpents, yet with <hi>Hercules</hi> in the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that killed his owne children, they haue like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractary delinquents set vpon their father &amp; their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Me their father the supreame Bishop, and the Church their mother, the blessed spouse of Christ. 2. Secondly, they haue denied our indulgences, and scorned our Pardons, not caring for their sicke soules,
<pb facs="tcp:2915:20"/>
but willing to dye in desperation, as a frantick man in a Feauer, that striketh his Phisician, and casteth the Potion on the ground. 3. Thirdly, they haue pulled downe our Images, and abrogated that constitution of the Church, as if they meant to be <hi>Anathemataes,</hi> and enemies to Religion, by taking away all the meanes of deuotion. 4. Fourthly, they haue banished the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites. It may be they are suspected amongst our owne Priests, and haue imputation rather of pollicie, then piety: but what is that to the cure of soules? and the estate of Lay men? I pray God I may not say by them, as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> tale is betweene the Sheepe and the Wolues, who were offended at the Sheepes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining great dogges amongst them, whereby they liued secured from their ruine: but when they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed them to their dimission, then did these cruell Wolues, more cruell by the aduantage of exasperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, returne to their former prey and violence. Last of all, they haue bewitched the foster spirited men with manswetude and good vsage, whereby the Priests themselues are growne to commend their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; the <hi>Catholickes</hi> in generall to shew their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: so that they, which in former times repined to pay our Officers the tribute of the Church, disburse both money and Armes to the sustentation of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and whereas we had euer much adoe to worke vpon their soules, these <hi>Bohemians</hi> (though of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion) haue brought both soules and bodies to their beck, and authority.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>(Deare sonne)</hi> for any thing I see, the matter is remedilesse, and to complaine against God, men, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb facs="tcp:2915:20"/>
treasons, and such like, will rather discouer a distemperature of passion, then magnanimity of spirit: nay, though there were hope of reformation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be aduised by me, though patience in some things be a poore vertue, and onely fit to draw on heauier burthens: yet in other businesse, and most occasions it reduceth the minde to consideration, and setleth the iudgement for the preuention of greater mischiefe. It bringeth the sences to order, and keeps both soule and body in temperature: as for imputation of cowardise, and basenesse, when high and glorious designes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose themselues to prosecution, remember the story of <hi>Fabius,</hi> and <hi>Minutius,</hi> against <hi>Hanniball.</hi> The Senate indeede gaue eare to the aspersions of his retraction and delay, as if either he durst not fight, or knew not how to proceede, and so deuided the Generalship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, but that diuided the successe of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse: for <hi>Minutius</hi> fayling in the heat of his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, was glad to retire vnder the shadow of <hi>Fabius</hi> his moderation: For as sometimes the doltishnesse of an aduersary doth animate weake troupes to giue the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set: so at all times the wisedome, and discipline of an enemie, doth keepe in awe euen equall forces for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturing too farre, and being too forward.</p>
            <p>This is your case, and my feare: your case, For what can you now get by this warre, considering the mightinesse of your foe, and the diuision of your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but in the preuailing an eternall hate against your house and family? and in the failing, such contumely and disgrace, that how euer you are sure of me and my Bishops, yet the name of <hi>Emperour</hi> shall be but a titular
<pb facs="tcp:2915:21"/>
dignity, and the obumbration of your glory bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at last obliuion of your greatnesse; nay, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture the losse of that Character of Emperor it selfe: For it fareth with the fortune of vnfortunate Princes, as with ruinous walls; when a man perceiues their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and weaknesse, euery one runnes aside for mistrust of falling vpon them: or else they are compared to a mans tumbling downe a paire of staires, who if hee once loose his first footing, commonly neuer stayes himselfe, till hee come to the bottome. Againe say, your aduersary be subiect to a defeat, as his friends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, his forces will be renued, and then hee returnes with greater violence, as in those dayes the Souldiers were wont to doe with their machinations, who pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led backe their rammes and engines, of purpose to run forward with the greater fury, and more impetuosity. But if you (which God forbid) should be subiect to the inconstancy of Fortune, or if you will (as many good men haue beene) to the chastisement of diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and suffer dissolution of your Army: how will you renue the same, considering the remotenesse of your friends, the weaknesse of confederates, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion of your people, the infection of your Subiects with <hi>Lutheranisme,</hi> the repining of <hi>Stiria, Curniola,</hi> and <hi>Carinthia:</hi> the murmuring of the <hi>Swisse</hi> and <hi>Grisons</hi>; and in a word, the shaking of the whole frame of your gouernment, as you see a high and heauy topped tree loosened in the root, and standing on vnfirme ground wauering, and ready to fall, &amp; so much for your selfe.</p>
            <p>Concerning my feare: say that successe (for it is a wisedome to presuppose the worst) should bring them
<pb facs="tcp:2915:21"/>
forward into the walke of preuayling, would they not runne thinke you without interception? Nay could the <hi>Alpes</hi> Barricado the way, or the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gulph deny them transportation, the high Hilles and white Cliffes of <hi>Ancona</hi> would be a Sea marke to bring them directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Appenine</hi> is but a poore moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in respect of those they haue passed: But you will say, our Friends about the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> Sea, will come in apace to preuent this mischiefe, and a 1000. Ships and Gallies will keepe the <hi>Ostia</hi> of <hi>Tiber,</hi> after they haue landed our Friends in our behalfe; I thinke and hope so too; yet I would be loath to put it to such an aduenture. For the straights of <hi>Gibralter</hi> are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then the Gates of the Citty that <hi>Sampson</hi> carryed on his shoulders, and they that cannot bee detained from going to the <hi>Indyes,</hi> will not be denyed to come into the <hi>Leuant:</hi> Our enemies haue more Shipping then our selues, and our Friends are far fewer then our Opposites, they that know the way for traficke, and commutation of Marchandize, will know the way to spoile and getting of riches so easily: Againe, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries are constant, sure and exasperated with zeale and fury against Vs: They march like <hi>Iohn</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Nimshi,</hi> and cry aloude to cast <hi>Iesabell</hi> out of the window: our Friends are wauering, vnconstant, and fearefull of alteration, so that to relye vpon them is but to trust <hi>Egiptian</hi> reedes, or a broken staffe: In a word; they haue Prophesies and calculations in their mouthes, wishes of reuenge, and eternall hate in their hearts, fury and bloody executions in their actions, and all against <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:2915:22"/>Some talke of the Scriptures, and compare the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of the Priests at their tables spoken of in the <hi>Prophets</hi> to the feasts of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and banquettings in our Court: some tell a tale of <hi>Bell</hi> and the Dragon, and when they come to the deuouring of so much meate, they say, that <hi>Daniel</hi> sifted Ashes in the place, and discouerd the footsteps of the <hi>Priests,</hi> their Wiues and their Children, and all against <hi>Rome</hi>: some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Doctrine of <hi>Deuils,</hi> the man of sinne, <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> and <hi>Idolatry:</hi> some descant of the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> and dare name <hi>Iesabell, Babilon, Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Whore vpon the Beast; the Cup of <hi>Abhomination,</hi> &amp; all against <hi>Rome:</hi> some repeate the Prophesies of the <hi>Sybels,</hi> the Praedictions of Moncks and Fryers, the praedil;sages of Nunnes and Saincts, the foretelling of Martyrs, and the persecuted vnder Tyrants, and all against <hi>Rome:</hi> Which though it end with blasphemous inuectiues, yet hath made such impressions in the hearts of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, that as they haue set their blacke mouthes on worke with contagious rayling, so they long to set their soule handes on worke, with our vncharitable destruction, and is not this a iust cause of our feare?</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>(Deare Sonne)</hi> for Gods sake, for my sake, for the Churches sake, for your owne sake, for our Friends sake, and in a word, for the generall cause sake both of <hi>Peters</hi> Chayre, and <hi>Caesars</hi> Throne, Be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to mingle a little water with your Wine, and coole the heate of your passion with some sweeter compounds, then rage and reuenge: Hearken to a Treatise of pacification, though it sound not such a

               <hi>Diapason</hi> of musicke, as will answer proportion, and satisfie the cares of your Maiesticke greatnes, Admit of a Peace in this case of extremity, and remember how <hi>Abimelech</hi> though a Heathen idolater, when hee saw <hi>Abraham</hi> so prosper in his enterprises, descended to contracts of amity, and came so lowe, as to allow him for a <hi>Prince</hi> amongst them.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Aspersions</hi> of disparagement, and extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the worthines of so great a Monarch, let all bee wiped away with the hand of <hi>Charity,</hi> and the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding effusion of <hi>Christian</hi> blood: blot out the exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of your enemies mischiefe against you, or the conceit of their trayterous reuolts amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: Bee wise in your owne harmes, and for your owne good: Let <hi>Spaine</hi> and your kindreds example induce you to immitation: they haue pollitickly kept their distances, and for aduantage made Truce with their owne rebels, I meane the Low-Countries, and contracted Peace with them, whom not long agoe they thought to swallow vp: I meane <hi>England</hi> it selfe, which now to shoot against, will returne their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes in their owne bosomes.</p>
            <p>If this be harsh and vnpleasant, as curbing the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roycknes of your Spirit by descending so lowe, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the first proffer, wee will goe another way to worke, and rather then faile of this Blessing of peace, put on <hi>Esaus</hi> hairy necke, &amp; rough hands, and bring to <hi>Isaac</hi> his Venison, though the voyce bee <hi>Iacobs:</hi> I will send a Legate: <hi>Spaine</hi> an Embassador: <hi>France</hi> an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor: <hi>England</hi> a Mediator, yea it shall bee so contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that all the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Christend<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

As for the swelling tumour of Greatnes, losse of renowne, disgraces, giuing way to rebellion, diminution of honour and such like, It resembles but the Imposturing incantation of <hi>Sathan</hi> to <hi>Eua,</hi> that made her taste of the forbidden Fruit, to the vtter sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of all Mankinde; so that I will say no more, but if God doe come with this murmuring sweetnes of Peace vnto you, hearken to his voyce, that tuneth such pleasant notes to your soules and Consciences. But if Sathan wish you to bee vnderstanding men, and like God himselfe to know good and euill, hearken not vnto him; your first Mother was deceiued, and your last ruine is a contriuing.</p>
