            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DECLARATION OF THE Peaceable Royalliſts.</head>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the King, We are not ſo mad, nor ſo fooliſh as to endeavour to enſlave our ſelves, and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under a Tyrant. We know that King <hi>James</hi> had his faults, and King <hi>Charles</hi> had his faults, and the preſent King of <hi>Scots</hi> hath his failings, as all men are ſinners too too bad God knows. Indeed, although we thought wee did well in aſſiſting the King againſt the Parliament, becauſe the word of God commanded obedience to Kings, yet had we but known of that moſt dreadful curſe of King <hi>James</hi> (who curſed himſelf and his Poſterity for ever, if he ſpared any that was ſound guilty of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury's</hi> death, and after the Lord <hi>Carr</hi> was found guilty and condemned for that Fact, he did ſpare him, and would never ſuffer him to be executed. We ſay, had we known this) we ſhould have let God alone, and not have been ſo forward in aſſiſting him in our late unhappy wars; for whoſoever ſhall read a Book entituled <hi>The Court of King James,</hi> and compare it with the laſt engagement made by the Parliament <hi>Saturday 3d Decemb.</hi> 1659 (the ſaid Engagement running thus, <hi>I A. B. do hereby declare, that I do renounce the pretended title of</hi> Charles Stewart, <hi>and the whole Line of the late King</hi> James <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) will find that Gods judgments are juſt; Nevertheleſſe we are exceeding ſorry for that Family, out of the love we bore to <hi>Charles</hi> out late King, becauſe he granted many good things ſo willingly, before any Arms was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up on either ſide, namely, 1. The damning all Patentees and Monopolies. 2. The taking off Ship-money. 3. That no Papiſts ſhould ſit in Parliament. 4. That Biſhops ſhould not be Lords. 5. That there ſhould be a Parliament every three years. 6. That this Parliament ſhould continue until it diſſolved it ſelf. And then after all this, for the Parliament to demand his Power from him, and becauſe he would not give it them to fight with him for it, we thought it was too hard meaſure, and that we were bound in Conſcience and duty to help him, not knowing of the aforeſaid imprecation of King <hi>James,</hi> or that the finger of God was in it. But now the Militia being by Conqueſt the Parliaments right, we pray God it may be rightly imployed, and for Peace ſake, and for preventing the coming in of Foreign Nations, and for poor-old <hi>Charles</hi> his ſake, our deſires are, 1</p>
            <p>That <hi>Charles Stewart</hi> may be but only Speaker of the Parliament, and have no more Power then <hi>VVilliam Lenthal</hi> had in Parliament, and that an hoſtage may be ſent into <hi>France</hi> for him, to come hither to that purpoſe, and that there may be ſucceſſive Parliaments, and he but the Speaker; And we will all be quiet and ſubmit to the Parliament, and their Army, in all things neceſſary to Peace and ſecurity of the Nation, and for Peace and good Trading with Forreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning Church matters, we do not deſire a rigid Epiſcopacy no more then a rigid Presbytery, (which is deteſtable to us) we are now indeed become Independants, and are fain to Congregate where we can to worſhip God in the Old way; and our Miniſters have no Tithes, but are content with the Alms of our Congregations, and we deſire only but our liberty of whoſe Office ſhould be only to overſee all private Congregations, that every one ſhould worſhip the true God according to the Scriptures, So that no Atheiſm, nor idolatry, nor any wicked worſhip ſhould be introduced; and for Anabaptiſts, ſo long as they Baptize in the ſame Faith, we are not againſt them. And for the Quakers ſo long as they confeſs Chriſt to be a light in their Conſcience, and walk honeſtly by that light, and do not introduce any Doctrine againſt Chriſts Doctrine, we are not againſt them neither.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We confeſſe Gods juſt Judgments upon thoſe of our profeſſion, that have been notorious lewd perſons, we are ſorry for the former pride of our Lords and Gentry, Our Biſhops and Miniſters alſo have indeed been too idle, too proud and too covetous in times paſt; and the prophanneſs and wickedneſs of many, will be laid to their charge. We conſider, that among all Sects and Opinions in Religion, there are ſome good, and ſome wicked among all; and for the good people amongſt them all, we deſire to live in peace with, but for the wicked of all parties, we deſire they may all be puniſhed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, according to the Lawes. And from henceforth we diſclaim and diſown all Swearers, Drunkards, Whoremongers, Blaſphemers, prophane perſons, Thieves, Cheaters, Lyars, Hypocrites, Idolaters, Murderers and Extortioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from cowing into our Congregations, or joyning in communion with us, according to our <hi>Liturgie</hi> or Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> if we know them to be ſuch wicked people.</p>
            <p>Alſo we deſire all Breakers of Oaths, Vows, and Proteſtations, and Engagements (who ever they are) to repent, that God may forgive them as well as the King. And that King <hi>James</hi> may be their warning. And when Peace is ſettled, we hope all poor penitent Royalliſts ſhall have ſome relief for former loſſes and Sequeſtrations.</p>
