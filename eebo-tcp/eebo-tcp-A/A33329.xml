         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the better to strengthen themselves, they entred into

<hi>Jeremy;</hi> the first whereof was the overthrow of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> First, at
the River <hi>Euphrates;</hi> then in their own Country, <hi>Jer.</hi> 46. The first of these
came to pass presently, <hi>Pharaoh Necho</hi>'s Forces, which he had left at <hi>Carchemish,</hi>
being cut off by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in the fourth year of <hi>Jehojakim, Jer.</hi> 46. 2.

               </note> 
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the second, his Father being
yet alive, entred <hi>Iudaea</hi> with a great Army, who, besieging, and forcing <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
made <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> his Vassal, in despight of <hi>Pharaoh Necho,</hi> who had made
him King, and took with him to <hi>Babylon,</hi> for Pledges, <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was yet a
Child, with <hi>Ananias, Misael,</hi> and <hi>Azarias.</hi> He took also part of the Treasures

hasted with his Army to the relief of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> hoping to find <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
in <hi>Iudea.</hi> But this great <hi>Babylonian</hi> had no mind to hazard himself and
his Army against the <hi>Egyptian, Iudaea</hi> being so ill affected towards him, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
far from all succour, or sure place of retreat. If he had (as may be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
any great strength of <hi>Scythian</hi> Horsemen, it was wisely done of him to fall
back out of that rough, Mountanous, and hot Country, into places that were
more even and temperate.<note place="margin">His Fathers death.</note> And besides these reasons, the Death of his Father
happening at the same time, gave him just occasion to return home, and take
possession of his own Kingdom, before he proceeded in the second care, of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
more unto it.</p>
            <p>And this he did at reasonable good leisure. For the <hi>Egyptian</hi> was not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to follow him so far, and to bid him Battel, until the new year came in,
which was the fourth of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> the first of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and the last of
<hi>Necho.</hi> In this year the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> lying upon the Banks of <hi>Euphrates</hi> (his own
Territories bounding it on the North-side) attended the coming of <hi>Necho:</hi>
there,<note place="margin">He conquers <hi>Pharaoh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho.</hi>
               </note> after a cruel Battel fought betwixt them, <hi>Necho</hi> was slain, and his Army
forced to save it self by a violent retreat, wherein it suffered great loss.</p>
            <p>This Victory was so well pursued by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He conquers <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </note> that he recovered all
<hi>Syria,</hi> and whatsoever the <hi>Egyptians</hi> held out of their proper Territories to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> being thus beaten, and altogether for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
discouraged, <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> held himself quiet, as being in heart a Friend to the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> yet having made his peace with the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> the year before, and
<hi>Mebuchadnezzar</hi> was contented with such profit as he could there readily make:
he had forborn to lay any Tribute upon the <hi>Iews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this cool reservedness of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> was, on both sides, taken in ill part.
Whereupon the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King <hi>Psamnis,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Necho,</hi> began to think
of restoring <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> (who had been taken prisoner by his Father, and carried
into <hi>Egypt</hi>) and of setting him up, as a Domestical enemy against his ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Brother. But to anticipate all such accidents, the <hi>Iudaean</hi> had put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
the usual remedy, which his fore-fathers used: For he had made his own
Son <hi>Iechonia</hi> King with him long before;<note place="margin">2 chron. 36 9.</note> in the second year of his own Reign,
when the Boy was but eight years old. As for this rumour of <hi>Iehoahaz</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> foretold, that it should prove a vain attempt, saying,
<hi>He shall not return thither, But he shall die in the place whither they have led him
Captive, and shall see this Land no more.</hi> Jer. 22. 11, 12.</p>

<hi>Baruch</hi> the Scribe, wrote all his Prophecies from his Mouth, whom he

               <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> thought himself secure from all danger,

<hi>Egyptian:</hi> About which time the mighty City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> opposed it self against
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> And upon just confidence of her own strength, despised all
preparations that could be made against her. Now for as much as the term of

            <p>Here it will not be amiss to insert a brief Note concerning the beginning of
this great Princes Rule; The third year of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> was the last of <hi>Nabulasser,</hi>
who being freed from other cares, and businesses, took notice of such as had
revolted from him to <hi>Pharaoh Necho,</hi> and sent this Noble Prince, his Son, with
an Army into <hi>Syria</hi> to reclaim them. In this Expedition was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> carried to
<hi>Babylon,</hi> who therefore makes mention of it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 1. The year next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
being the fourth of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> was the first year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
which <hi>Jeremy</hi> affirmeth in express words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 1. And from this we must
reckon all his time, and actions which follow to be spoken of. In his three and
twentieth year he conquered <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then began his great Empire, there
being none left that durst offend, or oppose him. The second from this year
it was wherein <hi>Daniel</hi> saw that Vision of the Image consisting of sundry Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
which prefigured the succession of great Kingdoms, that should Rule the
World before the coming of Christ. But to return to the Siege of <hi>Tyre,</hi> which
began in the seventh year of his Reign.</p>
            <p>The stately City of <hi>Tyre</hi> covered all the ground of an Island,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tyre</hi> besieged.</note> that was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from the Continent by a deep, and broad Channel of the Sea, The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103996:5"/>
               <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> had no Fleet of Ships, neither were they Seamen: The <hi>Tyrians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
all other Nations in multitude of goodly Ships, and skill to use them:
And every Wind, from one part or other, brought in all needful provisions
to the City: Wherefore neither force, nor Famine could greatly hurt the
place: whereof nevertheless, the Judgments of God (denounced against
it by <hi>Isay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isay 23.</note> 
               <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi>) had threatned the destruction;<note place="margin">Jer. 25.</note> and
the obstinate resolution of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had fully determined to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
it.<note place="margin">Ezek. 26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This hauty King, impatient of resistance, undertook a vast piece of
Work,<note place="margin">The difficulty of the work.</note> which was, to fill up that part of the Sea which divided the
Island from the continent. The City of old <hi>Tyre,</hi> that stood opposite to
the New, upon the firm Land, and the Mountain of <hi>Libanus</hi> near adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that was loaden with stately Cedars, and abundance of other Trees,
furnished him with materials to effect it. Thirteen years were spent in this
difficult, and hopeless undertaking, which need not seem strange, if
we consider, that <hi>Alexander,</hi> working upon that Foundation which was remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Peer, and being withal, assisted with a strong
Fleet, was yet seven months e're he could make way into the City.
Wherefore, if the raging of the Sea was able to carry away that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Alexander</hi> laboured to cover a Shelve, with much more violence could
it overturn, and as it were, consume the work of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> who
laid his Foundation in the bottom of the deep; Striving, as it were, to
fill the empty Belly of this greedy Cormorant, whereas the <hi>Macedonian</hi> did
only stop the throat of it. All may know that God could easily have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
his own threatnings against this place (though it had not pleased
him to use, either a Miracle, or such of his more immediate Engins, as are
Earthquakes, &amp;c.) by making at least, the Seas calm, and adding the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
concurrence of all second helps. But so it pleaseth him oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
in chastising the Pride of man, to use the hand of man, even the hand of
man, striving, as it may seem, against all resistance of nature, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
So that by this excessive labour of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> that Scripture
was fulfilled, that <hi>every Head should be made bald, and every Shoulder should
be made bare,</hi> Ezek. 29. 18. Yet would not <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> give over till
he was Master of the Town.</p>
            <p>When he was entred upon his desperate undertaking, whether it were by
some losses received, or some Mutiny in his Army, or some glorious rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> strenth, his evil willers took courage to rebel against
him; and amongst them, <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> renounced his subjection, and began
to hope for the contrary, which soon after fell out. For <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
gave him no leasure to do much hurt: But with part of his Army,<note place="margin">

strait into <hi>Judaea;</hi> where the amazed King made so little resistance (the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> having left him, as it were in a dream) that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
entred <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> laid hands on <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> whom at first he bound, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to send him to <hi>Babylon,</hi> but his mind changing, he caused him to be slain
in that place, and gave him the Burial of an Ass, to be devoured by Beasts,
and ravinous Birds, according to the former Prophesie; Leaving in his
place his Son,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jeconias</hi> made King and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned.</note> 
               <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> or <hi>Jeconias;</hi> whom yet after three months, and ten
days, he deposed, and sent him Prisoner to <hi>Babylon,</hi> together with <hi>Ezekiel,

those Messengers which came to visit <hi>Zedechias,</hi> making them know, that if
they, and the King of <hi>Iuda</hi> continued in subjection to <hi>Babylon,</hi> they should then
possess, and enjoy their own Countries; If not, they should assuredly perish by

to escape the present danger, lost both his Courage and his Hope at once, and
shifted himself, together with his Wives, Children, Princes, and principal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
out of the City, by a way under-ground, leaving his amazed, and now
headless Subjects, to the merciless Swords of their enraged enemies. Thus he,
who when the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> perswaded him to render himself, despised both
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103996:6"/>
the Counsel of God, and the Army and force of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> used now the
remedy which one calls, <hi>A woful, shameful, and unfortunate shift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this secret subterranean Vault, <hi>Zedechias</hi> stole away, and by the help of
the dark night, recovered the plains, or desarts of <hi>Iericho.</hi> But by reason of the
train that followed him and his, (every one leading with him those whom he
loved best) he was easily traced and pursued. How great soever the company
was that attended him, yet certain it is, that they, on whose fidelity he most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied,
no sooner beheld the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to draw near, but they all abandoned his
defence, and shifted for themselves in the Desarts, as they could. For, <hi>whom
God had forsaken, no man regarded.</hi> And thus <hi>Zedechias</hi> was taken by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Gods vengeance, and being made a Prisoner, together with his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and Princes, he was carried to <hi>Riblah,</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Nephthalim,</hi> where
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> then lay, as a place indifferent between <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi>
with both which places he had at one time to do.</p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had laid before <hi>Zedechias</hi> the many Graces and
Favours which he had conferred upon him,<note place="margin">And carried to <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </note> together with the notable falshood
and perjury wherewith he had requited him,<note place="margin">Jer. 34. 3, &amp;c, 2 King. 25. 4, 7.</note> he commanded his Children,
Princes,<note place="margin">Jer. 39. 4, 7. and 52. 7, 11.</note> and Friends, to be slain before his face. This being done, to the end
that so lamentable a spectacle should be the last that ever he should behold in
this world, he caused his eyes to be put out, and so carried him like a Slave to
<hi>Babylon,</hi> where he consumed the rest of his life in perpetual imprisonment.
Herein was that marvellous Prophesie of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> fulfilled: <hi>I will bring him to</hi>
Babylon, <hi>and he shall not see it,</hi> Ezek. 12. 13.</p>
            <p>Thus, in the eleventh, and last year of <hi>Zedechias,</hi> which was the eighteenth
of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> entred into <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by force, where, spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
neither Sex nor Age, they put all to the Sword that they found therein.</p>
            <p>In the next year following,<note place="margin">2 King. 25. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Nebuzaradan,</hi> the General of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
burnt the <hi>Kings</hi> Palace,<note place="margin">Jer. 52. 13. with 39. 8.</note> and the whole City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and after the fire
had lasted from the seventh to the tenth day,<note place="margin">The Temple and City burnt.</note> he also burnt the Temple of God
to the ground, the richest and most Magnificent place that ever the Sun saw,
when it had stood four hundred thirty and one years.</p>
            <p>After this,<note place="margin">2 King. 25. 18.</note> upon a second search, <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> (not yet satiated with blood)
commanded seventy and two others to be slain,<note place="margin">Jer. 39. 8, 9. and 52. 14, 23.</note> which had hidden themselves
from the first fury,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 18, &amp;c.</note> to wit, the chief and the second Priest, two Commanders
of <hi>Zedechias</hi> his men of war,<note place="margin">Poor people left under <hi>Gedaliah,</hi>
               </note> five of his houshould Servants, and some others;
carrying away to <hi>Babylon</hi> the ablest of the People through all <hi>Iudaea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 39. 10.</note> and leaving
the poorest labouring people,<note place="margin">Jer. 40. 16.</note> with some that followed the party of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
to till the Ground, over whom he placed <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> the Nephew of that
<hi>Saphan,</hi> whom <hi>Iosias</hi> had formerly imployed in the Reformation of Religion.
This <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> a <hi>Iew</hi> by Nation, left <hi>Zedechias,</hi> as it seemeth, in the beginning
of the War, and by <hi>Ieremies</hi> desire to live with him, it's probable that had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the same advice which the Prophet gave to <hi>Zedechias,</hi> which was, to
submit himself to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> King, who being ordained of God for them, as
an instrument of his Justice, was, therefore irresistable.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> being left to his own choice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jeremy</hi> goes to them.</note> to live where he pleased,
made choice to go to <hi>Gedaliah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 40. 6.</note> to whom he was commended by <hi>Nebuzaradan,</hi>
and he, not only entertained him kindly, but comforted him, and all the other
<hi>Iews</hi> that were left under his charge, promising them favour and liberty, so long
as they remained obedient Subjects to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> by whom he was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Provincial Governour over his own Nation.</p>
            <p>But e're the year was expired, a Prince of the late Kings Family (who, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

done, they escaped, and in their way, encountring with eighty persons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
toward <hi>Gedaliah</hi> with presents, they slew most of them, and onely spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some, who promised to discover to them some Treasures that were hidden
in the Fields during the War. They took with them also a Daughter of <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias,</hi>
committed to the care of <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> This treachery
of <hi>Ismael</hi> had been formerly discovered to <hi>Gedaliah</hi> by <hi>Iohanan,</hi> one of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the few remaining <hi>Iews,</hi> but he would not believe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iudea</hi> being now without a Governour (for <hi>Ismael</hi> durst not take it upon
him, but fled as fast as he could to the <hi>Ammonites</hi>) the residue of the <hi>Iews,</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the revenge of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> resolved to fly into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and besought <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
to ask counsel of God for them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel rejected.</note> who returned answer, that if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in <hi>Iudea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 43.</note> God would provide for them, and shew them mercy; but if
they sought to save themselves in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they should then undoubtedly perish.
Notwithstanding which advice, the <hi>Iews</hi> held their determination, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
the Oracle of God; and constraining <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> to accompany
them,<note place="margin">He is carried into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and stoned.</note> they went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by the permission of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> they dwelt in
<hi>Taphnes;</hi> where, when <hi>Ieremy</hi> often reproved them for their Idolatry, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
the destruction of themselves, and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he was, by these his
own hard-hearted and ingrateful Country-men, stoned to death, and by the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> who greatly reverenced him, buried near the Sepulchre of their
Kings, <hi>Ier.</hi> 42. and 43.</p>
            <p>The nineteenth year of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Reign it was, when destroying ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
the great and mighty City of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he exceedingly enriched himself
with the spoils of it and the Temple, and by that dreadful Example terrified
all those that should dare to resist him. From that time forward, he, to his
three and twentieth year,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> conquers divers Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> laboured in the Conquest of those adjoyning Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
which God had exposed unto his Sword, and commanded to wear his
Yoke, namely, the <hi>Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, Tyrians, Sidonians,</hi> and
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> though some of these were already become his followers, and served
under him when <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was taken and burnt. But the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> whose
City was built upon an Island, and therefore secure from the invasion of any
Land-Army, and whose Fleet was so strong, that they needed not to fear any
enemy at Sea, were neither daunted with the fall of their neighbour City, nor
with the obstinate resolution of this mighty King, imploying all his wit and
power to work their subversion.</p>
            <p>That the City of <hi>Tyre</hi> was rather well-pleased, than any way discouraged
with the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it appeareth by the Words which <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
condemneth, as the common voice of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> Ezek. 26. 2. <hi>Aha! the Gate of the
People is broken, it is turned unto me; For seeing she is desolate, I shall be replenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Yet at length, that great work before mentioned, began to appear above
Water, and so to threaten them with inevitable mischief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> still follows his work hard, notwithstanding all discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and in the thirteenth year of the Siege, and the nineteenth of his Reign,
he had brought it to such perfection, that now the Citizens despaired of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out against him; whereupon all the chiefest of them imbarked themselves,
their Families,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tyre</hi> is taken.</note> and Treasures in their Fleet, and escaped to the Isle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
but the poorer sort were left to the fury of the enemy; who being inraged for
being put to so much pains, slew with the Sword, not only such people of <hi>Type</hi>
as dwelt on the Continent (who are called her <hi>Daughters in the Field</hi>) but the
like execution was done in the streets, into which, with excessive labour, the
<hi>Chaldeans</hi> made way for his Horses and Chariots. <hi>Thus Nebuchadnezzar made
his Army serve a great service, against</hi> Tyrus, <hi>wherein every head was made bald,
and every shoulder was made bare, yet had he no wages, nor his Army,</hi> Ezek. 20. 18.
but was fain to rest contented with the Honour of having destroyed that City,
which in all mens Judgments had been held invincible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103996:7"/>
The destruction of these two Great, and powerful Cities, having made the
name of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> dreadful in the ears of all the Nations round about,
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> used this advantage of that reputation which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by his victories already gotten, to the getting of more, and more
profitable, with less pains. The Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> was the mark which
he chiefly aimed at. A Country so abounding in Riches and pleasures,
that it might well have tempted any Prince, finding himself strong enough
to pick occasion of quarrel against it. Besides, it was so far an enemy to
the Crown of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that, had it been far poorer, yet it must have been
subdued, or the Conquest of <hi>Syria</hi> could not have been secured.</p>
            <p>Yet was it needful, that before he entred upon this business, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
adjacent should be reduced into such tearms, that either they should
wholly stand at his devotion, or at least, be able not to work him any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure.
And herein the Decree of God concurred (as in all prosperous
enterprises) with reason of State. For the people of <hi>Moab, Ammon, Edom,
Damascus, Kedar, Hazor,</hi> and other adjoyning Regions, whom God for their
sins had condemned to fall under the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Yoke, were such, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
only their own gain, had, some of them, like Ravens, followed
the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Army, to feed upon the carcasses that fell by the cruelty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Others taking advantage of their Neighbours miseries, occupied the
Countries, which, by his Victories, belonged to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> all of
them thinking, that when the <hi>Babylonian</hi> had satisfied his fury, he would be
forced to forsake those desolated Countries, and leave the possession of them
to those who could first seize upon them.<note place="margin">The <hi>Jews</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> Particularly, the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and
<hi>Philistines,</hi> had shewed much malice against the <hi>Iews</hi> when their City was
taken, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25. 12, 15. Whether they had done any good service to the
<hi>Chaldeans,</hi> it appears not; if they did any, its like to have been in reference
to their own advantage, wherein yet they were deceived. The <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
were not contented to rejoyce only at the fall of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
they entred upon the Country of <hi>God,</hi> and took possession of it, as
if, not the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> but they had subdued <hi>Israel, Ezek. 25. 3. Jer.</hi> 49. 1.
Neither can it be imagined what other design <hi>Baalis,</hi> King of the <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
had, when he sent <hi>Ismael,</hi> a Prince of the Blood of <hi>Judah,</hi> to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Gedalia,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Babel</hi> had made Governour over those that
remained in <hi>Israel,</hi> and to carry Captive into the <hi>Ammonites</hi> Country, the
People that abode in <hi>Mizpah,</hi> than a desire of entangling <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
with so many labours at once, as should force him to retire into his
own Country, and abandon those wasted Lands, to himself, and others,
for whom they lay conveniently. Such, or the like Policy, the <hi>Moabites</hi>
also did exercise, whose Pride, and Wrath were made frustrate by God, and
their dissimulation condemned, as not doing aright, <hi>Ver.</hi> 40. 14. &amp; 41. 2. &amp;
10. &amp; 28, 27, &amp;c,</p>
            <p>All these Nations had the Art of ravening,<note place="margin">They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar.</hi>
               </note> which is familiar to such as
either live in, or that border upon Desarts; and now the time ministred
occasion to them to shew the uttermost cunning of their Thievish wits.
But <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> made void all their devices by sharp, and sudden War
upon them, overwhelming them with unexpected ruin, as it were in one
night,<note place="margin">Isa. 16. 14.</note> according to the Prophesies of <hi>Isay, Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who all
foretold, with little difference of Words, the greatness and swiftness of the
misery that should come upon them. It appears not with which of them
he first began; but it seems that <hi>Moab</hi> was the last that felt his heavy
hand: For so many interpret that Prophesie of <hi>Isay,</hi> threatning <hi>Moab</hi> with
destruction after three years, as having reference to the third year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> the next year after it, being spent in the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> expedition. This is evident that all the principal Towns in these
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103996:8"/>
Countries were burnt, and the people either slain, or made captives, few
excepted, who saved themselves by flight, and had not the courage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their habitations too hastily, much less to attempt any thing against
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> but lived as miserable out-laws, until the end of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
years which God had appointed for the desolation of their Countries,
as well as of the Land of <hi>Judaea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When by a long course of Victory <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had brought into Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
all the Nations of <hi>Syria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Egypt</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar.</hi>
               </note> and the bordering <hi>Arabians</hi> in such wise, as
that no enemy to himself, or Friend to the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> was left at his back, that
might either impede his proceedings, or take advantage of any misfortune
that might befall him; then did he forthwith apply himself to the Conquest
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon which those other Nations had formerly been dependants.
Of this expedition, and the Victorious issue thereof, the three great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>Isay, Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> have written so plainly, that its altogether
needless to seek after any other authority to confirm the same. Long before
it was prophesied by <hi>Isay,</hi> that the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> should lead away
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Prisoners, and the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> Captives, young, and old, naked and
barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of <hi>Egypt, Isa.</hi> 20. 4.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> as their Prophesies were neerer to the time of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
so they handled this Argument more plainly, and precisely. For <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sekiel</hi>
tells us cleerly, that <hi>Egypt</hi> should be given to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> as wages
for his great service which he had done against <hi>Tyre, Ezek.</hi> 29. 18, 19, 20.
He recounteth also in particular all the chief Cities in <hi>Egypt,</hi> saying, that
these by name should be destroyed, and go into Captivity: yea, and that
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all his Army should be slain by the Sword, <hi>Ezek. 30. 4, 10, &amp;c.
Chap. 32. 2, &amp;c.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> saith thus, <hi>Behold I will visit the
common people of</hi> Noe, <hi>and</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>and</hi> Egypt, <hi>with their Gods, and their
Kings, even</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and all that trust in him; and I will deliver them
into the hands of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of</hi> Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar
<hi>King òf</hi> Babel, <hi>and into the hands of his Servants,</hi> Jerem. 46.
25, 26. <hi>Josephus</hi> accordingly saith, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in three and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
year of his Raign,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Egypt</hi> conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and in the fifteenth year after the destruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
did Conquer <hi>Egypt,</hi> and kill the King thereof, appointing a Vice-Roy
to Govern it. And it is evident that his Victories which followed his
Conquest of <hi>Syria,</hi> were such as did more enlarge his Dominions, than all
his former Wars had done. For <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in his Thirtieth Chapter reckoneth
up (besides the whole Country of <hi>Egypt) Phut,</hi> and <hi>Lud,</hi> with other Nations
that may seem to have reached as far as into <hi>Mauritania,</hi> which were conquered
by him, and added to his Empire, And truly it is worth observation how
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> was infatuated by God, who thought himself most
safe in his own Country by reason of the well-defenced situation thereof,
and therefore very unwisely suffered his enemies to make a cleer way to his
own doors by the Conquest of all his Friends, and Allyes in <hi>Syria.</hi> For as
the labour of this business did more harden than weary the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Army, so
the confidence,<note place="margin">Carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and vain security of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> relying upon the difficulty
of the passages which the enemy was to make through the <hi>Arabian</hi> Desarts,
and the great advantage which the River <hi>Nilus</hi> afforded, did little avail them,
when the War came on; Yea, it did much astonish them (as may justly be
thought) in the time of execution. <hi>It being usually seen, that the hearts of
men fail, when those helps deceive them, in which they had reposed more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
than in their own Virtue, and Valour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Until this time, the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> had flourished under the Rule and
Government of the <hi>Pharaohs</hi> for above the space of one thousand, four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and eighty years. But from this time forward, it remained forty years
without a King under the subjection of the <hi>Babylonians;</hi> and then at lenghth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103996:8"/>
it began to recover by little and little the former greatness: Yet so,
that it was never dreadful unto others as it had been, God having said of that
people;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Egypt</hi> never recovered its strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</note> 
               <hi>At the end of forty years I will gather the</hi> Egyptians <hi>from the People
whither they were scattered; and I will bring again the Captivity of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and
will cause them to return into the Land of</hi> Pathros, <hi>into the land of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
and they shall be yet a base Kingdom. It shall be the basest of the
Kingdoms, neither shall it exalt it self any more above the Nations; For I will
diminish them that they shall no more rule over the Nations, and it shall be no
more the confidence of the House of</hi> Israel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29. 13, 14, 15, 16. For
whereas it had been said of <hi>Pharaoh, I am the Son of the wise, the Son of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Kings,</hi> Isa. 19. 11. and whereas they had Vaunted, <hi>the River is mine,
and I have made it,</hi> Ezek. 29. 9. <hi>The Princes of</hi> Egypt, <hi>now became fools,
the River failed them, the King himself was now taken and slain, and that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Linage was quite extinguished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of any Wars made by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> after such time as he returned from
the Conquest of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ninive</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. See before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> we read not, except that against <hi>Ninive,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
whereof was foretold by the Prophet. <hi>Ninive</hi> indeed had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
long before by <hi>Merodoch,</hi> and together with the rest of <hi>Assyria,</hi> made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> as <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> and <hi>Zedechias,</hi> Tributary Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> had
done, was made partaker also of the same ruin. That the destruction of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive</hi>
followed the Conquest of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is clear by the comparison which <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum</hi>
the Prophet made between this City that was to fall, and the City of
<hi>Noe</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> which was fallen already; <hi>Nabum</hi> 3. 8, &amp;c. <hi>Art thou better than
populous</hi> Noe, <hi>that was situate amongst the Rivers, that had the waters round
about it; whose Rampire was the Sea, and her wall was from the Sea,</hi>
Ethiopia, <hi>and</hi> Egypt <hi>were her strength, and it was infinite:</hi> Put, <hi>and</hi>
Lubin <hi>were her helpers. Yet was she carried away, she went into Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
Her young Children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the
streets, and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound
in chains. Thou also shalt be drunken; thou shalt be hid; thou also shalt seek
strength because of the enemy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Great Monarch, having thus spent his younger days in inlarging his
Dominions, he betook himself to rest, that he might reap the fruit of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
labours; and the first thing that he applied himself to, was to beautifie
his Imperial City of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Babylon</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</note> adding a new City to the Old, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
about with three Walls, and made in them stately Gates. And neer
the former Palace he built a New one, more stately than it, wherein he raised
stone-works, like unto Mountains, which he planted with all manner of
Trees.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pensile</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</note> He made also <hi>Pensile</hi> Gardeus (one of the Worlds wonders) born
upon Arches, foursquare, each square being four hundred Foot long, filled
above with Earth, whereon grew all sorts of Trees, and Plants. The Arches
were built one above another in a convenient-heigth, still increasing as they
ascended. The highest, which did bear the walls on the top, were fifty Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
high, so that they equalized the highest Mountains. He made also <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaeducts</hi>
for the watering of this Garden, which seemed to hang in the air.
This most sumptuous frame, which out-lasted all the remainder of the <hi>Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and all the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, is said to have been reared and finished in fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Days.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> Golden Image.</note> He erected also an image of Gold in the Plain of <hi>Dura,</hi> sixty Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits high, and six broad, commanding all his Servants, and Subjects to fall
down and Worship it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 1, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But of all this, and other his Magnificence, we find little else recorded,
save that which indeed is most profitable for us to consider, to wit, his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valewing
of his own greatness, which abased him to a condition inferior to
the poorest of men. For whereas God had honoured him, not only with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103996:9"/>
great, and glorious Victories, and much happiness in his own life; but
with a rare discovery of things that were to come after him; yea, and had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
the certainty of his Dreams, by the miraculous reducing of it into
his Memory,<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 31, &amp;c.</note> and given him the interpretation thereof by the Prophet <hi>Daniel:</hi>
He notwithstanding became so forgetful of God, whose wonderful power he
had seen,<note place="margin">His Pride.</note> and acknowledged, that he caused that Golden Image to be set up,
and Worshipped, appointing a cruel Death for them that should dare to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
him, which was utterly unlawful, and repugnant to the Law of him
that is King of Kings; And thus he who so lately had Worshipped <hi>Daniel,</hi>
the servant of God, as if he had been God himself: now commanded a Statue
to be erected unto himself, wherein himself might be worshipped as God:
From this impiety it pleased God to recall and reclaim him, by the wonderful
and miraculous delivery of those three blessed Saints,<note place="margin">A Miracle. Dan. 3. 26. &amp;c.</note> out of the fiery Furnace,
who being thrown bound into the midst of it, for refusing to commit that
abominable Idolatry, were preserved from all hurt of the fire, loosened from
their Bonds, accompanied by an Angel, and at last called out by the King, and
restored to their former honour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> being amazed at the Miracle,<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 29. He makes a Decree to Gods Honour.</note> made a Decree tending to
the honour of God, whom by the erection of his Image, he had dishonoured.
Yet was not this devotion so rooted in him, that it could bring forth fruit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to his hasty zeal: Therefore was he fore-warned of God in a Dream,
of a terrible Judgement which hung over his Head,<note place="margin">His Dream interpreted.</note> which <hi>Daniel</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
withall counselled him <hi>to break off his sin by righteousness, and his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by shewing mercy to the poor, that there might be a lengthening of his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,</hi>
Dan. 4. 27. Whence it seems, that injustice and cruelty were his
faults, for which he was thus threatned: But neither did the Dream, nor
advice of <hi>Daniel</hi> so prevail. For probably he believed it not, but looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as an idle Dream; for that it seemed altogether unlikely that so great a
Monarch should be driven from amongst men,<note place="margin">He dwells with the Beasts.</note> yea, compelled to dwell with
the Beasts of the Field, and made to eat Grass as the Oxen, this was altogether
incredible in mans Judgment, and therefore giving so little heed to it, its no
marvel that he had forgotten it by the years end.</p>
            <p>One whole year was given to this haughty Prince wherein to repent, which
respiting of the execution, may seem to have bred in him forgetfulness of
Gods sentence. For at the end of twelve months, as he was walking in his
Royal Palace in <hi>Babel,</hi> he was so overjoyed, and transported with a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of his own seeming happiness, that without all fear of Gods heavy
Judgment pronounced against him, he uttered these proud words: <hi>Is not
this great</hi> Babylon <hi>that I have built for the House of the Kingdom, by the might of
my power, and for the Honour of my Majesty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But his proud speeches were not fully ended, when a voice from Heaven
told him, that his <hi>Kingdom was departed from him, &amp;c.</hi> And the same hour
the thing was fulfilled upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> And <hi>he was driven from men,
and did eat grass as Oxen, and his Body was wet with the dew of Heaven, till his
hair was grown like Eagles Feathers, and his nails like Birds Claws,</hi> Dan. 4.
33, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This his punishment was singular,<note place="margin">His Bodily shape not changed.</note> and unexpected. For he ran amongst
Beasts in the Fields and Woods, where, for seven years he lived, not only as
a salvage man, but as a salvage Beast: for a Beast he thought himself to be,
and therefore fed himself in the same manner, and with the same food that
Beasts do. Not that he was changed in his external shape from a man to a
Beast. For as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> well expounds it, when he saith, <hi>vers.</hi> 34. that his
<hi>understanding was restored unto him,</hi> he shewed, that he had not lost his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
shape, but his understanding, being stricken with a Frenzy, or deep Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
which made him think himself a Beast.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:103996:9"/>

               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was restored both to his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and to his Kingdom: and (saith he) <hi>I blessed the most High,
and I praised, and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose Dominion is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Dominion, and his Kingdom is from Generation to Generation; And all the
Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing, and he doth according to his Will
in the Army of Heaven, and amongst the Inhabitants of the Earth: and none can
stay his hand, or say unto him, What dost thou? At the same time my reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto me; and for the Glory of my Kingdom, mine honour, and brightness
returned unto me, and my Counsellors, and my Lords sought unto me, and I was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in my Kingdom, and excellent Majesty was added unto me. Now therefore
I</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>praise, and extoll, and honour the King of Heaven, all whose
works are truth, and his way is Judgement, and those that walk in Pride he is able
to abase,</hi> Dan. 4. 34, 35, 36, 37.</p>
            <p>How long he lived after this is uncertain, but all agree that he reigned
about twenty months co-partner with his Father in the Kingdom, and about
three and forty years by himself alone.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> reged in <hi>Judaea,</hi>

with whom he lived till he was twelve years old, and

            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Media</hi> he served <hi>Astyages,</hi> first, as one of his Halberdiers, and then as one
of his Armour-bearers, till he was called home into <hi>Persia</hi> by his Father <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses,</hi>
when as yet he had one year to spend at School; and when he had
spent seventeen years at School amongst Boyes, he spent ten years more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
youths.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Cyrus</hi> was now almost sixteen years old,<note place="margin">His first Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in War.</note> 
               <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> the King of
<hi>Assyria,</hi> being about to marry a Wife called <hi>Nicotris,</hi> made an in-rode, with
a great Army of Horse and Foot, into the borders of <hi>Media,</hi> there to take his
pleasure in hunting, and harrassing of the Countrey: against whom, <hi>Astyages,</hi>
and <hi>Cyaxares</hi> his Son, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Grand-child, who then first began to bear
Arms, being but about fifteen or sixteen years old, marched out, met with
him, and in a great Battel overthrew him, and drave him out of his borders.
Indeed the Death of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the Father of <hi>Evilmerodach,</hi> gave cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to those that had found him a troublesome Neighbour, to stand upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103996:10"/>
prouder terms with the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> than in his flourishing estate they durst
have used.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Evilmerodach,</hi> being too proud to digest this loss which he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the <hi>Medes,</hi> and their Allies, the <hi>Persians</hi> under <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he drew unto
his party the <hi>Lydians,</hi> and all the people of the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> with great gifts and
strong perswasions, hoping by their assistance to overwhelm his enemies with
a strong invasion, whom in vain he had sought to weary out by a lingring
War.</p>
            <p>The issue of these great preparations made by <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> against the
<hi>Medes,</hi> was such as opened the way to the fulfilling divers <hi>Prophesies</hi> which
were many years before uttered against <hi>Babel,</hi> by <hi>Isay</hi> and <hi>Jeremy.</hi> For the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi>
and their Confederates, who, trusting in their numbers, thought to
have buried the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> under their thick showers of Arrows
and Darts, were encountred with an Army of stout and well trained men,
weightily Armed for close fight, by whom they were beaten in a great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
wherein <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> was slain.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Evilmerodach</hi> is slain.</note> After which, that great Empire that
was raised and upheld by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> was grievously shaken and enfeibled
under his unprosperous Son, and left to be sustained by his Grand-child <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar:</hi>
a man more like to have overthrown it when it was greatest and
strongest, than to repair it when it was in a way of falling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Xenophon</hi> relates the matter thus, When the <hi>Babylonian</hi> had enlarged his
Empire with many Victories, and was become Lord of all <hi>Syria,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Countreys, he began to hope, that if the <hi>Medes</hi> could be brought
under his Subjection, there would not then be left any Nation adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to make head against him.<note place="margin">The strength of <hi>Media.</hi>
               </note> For the King of the <hi>Medes</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bring into the Field sixty thousand Foot, and ten thousand Horse,
to which the Forces of <hi>Persia</hi> being joyned, made an exceeding great
Army.</p>
            <p>Considering therefore the strength of such a neighbour, he invited <hi>Croesus,</hi>
King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> a Prince very mighty both in men and Treasure, and with him
other Lords of <hi>Asia</hi> the less, to his assistance, alledging that those Eastern
Nations were very powerfull, and so firmly conjoyned by League, and many
Alliances, that it would not be easie, no nor possible, for any one Nation to
resist them.</p>
            <p>With these suggestions, backed with rich Presents, he drew to himself so
many adherents, as he compounded an Army of two hundred Thousand Foot,
and sixty thousand Horse: Of which ten thousand Horse, and forty thousand
Foot were brought by <hi>Croesus,</hi> who had great cause of enmity against the
<hi>Medes,</hi> for that they had made great Wars against his Father <hi>Allyattes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> made General of the Army.</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

him; and when he came thither, he was also made by his Uncle <hi>Cyaxares,</hi>
who had sent for him, General of the <hi>Median</hi> Forces, and the management of
the War against the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> was wholly committed to him: With this
Army he marched against <hi>Evilmerodach,</hi> and his associates, and in a very bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Battel,<note place="margin">He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the <hi>Babylonians.</hi>

at <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Fame and Prosperity; doubting also that his great Victories
might in the end grow perillous to himself, he consulted with the Oracle of

if by them he should be beaten and subdued, so great would his loss appear of
all things, which the world makes account of, that the same could neither be

whilst he attempted both by power and policy to take and Conquer, <hi>Cyrus</hi>

were inferior to other, either in strength or opinion. For out of doubt,
<hi>Croesus,</hi> as he excelled any Prince of that age in Riches and ability,
so was he not inferiour unto any in Territories and Fame, that then lived.
<hi>But Kingdoms and Commonwealths have their increase, and Periods from Divine

Subjects, and had undergone the same lot with the rest of the vanquished
persons, had not a Son of his, who had been dumb all his Life before (by the
extremity of Passion and Fear) cryed out to a common Souldier,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Croesus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</note> who was
with a drawn Sword pursuing his Father, that he should not kill <hi>Croesus.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he was taken and imprisoned, and despoiled of all things, but only the

            <p>Shortly after he was bound with Fetters, and Placed upon a large and high
pile of Wood,<note place="margin">He should have been burr, but is saved.</note> to be burnt to ashes thereon. To which, when Fire was set,
and kindled, <hi>Croesus</hi> remembring the discourse which long before he had with
<hi>Solon,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Lawgiver, he thrice cryed out, <hi>O Solon, Solon, Solon,</hi>
and being demanded what he meant by the invocation of <hi>Solon,</hi> he at first used
silence: But being urged again, he told them that now he found that true,
which wise <hi>Solon</hi> had long since told him; <hi>That many men in the race and course
of their lives might well be accounted Fortunate, but no man could discern himself
to be happy indeed till his end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this his answer, <hi>Cyrus</hi> being speedily informed, and thereby being put
in mind of the mutability of Fortune, and of his own mortality, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Ministers of Justice, speedily to withdraw the Fire, and to save <hi>Croesus,</hi>
and bring him to his presence; which being done, <hi>Cyrus</hi> demanded of him,
who it was that had perswaded him? or what reason had instigated him to
invade his Territories, and to make him, of a Friend, an Enemy. To which
<hi>Croesus</hi> thus answered: <hi>It was thy prosperous, and my unprosperous destiny (the</hi>
Grecian <hi>Gods with all, flattering my Ambition) that were the inventers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducters
of</hi> Croesus <hi>War against</hi> Cyrus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> being much affected with this answer of <hi>Croesus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> Maks him his friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

estate, though he was victorious over him, did not only spare his life, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained

it. But <hi>Xenophon</hi> saith, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> did entertain <hi>Craesus</hi> friendly at the

and this may seem the more probable, because <hi>Crasus</hi> was his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers

<hi>Cyrus</hi> (if he had been vicious, which he was not) from so cruel a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
as to have burnt him alive.</p>

                  </hi> Scythia.</note> he
left <hi>Croesus</hi> to be a companion, and counseller to his Son <hi>Cambyses,</hi> whom he
made Governour over his Empire in his absence, with whom he lived all the
Reign of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and did afterwards accompany <hi>Cambyses</hi> in his Expedition
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he hardly escaped his Tyrannous hands. At this time the
Races of three of the greatest Kings in that part of the World came to an end;
to wit, of the <hi>Babylonians, Medians,</hi> and <hi>Lydians,</hi> in <hi>Balthasar, Xiaxares,</hi> or
<hi>Darius Medus,</hi> and <hi>Croesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>Lydian</hi> War ensued the great Conquest of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which gave
unto <hi>Cyrus</hi> an Empire so large, and mighty, that he was justly reputed the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103996:12"/>
greatest Monarch then living upon the Earth. How long time the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for this great action took up, is uncertain, only it seems that ten whole
years did pass between his taking of those two Cities of <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Babylon;</hi>
which time was not wholly spent in providing for the <hi>Assyrian</hi> War, but
much of it in setling the Estates which he had already purchased; <hi>Ctesias</hi> also
tells us, that during this time <hi>Cyrus</hi> invaded <hi>Scythia,</hi> and being victorious
over that Nation, he took <hi>Amorges</hi> their King Prisoner; But being in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Battel overthrown by <hi>Sparetha,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Amorges,</hi> himself was taken
Prisoner, and so one King was released for the other. <hi>Gobrias</hi> about this time
(a Nobleman,<note place="margin">His danger.</note> whose only Son, the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in his Fathers life time,
had in a hunting match, villainously slain) together with his Friends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
to <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its very probable also, that no small part of those troubles which sprang up
in the lower <hi>Asia,</hi> grew soon after <hi>Cyrus</hi> his departure with his Victorious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
before the Conquest was fully established. For after <hi>Cyrus</hi> was returned
out of <hi>Asia</hi> the less, many Nations which were formerly conquered by <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
and now by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> revolted from him; Against whom he imployed
<hi>Pactias,</hi> and then <hi>Harpagus,</hi> who first reduced the <hi>Phocians</hi> under their former
Obedience; and then the rest of the <hi>Greeks</hi> that inhabited <hi>Asia</hi> the less, as
the <hi>Jonians, Carians, Aeolians,</hi> and <hi>Lycians,</hi> who, very resolutely (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the strength they had) defended themselves; But in the attempt upon
<hi>Babylon</hi> it self, its not to be questioned but <hi>Cyrus</hi> imployed all his Forces, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
taken order beforehand, that nothing should be able to divert him, or
to raise that Siege, or to frustrate that work upon which he did set all his
rest.</p>
            <p>And great reason there was,<note place="margin">The strength of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </note> that he should improve all his Policy and
strength unto the taking of that City, which, besides the Fame and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
that it held, as being the Head of an Empire, which depended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
was so strongly fortified with a trebble Wall of great heigth, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with the waters of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that were unfordable, and so plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Victualled for many years, that the Inhabitants were not only free from
fear, and doubt of their estate, but through their confidence, they derided,
and despised all the Projects and power of their Besiegers.</p>
            <p>For not long before,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Babylon</hi> forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Nicotris,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> a witty, and
active Woman, foreseeing the storm that was ready to fall upon <hi>Babylon</hi> from
the <hi>Medes,</hi> to hinder their passing the River by Boats into <hi>Babylon,</hi> She turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which before ran with a strait and swift course, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it through many winding Channels, which she had cut for that purpose,
whereby she made it to run more slowly than formerly it did: and then she
raised a huge Dam upon each side of the River; and up the River from the
City-ward, she digged a vast Pond, which was every way three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Furlongs wide, into which she turned the River, thereby leaving the
old Channel of the River dry; which done, she fell to work, and fenced the
Banke within the City with Brick-walls, and raised the Water-Gates, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
in every point to the rest of the Walls, which were made on the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side of the Channel, round about the City. She built also a stately, and
Magnificent Bridge of Stone in the midst of the City, which joyned to the
Kings Houses, that stood on each side the River: and having finished all her
Works, and Fortifications, she turned the River out of the Pond into its right
Channel again.</p>
            <p>And now came <hi>Cyrus</hi> to invade the Country of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> lnvades <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </note> and appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Walls of the City, and there challenged the King to a Duel, or single
Combat, but he refused it. At this time <hi>Gadatas,</hi> a Noble man of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
whom <hi>Belshazzar</hi> had gelt, upon a jealousie that he had of him with his Wife,
fell over to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in revenge whereof the <hi>Babylonians</hi> sallied out, and fell upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103996:12"/>
his Lands; but <hi>Cyrus</hi> set upon them, and routed them; At which time the
<hi>Cadusii,</hi> whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> had appointed to bring up the rear of his Army, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> set upon a Country lying neer to the City; but the King of
<hi>Babylon</hi> falling out upon them, cut them all off. Yet <hi>Cyrus</hi> quickly revenged
the Death of his men; and then came to an agreement with <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> to
hold truce with the Plough-men on both sides, and the War to go on between
the Souldiers only. After which, passing beyond the City, he took in three
of their Forts, and so returned into the confines of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and <hi>Media;</hi> and
thither, upon his invitation, came his Uncle <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> and was by him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
received, and entertained in a Pavilion, that had been the King of
<hi>Assyrias:</hi> and Winter now approaching, they entred into consultation to
provide things necessary to maintain the Siege.</p>
            <p>The only hope of <hi>Cyrus</hi> with his <hi>Medes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> besieges it.</note> and <hi>Persians</hi> (who despaired of
carrying by assault a City so well, and strongly fortified, and manned) was
in cutting off all supplies of victuals, and other necessaries; Whereof, though
the Town was said to be stored sufficiently for more than twenty years, yet
might it well be imagined, that amongst such a World of People as dwelt
within those Walls, one great want or other would soon appear amongst
them, and vanquish the resolution of that unwarlike multitude. Yet in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
that success of this course, the Besiegers were likely to endure much
hardship, and travel, and that all in valn, if they did not keep strict watch,
and sure guards upon all the Avenues, and Quarters of it.</p>
            <p>Which that he might the better do, he caused presently a vast trench, both
for bredth and depth to be cast round about the Walls of the City, casting the
earth ever towards his own Army, and made store of Bulworks all along up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, for his Guards to be upon: and then, dividing his whole Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
twelve parts, he ordered that each of them should watch his Moneth,
by turn.</p>
            <p>And yet this was a very hard work,<note place="margin">The <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> vain Hopes.</note> considering the vast circuit of those
Walls which they were to gird in, having neither men enough, nor yet suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
assured to their Commander; the consideration whereof Ministred
unto the <hi>Babylonians</hi> matter of good Pastime, when they saw <hi>Lydians, Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,
Cappadocians,</hi> and others, quartered about their City to keep them in,
who, having been their Ancient Friends, and Allies, were more like to joyn
with them, if occasion were offered, than to use much diligence on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who had, as it were but yesterday; laid upon their necks the
galling Yoke of servitude.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Besieged were thus pleasing themselves with this foolish-fansie,
and vain mirth (the ordinary forerunners of sudden calamity) <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who by
God that set him on work,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyru's</hi> strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem.</note> was made strong, valiant, constant, and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
devised, and by the labour of his men, digged so many Channels as
were capable of receiving the Waters of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and so to draw the same
from the Walls of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that thereby he might make his approaches the
more facile, and assured, which, when by the labour of many hands he had
performed, he waited for a fit time wherein to put in execution, what he had
designed. For he had left in each of the Trenches towards the River, certain
Banks, or Heads uncut till he saw his opportunity.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Belshazzar</hi> finding neither any want or weakness within the City,<note place="margin">

any possibility for his enemies without, to approach the Walls by reason of
the great River that surrounded them, he prepared an exceeding sumptuous
Feast, Publick Plays, and other Pastimes, and thereto invited a Thousand
of his Princes, or Nobles, besides his Wives, Courtezans, and others of
that Trade. This he did, either to let the Besiegers know that his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
were sufficient, not only for all needful uses, but even for superfluity,
and excess; Or because he hoped that his enemies by this time were discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103996:13"/>
and even broken under their manifold disasters: Or else he made this
Feast in honour of <hi>Bell,</hi> his most adored Idol: Or lastly, because it was his Birth,
or Coronation Day: Or for many, or most of these respects.</p>
            <p>Yea, he was not contented to use, and shew such Magnificence, as no
Prince else could Equal, but he lifted up himself against the God of Heaven,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 23. For he, his Princes, his Wives, and his Concubines, made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousing
Cups of the Golden, and Silver Vessels which his Grandfather <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>
had taken out of the Temple which was at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and in
contempt of the Lord of Heaven,<note place="margin">His Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> he praised his own Puppets made
of Gold, and Silver, and Brass, and Iron, and Wood, and Stone; Whilst
<hi>Belshazzar</hi> was thus triumphing, and had his brains well filled with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
he beheld a hand,<note place="margin">The Writing on the Wall.</note> which by Divine power wrote upon the Wall
that was opposite to him, certain Words which he understood not,
wherewith, so great a fear, and amazement seized upon him, that
the joynts of his loins were loosed,<note place="margin">The Kings Distraction.</note> and his knees smote one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Which Passion when he had in some measure recovered, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
aloud to bring in the Astrologers, the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and the Southsayers,
promising them great rewards, and the third place of Honour in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to him that could read, and expound the Writing: But it exceeded
their Art, and Skill.</p>
            <p>In this disturbance and astonishment the Queen,<note place="margin">The Queen comforts him.</note> hearing what had
passed, came in, and observing what distraction the King was in, after
Reverence done, She used this Speech; <hi>O King live for ever; Let not thy
thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed; there is a man in thy
Kingdom in whom is the Spirit of the holy Gods, and in the Days of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
light, and understanding, and Wisdome like the Wisdom of the Gods was
found in him, whom the King</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>thy Father, the King I say, thy
Father made Master of the Magicians, the Astrologers, the</hi> Chaldeans, <hi>and
the Southsayers; for as much as an excellent Spirit, and knowledg, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
in interpreting Dreams, and shewing of hard Sentences, and dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
doubts were found in the same</hi> Daniel, <hi>whom the King named</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teshazzar.
<hi>Now let</hi> Daniel <hi>be called, and he will shew the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Queen was either the Grandmother, or the Mother of <hi>Belshazzar;</hi>
For it appears that She was not any of the Kings Wives, because She
was absent from the Feast, and in regard of her age, past banquetting,
and dancing; Yet upon the report of the Miracle, She came in to comfort,
and cheer up the King; and whereas <hi>Daniel</hi> was forgotten, and neglected by
others, of younger years, and latter times, this old Queen remembred well,
what <hi>Daniel</hi> had done in the days of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> Grandfather to this
<hi>Belshazzar,</hi> and kept in mind, both his Religion, and Divine gifts.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Daniel</hi> was brought into the Kings presence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> brought in.</note> he said unto him:
<hi>Art thou that</hi> Daniel, <hi>which art of the Children of the Captivity of</hi> Judah;
<hi>whom the King my Father brought out of</hi> Jewry?<note place="margin">The Kings Speech to him.</note> 
               <hi>I have heard of thee that
the Spirit of the Gods is in thee, and that light, and understanding, and excellent

brought in before me, that they should read this Writing, and make known to me
the Interpretation thereof, but they could not do it: And I have heard of thee that
thou canst make Interpretations, and dissolve doubts: Now if thou canst read the
Writing, and make known to me the Interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed
with Scarlet, and have a chain of Gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third Ruler
in the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Daniel</hi> made answer in a far differing stile from that which he had used
to his Grandfather;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Daniels</hi> ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</note> For the evil which he had foretold to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
he wished that it might befal his enemies: But to this King (whose contempt

of God, and vicious life he hated) he answered in these Words; <hi>Let thy
gifts be to thy self, and give thy rewards to another: Yet I will read the writing
to the King, and make known to him the Interpretation:</hi> which yet before he
did, he shewed him the cause of Gods Judgments against him, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this terrible sentence, whereof the King and all his Wise men were
utterly Ignorant, the substance whereof is this; That <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Gods goodness to his Father, whom all Nations feared and obeyed, and
yet for his Pride, and neglect of those benefits, as he had deprived him of his
Estate and Understanding; so upon the acknowledgement of Gods infinite
power, he restored him to both again; <hi>And thou his Son</hi> (said he) <hi>O</hi> Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Zar,
<hi>hast not humbled thy heart; though thou knowest all this, But hast lifted up
thy self against the Lord of Heaven, and they have brought thee Vessels of his House

<hi>The mighty men of</hi> Babylon <hi>have forborn to fight; they have remained in
their holds; their might hath failed; they became as women; they have burnt
their dwelling-places; Her barrs are broken. One Post shall run to meet another,
and one messenger to meet another, to shew the King of</hi> Babylon <hi>that his City is
taken at one end. And that the passages are stopped (viz.</hi> of the River <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes)
and the Reeds they have burnt with fire, and the men of War are affrighted.</hi>
The Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> also, two hundred years before this subversion of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
in his forty seventh Chapter, and elsewhere, describeth this destruction so
feelingly and lively, as if he had been present, both at the terrible slaughter
there committed, and had seen the great and unfeared change, and calamity
of this great Empire; Yea, and had also heard the sorrows and bewailings
of every surviving Soul, thereunto subject; which Prophesie he begins with
these words; <hi>Come down, and sit in the dust, O Virgin Daughter of</hi> Babylon, <hi>sit
on the Ground; there is no Throne; O Daughter of the</hi> Chaldeans: <hi>For thou shalt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103996:14"/>
no more be called tender and delicate,</hi> &amp;c. And though it cannot be doubted,
that God used <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> as his Instruments to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the Idolatry and wickedness of the <hi>Iews,</hi> yet did he not forget that in
the Execution of Gods Judgments, they had used much rigour and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
as we see, <hi>Isa. 47. 6. I was wroth with my people; I have polluted mine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and given them into thine hand; Thou didst shew them no mercy; Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ancient hast thou very heavily laid the yoke;</hi> And again, <hi>I will rise up
against them, saith the Lord of Hosts, and will cut off from</hi> Babel <hi>the Name, and
the remnant, and the Son, and the Nephew:</hi> meaning Evilmerodach <hi>and</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shazzar.
And again, <hi>Isa.</hi> 13. 15, &amp;c. <hi>Every one that is found shall be thrust
thorow; and every one that is joyned to them shall be slain with the Sword; their
Children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes, their Houses shall be spoiled,
and their Wives ravished. Behold, I will stir up the</hi> Medes <hi>against them, which
shall not regard Silver, and as for Gold, they shall not delight in it; their Bowes
also shall dash the young men to pieces, and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the
Womb; their eye shall not spare children. And</hi> Babylon. <hi>the Glory of Kingdoms,
and beauty of the</hi> Chaldees <hi>excellency, shall be, as when God overthrew</hi> Sodom,
<hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, &amp;c. Read also Chapter fourteenth. No Historian that was
either present at this Victory of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> or that received the report from others
truly as it was, could better describe, and leave the same to posterity after it
was acted, than <hi>Isay</hi> hath done in many parts of his Prophesie, which
were written two hundred years before any of these things were attempted.</p>
            <p>The Greatness and Magnificence of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The greatness of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               </note> were it not by divers grave
Authors recorded, might seem altogether Fabulous; For it is reported for
truth, that one part of the City knew not that the other was taken three
dayes after; which is not impossible, if we consider the vast Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of it. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> saith, that it was in compass three hundred and
sixty Furlongs, which make forty five Miles. The Walls were so thick, that
six Chariots might pass in front thereon, and they were three hundred sixty
and five Foot high, and were adorned, and beautified with one hundred
and fifty Towers. <hi>Strabo</hi> gives a greater circuit, adding twenty five Furlongs
more to the former compass, reckoning it at three hundred eighty five Furlongs,
which makes forty eight Miles and one Furlong, <hi>Herodetus</hi> finds the compass yet
to be greater, namely, four hundred and eighty Furlongs in circuit, the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Wall he measures at fifty Cubits, and the height at two hundred of
the same Regal Cubits. For entrance, it had a hundred Gates of Brass, with Posts
and Hooks to hang them on of the same Metal; and therefore did the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi>
rightly intitle <hi>Babylon, The Princess, and Glory of Kingdoms,</hi> Isa. 47. 5. &amp; 13. 19.</p>

            <p>The last War,<note place="margin">His last Wars.</note> and the end of this Great King <hi>Cyrus,</hi> is diversly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Historians: <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Justin</hi> say, That after these Conquests,
<hi>Cyrus</hi> invaded the <hi>Massagets,</hi> a very Warlike Nation of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by <hi>Tomyris,</hi> their Queen: and that in an encounter between the
<hi>Persians,</hi> and these Northern <hi>Nomades, Tomyris</hi> lost her Army, together
with her Son <hi>Spargapises,</hi> that was the General of it. In revenge whereof,
this Queen making new levies of men of War, and prosecuting the
War against <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in a second sore Battel, the <hi>Persians</hi> were beaten, and
<hi>Cyrus</hi> was taken Prisoner, and that <hi>Tomyris</hi> cut off his Head from his
Body, and threw it into a Bowl of Blood, using these words; <hi>Thou that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103996:15"/>
hast all thy time thirsted for blood, now drink thy fill, and satiate thy self
with it.</hi> This War which <hi>Metasthenes</hi> calls <hi>Tomyrique,</hi> lasted about six
years.</p>
            <p>But more probably, this <hi>Scythian</hi> War was that which is mentioned before,
which <hi>Cyrus</hi> made against the <hi>Scythians,</hi> after the Conquest of <hi>Lydia,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Ctesias,</hi> who calleth <hi>Tomyris, Sparetha,</hi> and makes the end of it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as you may see before.</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Ctesias</hi> also recordeth, that the last War which <hi>Cyrus</hi> made, was
against <hi>Amarhaeus,</hi> King of the <hi>Derbitians,</hi> another Nation of the <hi>Scythians,</hi>
whom,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> though he overcame in Battel, yet there he received a Wound where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he died three dayes after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strabo</hi> also affirmeth, that he was buried in his own City of <hi>Pesagardes,</hi>
which himself had built, and where his Epitaph was to be read in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s
time, which he saith was this;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Vir,</hi>

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> opens his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. And honours his Tomb.</note> and caused this Tomb of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be opened, either upon
hope of great Treasure supposed to have been buried with him, or upon a
desire to honour his dead Body with certain Ceremonies; when the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre

caused to be covered with his own Garment, and a Crown of Gold to be

            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> finding in himself that he could not long enjoy the World, he
called unto him his Nobility, with his two Sons, <hi>Cambyses</hi> and <hi>Smerdis,</hi>
and after a long Oration,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> his last words.</note> wherein he assured himself, and taught others,
about the Immortality of the Soul, and of the punishments and rewards
following the ill, and good deservings of every man in this life; He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
his Sons, by the strongest Arguments he had, to a perpetual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and Agreement, Many other things he uttered, which makes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that he received the knowledge of the true God from <hi>Daniel,</hi> whilst
he Governed <hi>Susa</hi> in <hi>Persia;</hi> and that <hi>Cyrus</hi> himself had read the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
of <hi>Isay,</hi> wherein he was expresly named, and by God pre-ordained for
the delivery of his people out of Captivity; which act of delivering the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and of restoring of the Holy Temple, and the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
was in true consideration the Noblest work that ever <hi>Cyrus</hi> performed. For
in other actions he was an Instrument of Gods power, used for the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stising
of many Nations, and the establishing of a Government in those parts
of the World, which yet was not to continue long: But herein he had the
favour to be an Instrument of Gods goodness, and a willing advancer of his
Kingdom upon Earth, which must last for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> had issue two Sons,<note place="margin">His Issue.</note>

Eldest Son <hi>Cambyses,</hi> appointing <hi>Smerdis,</hi> his younger Son, to be <hi>Satrapa,</hi> or
Lieutenant of <hi>Media, Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Cadusia.</hi> He reigned about one and thirty
years, and died aged.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Historians wholly ascribe the Conquest of <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
because that he commanded the Army in Chief; yet the Scriptures at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
it to <hi>Darius,</hi> King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> whose General <hi>Cyrus</hi> was: For
when <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken, and <hi>Belshazzar</hi> slain; It's said, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 31. that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:103996:15"/>
the <hi>Median</hi> took the Kingdom, being about sixty two years old. It
was <hi>Darius</hi> also that placed Officers over the several Provinces thereof,
as we read, <hi>Dan. 6, 1, 2. It pleased</hi> Darius <hi>to set over the Kingdom an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty Princes, which should be over the whole Kingdom, and over
these, three Presidents, of whom</hi> Daniel <hi>was the first,</hi> &amp;c. And thus was it
Prophesied by <hi>Isay</hi> long before; <hi>Behold! I will stir up the</hi> Medes <hi>against
them,</hi> &amp;c. And by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy; The Lord hath raised up the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

of his Dominion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But certain it is, that the Honour of that great Victory over <hi>Babylon,</hi>
was wholly given to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was the Instrument pre-ordained, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
by God himself: not onely for this Action; but also for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his Church: Yet <hi>Daniel</hi> makes it plain, that himself, not onely
lived a great Officer under King <hi>Darius,</hi> but that he continued in that estate
to the first year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which was not long after, which also was the year of
<hi>Daniels</hi> Death.</p>
            <p>As for the Age of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> we are beholding to <hi>Tully</hi> for it; who, in his

this manner. <hi>The Sun</hi> (saith <hi>Dionysius) appeared unto</hi> Cyrus <hi>in his sleep,
standing at his feet; which, when</hi> Cyrus <hi>thrice endeavoured to take in his
hands, the Sun still turned aside, and went away: and the</hi> Magi, <hi>who were
the most learned men amongst the</hi> Persians, <hi>said, that by his thrice offering
to take hold of the Sun, was portended to him that he should reign thirty years;
which came to pass accordingly:</hi>

they had bribed for that purpose, disturbed the <hi>Jews</hi> in their building of the
Temple, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. 5. Whence proceeded that three weeks mourning of the
Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> which Fast he begun about the third Day of the first
Moneth, in the third year of <hi>Cyrus, Dan.</hi> 10. 1, 4. After which, upon the
four and twentieth Day of the first Moneth, that Vision of the Kings of
<hi>Persia,</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and his Successours, and their Kingdoms,
was shewed and revealed unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> as he stood upon the Bank of <hi>Hiddikel,</hi>
or <hi>Tygris;</hi> All which is contained in the three last Chapters of <hi>Daniel;</hi> which
(as may be collected out of the close thereof) was the last Vision that ever he
had, and that but a little before his Death.</p>

            <head>THE
LIFE and DEATH
OF
ARTAXERXES MNEMON,
One of the Great
MONARCHS
OF
PERSIA.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here were two <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>'s that were Monarchs of <hi>Persia;</hi>
the first was called <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> or <hi>Long-hand,</hi>
because his right hand was longer than his left. The
second (whole Life we are now setting forth) was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> from his excellent Memory.
This <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was the Son of <hi>Darius Ochus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</note> begotten by
him on the Body of <hi>Parysatis,</hi> before he came to be King:
And <hi>Parysatis</hi> was the Daughter of the first <hi>Artaxerxes.
Darius</hi> had by his Wife <hi>Parysatis</hi> four Sons, of the which the eldest was
this <hi>Ataxerxes,</hi> the second was called <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the two younger <hi>Ostanes,</hi> and
<hi>Oxathres.</hi> This <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> before he came to the Kingdom, was called <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces,</hi>
but after he came to the Kingdom he assumed the name of <hi>Artaxerxes:
Darius Ochus</hi> raigned Nineteen Years, and dyed at <hi>Babylon.</hi> When he lay
on his Death-bed, his Son <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> asked him by what Wisdom and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy he had maintained his State so long, To the end (said he) that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving learned by you,<note place="margin">A wise saying:</note> I may follow your steps therein? To whom <hi>Darius</hi>
answered, <hi>That he had done it, by doing right to God and man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> from his Childhood was of an hot stirring disposition, and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
on the contrary was alwayes mild and gentle. Wherefore <hi>Parysatis</hi> always
loved her Son <hi>Cyrus</hi> more than the Elder, and therefore often urged her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<hi>Darius Ochus</hi> to follow the example of <hi>Darius Hystaspes,</hi> to leave him
to succeed in the Kingdom, who was first born, after he came to be King, and
not him who was born before. This indeed did help <hi>Xerxes</hi> to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103996:17"/>
Wherefore she urged this Example to induce her Husband to leave the
Kingdom to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was born after his Father was Crowned King, and
not unto <hi>Arsaces,</hi> who was born before: Yet could she never prevail. For
<hi>Darius,</hi> by his last will, gave the Kingdom to his eldest Son <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and
made <hi>Cyrus</hi> Governour of <hi>Lydiae,</hi> and the King Leiutenant General of all the
lower Countries of <hi>Asia,</hi> next to the Sea side.</p>
            <p>Shortly after the Death of <hi>Darius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He comes to the Kingdom.</note> the new King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> went unto
<hi>Pasargades,</hi> there to be Consecrated, and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ointed King by the Priests of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi>
At this place was a Temple dedicated to <hi>Minerva,</hi> where the new
Kings must be Consecrated, after this manner: When he came into the
Temple he must put off his own Gown, and put on that which the first and
great <hi>Cyrus</hi> wore before he was King Then he must eat of a certain Tart or
Fricacy made of Figs with Turpentine.<note place="margin">Ceremonies at his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</note> Then he must take a Drink made
with Vinegar and Milk, besides some other secret Ceremonies, which none
knew but the Priests themselves.</p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was ready to enter into the Temple, <hi>Tisaphernes</hi>
came to him, and brought him one of the Priests; who had been School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
to <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his Youth, who informed him that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had conspired
Treason against him,<note place="margin">Treason discovered.</note> and that he meant traiterously to kill him in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
when he should put off his Gown. Upon this accusation <hi>Cyrus</hi> was
apprehended, and condemned: But as he was going to execution, his Mother
took him in her armes, and wound the hair of her Head about his Neck,
wherewith she tyed him fast to her, and withall, she wept so bitterly, and
made such pittiful mone to the King her Son,<note place="margin">The Traytor pardoned.</note> that at her intercession, he
granted to <hi>Cyrus</hi> his life, and sent him again to his Government in the lesser
<hi>Asia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Cyrus</hi> was not satisfied with this, but shortly after entered into open
Rebellion against the King his Brother;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> his new Treason.</note> for which end he kept Souldiers in
pay in divers places, not bringing them altogether into one Army, because
he desired to conceal his enterprise. He had also Friends, and Servants that levied
him men in divers places, and under divers pretences. He had his Mother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
about the King that cleared all suspitions conceived against him. Himself
also whilst he made these preparations, wrote very humbly to his Brother; one
while craving somthing of him, and another while accusing <hi>Tisaphernes,</hi> to
delude the King, and make him believe that he bent all his malice against
the said <hi>Tisaphernes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> at his first coming to the Crown, followed and imitated the
goodness,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Virtues.</note> and curtesie of the first <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> giving easie audience unto
suitors, and more honourably rewarding those that had deserved well of him:
and he used such moderation in punishing offenders, that he made it appear
that he punished not out of any malicious mind, or desire of revenge, nor yet
out of a will to hurt any man. When he had any thing given him he took
it very thankfully, and did as willingly and frankly give to them again: For
how small a thing soever was offered him, he took it well. One <hi>Romises</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a time presenting him with a marvellous fair Pomgranate: <hi>By the Sun</hi>
(said he) <hi>this man in a short time of a little Town would make a great City, if he
were made Governour of it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His gratitude.</note> At another time a poor Labourer seeing every man
give the King a present, he having nothing to give, ran to the River side and
took both his hands full of Water, and came and offered it to the King,
who took it so kindly, that in a Cup of Massey Gold, he sent him a thousand
<hi>Daricks,</hi> which were pieces of Gold so called, because the Image of <hi>Darius</hi>
was stamped upon them. And when one <hi>Euclidas</hi> a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> presumed
to give him bold words,<note place="margin">His meekness.</note> he answered by one of his Captains, <hi>Thou maist say
what thou listest, and I, as King may say and do what I list.</hi> Another time
as he was hunting, <hi>Tiribazus</hi> shewed the King his Gown that was all tatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103996:17"/>
               <hi>Well</hi> (said the King) <hi>what wouldst thou have me do?</hi> I pray your Grace
(said <hi>Tiribazus</hi>) take you another and give me that you have on. The King
did so, adding, <hi>Tiribazus, I give thee my Gown, but I command thee not to
wear it:</hi> But <hi>Tiribazus</hi> being a foolish, light-headed Fellow, not caring for
the Kings Commandment, did strait put on the Gown, and besides, set on
many Jewels which Kings only used to wear, whereupon every one in the
Court murmured at him, because it was a presumption, directly against the
Laws of <hi>Persia:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His prudence.</note> Yet the King did but laugh at it, saying, <hi>I give thee leave</hi>
Tiribazus <hi>to wear those Women gawds as a Woman, and the Kings Robe as
a Fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the manner in <hi>Persia,</hi> that no Person sat at the Kings Table but his
Mother (which sat uppermost) and his Wife which sat lowermost, but <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
made his two younger Brethren, <hi>Ostanes</hi> and <hi>Oxathres</hi> to sit with
him, which much pleased the <hi>Persians,</hi> but especially, because he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
that his Wife <hi>Statira</hi> should sit openly in her Chariot, that she might
be seen and reverenced by the other Ladies of the Court, and Country. But
some that hated Peace and desired innovations, said, that the Realm of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
needed such a Prince as <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that was bountiful, given to Arms, and
that liberally rewarded his Servants.</p>
            <p>At this time all the Cities of <hi>Jonia,</hi> except <hi>Miletus,</hi> which were under the
Government of <hi>Tisaphernes,</hi> fell from him to <hi>Cyrus:</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi>
praying him that he would be pleased to trust him, being his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with those Cities, rather than <hi>Tisaphernes,</hi> and in this suit his Mother also
sticked hard for him: All this while the King discerned not the Treason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
against him; but thought that <hi>Cyrus</hi> kept his Army about him to
strengthen him against <hi>Tisaphernes,</hi> and he was well content that they two
should try it out between themselves; for <hi>Cyrus</hi> did daily send the King the
Tribute of those Cities, which <hi>Tisaphernes</hi> formerly held. But in the mean
time <hi>Cyrus</hi> sent to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> his dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> praying them, that as he had hitherto support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them with men and money against the <hi>Athenians,</hi> so now they would send
him some men, boasting if they sent him Foot, he would give them Horses,
if Horsemen, he would give them Coaches. If they had Lands he would
give them Townships: If Towns, he would give them Cities for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
And for their wages, they should have it, not by tale, but by weight,
and paid down presently. Hereupon the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> jndging his request
but equal, and that this War would tend to their advantage, they decreed
him aid, and the <hi>Ephori</hi> sent presently to their Admiral at <hi>Samos,</hi> to do
whatsoever <hi>Cyrus</hi> required of him: He therefore with his Ships put over
to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where he met with <hi>Tamos</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> who was Admiral with
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> and offered him his service, joyning his Fleet to his: and so they both
sailed round about the coast of <hi>Jonia,</hi> unto <hi>Cania,</hi> whereby they prevented
<hi>Syenesis</hi> (who Governed there) that he could not stir to hinder <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his
march against his Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> having now his Army in readiness, resolved to march into upper <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
giving out, that he went against the <hi>Pisidians,</hi> who (as he said) made
often inrodes into his Government: He sent for <hi>Clearchus</hi> of <hi>Lacedemonia,
Aristippus</hi> of <hi>Thessaly, Xenes</hi> of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> those which were banished from <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus,</hi>
and the Army that lay before that City: <hi>Proxenus</hi> also a <hi>Booetian,</hi> with
all the power he could make, both of <hi>Grecians</hi> and others, to repair speedily
to him to <hi>Sardis.</hi> But <hi>Tisaphernes</hi> seeing greater preparations made than a
bare going against the <hi>Pisidians</hi> could require,<note place="margin">The Treason discovered.</note> taking with him five hundred
Horse, made all the speed that possibly he could to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> informing him
of his danger, who thereupon presently prepared for the Wars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the mean time left some trusty <hi>Persians,</hi> his Friends, to look to <hi>Lydia,</hi>
and <hi>Tamos,</hi> his Admital, to take care of the Cities of <hi>Jonia</hi> and <hi>Eolia</hi> in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103996:18"/>
and himself with his Army marched towards <hi>Caria,</hi> and <hi>Pisidia,</hi> still
giving it out, that some Persons in those parts were grown unruly. He had
in his Army a great number of his own, besides thirteen thousand <hi>Grecians;</hi>
when news of his approach was brought to the Court, all was strait in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar.
Many accused the Queen-Mother as having a hand in it, and all her
Servants were vehemently suspected: But that which troubled <hi>Parysatis</hi> most,
was Queen <hi>Statyra,</hi> her Daughter in Law, who stormed exceedingly when she
saw this War begun against her Husband, and cryed out on the Queen-Mother
for it: <hi>Parysatis</hi> hereupon, being a cruel and malicious Woman, so hated her
hence forwards, that she sought her Death by all means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the mean time came on (without resistance) even to the City of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon:</hi>
And whereas <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had determined to retire into the farthest
parts of <hi>Persia, Tiribazus</hi> was the first that durst tell him that he should not
shun the fight, lerving to his enemies the Kingdomes of <hi>Media, Babylon,</hi> and
<hi>Susa,</hi> considering that he had a greater Army than <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and far more skilful
Captains: which words made the King to alter his mind, and to resolve to
give Battel so soon as he could.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> coming with his Army to the River <hi>Cayster,</hi> received money from
<hi>Epiaxa,</hi> Wife to <hi>Syenesis,</hi> the King of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> wherewith he paid his Army
full four months Wages:<note place="margin">Policy.</note> and by her perswasion her Husband <hi>Syenesis</hi> gave
him also a vast summ of money towards the maintenance of his Army: and
like a wise man, at the same time he supplied <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> with necessaries for
the War: and having two Sons, he sent one of them to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
number of men for his service, and the other he sent privily away to
<hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to let him know, that having such an Army come upon him,
he durst not but keep fair with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> nevertheless that he continued a true
Servant in heart to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and would fall to him so soon as he had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Tarsus</hi> the <hi>Grecians</hi> (who were eleven thousand Corselets, and two
thousand Targateers) told <hi>Cyrus</hi> plainly, that they would march no farther;
but by the wisdom of <hi>Clearchus</hi> they were perswaded to go on, and so they
came to <hi>Issus,</hi> the utmost City of <hi>Cilicia:</hi> where <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Fleet met him,
bringing great supplies to him, and the Straights of <hi>Syria</hi> being abandoned,
<hi>Cyrus</hi> marched without any stop to the place where the fight shortly after was.
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> besides the <hi>Grecians</hi> before mentioned, had in his Army one hundred
thousand fighting men, and two hundred hooked Chariots. Of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi>
his part there were four hundred thousand men,<note place="margin">Their great Armies.</note> and fifteen hundred hooked
Chariots: The place where the fight was, was called <hi>Cyanaxa,</hi> five hundred
furlongs from <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> his men were marvelously astonished when they saw the Army of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
in such excellent good order, whereas themselves were disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
here and there, stragling without any order, and ill armed, trusting too
much to themselves and dispising their enemies: So that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had much ado
to set his men in Battel array, and yet was it with great noise, and tumult.
But of all others the <hi>Grecians</hi> wondred most, when they saw the Kings Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
march in so good order of Battel without any noise: for they thought to
have seen them in great disorder, and confusion, and supposed that they
would have made such a noise as one could not have heard another: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had marshalled his Army excellent well. He had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
before his Battel his best Chariots armed with Sithes, and drawn by
the strongest and biggest Horses he had, hoping by their fierceness and fury
to disorder the ranks of his enemies.</p>
            <p>Before the Battel began, <hi>Clearchus</hi> (General of the <hi>Grecians</hi>) advised <hi>Cyrus</hi>
to keep behind his Squadron, and not to hazard his Person amongst his own
men: To whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> answered: <hi>What saist thou</hi> Clearchus? <hi>What wouldst thou
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103996:18"/>
have me who strive to be a King, to shew my self unworthy to be a King?</hi> But <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi>
himself committed as great, if not a worse fault, whenas he would not
order his men directly against the Battel of the enemy where <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was,
but pent them up by the Rivers side, for fear least they should be compassed in
behind, whereas, if the <hi>Grecians</hi> had been set in opposition to the King, he had
never been able to endure their charge, but had either been slain or forced to
fly, wherefore if <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> would have chosen or wished a place where the
<hi>Grecians</hi> might have done him less hurt, he could not have devised a fitter
place that was so far from him, and from whence the <hi>Grecians</hi> could neither
see nor hear what was done in the place where he was, as afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> being mounted upon an hot, and hard mouthed Horse, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Province of the <hi>Caducians</hi> spyed him afar off,<note place="margin">A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and clapping spurs
to his Horse, he came with a full career to him, crying out, <hi>O Traytor
and most unfaithful man! Thou dishonourest the name of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>for that thou
hast brought such valiant</hi> Grecians <hi>upon so wicked an enterprise, to spoil the</hi>
Persians <hi>Goods, and to destroy thy Soveraign Lord and only Brother, who hath an
infinite number of Slaves, and Servants that are honester men than thy self, and
that thou shalt presently know by experience, for thou shalt die before thou seest the
Kings face,</hi> and therewithall he threw his Dart at him with all his force:
But the Armour of <hi>Cyrus</hi> was so good that it pierced not, yet the blow made
him stagger on his Horse back. <hi>Artagerses</hi> having given him this blow, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
wheeled about: But <hi>Cyrus</hi> threw a Dart at him so happily that he
slew him, the head of his Dart passing quite through his Neck. <hi>Cyrus</hi>
hereupon presently slew upon those that were neerest to the Kings Person,
and came so near the King that he flew his Horse under him: But <hi>Tiriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi>
presently mounted the King upon another Horse, and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> clapping
spurs to his Horse, threw another Dart at the King and hit him: But at the
third charge <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> told them about him that he could not abide this,
and that he had rather die than suffer it, and thereupon he spurred his Horse
to charge <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (who also came fiercely against him) and threw his Dart
at him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> slain.</note> as also did all those that were about the King, and so was <hi>Cyrus</hi> slain
in this conflict.</p>
            <p>Now after <hi>Cyrus</hi> was dead, <hi>Artasyras,</hi> one of the Kings Eunuchs, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
by, found his dead Body, whereupon he gallopped apace to the King,
and with a smiling countenance told him the news. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was so
joyful that he would needs go to the place to see it: But he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
not to go in Person; for fear of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who carried all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, and were killing those that had fled before them. Upon this
advice the King stayed; and sent thirty men with Torches in their hands
to seek him out. The King was very ill, both by reason of the great
thirst he suffered; as also by reason of a wound that he had received in his
Breast by <hi>Cyrus:</hi> One of his Eunuchs therefore, called <hi>Satribarzenes</hi> ran up
and down to see if he could get any Water for him: and as he ran here
and there, he met with same poor Slaves of the <hi>Caunians,</hi> amongst
which, one had in an old ragged Goats Skin about eight glasful of stinking
naughty Water: This he presently carried to the King, who drank it up
every whit, and his Eunuch asking him afterwards if that naughty Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did him no hurt? The King swore by the Gods, that he never drank
better Wine, nor sweeter Water than that was, nor that pleased him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
and therefore (said he) <hi>I beseech the Gods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>if it be not my hap to meet with
this man that gave thee this Water, to reward him, that yet it will please them
to send him good Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the King was thus talking with the Eunuches, the thirty men with
Torches returned, who assured him of the death of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> Multitudes also
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103996:19"/>
of his Souldiers gathered about him, so that he began to be couragious and with
an infinite number of Torches and lights about him, he went to the place
where the Body of <hi>Cyrus</hi> lay, and caused his Head and right hand to be strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
off, and taking the Head by the Hair, he shewed it to his men, who were
yet flying: they taking courage hereby, so flocked about the King, that in a
short time he had seventy thousand Souldiers about him, with whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again towards the Camp of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which he rifled, and there met with
a Concubine of <hi>Cyrus,</hi>

She was brought bound to the King, for which he was so angry, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
those that bound her, and ever after esteemed her above all the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
he kept (who were in number three hundred and sixty, all choice beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
and most doted on her.</p>
            <p>The Brigade of <hi>Grecians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Grecians</hi> valour.</note> not knowing what had befallen <hi>Cyrus,</hi> kept on
fighting still, and had beaten <hi>Tisaphernes</hi> and all his power. But the King
coming with the main of his Army to the relief of <hi>Tisaphernes,</hi> fell upon the
<hi>Grecians</hi> Camp, and rifled it, yet when they returned from the pursuit, they
recovered it, and beat the King out again, and lodged Supperless in it that
night, as well as Dinnerless the day before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> after this Battel sent rich Gifts unto the Son of <hi>Artagerses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Gratitude.</note>
whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> had slain with his own hands. He caused also the poor <hi>Caunian</hi>
Slave that had given him the stinking Water, to be sought out, and of a poor
wretch, and unknown before, he made him a rich Nobleman. He punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
such severely as had offended against martial Discipline. And one <hi>Arbaces</hi>
a <hi>Median,</hi> who at the first ran over to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and after his Death he returned
to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> again,<note place="margin">His Justice.</note> for punishment, he compelled him to carry a whore
on his back, stark naked all day long about the Market place: and for
one who had yielded himself to his enemies, and yet falsly boasted that
he had slain two, he caused his Tongue to be boared through in three
places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> thinking that himself had slain <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory.</note> and being desirous that
all others should think so too, he sent Presents to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who had first
hurt him in the fore-head, commanding the Messenger to tell him from the
King, The King sends thee these Presents, because thou didst first find the
Caparisons of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Horse, and broughtest them to the King. The <hi>Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
likewise that had cut <hi>Cyrus</hi> his hamm, which made him fall to the ground,
asked his reward also, which the King gave him, and bad the Messenger tell
him, The King gives thee this, because thou wast the second Person that
brought him the good news of the Death of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Now <hi>Mithridates,</hi> though
he was not well pleased with the message, said nothing for the present, but
the unhappy <hi>Carian,</hi> in a foolish vain, being overjoyed with the rich Presents,
said, that he would not take them as a reward for bringing the news, but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Gods to witness, that he was the man, and the onely man that slew
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> and that he did him great wrong to take that honour from him. The
King was so incensed hereby, that he commanded some presently to strike
off his head:<note place="margin">Horrid Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> 
               <hi>But Parysatis</hi> (the Queen-Mother) said, <hi>Let me alone with the
Villain, I will chastise him well enough:</hi> and withall she sent Serjeants, who
hung him in chains for ten dayes together, then caused his eyes to be pulled
out of his head; and lastly, poured molten lead into his ears, and so kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him.</p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Mithridates</hi> was invited to a Fcast, where many of the
Kings and Queen-Mothers Eunuchs were, and <hi>Mithridates</hi> fat in the Golden
Gown which the King had sent him: and after Supper, as they were drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
freely, one of the Queen-Mothers Eunuchs said to him, <hi>Mithridates, the
King hath given thee a rich Gown, Goodly chains, and Carckenets of Gold, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103996:19"/>
Rich, so that every one thinks thee a happy man with them. Mithridates</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
What meanest thou by this, <hi>Sparamixes?</hi> I deserved better than
these when the Battel was fought. Why? (said <hi>Sparamixes</hi>) what so valiant
an act was it to take up a Caparison of a Horse that fell to the ground, and to
carry it to the King: <hi>Mithridates</hi> being a cholerick man, and his brain heat
with wine, answered: <hi>You may talk as long as you list of a Caparison of a Horse,
but I tell you plainly that</hi> Cyrus <hi>was slain with my own hands, and with no mans
else. For I hit him not in vain, as</hi> Artagerses <hi>did, but full in the forehead, hardby
the eye, which pierced through his head, of which blow he died.</hi> The envious Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch
at his departure told this to <hi>Parysatis,</hi> who went presently and told it to
the King. He was marvellously angry to lose the thing that was most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
and that best pleased him in his Victory. For he desired that all the
world should believe, that though his Brother hurt him, yet he slew his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with his own hand: He therefore commanded that <hi>Mithridates</hi> should
suffer the Death by Boats,<note place="margin">Cruelty.</note> which was thus; They took two Boats of equal
size, and laying the offender in one of them upon his back, they covered him
with the other, and fastned both Boats together, that his feet, hands, and
head came out at holes made on purpose: then they gave him meat as much
as he would eat, which if refused, they thrust awls into his eyes to force him:
and when he had eaten, they gave him Honey and Milk to drink, pouring it
also all over his face, and turned his face full into the Sun, which was covered
over with Flyes sucking at it. In his excrements also that came from him,
Worms did breed, which devoured his Flesh: And when they see the man is
dead, they take off the upper Boat, and find all his flesh devoured to his very
intrails. <hi>Mithridates</hi> thus miserably languished for seventeen dayes together,
and then died, with much torment.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Parysatis,</hi> to satisfie her revenge, had only <hi>Mesabates</hi> to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ak her teen
on, who was one of the Kings Eunuchs, who, at his command, had cut off
<hi>Cyrus</hi> his Head and Hand: But he was so wary, that she could get no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
against him, wherefore she invented this device.<note place="margin">Subtilty of <hi>Parysatis.</hi>
               </note> She was very skilful in
playing at Cards and Dice, and finding the King one day at leisure, she enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to play at Dice with her for a thousand <hi>Daricks,</hi> and was contented
willingly to lose them, and paid them down. Then she prayed him to play
with her for one of his Eunuchs: the King was contented, but they agreed
that each of them should name five of the chiefest whom they would except,
and then the loser should presently deliver to the winner the choice of all the
other Eunuchs they had. Now did she play so warily and cunningly, that she
wan the Game, and then required <hi>Mesabates</hi> to be delivered to her, being none
of those whom the King excepted.<note place="margin">Her cruelty.</note> And when she had him, she delivered him
to the Hangman, commanding him to flea him alive, and then to nail him to
a Cross, and crucifie him, and to hang his skin by him, which was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
The King was marvellously angry when he knew it, and was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
offended with his Mother. But Queen <hi>Statyra</hi> spared not to tell the
Queen-Mother plainly, that it was wickedly done of her to put the Kings true
and faithful Servant to so cruel a Death, for <hi>Cyrus</hi> sake. Yet <hi>Parysatis</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it out, saying to her Son, <hi>Indeed it becomes thee well to be angry for an old
Gelded Villain, whereas I lost a thousand</hi> Daricks, <hi>and said never a word for it.</hi>
In brief, she would never be out of her Sons sight, but as little as might be,
and would let his Wife <hi>Statyra</hi> have as little time with him as possible, that
she might Govern him as she would; because she hated her of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
living, as also for that she would bear the greatest sway and credit about
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tisaphernes</hi> having deceived <hi>Clearchus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Grecian</hi> Coptains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.</note> and the other Captains of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
by falsifying his word and promise given to them, he sent them bound to the
King, who cast them into Prison: and though <hi>Parysatis</hi> was an earnest suitor
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103996:20"/>
to the King her Son for them, yet at the perswasion of his Wife <hi>Statyra,</hi> he put
them all to death but <hi>Menon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parysatis</hi> had for a long time born implacable and inveterate hatred against
<hi>Statyra,</hi> for that she had more love and respect from the King than her self, so
that she determined, that either her self or her Daughter in Law must dye.
Now <hi>Statyra</hi> had a Maid called <hi>Gingis,</hi> or <hi>Gigis,</hi> who was very gracious with
her,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Statyra</hi> poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned.</note> and whom <hi>Parysatis</hi> made use of in poysoning <hi>Statyra.</hi> There is a little
Bird in <hi>Persia</hi> called <hi>Rhindaces,</hi> that hath no excrements at all, but all her guts
are stuffed full with fat: One of these Birds, as she sat at Table with <hi>Statyra,</hi>
she (or one of her maids) took and cut in two, with a knife that was poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the one side, and so gave that half which was towards that poisoned side
to her Daughter, and did eat the other her self; shortly after which, the Queen
died in extream torments: And the King presently suspected his Mother for
it, knowing her cruel and implacable disposition; and he caused her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Carvers to be examined, and wracked about it: But <hi>Parysatis</hi> kept
<hi>Gingis</hi> a long time in her own chamber, and though the King required her,
yet would she not give her up to Justice; till at last <hi>Gingis</hi> her self desiring to
steal to her own lodging in the night, she was apprehended, and punished as a
Poysoner. As for his Mother, the King neither did, nor said any hurt unto
her: But when she desired to retire her self to <hi>Babylon,</hi> the King gave it her,
but withall, swore to her, that while she lived, he would not come thither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Gratitude.</note> for his good service in the War, gave to <hi>Tisaphernes</hi> all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
which his Brother <hi>Cyrus</hi> had held, besides what he had before: he
heaped also many other large gifts and favours upon him; and above all, gave
him his own Daughter to Wife, and ever after used him as his most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Friend and Servant.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> having done the utmost he could to overcome those <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
whom his Brother <hi>Cyrus</hi> had brought into the heart of his Dominions,
yet could he never prevail against them: For though they had lost <hi>Cyrus</hi> who
entertained them,<note place="margin">The <hi>Grecians</hi> valour.</note> and all their Captains that led them; yet did they choose
other Captains, whereof <hi>Xenophon</hi> was one, and made their retreat in spite
of all the Power of <hi>Persia:</hi> whereupon all the other <hi>Grecians</hi> waxed bold,
and despised those Barbarous People: and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> thought it a great
shame to them, if they did not deliver the <hi>Grecians</hi> that dwelt in <hi>Asia</hi> from
the slavery and bondage of the <hi>Persians:</hi> For which end, they sent thither
their King <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> who passing into <hi>Asia</hi> with his Ships, began presently to
make hot War against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and in the first conflict he overthrew <hi>Tisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes,</hi>
and caused most of the Cities of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in those parts to rebell
against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> being informed hereof, considered seriously how he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this mischief, and at last resolved upon this as his only course. He sent
into <hi>Greece,</hi> one <hi>Hermocrates, a Rhodian,</hi> with a very great sum of Gold and
Silver,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Policy.</note> which he was bountifully to bestow amongst the Nobility, and chief
Rulers of the Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> to provoke them to rise up against the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians.</hi>
This <hi>Hermocrates</hi> so wisely managed his business; that he made the
chiefest Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> to rebell against the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> so that all <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesus</hi>
being in Arms, the <hi>Ephori</hi> at <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> were enforced to send for
<hi>Agesilaus</hi> home again. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> being sorry that he lef <hi>Asia,</hi> said unto his
Friends: that the King of <hi>Persia</hi> had driven him out of his Dominions with
thirty thousand Archers: and this he said, because the <hi>Persian</hi> coin was stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Reverse with an Archer, having a Bow in his hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> also drave out the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> from all their jurisdiction by
Sea, by the help of <hi>Conon</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Admiral, whom <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> (one of
his Lieutenants) had procured to take his part. This <hi>Conon</hi> having been
overthrown in a Battel at a place called the <hi>Goats River,</hi> kept ever after in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103996:20"/>
Isle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as being the meetest place to slay in, till the Wars of <hi>Greece</hi> were
ended. He knowing that himself lacked power, and that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a man of Judgment to be employed, he wrote Letters to him, wherein he
advised him what to do. These Letters were delivered to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> by <hi>Cte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi>
who was presently sent to assist <hi>Conon.</hi> And it fell out, that after <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi>
had, through the conduct of <hi>Conon</hi> and <hi>Pharnebazus,</hi> won the Battel by
Sea, near to the Isle of <hi>Gnidus,</hi> and thereby had driven the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> from
their Lordship of the Sea, all <hi>Greece</hi> had him in marvellous great estimation,
so that he gave to the <hi>Grecians</hi> such conditions as he pleased, whereupon that
famous Peace,<note place="margin">Peace betwixt him and the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
               </note> called <hi>Antalcid as Peace,</hi> was concluded. This <hi>Antalcidas</hi> was a
Citizen of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who, favouring the affairs of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> procured by this
Treaty of Peace, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> should leave to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> all the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Cities in <hi>Asia,</hi> and all the Isles belonging thereunto, and to cause them to
pay him Tribute at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>This Peace being concluded with the <hi>Grecians,</hi> King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> though he
extreamly hated the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> yet he loved <hi>Antalcidas</hi> very well, and
entertained him honourably, when he came to him into <hi>Persia.</hi> One day the
King took a Garland of Flowers, and wet it in the most precious and sweetest
Oyl of perfume, that was prepared for the Feast, and sent it to <hi>Antalcidas:</hi>
Indeed he was a meet man to follow the vanity and curiosity of the <hi>Persians.</hi>
Shortly after, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> lost the Battel at <hi>Leuctres,</hi> and therewith the
Principality which they had kept so long over all <hi>Greece.</hi> When <hi>Sparta</hi> flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
most, and was chief of all the other <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities, so long did <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi>
continue to make much of <hi>Antalcidas,</hi> and called him his <hi>Friend:</hi> But
when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had lost the Battel at <hi>Leuctres,</hi> having received so
great a blow, and wanting money, they sent <hi>Agesilaus</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Antal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi>
into <hi>Persia,</hi> to King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> to pray him to aid and assist the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians:</hi>
But he made so small account of him, and disdained him so much,
denying his request, that he returned to <hi>Sparta</hi> with shame and dishonour:
And there also, seeing that his enemies did mock him, and fearing that the
<hi>Ephori</hi> would commit him to Prison, he killed himself with Famine.</p>
            <p>About the same time, the <hi>Thebans,</hi> having under <hi>Epaminondas</hi> won the
Battel at <hi>Leuctres,</hi> sent <hi>Ismenias</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas</hi> into <hi>Persia</hi> to King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>
where <hi>Pelopidas</hi> did nothing unworthy himself: But <hi>Ismenias,</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to kneel to the King, let fall his Ring at his feet, and stooped to take
it up, whereby some thought that he did it to kneel to the King. At another
time, <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> liking well a secret advertisement sent him from <hi>Timagoras</hi>
the <hi>Athenian,</hi> he gave him ten thousand <hi>Daricks</hi> by his Secretary <hi>Belluris:</hi> and
because he had a sickly Body, and was forced to drink Cows milk to restore
him; the King therefore sent him eighty milch Kine, that he might have
fresh Milk every day. He sent him also a Bed, with all things belonging
thereto, and Grooms of his Chamber to make his Bed, saying, <hi>That the</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<hi>knew not how to make it.</hi> He also sent him men to carry him upon their
Arms to the Sea-side, because he was sick: and whilst he was at Court, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
him very honourably, and bountifully.<note place="margin">Justice.</note> But the <hi>Athenians</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
condemned <hi>Timagoras</hi> to dye, because he had taken Bribes of the King
of <hi>Persia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> though he had in many other things vexed the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
yet he did one thing that pleased them exceeding well, when he did put <hi>Tisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes</hi>
to Death,<note place="margin">Malice.</note> who was the greatest enemy they had. <hi>Parisatis,</hi> the Kings
Mother, did help to bring this to pass; aggravating the accusations which
were brought against <hi>Tisaphernes,</hi> out of the hatred which she did bear him
for her Son <hi>Cyrus</hi> his sake: For the King did not keep his anger long against
her, but sent for her from <hi>Babylon,</hi> knowing that she had an excellent wit, and
was fit to Govern a Kingdom: Besides, there was nothing now to hinder their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103996:21"/>
coming together, his Wife being dead. And now <hi>Parysatis</hi> applyed her self
to feed the Kings humour in every thing, seeming to mislike nothing that he
did: By this means she grew into so great credit with him, that he denied
nothing that she asked. She perceiving that the King was extreamly in love
with one of his own Daughters called <hi>Atossa,</hi> which hitherto he had dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
chiefly for fear of her; <hi>Parysatis</hi> having found out this, began to make
more of his Daughter than she did before; and in her Fathers presence, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
she praised her beauty, another time her grace and good carriage, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Unnatural wickedness.</note>
               <hi>That she was like a Queen, and Noble Princess;</hi> so that at length she perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to marry her openly (though before he had her Maidenhead) not
passing for the Laws and opinions of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> considering that he was to
establish Laws to the <hi>Persians,</hi> to determine of right, and wrong, good and
bad. Hereupon he married <hi>Atossa,</hi> and loved her very intirely, insomuch as
though she had a grievous disease that ran all over her Body, yet he loved her
not the less for it, and prayed continually for her to the Goddess <hi>Juno,</hi> and fell
on his knees before her Image, and sent to her so many offerings, that all the
way from the Court Gates to <hi>Juno's</hi> Temple (which was sixteen furlongs
off) was full of Gold, Silver, rich Purple, Silks, and Horses, which were sent
thither.</p>
            <p>About this time,<note place="margin">He wars against <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> made War against <hi>Aegypt,</hi> by <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi>
and <hi>Iphicrates</hi> the <hi>Athenian;</hi> but they did no good, because they fell out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
themselves;<note place="margin">And against the <hi>Caducians.</hi>
               </note> wherefore himself went in Person against the <hi>Caducians,</hi>
with three hundred thousand Foot, and ten thousand Horse. Their Country
was very rude, which he invaded, alwayes dark and cloudy: the earth brought
forth nothing that was sowed by man, and the Inhabitants lived upon Pears
and Apples, and such like fruit, yet the men were strong and lusty. When
he was entred far into this Country, his Army fell into great straits for want
of Victuals;<note place="margin">A Famine in his Army.</note> for his Souldiers found nothing that was fit to eat, neither could
they come by Victuals from any other place, because of the naughty, and
craggy wayes, so that they were forced to live upon their own Beasts, and
that was sold very dear; for an Asses head was sold for sixty Silver Drams.
Yea, the Famine was so great, that the King himself wanted food, and now
there were but few Horses left. Now <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> though he was at this time
out of favour with the King, yet he invented this Stratagem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the King and all his men.</p>
            <p>In this Countrey,<note place="margin">A Stratagem,</note> there were two Kings with their Armies in the Field,
and each of them camped apart from the other. <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> after he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
his Project to the King, himself went to one of these Kings, and at the
same time sent his Son to the other, and told either of them, that the other
had sent Ambassadours unto King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to make Peace with him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witting
to his Companion: and therefore he counselled them, if they were
wise, one of them to seek to prevent the other, with all the speed that possible
he could. Both the one and the other Kings believed these words, either of
them mistrusting the other; So that speedily the one sent his Ambassadours
to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> with <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> and the other also his Ambassadours with his
Son. But <hi>Tiribazus</hi> tarrying somewhat long in the Journey, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
somewhat to suspect him: His enemies also accused him in his absence,
and the King grew angry, and was sorry that he had trusted him so far. But
at length he returned, and his Son also, and either of them brought with him
the Ambassadours of the <hi>Cadusians,</hi> and so Peace was concluded with them
both. Then was <hi>Tiribazus</hi> highly in favour again, and so departed with the
King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> at this time made it evident, that cowardliness doth not always
proceed from Pomp and curiosity, which some think to effeminate mens
hearts, but rather from a base and abject mind, that commonly follows evil,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103996:21"/>
and the worst counsel. For neither the Jewels of Gold, nor Kingly Robe, not
other sumptuous Ornaments which the King ever wore about him, valued at
twelve thousand Talents, did hinder him at that time to travel, and to take
as much pains as any man in all his Army.<note place="margin">His hard tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</note> For he himself marched on foot
the fore-most man, carrying his knapsack in a scarf upon his Shoulders, and
his Target on his Arm, with which he travelled over high stony Mountains,
so that his Souldiers seeing the Kings courage, and the pains that he took,
they marched so nimbly, as if they had wings, about two hundred Furlongs
a day. At length the King by hard travel, came to one of his own Houses,
where were stately Arbours and Parks, with goodly Trees curiously planted,
but all the Countrey beside, was naked and barren, having no other Trees
near, and the weather was very cold: the King therefore suffered his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

               </note> and Cypress Trees in his Parks, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden
them, he himself took an Axe in his hand, and began to hew the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
Tree of them all: The Souldiers seeing that, fell every man to work, so
that in a short time they had wood enough, and the Parks were filled with
fires, by which the Souldiers sat all night.</p>
            <p>In this expedition <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> lost many valiant men, and most of his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
wherefore, thinking that his men would mock him for his miscarriage,
he grew distrustfull of all, and suspected the chiefest Nobles about him, so
that in a rage he put many of them to death,<note place="margin">His cruelty.</note> and yet was not satisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.
<hi>For there is nothing more cruel, nor a greater Bloud-sucker, than a cowardly
Tyrant: as on the contrary, there is nothing more courteous and less suspicious than
a valiant and couragious man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> being grown very old, heard that there were
great contentions between his Sons, which of them should inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
after his Death, and that the same was diffused amongst his Kindred
and Nobles. The wisest of them desired, that as he himself came to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as his Fathers eldest Son, so that he also should leave it to his eldest Son
called <hi>Darius.</hi> But the younger, who was called <hi>Ochus,</hi> being valiant, and
of a stirring nature, had some in the Court that took his part, and himself ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to obtain the Crown by the means of his Sister <hi>Atossa,</hi> whom he much lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and promised to marry her, and to make her Queen, if he came to the
Kingdom after his Fathers Death. Now <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> because he would put
<hi>Ochus</hi> out of all hope to succeed him, lest his expectation might put him to
go about to practice that which <hi>Cyrus</hi> did, and by this means, his Realm
should fall into factions and Civil Wars,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King.</note> he proclaimed his Son <hi>Darius,</hi> (who
was now fifty years old) King after his Death, and gave him leave from
henceforth to wear the point of his Hat upright, as the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings used
to do.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the custome in <hi>Persia</hi> was, that when any came to be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Heir apparent to the Crown, that he should request a gift of him that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
him his Successor, which the other grants whatsoever it be if it be
possible.<note place="margin">He begs his Fathers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine.</note> 
               <hi>Darius</hi> then asked his Father, for his Concubine <hi>Aspasia,</hi> who was
first Concubine to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but now the King kept her for his own use. She was
born in <hi>Ionia</hi> of Free Parents, and was brought up virtuously, and amongst
other beauties, she was brought one night to <hi>Cyrus</hi> as he was at Supper; those
others, without making nice of it, sat down by him, and were glad when Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>began
to play and be merry with them, answering him pleasantly again: But
<hi>Aspasia</hi> stood on her feet by the Table, and spake never a word, and though
<hi>Cyrus</hi> called her, yet would she not come at him: And when one of the Grooms
would have forced her to him, <hi>The first</hi> (said she) <hi>that shall lay hands on me,
shall repent it;</hi> whereupon all that were present said, she was a foolish thing,
and meanly brought up, and knew not what belonged to Courtship: But <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
being glad of it, passed it over with laughter, and said to him that brought
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103996:22"/>
them to him, <hi>Dost thou not see that of all those that thou hast brought me, there is
not an honest woman but she?</hi> After this, <hi>Cyrus</hi> made much of, and loved her
very well, and called her <hi>Aspasia the wise.</hi> She was taken in the Camp of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
amongst his spoils,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> begs <hi>Aspasia.</hi>
               </note> after his overthrow; and now <hi>Darius</hi> begged her of
his Father, who was very angry in his mind for it. For the <hi>Persians,</hi> of all
other things, were very jealous of their Women, and he was to be punished
with Death that durst but speak to, or touch any Concubine of the Kings,
though but in sport: yea, if they come near them, or near their Coaches, as
they went abroad.</p>
            <p>The Kings Daughter <hi>Atossa,</hi> whom he had married against the Law, was
yet living, and besides her, he had three hundred and sixty Beautiful Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
and yet, when <hi>Darius</hi> asked <hi>Aspasia</hi> of him, the King answered, that
she was a Free-woman born, and if she would, he was content that he should
have her, but if she was unwilling, he would not by any means have him to
force her. So <hi>Aspasia</hi> was called, and she was asked with which of them she
would choose to be?<note place="margin">She chooses him before his Father.</note> She answered, with <hi>Darius:</hi> This was contrary to the
expectation of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who, both by custome and Law, was forced to
let him have her. But shortly after, he took her from him again, saying, that
he would place her in a Nunnery of <hi>Diana,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Ecbatane,</hi> there
to serve the Goddess, and to live chaste all her dayes. <hi>Darius</hi> took this very
impatiently, either for that he was deeply in love with her, or because he
thought that his Father mocked him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tiribazus</hi> perceiving it, he laboured to aggravate <hi>Darius</hi> his anger, and he
every day buzzed it in his ears, that it was in vain for him to wear his hat
upright, if his affairs also went not right forward, and that he deceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
much, if he did not know that his Brother (by means of the women he
kept) secretly aspired to the Crown: and that his Father being so inconstant
as he was, he must not expect to succeed him in the Kingdom. For (said he)
<hi>he that</hi> for a Grecian <hi>woman hath broken and violated the holiest Law that was in</hi>
Persia, <hi>thou must not think he will perform promise with thee:</hi> He perswaded him
also, that it was not a like repulse to <hi>Ochus</hi> to be denied that which he looked
for, as it was for him to be turned out of all that ever he had gotten. For
(said he) <hi>if it please</hi> Ochus <hi>to live as a private man, he might do it safely, and
no man will trouble him; but for you who are already proclaimed King, you must of
necessity make your self King, or else you cannot live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now besides these perswasions, the largeness of the Empire, and the fear
<hi>Darius</hi> stood in of his Brother <hi>Ochus,</hi> much prevailed with him, infomuch
that he flatly conspired against his Father <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires against <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi>
               </note> together with <hi>Tiriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus,</hi>
and both of them drew many Conspirators to joyn with them. But one
of the Kings Eunuchs smelling it out, ran presently and told the King all, and
how they had determined suddenly to assail him, and to kill him in his Bed in
the night. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> having received this intelligence, thought it not safe
to be careless in a matter of so great importance as was his Life; and yet that
it would savour of too great lightness, so suddenly to believe the Eunuch,
without better proof of the matter: He therefore commanded the Eunuch
to keep Company still with the Conspirators, and to follow them whitherso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they went, and in the mean time he caused the wall behind his Bed to be
beaten down, making a door in the place, and Tapestry Hangings to be put
up before it.</p>
            <p>When the time was come, as the Eunuch had advertized the King, that the
Conspirators intended to execute their Design, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> being laid on his
bed, rose not up till he had seen every Traytor in the face that came to kill
him: But when he saw them coming towards him, with their Swords drawn,
he suddenly slip't under the Hangings into the inner Chamber, and shut the

and together with his Sons, was brought Prisoner before the King. The King
referred him to be judged by his Peers: and withall, he commanded his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
to set down all the Tryal in writing, together with the opinion and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of every one of the Judges, and to bring it to him. In conclusion, they
all cast him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> and condemned him to dye. Then the Officers laid hold on him,
and led him into a Chamber of the Prison, where the Hang-man came with
a Razor in his hand, with which he used to cut mens throats who were so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
But when he came into the Chamber, he saw it was <hi>Darius;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
his heart so failed, that he durst not lay hands on him, but went out
again: The Judges that were without, bad him go in and do it, unless he
would have his own throat cut: Then went he in again,<note place="margin">And executed.</note> and took <hi>Darius</hi> by
the hair, and made him hold down his head, and so cut his neck with the
Rasor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> being informed hereof, went and worshipped the Sun, and then
turning to his Lords that were about him, he said unto them: <hi>My Lords, God
be with you, and be merry at home in your Houses, and tell them that were not here,
that the great God</hi> Oromazes <hi>hath taken revenge upon those that practised Treason
against me.</hi> Now <hi>Darius</hi> being dead, <hi>Ochus</hi> stood in good hope to be next heir
to the Crown, and the rather, through the means and assistance of his Sister
<hi>Atossa:</hi> But of his legitimate Brethren,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ochus</hi> his fears</note> he most feared <hi>Ariaspes,</hi> who was
only left of all that were legitimate, and of his Bastard Brethren he feared <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sames:</hi>
Not for that <hi>Ariaspes</hi> was elder than he, but because (he being of a
soft and plain name) the <hi>Persians</hi> desired that he might be their King. And
for <hi>Arsames,</hi> he was wise and valiant, and <hi>Ochus</hi> saw that his Father loved him
dearly.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Ochus</hi> being subtle and malicious,<note place="margin">His craft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> first shewed cruelty upon <hi>Arsames,</hi>
and then his Malice upon <hi>Ariaspes,</hi> his Legitimate Brother. For knowing him
to be simple and plain, he daily sent some of the Kings Eunuchs to him, who
carried him threatning messages, as from the King, telling him, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to put him to a cruel and shameful death. These things being daily

worse Death. King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> being informed of his Death, took it very
heavily, and began to suspect the cause that made him thus destroy himself,
yet, being grown very old, he neglected to search it out. But the Death of
<hi>Ariaspes</hi> made him to love <hi>Arsames</hi> the better, making it to appear that he had
a better opinion of him than he had of <hi>Ochus,</hi> and therefore made him privy
to all his affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ochus</hi> seeing this, could no longer defer his revenge, and he therefore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned
<hi>Harpaces,</hi>

accordingly he accomplished. Now <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> being almost spent with age,
when he heard that his dearly beloved Son <hi>Arsames</hi> was Murthered, was
not able to bear it any longer, but took it so to heart, that he died of
grief, having lived fourscore and fourteen years, and reigned threescore and
two.</p>
            <p>When he was dead,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> dyes.</note> the <hi>Persians</hi> found that he had been a good and a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Prince, and one that loved his People and Subjects, especially when they
came to have tryal of his Successor <hi>Ochus,</hi> that passed all men living in cruelty.
For when his Father was dead, he dealt so with the Chiliarchs and Eunuchs
that were about him, that his Death was concealed for ten Months together;
in which time he dispatched away Letters signed with the Kings Seal, into all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103996:23"/>
parts of the Empire, commanding them to receive <hi>Ochus</hi> for their King: And
when all men had acknowledged him, and sworn fealty to him, he then made
known his Fathers death, and commanded a publick mourning to be made
for him, after the <hi>Persian</hi> manner, and assumed his Fathers name, <hi>Artaxerxes:</hi>
And then filled, and fouled his Court with the bloud of his Kindred and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
without respect of Age or Sex: amongst whom, he caused his own Sister
whose Daughter he had married,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ochus</hi> his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> to be buried alive, with her heels upward:
He also caused an Unkle of his, with above a hundred of his Children and
Grand-children descended out of his loyns; to be put into a court, and there
shot to Death with Arrows.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> following herein the example of <hi>Cambyses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An excellent example.</note> caused certain
unjust Judges to be flead alive, and their skins to be hung up over the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seats,
that they which sat therein, seeing what hung over their heads,
might be the more careful to do Justice to his People. He also it was, who
intending to make War upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he might have the more assistance
therein from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> he sent his Ambassadours into <hi>Greece,</hi> to induce
them to make a general Peace among themselves, upon these terms, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Lous.</hi> Upon the very same day that the Temple
of <hi>Diana</hi> in <hi>Ephesus</hi> was burned down; whereupon the
Priests, Magicians, and South-sayers ran about the City,
crying, that some great Plague and mischief to <hi>Asia</hi> was
surely born that day. Three Messengers came to King
<hi>Philip,</hi> presently after he had won the City of <hi>Potidaea,</hi> upon the same day,
who brought him great News, the first, that <hi>Parmenio</hi> his General, had
won a notable Battel of the <hi>Illyrians:</hi> the second that his Horse had won the

            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> being marvellous glad to hear these Newses, the South-sayers much
added to his joy; assuring him, that his Son that was thus born, should be
invincible. He had naturally a very fair white colour mingled with red,
which chiefly appeared in his face and breast: His Skin had a marvellous sweet
savour, and his breath was very sweet, which sheweth his excellent constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He was naturally hot and Cholerick, which made him to be addicted
to drink, and hasty, and yet was chast withall. His Father was very careful
of his Education, and therefote gat for him excellent Tutors, as <hi>Leonidas,</hi>
which had the chiefest Government of him. Then <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> an <hi>Acarnanian:</hi>

            <p>He delighted much in hunting divers kind of wild Beasts, and playing at
the Staff. On a time while he was young, Ambassadors were sent to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and it fell out that <hi>Philip</hi> was in some jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
out of his Kingdom. <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore intertained them familiarly,
not using any childish questions to them, nor enquiring about trifling, and
trivial matters, but what distance it was from one place to another, and which
way they went into the higher places of <hi>Asia;</hi>

had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> insomuch as they were ravished with delight to hear him, judging
him to be of great Courage, and of a Noble mind, and one that was like to
attempt great enterprises. When at any time news was brought him that his
Father had taken some famous City, or had won some great Battel, he was
no whit glad to hear it, but would say to his Play-fellows: Sirs, <hi>My Father

            </p>
            <p>Upon a time <hi>Philonicus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bucephalus</hi> broken by <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </note> a <hi>Thessalian</hi> brought a brave Horse, called <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalus,</hi>
to sell unto king <hi>Philip,</hi> demanding thirteen Talents for him, and
they went into the Field to try him: But the Horse was found to be so unruly,
and churlish, that they which should have ridden him, said, that he
would never be made serviceable: For he would let no man get upon his
Back, nor abide any of the Gentlemens voices that were about <hi>Philip,</hi> but
would yerk at them with his heels; whereupon <hi>Philip,</hi> being afraid, bad
them take him away as a wild, untamable, and unprofitable Beast: which
they had done accordingly, had not <hi>Alexander,</hi> that stood by, said, <hi>O Gods!
what a Horse do they turn away for lack of skill, and courage to handle and break
him? Philip</hi> heard what he said, but held his peace. <hi>Alexander</hi> often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those words, and seeming sorry that the Horse should be sent back, <hi>Philip</hi>
said, Why doest thou control them that have more skill and experience than
thy self; and that know better how to handle a Horse than thou doest; <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
answered, <hi>and yet me-thinks I could handle him better than all they have
done.</hi> But if thou canst do no more than they (replied <hi>Philip</hi>) what wilt
thou forfet for thy folly? <hi>I am content</hi> (said <hi>Alexander) to forfeit the price
of the Horse.</hi> Every one laughed to hear his answer, and the match was made
between the Father and the Son. Then ran <hi>Alexander</hi> to the Horse, and took
him by the Bridle, and turned him towards the Sun. It seems he had obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
how mad the Horse was to see his own shadow, which was before, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
before his eyes as he sturred too and fro. Then <hi>Alexander</hi> speaking gently
to the Horse, and clapping him on the back with his hand, till he had left his
fury and snorting, softly let fall his Cloak from him, and lightly leaped on his
back, and so gat up without any danger, and holding the reins of the Bridle
hard, without striking or stirring the Horse, made him to be gentle enough.
And when he perceived that the fury of the Horse was calmed, he put him
forward, and began to Gallop; Then he put him to his full carrier, spurring,
and switching him. <hi>Philip</hi> at first, seeing his Sons confidence, began to
fear lest he should catch any hurt. But when he saw him readily to turn the
Horse at the end of his carrier, and shewing bravery for what he had done,
all the Spectators gave a great shoot for joy: and the Father fell a weeping for
joy: and when <hi>Alexander</hi> was alighted from the Horse, his Father went and
kissed him, saying, <hi>O Son! thou must have a Kingdom that is meet for thee; for</hi>
Macedonia <hi>is not sufficient for thee:</hi> Considering also that he was not to be
rigorously dealt with, and that by gentle means and perswasions he could
make him do what he would, he ever sought rather to perswade than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

resolve to die, than to live in slavery: But <hi>Alexander</hi> gave no respite to these
discontented humours;<note place="margin">He says his Fathers Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</note> For after revenge taken upon the Conspiratours
against his Father, whom he slew upon his Tomb, and the celebration of his
Funerals, he first engaged his <hi>Macedonians</hi> to him by freeing them from all
exactions, and bodily slavery, other than his service in the Wars, and to
others that contemned his youth, he used such austerity, and such clemency
to the rest; that having calmed these neerer discontents, he presently went
into <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and so insinuated himself amongst them, that by the Council
of the States of <hi>Greece,</hi> he was chosen <hi>Captain General</hi> to manage the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Persians,</hi> as his Father had been before him, who was so intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that War, that he had sent over into <hi>Asia</hi> part of his Army under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and <hi>Attalus,</hi> with order to take in some place which might
secure the descent of the rest.</p>
            <p>Upon this enterprise against the <hi>Persians</hi> was <hi>Alexander</hi> wholly busied,<note place="margin">He intends War against <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </note> his
restless thoughts both sleeping and waking, presenting to him the Riches, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and large Dominions which he hoped to attain thereby. Yet was he
again crossed, and retarded by the <hi>Athenians, Thebans,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
who had united themselves against him, hoping by the assistance of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
to recover their former liberty; and they were to this, encouraged by
<hi>Demosthenes,</hi> whom the <hi>Persian</hi> Gold had bribed thereunto. This unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rub, and loss of time was very grievous to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was troubled
that he should turn his Sword from the base and effeminate <hi>Persians,</hi> against
the manly, and famous <hi>Grecians,</hi> of whose assistance in his intended Wars he
had assured himself;<note place="margin">He subdues the <hi>Grecians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> He therefore made such expedition against them, that
himself, with his Army at his heels, brought them the first news of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.
This celerity of his made them begin to stagger, and the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
as they were the first that moved, so were they the first that fainted, and
by their Ambassadours sought to pacifie him. <hi>Alexander</hi> was not long in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving,
but admitted their excuses, and made peace.</p>
            <p>Having now quieted his Borderers on the South, he resolved also to assure
himself of those Nations which lay on the North of <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And other Nations.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
Triballes, Peones, Getes, Agrians,</hi> and others, who by their frequent
incursions had much molested his Father; and withal those, after he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
then divers overthrows, he made peace, or brought them into his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
and yet could he not find the way out of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Thebans,</hi> which had one thousand <hi>Macedonians</hi> in Garrison in their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel,
being impatient of slavery, endeavoured to force it; which <hi>Alexander</hi>
being informed of, hastened to their succour with thirty thousand Foot, all
old Souldiers, and three thousand Horse, and presenting himself before their
City, he gave the <hi>Thebans</hi> time to resolve whether they would have peace or
War, only demanding that they should deliver up to him the two chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries,
<hi>Phoenix</hi> and <hi>Prothytes,</hi> which they took in such scorn, that they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103996:25"/>
demand <hi>Philotas,</hi> and <hi>Antipater,</hi> two of his chief Captains. This so incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Alexander,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And the Tbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans.</note> that whilst he assailed the City before, the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
did the like behind, and so breaking into the City, he slew ninety thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of them, and sold thirty thousand more for slaves, and this he did for a
terrour to the other <hi>Grecians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Arguments were used by <hi>Cleadas</hi> (one of the Prisoners) to disswade
him from destroying the City of <hi>Thebes,</hi> but all proved fruitless; for he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
the City, only out of his respect to learning, he pardoned all of the race
of <hi>Pindarus</hi> the Poet, and set at liberty <hi>Timoclea,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Theagines,</hi>
who died in the defence of the liberty of <hi>Greece</hi> against his Father <hi>Philip.</hi>
This Noble Woman,<note place="margin">A brave Example.</note> being taken by a <hi>Thracian,</hi> and ravished, he threatned
to kill her unless she would discover her Treasure to him: She led him to a
Well, and told him that she had cast it therein, and when he stooped to look
into the Well, she thrust him in, and stoned him to Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> shortly after at a Common Council of <hi>Greece,</hi> being chosen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
a second time against the <hi>Persians,</hi> went to visit <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Philosopher,
there. Then returned into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where, in a Town called <hi>Dios,</hi> as he
was wholly taken up with thoughts of subduing <hi>Asia,</hi> there appeared to him
in his Sleep the resemblance of the High Priest of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Vision.</note> who bad him be
couragious and bold, and speedily with his Army to put over into <hi>Asia,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
that he would be his Conductor in the Conquest of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire,
as <hi>Alexander</hi> himself reported.</p>
            <p>All being now quieted at home,<note place="margin">He goes into <hi>Asia.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Alexander</hi> leaving the Government of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
and <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Antipater,</hi> in the beginning of the Spring he passed the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spont,</hi>
and being ready to dis-imbark, he threw a Dart towards the <hi>Asian</hi> shore,
as a token of defiance, commanding his Souldiers not to wast, and destroy the
Country, or to burn those buildings which themselves were presently, and in
future to possess. Then landed he his Army consisting of thirty two
thousand Foot, and five thousand Horse, all old Souldiers, neer unto <hi>Troy,</hi>
where he offered a sacrifice upon the Tomb of <hi>Achilles,</hi> his Maternal An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestor.</p>
            <p>But before he left his own Country,<note place="margin">His cruelty.</note> he put to death, without an offence
given him, all his Mother in Laws Kinsmen, whom his Father had greatly
advanced, not sparing such of his own as he suspected, thinking by unjust cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
to secure himself for the present, and future: Yet the end fell out contrary
to the Policy which his Ambition taught him, though well agreeing with the
Justice of God:<note place="margin">Gods Justice.</note> For within a few years all that he had planted was rooted up;
those whom he most trusted were most Traiterous: His Mother, Friends and
Children fell by such another merciless Sword as his own, and all manner
of confusion followed his dead Body to the Grave, and left him there.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Darius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> his Pride.</note> The King of <hi>Persia,</hi> was informed that <hi>Alexander</hi> was landed
in <hi>Asia,</hi> he so much scorned the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Army, and contemned <hi>Alexander</hi>
himself, that writing to him, he stiled him his Servant, and reprehended him
for his presumption, and disloyalty (For <hi>Darius</hi> Intitled himself <hi>King of Kings,
and Kinsman of the Gods</hi>) and withal, he wrote to his Lieutenants in the Lesser
<hi>Asia,</hi> that they should take <hi>Alexander</hi> alive, whip him with Rods, and then
convey him to his presence; that they should sink his Ships, and send his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi>
prisoners beyond the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding these brags <hi>Alexander</hi> soon discovered what manner of
men the <hi>Persians</hi> were: For two of <hi>Darius</hi> his Generals [<hi>Spithredates</hi> and <hi>Rhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces</hi>]
at the River of <hi>Granick</hi> (which severs the Territories of <hi>Troy</hi> from <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis</hi>)
with a huge Army both of Horfe and Foot, sought to stop his passage,
taking the higher ground, and the bank of the River to defend, which <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
was forced to climb up unto from out of the Channel,<note place="margin">His Victory at <hi>Granick.</hi>
               </note> yet was his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
so easie, that the <hi>Persians</hi> flying, he slew twenty thousand of the Foot, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103996:25"/>
two thousand five hundred Horsemen, with the loss of twelve of his own
Foot, and two and twenty of his Horsemen, which shews that the <hi>Persians</hi>
were rather killed in their backs whilst they ran away, than hurt in their
bosoms by resisting.</p>
            <p>It was wisely done of <hi>Alexander</hi> to pass this River of <hi>Granick</hi> in the face of
the enemy, without seeking any other place, or means to convey his men
over. For having beaten the <hi>Asiaticks</hi> upon their own ground, he did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
cut off no less of their reputation, than of their strength, leaving the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of such Cowards without hope of Succour.</p>
            <p>Presently after this Victory,<note place="margin">He wins many Cities, and Countries.</note> he recovered <hi>Sardis; Ephesus,</hi> and the City of
the <hi>Trallians,</hi> and <hi>Magnesia,</hi> all which were soon rendred to him, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
he received with great grace, suffering them to be governed by their
own Laws: and about the same time, by <hi>Parmenio,</hi> he wan <hi>Miletus,</hi> and by
force took in <hi>Halicarnasseus,</hi> which because it resisted obstinately, he razed it
to the ground. From thence he went into <hi>Caria,</hi> where <hi>Ada,</hi> the Queen,
who had been cast out of all that she held (except the City of <hi>Alinda</hi>) by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
his Leiutenants,<note place="margin">The Queen of <hi>Caria</hi> Adopts him.</note> presented her self to him, and adopted him for her Son,
and Successour, which <hi>Alexander</hi> took so kindly that he left the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to her disposal. Then entred he into <hi>Lycia,</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and assured
to him all the Sea-coasts, and subjecting to him <hi>Pisidia,</hi> he steared his course
towards <hi>Darius</hi> vvho (as he was informed) vvas marching towards him with
a marvellous great Army) by the vvay of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and this he might the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
do, for that his first Victory had laid under his feet all the Provinces of
<hi>Asia</hi> the less, which bordered upon the Sea-coast.</p>
            <p>Then gave he order for the setling and Government of <hi>Lycia,</hi> and <hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
and so marching towards the North, he entred <hi>Celenas,</hi> seated on the
River <hi>Meander,</hi> which was abandoned to him, only the Castle held out,
which yet after forty days, vvas surrendred to him also: for so long time he
gave them to attend succour from <hi>Darius.</hi> From <hi>Celenas,</hi> he passed on thorow
<hi>Phrygia</hi> towards the <hi>Euxine Sea,</hi> till he came to the City of <hi>Gordium,</hi> somtimes
the Regal City of King <hi>Midas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He cuts the <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot.</note> vvhere he found the <hi>Gordian</hi> Knot, which
when he knew not hovv to undo, he cut it asunder vvith his Svvord: For
there vvas an old Prophesie vvhich promised him that could unty it, the
Lordship of all <hi>Asia:</hi> vvhereupon <hi>Alexander,</hi> not respecting the manner so it
vvere done, assumed to himself the fulfilling of the Prophesie by hevving it in
pieces.</p>
            <p>Novv before he left this part of <hi>Asia</hi> to go to the East,<note place="margin">He Conquers the Islands.</note> he took care to clear
the Sea-coast on his back, and to thrust the <hi>Persians</hi> out of the Islands of <hi>Lesbos,
Chio,</hi> and <hi>Coos,</hi> the charge vvhereof he committed to tvvo of his Captains,
giving them such directions as he judged most meet for that service, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
to them fifty Talents for defraying the charges thereof: and vvithal,
out of the spoil gotten by his first Victory, he sent sixty Talents more to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater,</hi>
vvhom he had left for the Government of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> From
<hi>Celenas</hi> he vvent to <hi>Ancira,</hi> standing on the same River of <hi>Sanguarius,</hi> vvhich
runs through <hi>Gordium:</hi> there he mustered his Army, and so entred into <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagonia,</hi>
vvhose Inhabitants submitted themselves to him, and thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
freedom from Tribute. There he left <hi>Catus</hi> Governour vvith one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of <hi>Macedonians</hi> newly come to him.</p>
            <p>Here he heard of the Death of <hi>Memnon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Memnon</hi> dies.</note> 
               <hi>Darius</hi>'s Lieutenant, which much
encouraged him to pass on towards him: For of this one Commander he had
more respect than of all the multitude assembled by <hi>Darius,</hi> and of all the
Captains he had besides. Then did he travel hastily towards <hi>Cilicia,</hi> with a
desire to recover the Streights thereof before <hi>Darius</hi> should arrive there.
The Governour of <hi>Cilicia</hi> hearing of <hi>Alexanders</hi> hasty march, left some
Companies to keep the Streights, which were indeed very defensible, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103996:26"/>
now (though too late) began to prize, and put in Execution the advice of
<hi>Memnon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel neglected.</note> who in the beginning of the Wars, had counselled to wast all the
provisions both for Man, and Horse that could not be conveyed into strong
holds, and always to give ground to the Invader, till he found some such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
advantage as might secure to him the Victory. <hi>For the fury of an inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
army is best broken by delays, change of diet, and want, and other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
bringing, and breeding many diseases upon all Nations out of their own
Country.</hi> And had <hi>Darius</hi> kept the <hi>Macedonians</hi> but a while without meat,
and sleep, refusing to give or take Battel, and had wearied them with his light
Horsemen (as the <hi>Parthians</hi> afterwards did the <hi>Romans</hi>) in all probability he might
have saved both his life, and Estate. For it was one of the greatest encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
given by <hi>Alexander</hi> to his <hi>Macedonians</hi> before the third, and last fatal Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
that they were now to fight with all the strength of <hi>Persia</hi> at once.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But where God hath a purpose to destroy, wise men are taken away, and the
charge of things is committed unto such as either cannot see what is for their
good, or that know not how to put in execution any sound advice;</hi> the courte which
<hi>Memnon</hi> had propounded, must in all liklyhood have brought the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
into great straits, and stopt them at those narrow passages of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> For
had <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonia</hi> being wasted when <hi>Alexander</hi> was far off, and
the Streights of <hi>Cilicia</hi> been defended by <hi>Arsenes</hi> with his best Souldiers, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
would not have suffered the enemy to stay the tryal of all means for the
forcing of that passage: Or if the place could not have been defended,
yet might <hi>Cilicia</hi> at leasure have been throughly spoiled, that the heart of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi>
Army should have been broken, whilest they sought out miseries by
painful travel.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Arsenes</hi> leaving a small number to defend the Streights, took the best
of his Army with him to wast and spoil the Country; or rather, as it seemed,
to make himself some work, under which pretence he might with honesty
run the further from <hi>Alexander;</hi> And in truth he so handled the matter, that
he gave cause to the <hi>Cicilians</hi> to wish for <hi>Alexanders</hi> coming, and as great
cause to the Keepers of the Passage not to hinder it. For <hi>Cowards are wise in
apprehending all forms of danger.</hi> These Guardians of the Streights, hearing
that <hi>Arsenes</hi> hasted to joyn himself with <hi>Darius,</hi> burning down all as he went,
as one despairing to defend it, began to think, that surely their General (who
gave for lost the Country behind their backs) had exposed themselves to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ruin, as men that were fit only to dull the Swords of the <hi>Macedonians;</hi>
Wherefore, not being ambitious to die for their Prince and Country (which
honour they saw that <hi>Arsenes</hi> himself could well forbear) they presently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the footsteps of their General, gleaning what he had left. And thus
<hi>Alexander</hi> without hazard, got, both the entrance into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> abandoned by
the cowardliness of his enemies,<note place="margin">The Streights of <hi>Cilicia</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> and also that whole Province whose minds
were now alienated from the <hi>Persians</hi> through the imprudent carriage of
<hi>Arsenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> with great speed was come to <hi>Tarsus,</hi> taking pleasure
in the River <hi>Cydnus,</hi> which ran through the City, all hot as he was, he threw
off his Armour, and leaped into the cold water, whereupon he grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
so benumb in all the Nerves of his Body, that he lost the use of
his Tongue; and so far was he from hope of recovery, that nothing was
expected but present Death: But one <hi>Philip</hi> a Physician, gave him a Potion,
which he took, and it cured him out of hand, though <hi>Parmenio</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
him, that this <hi>Philip</hi> was set on work to poison him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Darius</hi> approached,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> his Army.</note> having gathered together an Army
of two hundred and ninety thousand men of divers Nations (saith <hi>Q. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>)
or of three hundred thousand Foot, and one hundred thousand Horse,
(as <hi>Justine</hi> numbers them,) Or of six hundred thousand, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:103996:26"/>
The manner of his coming was rather like a Masker,<note place="margin">The manner of his March.</note> than a man of War; and
like one that took more care to shew his Glory and Riches, than to provide for
his own safety. For before his Army there were carried the holy Fire,
which the <hi>Persians</hi> worshipped for their God; attended by their Priests,
and after them three hundred sixty and five young men, answering to the
days of the year, clothed in Skarlet. Then the Chariot of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> drawn
with white Horses, with their Riders clothed in white, and carrying Rods of
Gold in their hands. Next after them came the Horse of the Sun, and after
him ten sumptuous Chariots Inlay'd and garnished with Gold and Silver:<note place="margin">His Pride and Folly,</note> and
then the Vaunt Guard of their Horse, compounded of twelve several Nations,
which, the better to avoid confusion, did hardly understand one anothers
Language, and these, marshelled in the head of the rest, being beaten,
might serve very fitly to disorder all that followed them. In the tail of these,
marched the Regiment of foot stiled by the <hi>Persians, Immortal;</hi> because if any
died, their place was presently supplied by others; and these were armed
with chains of Gold, and theit Coats embroidered with the same, having
their sleeves garnished with Pearl: Baits fit either to intice the poor <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi>
or to perswade them that it were great incivility to cut or deface such goodly Garments.</p>
            <p>Then marched after them fifteen thousand, more rich and glittering than
the former, but apparelled like Women, and these were honoured with the
Title of the <hi>Kings Kinsmen.</hi> Then came <hi>Darius</hi> himself with the Gentlemen
of his Guard-robe, riding before his Chariot, which was supported by the
Gods of his Nation, cast and cut in pure Gold: the head of this Chariot was
set with precious Stones, with two Golden Idols, covered with an open
winged Eagle of the same mettal. The hinder part being raised high, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Darius</hi> sat, had a covering of inestimable valew.</p>
            <p>This Chariot of the Kings was followed with ten thousand Horsemen, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lances plated with Silver, and their heads guilt. He had for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Guard of his own Person, two hundred of the blood Royal: blood too
Royal, and precius to be spilt in any Noble adventure, and these were back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with thirty thousand Footmen, after whom again were led four hundred
spare Horses for the Kings own use. Then followed the Rereward, being led
by <hi>Sisygambis,</hi> the Kings Mother, and by his Wife, drawn in glorious, and
glittering Chariots, followed by a great train of Ladies on Horseback, with
fifteen rich Wagons of the Kings Children, and the Wives of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
waited upon by two hundred and fifty Concubines, and a World of
Nurses, and Eunuches most sumptuously apparelled: Between these, and
a Company of slight Armed Slaves, was the Kings Treasure, loaden on six
hundred Mules and three hundred Camels.</p>
            <p>In this sort came this May-game King into the field, encumbred with a
most unnecessary train of Sumpters, attended with Troops of divers Nations,
speaking divers Languages, impossible to be well Marshalled by reason of
their numbers, and for the most part so effeminate, and so rich in Gold
and costly Garments, as the same could not but have encouraged the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedst
Nation against them.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> met with these effeminate <hi>Asiaticks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Alexander <hi>beats</hi> Dartus.</note> it may easily be
guessed what a cheap Victory he had over them. Some say that he slew
in this Battel sixty thousand Footmen, and ten thousand Horsemen., Q. <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
saith, an hundred thousand Foot, with as many Horsemen, and took
forty thousand Prisoners, whilest of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Army there miscarried but
two hundred and eighty of all sorts, of which number some Historians
cut off almost one half. He took Prisoners also <hi>Darius</hi> his Mother, Wife,
Daughters, and other the Kings Children. <hi>Darius</hi> by this time found it true,
that <hi>Charidemus,</hi> a banished <hi>Grecian</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> had told him when he made a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103996:27"/>
view of his Army about <hi>Babylon,</hi> to wit, That the multitude which he
had assembled of divers Nations, richly attired but poorly Armed, would
be found more terrible to the Countries through which they should pass,
than to the <hi>Macedonians</hi> whom they went to assail, who being all old,
Well-disciplined Souldiers, imbattelled in gross Squadrons, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their <hi>Phalanx,</hi> well covered with Armour for defence, and furnished with
advantagious Weapons for offence, would make so little account of his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<hi>Persians,</hi> ill Armed, and worse Disciplin'd, that except he would (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such abundance of Treasure) entertain a sufficient number of the
same <hi>Grecians,</hi> and so encounter the <hi>Macedonians</hi> with men of equal cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
he would repent overlate, as taught by the miserable success like
to follow.</p>
            <p>But so unpleasing was this discourse to <hi>Darius,</hi> (who used to hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but his own praises) that he caused this poor <hi>Grecian</hi> to be present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <hi>Darius</hi> his cruelty.</note> who whilst he was under the Tormentors hand, said, to the King,
that <hi>Alexander,</hi> against whom he had given this good counsel, should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
revenge his Death,<note place="margin">and Folly.</note> and deservedly punish <hi>Darius</hi> for refusing this
advise. <hi>Darius</hi> likewise slighted the counsel given him by the <hi>Grecian</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
that served under him, who intreated him not to fight in those streight
places where <hi>Alexander</hi> could bring as many hands to fight as <hi>Darius</hi> could:
and these old Blades, when <hi>Darius</hi> was overthrown with all his cowardly,
and confused Rabble, under their Captain <hi>Amyntas,</hi> held firm, and made a
brave retreat in despite of the vanquishers.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Grecians</hi> also after their retreat, advised <hi>Darius</hi> to draw back his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
into the plains of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> where he might have environed the
<hi>Macedonians</hi> on all sides with his multitudes; they counselled him also to
divide his huge Army into parts, and not to cast his Empire upon one Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this advise was so contrary to the cowardly spirits of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi>
that they perswaded <hi>Darius</hi> to environ these <hi>Greeks</hi> with his Army,
and to cut them in pieces as Traitors. But <hi>Darius</hi> was so infatuated that
he would needs fight with <hi>Alexander</hi> in such a streight place, neer unto the
City of <hi>Issus,</hi> where he could bring no more hands to fight than <hi>Alexander</hi>
could (who by the advice of <hi>Parmenio</hi> staid there as in a place of advantage)
whereby he was utterly overthrown, his Treasure lost, his Wife, Mother,
and Children (whom the <hi>Grecians</hi> had perswaded him to leave in <hi>Babylon</hi>)
taken Prisoners, and all their train of Ladies spoiled of their rich Garments,
Jewels, and Honour. Indeed the Queen, with her Daughters, who had
the good hap to be brought to <hi>Alexanders</hi> presence, were entertained with
all respect due unto them, their Honours preserved, and their Jewels, and
rich Garments restored; and though the Queen was a most beautiful Lady,
and her Daughters of excellent features,<note place="margin">Alexanders <hi>Chastity.</hi>
               </note> yet <hi>Alexander</hi> mastered his affections
towards them all: Only he embraced the Wife of the Valiant <hi>Memnon,</hi>
who was lately dead, she being taken by <hi>Parmenio,</hi> as she fled from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus,</hi>
at which time the Daughters of <hi>Ochus,</hi> who reigned before <hi>Darius,</hi>
and the Wives and Children of almost all the Nobility of <hi>Persia,</hi> fell into
Captivity, together with the Treasure of <hi>Darius</hi> (not taken at <hi>Issus</hi>) was
seized upon, amounting to six thousand and two hundred Talents in ready
Coin, and in Bullion, five hundred Talents, with a world of Riches besides.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parmenio</hi> also in his Letter to <hi>Alexander</hi> sent him word, that amongst
other things, he had taken at <hi>Damascus</hi> three hundred twenty nine of the
Kings Women, which were Skilful in Musick; forty six Weavers, or Knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> to honour his beloved <hi>Ephestion,</hi> gave him power to dispose of the

upon his Host with whom he quartered;<note place="margin">A notable Example.</note> But the Man, not being of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

hard by, a good, and a wise man, but very poor, and one that lives by his hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</hi>
Then did <hi>Ephestion</hi> (taking Kingly apparrel along with him) go to this
poor Man, and saluted him King, bidding him, wash off his dirt, and put off
his rags, and put on that Royal Apparel; The poor Mans name was <hi>Abdolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi>
who thought he had been in a dream, but being by the standers by,
washed, and adorned, <hi>Ephestion</hi> led him into the Pallace, saying, <hi>When thou
sittest on thy Throne, and hast power over the lives of all thy Subjects, forget not thy
former condition. Alexander</hi> hearing of it, sent for him, and asked him, with
what pacience, he, being of so Noble an Extraction, could bear his former
poverty? To whom <hi>Abdolominus</hi> answered; <hi>I pray God that I may bear the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
with the same mind.</hi> For (said he) <hi>these hands have provided for my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
and as I had nothing, so I wanted nothing.</hi>

            <p>While <hi>Alexander</hi> staid in those parts,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> desires Peace, which <hi>Alexander</hi> rejected.</note> he received a Letter from <hi>Darius,</hi>
wherein he desired to ransom his Mother, Wife, and Children, with some
other conditions of Peace, but such as rather became a Conqueror, than one
who had been so shamefully beaten, not vouchsafing in the Endorsement to
give <hi>Alexander</hi> the Title of King. <hi>Alexander</hi> disdained his offers, and sent him
word, that he was not only a King, but the King of <hi>Darius</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> came neer the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> he received from them the
present of a Golden Crown, and great store of Victuals, with some other
things, which he took very thankfully, sending them word, that he desired
to offer a Sacrifice to <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Protector of their City, from whom he
was descended. The <hi>Tyrians,</hi> not liking his presence within their Walls,
returned answer, that the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> was seated where the old
City stood;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tyre</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> but <hi>Alexander</hi> was resolved to enter <hi>Tyre</hi> by force, though
in most mens Judgments the City was impregnable; for the Island where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it was built, was eight hundred furlongs from the Land, yet with the
labor of many hands, having great store of Stone from old <hi>Tyre,</hi> and Timber
sufficient from <hi>Libanus,</hi> he stopped up the passage between the Island and
the Main, being more than once carried away by Storms, and sometimes fired
by the <hi>Tyrians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">and taken</note> yet with the help of his Navy, he overcame all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and prevailed, having spent seven moneths in that attempt. The <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
in the beginning of the Siege, had barbarously drowned some Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
sent by <hi>Alexander</hi> to perswade them to yield, in respect whereof, and
of his great loss of time and men,<note place="margin">Alexanders <hi>rigor.</hi>
               </note> he put eight thousand to the Sword,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103996:28"/>
and caused two thousand of those that had escaped the first fury, to be
hanged on Crosses upon the Sea-shore, and reserved for slaves thirteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
some say thirty thousand, and many more of them had died, if the <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi>
that served <hi>Alexander,</hi> had not conveyed great numbers of them by
shipping to their own City. <hi>Alexander</hi> gave the Government of this Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to <hi>Philotas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Parmenio, Ephestion</hi> had the charge of the Fleet, and
was commanded to meet <hi>Alexander</hi> at <hi>Gaza</hi> in the way to <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Alexander</hi> lay at the Siege of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> he sent to <hi>Jaddus,</hi> the High
Priest at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> demanding of him supplies, and provisions for his Army;
and withal, such Tribute as they formerly paid to <hi>Darius:</hi> But when <hi>Jaddus</hi>
answered, that he was tyed by a former Oath of Allegiance to <hi>Darius,</hi> from
which he could not be free so long as <hi>Darius</hi> lived: <hi>Alexander</hi> growing
wroth at this answer, swore, that as soon as he had taken <hi>Tyrus,</hi> he would
march against <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time also came <hi>Sanballat,</hi> the <hi>Cuthaean</hi> to <hi>Alexander;</hi> who,
haing forsaken <hi>Darius,</hi> brought with him eight thousand men: Him did
<hi>Alexander</hi> receive very graciously; Whereupon he asked leave of him to
build a Temple upon his own Land, and to make high Priest thereof,
his Son in Law, <hi>Manasses,</hi> who was Brother to <hi>Jaddus,</hi> the High Prist at
<hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and having obtained leave, because he now grew old, he fell
presently to work, and built a Temple, and made <hi>Manasses</hi> High Priest
of it, thinking hereby to leave a great Honour to the Posterity of his
Daughter.</p>
            <p>In the mean while <hi>Darius</hi> sends again to <hi>Alexander,</hi> setting before him
all difficulties he should meet with in his passing on to the East,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond message.</note> laying
the loss of the late Battel to the streightness of the place: He bids him
to consider how impossible it was for him to pass the Rivers of <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
Tygris, Araxes,</hi> &amp;c. with all such other dreadful things as he thought
might discourage him. Moreover he profered to him all the Kingdoms
which lay between the River <hi>Halis,</hi> and the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> as a Dower with
his beloveed Daughter:<note place="margin">Rejected by <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </note> But <hi>Alexander</hi> rejected all, saying, <hi>That he profer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him nothing but what already was his own, and what Victory, and his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
had possessed him of. That he was in a capacity to give conditions, and
not to receive any: and that having passed the Sea it self, he disdained to
think of resistance in transporting his Army over Rivers.</hi> Indeed <hi>Parmenio,</hi>
who was now old, and full of Honour and Riches, told the King, that
if he were <hi>Alexander</hi> he would embrace the offers of <hi>Darius;</hi> to which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
answered, that so would he if he were <hi>Parmenio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Alexander</hi> march on towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> and when he came to

against him, and defended the Town with a Noble Resolution, at the
Siege whereof <hi>Alexander</hi> received a wound in the shoulder which was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and a blow on his Leg with a stone. He found better men in
this place than he had done in the former Battels: For he left so many
of his <hi>Macedonians</hi> buried in the Sands of <hi>Gaza,</hi> that he was fain to send
for a new supply into <hi>Greece.</hi> Here it was that <hi>Alexander</hi> began to
shew his cruelty:<note place="margin">and taken.</note> For after he had taken <hi>Gaza</hi> by assault, and <hi>Getes</hi> the
Governour, who was weakened with divers wounds, and who never

                  <hi>Alexanders</hi> cruelty.</note> 
               <hi>Alexander</hi> caused holes to be bored
through his feet, and himself to be dragged about the streets whilst he
was yet alive, who being as Valiant a man as himself, scorned to ask
him either for life, or the mitigation of his Torments.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Gaza Alexander</hi> led his Army towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </note> a City for the
Antiquity, and great fame thereof, well known unto him; while he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103996:28"/>
lay before <hi>Tyre,</hi> he had sent for some supplies thither, which <hi>Jaddus</hi> the
High Priest, being Subject, and Sworn to <hi>Darius,</hi> had refused him. The
<hi>Jews</hi> therefore fearing revenge, and unable to resist, committed the care
of their Lives and Estates to <hi>Jaddus,</hi> who had recourse to God by Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
and Sacrifices for the Common safety; and was by him warned
in a Dream that he should make Holy-day in the City, and set the
Gates wide open, and that he and the rest of the Priests, every one in
his Priestly Raiment, and the People all clothed in white, should go forth
and meet <hi>Alexander;</hi> and accordingly he Issued out of the City, arrayed
in his Pontifical Robes, to wit, an upper garment of Purple, Embroidered
with Gold, with his Mitre, and the Plate of Gold, wherein was engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Name of God, the Priests and Levites also in their rich Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the People in White Garments, in a manner so unusual, state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and grave, as <hi>Alexander</hi> greatly admired it; and when he came neer
to the High Priest,<note place="margin">and Worships the High Priest.</note> he fell to the ground before him, as reverencing the
Name of God, and when <hi>Parmenio</hi> reproved him for it, <hi>Alexander</hi> told
him, that in <hi>Dios,</hi> a City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> his mind being busied about the
Conquest of <hi>Asia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Vision.</note> he saw in his sleep such a Person as <hi>Jaddus,</hi> and so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled,
by whom he was encouraged to pursue his purpose, with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Victory; and now beholding with his bodily eyes him who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was only represented to his fancy, he was so exceedingly pleased, and
encouraged, as (contrary to the expectation of the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to have sackt,<note place="margin">His favour to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </note> and destroyed <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) he gave the <hi>Jews</hi> all, and
more than all that they desired; During his abode there, <hi>Jaddus</hi> shewed
him the Prophesie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> wherein he saw himself; and his Conquest
of <hi>Persia</hi> so directly pointed at, as that nothing from thenceforth could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affright, or discourage him therein.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Alexander</hi> assembled the People, and bad them ask what
they would of him: But they asked nothing but that they might live
according to the Laws of their own Country, and that every seventh year
(vvherein they were to have no harvest) they might be exempted from
paying any Tribute, all which he granted. And when they asked fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he would suffer the <hi>Jews,</hi> vvhich dwelt in the Countries of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> to live according to their own Rites and Laws, he
answered that he vvould satisfie their desires in that point also, so soon
as he should get those Countries into his power. And vvhen he told them,
that if any of them vvould follovv him in his Wars, they should use their
own Rites vvheresoever they came, many listed themselves to serve him.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Jerusalem Alexander</hi> turned again towards <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

and all other the Kings Riches; and vvhen <hi>Alexander</hi> had set things in

so foolish had prosperity made him. He vvas to pass over dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and dry Sands, vvhere, vvhen the Water vvhich he brought on

Indeed it nevever Rains in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but the purposes of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Its said also that vvhen he had lost his vvay in those vast Desarts, a flight
of Crows flew before his Army, making sometimes more, sometimes less

            <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> came neer the place,<note place="margin">His Pride.</note> he sent some of his <hi>Parasites</hi> to
corrupt the Priests attending the Oracle, that their answer might be given
in all things according to his mad ambition, vvho affected to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103996:29"/>
the Son of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> and accordingly he was saluted <hi>Jupiters</hi> Son,
by the Devils Prophet, for which he was richly rewarded, and presently
a rumour was spread abroad, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> had owned him for his Child:
and the better to confirm his followers in the belief of his Deity, he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned
the Priests to give answer to such as consulted with the Oracle, that
it would be very pleasing to <hi>Jupiter</hi> to Honour <hi>Alexander</hi> as his Son. But this
is certain, and very observable, that at <hi>Christs</hi> coming, and at the first preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel,<note place="margin">The power of the Gospel.</note> the Devil in this, and in all other his Oracles became speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
            <p>From the Temple of <hi>Hammon, Alexander</hi> returned to <hi>Memphis,</hi> where among
many other learned men, he heard the Philosopher <hi>Psammones,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that he affected the Title of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Son, told him, that God was
the Father King of all men: and, refining the Pride of this haughty King, he
brought him to acknowledg, that God was the Father of all mortal men, but
that he acknowledgeth none for his Children, save good men.</p>
            <p>The charge of the several Provinces of <hi>Egypt, Alexander</hi> gave to several Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,
following therein the Rules of his Master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that <hi>a great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
should not be continued in the hands of any one man;</hi> Then gave he order
for the building of <hi>Alexandria</hi> upon the most Westernly branch of <hi>Nilus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexandria</hi> built.</note> and
thus having setled (as he could) the State of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with the Kingdoms of the
Lesser <hi>Asia, Phoenicia,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> he Conducted his Army towards <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He passeth <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
               </note>
which passage (though the same was committed to <hi>Mazeus</hi> to be defended
by him) yet did he abandon it, and <hi>Alexander</hi> without resistance, passed it.
From thence he marched towards <hi>Tygris,</hi> a River, for the swiftness thereof,
called by the <hi>Persians, The Arrow:</hi> here might <hi>Darius</hi> easily have repelled him;
for the violent course of the stream was such, as it drave before it many weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
stones, and those that moved not, but lay in the bottom were so round,
and smooth by continual rolling, that no man was able to fight upon so slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
a standing: Nor were the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Footmen able to wade through
the River, otherwise than by joyning their hands, and interlacing their Arms
each in others, making thereby one intire, and weighty Body to resist the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuousness
of the stream; and besides this; the Channel was so deep towards
the Eastern Shore,<note place="margin">And <hi>Tygris.</hi>
               </note> where <hi>Darius</hi> should have opposed him, that the Footmen
were enforced to lift their Bows, Arrows, and Darts over their Heads to keep
them from being made unserviceable by the Water. Indeed it cannot be denied,
that as all Estates of the World, by the surfeit of misgovernment, have been
subject to many grievous, and sometimes, mortal diseases: So had the
Empire of <hi>Persia</hi> at this time brought it self into a burning Feavour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
became frantick, and without understanding, foreshewing manifestly the
death, and dissolution thereof.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Alexander</hi> had now recovered the Eastern Shore of <hi>Tygris</hi> without
any opposition but what the Nature of the River made, where <hi>Mazeus,</hi> who
had the charge to defend the banks, both of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
himself to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> being attended with certain Troops
of Horsemen, as if with uneven forces, he durst have charged them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
even ground, when as with a multitude far exceeding them he forsook
those advantages which no valour of the enemy could easily have overcome.
But <hi>its commonly seen that timorous and cowardly Persons do ever follow those ways,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Base cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.</note>
               <hi>and counsels, whereof the opportunity is already lost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its true, that he sets all provisions on fire wherewith the <hi>Macedonians</hi>
might be assisted in their passage over <hi>Tygris,</hi> thinking thereby greatly to
have distressed them: but the execution of good counsel is fruitless, when
unseasonable. For now was <hi>Alexander</hi> so well furnished with carriages,
that no conveniences were wanting to the Army which he conducted.
Those things also which <hi>Mazeus</hi> now sought to destroy, <hi>Alexander</hi> being in

sight,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> his new Army.</note> by his Horsemen, saved and recovered them. This <hi>Mazeus</hi> might
have done some days before at good leasure; yea, at this time he might
have done it with so great a strength of Horsemen, as the <hi>Macedonians</hi> might
not have dared to pursue, leaving the Body of their Foot out of sight, and so
far behind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius</hi> upon <hi>Alexanders</hi> first return out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had assembled all those
Forces which the Countries next to him could afford; and now also were
the <hi>Arians, Scythians, Indians,</hi> and other Nations come to him. Nations
(saith <hi>Curtius</hi>) that rather served to make up a number, than to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
Some reckon them to amount to the number of ten hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and four hundred thousand Horse, besides armed Chariots, and
some few Elephants. <hi>Curtius</hi> numbers them but two hundred thousand Foot,
and about fifty thousand Horse, which is more probable: And yet seeing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
had more confidence in the number, than in the Valour of his Souldiers,
probably he had brought together some three or four hundred thousand of all
sorts, with which, he hoped in those fair plains of <hi>Assyria,</hi> to have overborn
the small number of the invading Army. But its most true, <hi>That in every
Battel skil and practice do more towards attaining the Victory, than multitudes, and
rude audacity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilest <hi>Alexander</hi> rested,<note place="margin">An <hi>Eclipse</hi> frightens the <hi>Macedonians.</hi>
               </note> and refreshed his Army after their hard passage
over <hi>Tygris,</hi> their happened an <hi>Eclipse</hi> of the Moon, at which the <hi>Macedonians</hi>
(being ignorant of the cause, and reason of it) were much troubled; taking
it as a certain presage of their ruin and destruction, insomuch as they began not
only to murmur, but to speak boldly, that to satisfie the ambition of one man,
and of such a one as disdained <hi>Philip</hi> for his Father, and would needs be called
the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> they should all perish: For he enforced them, not only to
War against a world of enemies, but against Rivers, Mountains, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
themselves.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was now ready to advance, made an halt, and to
quiet the minds of the multitude, he led before him the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Astrologers,
that by them the Souldiers might be assured that this <hi>Eclipse</hi> of the Moon, was
a sure presage of his good success. But they never informed them that it came to
pass by natural causes, but reserved that as a secret fit to be kept among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
These Astrologers gave no other reason for it than this, That the <hi>Grecians</hi>
were under the Aspect of the Sun, and the <hi>Persians</hi> under that of the Moon, and
therefore the Moon losing her light, did foreshew that the state of <hi>Persia</hi> was
now in danger of falling, and their Glory of being obscured. This being noised
through all the Army, every man was satisfied, and quieted, and their courage
redoubled.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Alexander</hi> drew near the <hi>Persian</hi> Army, certain Letters were intercepted,
written by <hi>Darius</hi> to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> proffering and promising them a great sum
of money, if they would either kill or betray <hi>Alexander.</hi> But these, by the
advice of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> were suppressed.</p>
            <p>About this time also <hi>Darius</hi> his beautiful Wife,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> his Wife died.</note> being oppressed with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and wearied with travel, died: which accident <hi>Alexander</hi> seemed to
bewail no less then <hi>Darius:</hi> who, upon the first report of it, suspected, that some
dishonorable violence had been offered to her; but being satisfied by an Eunuch
of his own that attended her, of <hi>Alexanders</hi> kind, and Kingly respect towards her
from the very time of her being taken, he prayed the immortal Gods, that if
they had decreed to set a new Master over the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, that then it would
please them to confer it on so just &amp; chast an enemy as was <hi>Alexander,</hi> to whom,
once more before the last tryal by Battel, he offered these conditions of peace.</p>
            <p>That if he would marry his Daughter,<note place="margin">Proposals to <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </note> he would deliver, and resign up to him
all <hi>Asia</hi> the less, with <hi>Egypt,</hi> and all those Kingdoms between the <hi>Phaenician</hi> Sea
and the River <hi>Euphrates.</hi> That he would pay him for the Ransom of his Mother,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103996:30"/>
and other Daughters, thirty thousand Talents, and that for performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he would leave his Son <hi>Ochus</hi> in Hostage; and they sought by sundry Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to perswade <hi>Alexander</hi> to accept hereof. <hi>Alexander</hi> causing the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to withdraw, advised with his Councel, yet heard no man speak
but <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who was the very right hand of his good Fortune, and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him to accept of such fair conditions: He told him, that the Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Euphrates</hi> and the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> was a large addition to <hi>Macedonia:</hi> That
the retaining of those <hi>Persian</hi> Prisoners was a great cumber to him; and that
the Treasure offered for them was of far better use than their Persons, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other Arguments, yet <hi>Alexander,</hi> rejected all; though it was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that if he had followed his advice, and set bounds to his ambition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
those limits, he might have been as famous for his virtue, as he was for his
great successes, and might have left a successor of fit age to have enjoyed his
estate, which afterwards, indeed he much enlarged, rather to the greatning
of others than himself, who to assure themselves of what they had Usurped,
left not one of his issue alive within a few years after. Besides, <hi>Alexander</hi> by
going so far into the East, left behind him the reputation which he brought
with him out of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> of a just and prudent Prince: A Prince temperate,
advised, and grateful; and learned by abundance of prosperity, to be a lover
of Wine, of Flatterers, and of extream cruelty.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassadors waited for their answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexanders.</hi> answer.</note> which was to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:
that what curtesies soever he had bestowed upon the Wife, and Children
of <hi>Darius,</hi> proceeded from his own natural clemency, and magnanimity,
without all respect to their Master, but thanks to an enemy was improper:
That he made no Wars against adversity, but against those that resisted
him: Not against Women, and Children, but against armed enemies: And
also that by the reiterated practices of <hi>Darius,</hi> to corrupt his Souldiers, and by
great sums of money, to debauch his Friends to attempt something against
his Person, he had reason to doubt whether the peace offered were really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
yet could he not (were it true and faithful) resolve in hast to accept
of it, seeing <hi>Darius</hi> had Warred against him, not as a King, vvith Royal and
over forces, but as a Traytor, by secret, and base practices. Besides, the
Territories which he offered him were already his own; and if <hi>Darius,</hi> could
beat him back again over <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he would then believe that he offered
him something that was in his power to give: Otherwise he propounded to
himself, as a reward of his enterprizes, all those Kingdoms which <hi>Darius</hi> as
yet had in his possession; wherein, vvhether he was abused by his own hopes
or no, the Battel vvhich he meant to fight the day following, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.
And in conclusion, he told them, that he came into <hi>Asia,</hi> to give
Kingdoms, and not to receive them: That the Heavens could not hold two Suns,
and therefore if <hi>Darius</hi> could be content to acknowledg <hi>Alexander</hi> his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
he might perchance be perswaded to give him condition fit for a second
Person,<note place="margin">His Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
and an Inferiour.</p>
            <p>The Ambassaders being returned with this answer, <hi>Darius</hi> prepares to fight,
and sent <hi>Mazeus</hi> to defend a Pass, which yet he never dared so much as to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.
<hi>Alexander</hi> consulting with his Captains, <hi>Parmenio,</hi> perswaded him to force
the Camp of <hi>Darius</hi> by night, that the multitudes of his enemies might not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
his <hi>Macedonians,</hi> being comparatively but a few. But <hi>Alexander</hi> replied,
that <hi>he scorned to steal a Victory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Valour.</note> 
               <hi>and resolved to bring with him Daylight to witness his
Valour.</hi> Indeed the success commended <hi>Alexanders</hi> resolution, though the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
given by <hi>Parmenio</hi> was more sound. Yet when he came to view the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of his enemies, he began to stagger, and entrenched himself upon a Ground
of advantage, which foolishly the <hi>Persians</hi> had abandoned. And when as <hi>Darius,</hi>
for fear of a <hi>Camizado,</hi> had stood with his men in Armour all the day, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
all sleep in the Night; <hi>Alexander</hi> on the contrary, gave his men rest, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103996:30"/>
store of food, knowing, that Souldiers do better stand to it in fight, if they
have their bellies full of meat and drink: for hunger within, fights more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
than steel without.</p>
            <p>The numbers which <hi>Alexander</hi> had,<note place="margin">They prepare to fight.</note> were about forty thousand Foot, and
seven thousand Horse, which were of the <hi>Europaean</hi> Army: And besides these,
he had <hi>Aegyptians, Syrians, Judaeans,</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> which followed him out
of those Countries. He used but a short speech to his Souldiers to encourage
them, neither need he; For one Victory begets another, and puts courage
into the Conquerors, and taketh away spirits from those that have been beaten.</p>
            <p>Some make large descriptions of this Battel,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> fought at <hi>Gaugamela,</hi> but in
conclusion they tell us but of three hundred of <hi>Alexanders</hi> men that were
slain, and some say less; but of the <hi>Persians</hi> there fell forty thousand:
But what can we judg of this great encounter, other than (as in the two
former Battels at <hi>Granick,</hi> and in <hi>Cilicia</hi>) that the <hi>Persians,</hi> upon the first
charge, ran away, and that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> pursued them. For if that
every man whom <hi>Darius</hi> brought into the Field, had but cast a Dart,
or a Stone, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> could not have bought the Empire of the
East at so easie a rate, as six or seven hundred in three such notorious Battels.
Certainly if <hi>Darius</hi> had fought with <hi>Alexander</hi> upon the Banks of <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and had Armed but fifty or sixty thousand of this great multitude,
only with Spades (for most of his men were fit for no other Weapon) it had
been impossible for <hi>Alexander</hi> to have passed that River so easily, much less
the River of <hi>Tygris.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> But as a man, whose Empire God was putting a Period
to, he abandoned all places of advantage, and suffered <hi>Alexander</hi> to enter so
far into the bowels of his Kingdom, as all hope and possibility of escaping by
retreat being taken from the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> they were put to the choise,
either to Die or Conquer, to which Election <hi>Darius</hi> could no way constrain his
men, seeing they had many large Regions to run into from their Invaders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">and flies.</note> after the rout of his Army, fled to <hi>Arbela</hi> that Night, better attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his flight than in the fight, and to them that fled with him, he propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his purpose of retreating into <hi>Media,</hi> perswading them that the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who were greedy of spoil and riches, would rather attempt <hi>Babylon, Susa,</hi>
and other Cities filled with Treasure, than to pursue the vanquished. This
miserable resolution his Nobility rather obeyed, than approved.</p>
            <p>Soon after the departure of <hi>Darius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arbela</hi> taken and much Treasure.</note> came <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Arbela,</hi> vvhich,
with a great mass of Treasure, and many Princely Ornaments, was surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to him. For the fear which accompanied <hi>Darius,</hi> took nothing with
it but shame, and dishonour. He that had been twice beaten before, should
have sent his Treasure into <hi>Media</hi> rather than to have brought it to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bela,</hi>
so neer the place where he intended to wait the coming of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
If he had been victorious, he might have brought it back at leasure:
But being overcome, he knew it impossible to drive Mules and Camels loaden
with Gold, from the pursuing Enemy, seeing himself, at the overthrow
which he had in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> cast the Crown from his head, to run away the
lighter: <hi>But its easier to reprehend, than to amend what is past.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Arbela,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Babylon</hi> taken.</note> 
               <hi>Alexander</hi> marched towards <hi>Babylon,</hi> where <hi>Mazeus,</hi> in
whom <hi>Darius</hi> had most confidence, rendred to him, himself, his Children,
and the City. Also the Captain of the Castle where the Treasure was kept;
strewed the Streets with Flowers, burnt Frankincense upon the Silver Altars,
as <hi>Alexander</hi> passed by, and delivered to him whatsoever was committed
to his trust. The <hi>Magi</hi> also, who were the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Astrologers, followed
this Captain to entertain their new King: After these, came the <hi>Babylonian</hi>
Horsemen, infinitely rich in attire, but exceeding poor in Warlike furniture.
Between these and himself, <hi>Alexander</hi> caused his <hi>Macedonian</hi> Footmen to
march. When he entred the Castle he admired the Glory thereof, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103996:31"/>
the abundance of Treasure which he found therein, amounting to fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Talents of Silver uncoined. In this City, rich in all things, but most
of all in voluptuous pleasures, the King rested himself and his vvhole Army
thirty four days, spending that time in Banquetting, and in all sorts of
effeminate exercises, which so much softned the minds of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi>
not acquainted till now with such delicacies, as the severe Discipline of War,
which taught them to endure hunger and thirst, painful travel, and hard
lodging, began rather to be forgotten than neglected. <hi>Alexander,</hi> as he
was rowed upon a Lake neer <hi>Babylon</hi> in his Gally, a sudden tempest arising
blew off his Hat, and Crown fastened upon it, into the Lake, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one of the Marriners, leaping into the vvater, swam, and fetched it to
him, and to keep it the drier, he put it upon his own head. <hi>Alexander</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
him with a Talent for saving his Crown;<note place="margin">Base cruelty.</note> but vvithal, caused his
Head to be cut off, for presuming to put his Crown upon it.</p>
            <p>During his abode here, <hi>Alexander</hi> instituted those Regiments consisting of
a thousand Souldiers, appointing Colonels over them, who thereupon were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Chiliarks.</hi> This new order <hi>Alexander</hi> brought in, vvas to honour those Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
which were found by certain Judges, to have deserved best in the late War.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Alexander</hi> vvas yet at <hi>Babylon,</hi> there came to him a great supply out
of <hi>Europe.</hi> For <hi>Antipater</hi> sent him six thousand Foot, and five hundred
Hore out of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> and of the <hi>Thracians</hi> three thousand Foot, and
as many Horse, and out of <hi>Greece</hi> four thousand, and four hundred Horse,
by vvhich his Army vvas greatly strengthened. For those that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the pleasures of <hi>Babylon,</hi> could hardly be brought again to change
their soft beds for hard boards, and the cold ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> left the City and Castle of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with the Territories ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning,
in charge with three of his own Captains, <hi>Agathon, Minetus,</hi> and
<hi>Apolidorus,</hi> leaving a thousand Talents to supply their wants: But to
grace <hi>Mazeus,</hi> who delivered up the City to him, he gave him the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of his Lieutenant General, and took along with him <hi>Bagistines,</hi> who
surrendred the Castle to him; and having distributed to every Souldier
a part of the Treasure, he left <hi>Babylon</hi> and entred into the Province of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapene,</hi>
marching from thence towards <hi>Susa</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> situated on the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Euleus,</hi> which City vvas sometime Governed by the Prophet <hi>Daniel.</hi>
Here <hi>Abulites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Susa</hi> taken.</note> the Governour of this famous City, gave it up to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
with fifty thousand Talents of Silver in Bullion, and twelve E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants
for the War, with all other the Treasure of <hi>Darius</hi> there; such
as the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings had for a long time heaped up together, leaving it
from Father to Son; all which in one hour came into his hands who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cared for it. <hi>In this sort did those Vassals of Fortune; those lovers of
the Kings prosperity, not of his Person, purchase their own peace, and safety
with their Masters Treasure;</hi> and herein was <hi>Alexander</hi> well advised, that
whatsoever Titles he gave to the <hi>Persians,</hi> yet he left all places of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in trust vvith his own Captains, as <hi>Babylon, Susa, Persepolis,</hi> with
other Cities, and Provinces that were Conquered by him: for had <hi>Darius</hi>
but beaten the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in one Battel, all the <hi>Persian</hi> Nobility would have
turned again to their natural Lord.</p>
            <p>Whilest <hi>Alexander</hi> was ransacking <hi>Arbela,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gross folly.</note> 
               <hi>Mazeus</hi> might have furnished
<hi>Darius</hi> from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and whilest he stayed those thirty four days at <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
Abulites</hi> might have holpen him from <hi>Susa:</hi> and whilest he was Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Frolicking there; <hi>Teridates</hi> from <hi>Persepolis</hi> might fully have supplied
him: for the chiefest bulk of his Treasure was laid up in that City: But <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
bind not the ambitious but the honest; for those that are selfish, do in all changes,
consult only the conservation of their own greatness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Government of <hi>Susa,</hi> with the Castle and treasure, <hi>Alexander</hi> committed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103996:31"/>
to his own <hi>Macedonians,</hi> making <hi>Abulites,</hi> who rendred it to him, his Lieutenant,
as he had done <hi>Mazeus</hi> before, giving them Honourable Titles, but neither
trust nor power. For he left three thousand old Souldiers to Garrison that
City, and with them, the Mother and Children of <hi>Darius</hi> to repose themselves
there.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Susa Alexander</hi> marched with his Army towards <hi>Persepolis;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> beaten.</note> but when
he sought to pass those Mountains that sunder <hi>Susiana</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> he was sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beaten by <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who defended those Streights against him, called
<hi>Pilae Persidis,</hi> and after the loss of many of his <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he was forced to
save himself by retreat, causing his Foot to march close together, and to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
themselves with their Targets, from the Stones that were tumbled upon
them from the Mountain-tops. Yet in the end, he found out another passage,
which was discovered to him by a <hi>Lycian</hi> that lived in that Countrey, and
thereby, coming suddenly upon <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who now was enforced to fight
upon even ground, he overthrew him, who from thence fled to <hi>Persepolis:</hi>
But the Citizens refusing to admit him, he returned, and gave a second charge
upon the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> in which he was slain.</p>
            <p>Many <hi>Greeks</hi> (for Authors agree not upon their number) having been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Prisoners by the <hi>Persians,</hi> presented themselves here to <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Barbarons cruelty.</note> These
had the <hi>Barbarians</hi> so maimed, by cutting off their Hands, Ears, Noses, and
other Members, as that they could not have been known to their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

hundred Crowns, with new Garments, and such Lands as they liked to live
upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tiridates,</hi> one of <hi>Darius</hi> his false hearted Grandees, hearing of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s
approach to <hi>Persepolis,</hi> made him know that <hi>Persepolis</hi> was ready to receive
him, and intreated him to double his pace, because there was a determination
amongst the People to Plunder the Kings Treasury.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Persepolis</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> This City was forsaken
by many of her Inhabitants upon <hi>Alexanders</hi> arrival, and they that staid, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the worst Counsel. For the City was given up to the Liberty of the
Souldiers, to spoil and kill at their pleasure. There was no place in the world
at that time, which, if it had been lain in the balance with <hi>Persepolis,</hi> would
have weighed it down. Indeed, <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Susa</hi> were very rich, but in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sepolis</hi>
lay the bulk, and greatest store of the riches of <hi>Persia.</hi> For after the
spoil that had been made, of money, curious Plate, Bullion, Images of Gold
and Silver, and other Jewels, there remained to <hi>Alexander</hi> himself, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty thousand Talents, and as much other Treasure as twenty
thousand Mules, and ten thousand Camels could carry away; much whereof
had been reserved there from the dayes of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Here it was that <hi>Alexander,</hi>
setting himself down upon <hi>Darius</hi> his Throne, it was so high that his feet
could not reach the ground; whereupon one of his Attendants brought him a
little Table, and set it under his feet. One of <hi>Darius</hi>'s Eunuchs standing by,
sighed, and wept grievously, which <hi>Alexander</hi> taking notice of, asked him
the reason of it? the Eunuch answered, <hi>I weep to see a Table that was so highly
prized by my Master</hi> Darius, <hi>now to be made thy foot-stool.</hi> Here he left the same
number of three thousand <hi>Macedonians,</hi> in <hi>Persepolis,</hi> as he had done in <hi>Susa,</hi>
and gave the same formal honour to the Traitor <hi>Tiridates,</hi> as he had done to
<hi>Abulites;</hi> but he committed the charge of the place to <hi>Nicarides,</hi> a Creature
of his own.</p>
            <p>The Body of his Army he left there for thirty dayes,<note place="margin">A foolish enterprize.</note> and the care of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio</hi>

now were covered with Snow: a fruitless and foolish enterprize. Some speak
it in his praise, that when his Souldiers cryed out against him, because of the

great difficulty, that <hi>Alexander</hi> forsook his Horse, and marched on foot before

of the basest Harlots; He began to be despised both of his own, and of all other
Nations. For when he was enflamed with Wine, and being perswaded by
the infamous Strumpet <hi>Thais,</hi> he caused the most sumptuous, and goodly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
and City of <hi>Persepolis</hi> to be consumed with fire,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Persepolis</hi> burnt.</note> notwithstanding all the
Arguments that <hi>Parmenio</hi> could use to the contrary, who told him, that it
was a dishonour to destroy those things by the perswasion of others, which by
his proper virtue and force he obtained: and that it would be a certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to the <hi>Asiaticks,</hi> to think hardly of him, and thereby alienate their hearts
from him. For they might well believe, that he which demolished the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
Ornaments they had, meant nothing less, than after such vastations, to
hold the possession of them.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Alexander</hi> received another supply of Souldiers out of <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> his last Army.</note>
and advanced to find out <hi>Darius</hi> in <hi>Media. Darius</hi> had there formed his
fourth, and last Army, which he meant to have encreased in <hi>Bactria,</hi> had he
not heard of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s coming on, with whom (trusting to his present
numbers, which yet were but thirty or forty thousand) he intended once
again to try what he might do against him. He therefore called together his
Captains and Commanders, and propounded his resolution to them, who,
despairing of good success, stood for a while silent: But at last <hi>Artabazus,</hi> one
of his eldest men of War, who had sometime lived with King <hi>Philip</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Alexander,</hi> brake the silence, protesting that he could never be beaten
by any adversity of the Kings, from the Faith that he had ever ought him,
with firm confidence that all the rest were of the same mind, whereof they
likewise assured <hi>Darius,</hi> by the like protestation, and so they approved of the
Kings resolution.<note place="margin">The Treason of <hi>Bessus.</hi>
               </note> Two onely, and they the greatest, to wit, <hi>Naburzanes,</hi> and
<hi>Bessus,</hi> who was Governour of <hi>Bactria,</hi> had conspired against their Master, and
therefore advised the King to lay a new foundation for the War, and to pursue
it for the present by some such person against whom, neither the Gods, nor
Fortune had in all things declared themselves to be an enemy.</p>
            <p>This preamble <hi>Naburzanes</hi> used, and in conclusion, advised the election of
his fellow Traitor <hi>Bessus,</hi> with promise that when the War should be ended,
the Empire should be again restored to <hi>Darius.</hi> The King, swoln with disdain,
pressed towards <hi>Naburzanes,</hi> to have slain him; but <hi>Bessus</hi> and the <hi>Bactrians,</hi>
whom he commanded, being more in number than the rest, with-held him.
Hereupon <hi>Naburzanes</hi> withdrew himself, and <hi>Bessus</hi> followed him, making
their Quarters apart from the rest of the Army. <hi>Artabazus,</hi> the Kings faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servant, perswaded him to be advised, and to comply for the time, the
rather because <hi>Alexander</hi> was at hand, and that he would at least make shew
of forgetting the offence: which the King (being of a gentle Disposition)
easily yielded to. Then came <hi>Bessus</hi> to the King, and made his submission:
But <hi>Patron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The fidelity of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </note> who commanded a Brigade of four thousand <hi>Greeks,</hi> which had in all the former Battels served <hi>Darius</hi> faithfully, and had alwayes made their
retreat in despite of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> offered himself to Darius, to guard his
Person, protesting against the Treason of <hi>Bessus, (But God had otherwise deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103996:32"/>
of the Empire, and therefore so sar was the King infatuated, that be ever
rejected their Counsel from the beginning of the War, who were most faithful to
him.</hi>) And now hearkened to <hi>Bessus,</hi> who told him, that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> with
<hi>Patron</hi> their Captain, were corrupted by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and practiced the division
of his faithful servants: Yet, even this while, <hi>Bessus</hi> had corrupted, and drawn
to himself thirty thousand of the Army, promising them all those things by
which, the lovers of the world and themselves, are wont to be allured, to wit,
Riches, Honour, and Safety.</p>
            <p>Now the day following,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges his Attendants.</note> 
               <hi>Darius</hi> plainly discovered the purposes of <hi>Bessus,</hi>
and being overcome with passion, as judging himself unable to make head
against these ungrateful and unnatural Traitors, he prayed <hi>Artabazus,</hi> his
faithful Servant, to depart from him, and to provide for his own safety. In
like manner he discharged the rest of his Attendants, all save a few of his
Eunuchs. For his Guards had voluntarily abandoned him. His <hi>Persians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most base cowards, durst not undertake his defence against the <hi>Bactrians,</hi>
though they had four thousand <hi>Greeks</hi> to assist them, who of themselves were
able to beat both the Parties. But it's most true, <hi>That him that forsakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
will no man follow.</hi> It had been far more man-like, and King-like, to
have dyed in the head of those four thousand <hi>Greeks,</hi> who offered him the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of their Lives, (to which <hi>Artabazus</hi> also perswaded him) than to have
lain upon the ground bewailing himself, and suffering himself to be bound
like a Slave,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> made a Prisoner and abused.</note> by those Ambitious Monsters that laid violent hands on him;
whom, neither the consideration of his former great estate, nor the Honour
he had conferred upon them, nor the trust he had reposed in them, nor the
world of benefits he had bestowed on them, could move to pity: No, nor his
present adversity, which above all things should have prevailed with them,
could pierce their viperous and ingrateful hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius,</hi> thus forsaken, was bound by them, and laid in a Cart covered with
Hides of Beasts, that he might not be discovered; and to add despite and
derision to his adversity, they bound him with Chains of Gold, and so drew him
amongst their ordinary Carriages. For <hi>Bessus</hi> and <hi>Naburzanes</hi> perswaded
themselves that they might redeem their lives, and be setled in their Provinces
that they held, either by delivering him Prisoner to <hi>Alexander,</hi> of if that hope
failed, to make themselves Kings by his murther, and then to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by force of Armes. But their expectations were frustrate in both. For
it was against the Nature of God,<note place="margin">Gods Justice.</note> who is most just, to suffer such villany to go
unpunsihed, yea, though against an Heathen King, and an Idolator.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing that <hi>Darius</hi> was retreated towards <hi>Bactria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> pursues him.</note> not daring to
abide his coming, hastned after him by a violent march, and because he would
not force his Footmen beyond their strength, he mounted on Horseback cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
select Companies of them, and those which were best Armed, and with
six thousand other Horse, he rather ran than marched after <hi>Darius.</hi> Now
such as hated the Treason of <hi>Bessus,</hi> secretly forsook him, and gave intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to <hi>Alexander</hi> of all that had happened, informing him of the way that
<hi>Bessus</hi> took, and how near he was unto him. Hereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> again
doubled his pace, and his Vant-guard being come within sight of <hi>Bessus</hi> his
Rear, <hi>Bessus</hi> brought a Horse to the Cart where <hi>Darius</hi> lay bound, perswading
him to mount thereon, and to save himself by flight. But the unfortunate
King refusing to follow those that had betrayed him, they cast Darts at him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> is wounded.</note>
and gave him some mortal wounds: they wounded also the Beasts that drew
him, and slew two poor servants that attended his person. This done, they
all fled that could, and left the rest to the mercy of the <hi>Macedonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polystratus, a Macedonian,</hi> in his pursuit after <hi>Bessus,</hi> being extream thirsty,
as he was refreshing himself with some water that he had found out, espied a
Cart drawn by wounded Beasts, that were now scarce able to go, whereupon he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103996:33"/>
searched it, and there found <hi>Darius</hi> bathed in his own bloud: and by a <hi>Persian</hi>
Captain that <hi>Polystratus</hi> had, he understood that it was <hi>Darius,</hi> and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of that barbarous Tragedy. <hi>Darius</hi> also seemed greatly comforted (if
dying men, ignorant of the living God can be comforted) that he vented not
his last sorrows unheard; but that by this <hi>Macedonian, Alexander</hi> might be
informed of the truth, and take vengeance on those Traitors, who had dealt
no less unworthily, than cruelly with him, recommending the revenge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to <hi>Alexander</hi> by this messenger,<note place="margin">His last words.</note> beseeching him to pursue the Traytors, not
for <hi>Darius</hi> his sake, but for his own Honour, and for the safety of all that did,
or should hereafter wear Crowns. He also having nothing else to present to
<hi>Alexander,</hi> rendred him thanks for his Kingly Grace and Favour used to his
Wife, Mother, and Children; desiring the immortal Gods to subject to him
the Kingdom of the whole World. As he was thus speaking, importunate
Death pressing out his few remaining spirits, he desired a little Water, which
<hi>Polystratus</hi> presented unto him; after which, he lived but to tell him, that of
all the good things which of late he was Master of, he had nothing remaining
but his last breath, wherewith to desire the Gods to reward his compassion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Macedonians</hi> began now to hope that their Travels were near an end;
and therefore every man was preparing for his return: whereof, when <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
was informed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexanders</hi> Ambition.</note> he was much troubled at it. For the bounded Earth
sufficed not for his boundless Ambition. Many Arguments he therefore used
to draw on his Army farther into the East: But that which prevailed most
was, that <hi>Bessus,</hi> a base Traitor to his Master <hi>Darius,</hi> having at his Devotion
the <hi>Hircanians</hi> and <hi>Bactrians,</hi> would in a short time, if the <hi>Macedonians</hi> should
now return, make himself Lord of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, and reap the fruit of
all their former Travels. In conclusion, <hi>Alexander</hi> won their consents to go
on: Which done, leaving <hi>Craterus</hi> with certain Regiments of Foot, and
<hi>Amyntas</hi> with six thousand Horse in <hi>Parthia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes into <hi>Hircania.</hi>
               </note> he entred (not without some op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position)
into <hi>Hyrcania.</hi> For the <hi>Mardons</hi> and other barbarous Nations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
certain passages for a while. But at last prevailing, he passed the River
of <hi>Zioberis,</hi> which, taking its rise in <hi>Parthia,</hi> empties it self into the <hi>Caspian</hi>
Sea. It runneth under the ledge of Mountains which bound <hi>Parthia</hi> and <hi>Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania,</hi>
where, hiding it self under ground for three hundred furlongs, it then
riseth again, and follows its former course, as is said before. In <hi>Zadracarta,</hi>
the Metropolis of <hi>Hircania, Alexander</hi> rested fifteen dayes, Banquetting, and
Feasting therein.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Pataphernes,</hi> one of <hi>Darius</hi> his greatest Commanders, with
some others of his followers,<note place="margin">Divers submit to him.</note> submitted themselves to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and were
restored to their places and Government. But above all other, he Graced <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus</hi>
most highly, for his approved and constant Faith and Loyalty to his
Master <hi>Darius. Artabazus</hi> brought along with him ten thousand and five
hundred <hi>Greeks,</hi> the remainder of all those that had served <hi>Darius.</hi> He treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Alexander</hi> for their pardon before they came; but in the end, they
rendred themselves simply without promise or compostion: <hi>Alexander</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
all but the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whom he imprisoned, their Captain ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
slain himself. He was also prevailed with (though to his great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour)
to pardon <hi>Nabarzanes,</hi> that had joyned with <hi>Bessus</hi> in the Murther
of <hi>Darius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here (as some write) <hi>Thalestris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Queen of the <hi>Amazons</hi> comes to him.</note> Queen of the <hi>Amazons</hi> come to visit him,
and her suit was, (which she easily obtained) that she might accompany him,
till she proved with child by him: which done, she refused to go along with
him into <hi>India,</hi> but returned into her own Country.</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Alexander</hi> had begun to change his conditions after the taking of
<hi>Persepolis;</hi> so at this time Prosperity had so much corrupted his Virtue, that
he accounted Clemency to be but baseness, and the Temperance, which all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103996:33"/>
his life before he had used, to be but a poor and abject humour, rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the instructers of his youth, than the condition and state of so mighty
a King as the World could not equal. For he perswaded himself, that he
now represented the greatness of the Gods;<note place="margin">He affects a Deity.</note> and he was pleased when those
that came before him, would fall down on the ground and adore him. He
wore the Garments and Robes of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and commanded his Nobles to
do the like. He entertained into his Court and Camp the same shameless
Rabble of <hi>Curtizans</hi> and <hi>Catamites,</hi> as <hi>Darius</hi> had done, whom he imitated, in
all the proud, voluptuous, and detested manners of the <hi>Persians,</hi> whom he had
vanquished, and became a more foul and fearful Monster than <hi>Darius,</hi> from
whose Tyranny, he vaunted, to have delivered so many Nations; Insomuch
as they that were nearest and dearest to him, began to be ashamed of him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
each other with this, or the like scornful discourse; That <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of <hi>Macedonia</hi> was become one of <hi>Darius</hi>'s licentious Courtiers:<note place="margin">For which he is scorned of his Friends.</note> That by his
Example, the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> after so many, and tedious travels, were more
impoverished in their Virtues, than enriched by their Victories; and that it
was hard now to judge, whether the Conquerors or conquered were the baser
slaves. Neither were these things so whispered in corners, but that they
came to <hi>Alexanders ears:</hi> He therefore with great Gifts sought to stop the
mouthes of the better sort, and of such, of whose judgments he was most
jealous.</p>
            <p>Then did he make it known to the Army, that <hi>Bessus</hi> had assumed the title
of a King, and called himself <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> and that he had compounded a
great Army of the <hi>Bactrians</hi> and other Nations, whereby he perswaded them
to go on; to the end, that all which they had already gotten, together with
themselves (so far engaged) might not be cast away and lost. And because
they were pestered with the plunder of so many rich Cities, that the whole
Army seemed but the guard of their Carriages, he commanded that every
mans Fardel should be brought into the Market place; which, when it was
done, he, together with his own,<note place="margin">He burns all the spoils.</note> caused all to be consumed with fire. This,
in probability, might have proved very dangerous unto him: For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers had more interest in that which they had purchased with their
painful travel, and with their blood, than in the Kings Ambition; had not this
happy temerity overcome all difficulties.</p>
            <p>As he was upon his march, news was brought that <hi>Satribarzanes,</hi> whom
he had established in his former Government over the <hi>Arians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rebellion against him.</note> was revolted;
Whereupon, leaving the way of <hi>Bactria,</hi> he sought the Traytor out: But the
Rebell hearing of his coming, fled with two thousand Horse to <hi>Bessus.</hi> Then
marched <hi>Alexander</hi> on against <hi>Bessus,</hi> and by setting a great Pile of wood on
fire, with the advantage of a strong wind, he won a passage over an high
an unaccessible Rock, which was defended against him by thirty thousand
Foot, the extremity of the fire and smoke forcing them to quit the place,
which otherwise had been invincible: After which, he found no resistance,
till he came into <hi>Aria,</hi> on the East of <hi>Bactria,</hi> where the chief City of that
Province, called <hi>Artacoana,</hi> was a while defended against him, by the revolt
of <hi>Satribarzanes;</hi> but in the end, he received the Inhabitants to mercy. At
this place his Army was recruited with a new supply of five thousand, and
five hundred Foot, and near five hundred Horse, out of <hi>Greece, Thessaly,</hi> and
other places.</p>
            <p>At this time it was, that the Treason of <hi>Dimnus</hi> was discovered, of which,
<hi>Philotas</hi> the Son of <hi>Parmenio</hi> was accused,<note place="margin">Treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> at least as accessary, if not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal. This <hi>Dimnus,</hi> with some others, having conspired against the life of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> went about to draw <hi>Nicomacus,</hi> a young man whom he loved, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the conspiracy: The youth, although he was first bound by Oath to secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
when he heard so foul a matter uttered, began to protest against it so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103996:34"/>
that his Friend was like to have slain him, to secure his own life;
and so constrained by fear, he made shew as if he had been won by perswasion,
and by seeming at length to like well of the business, he was told more at large
who they were that had undertaken it. There were nine or ten of them, all
men of rank, whose Names <hi>Dimnus</hi> (the better to countenance the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize)
reckoned up to him, <hi>Nicomachus</hi> had no sooner freed himself from the
company of this Traytor <hi>Dimnus,</hi> than he acquainted his own Brother, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballinus,</hi>
with the whole design; whereupon it was agreed between them,
that <hi>Ceballinus,</hi> (who might do it with the least suspition) should go to the
Court, and utter all. <hi>Ceballinus</hi> meeting with <hi>Philotas,</hi> told him the whole
business, requesting him to acquaint the King with it, which he promised to
do, but yet did not.</p>
            <p>Two dayes passed, and <hi>Philotas</hi> never brake with the King about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but still excused himself to <hi>Ceballinus,</hi> by the Kings want of leisure. This
his coldness bred suspition, and caused <hi>Ceballinus</hi> to apply himself to one <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi>
Keeper of the Kings Armory, who forthwith brought him to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
presence. <hi>Alexander</hi> finding by examination what had passed between
<hi>Ceballinus</hi> and <hi>Philotas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It's discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
               </note> fully perswaded himself, that this concealment of the
Treason argued <hi>Philotas</hi> to have a hand in it; When <hi>Dimnus</hi> therefore was
brought before him, he asked him only this Question; <hi>Wherein have I so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
thee, that thou shouldst think</hi> Philotas <hi>more worthy to be King than my self?
Dimnus,</hi> when he was first apprehended, perceiving how the matter was like
to go, had so wounded himself, that he lived no longer than to give his last
groan in the Kings presence.</p>
            <p>Then was <hi>Philotas</hi> sent for, and charged with the suspition which his silence
might justly breed. His answer was, that when the Treason was revealed to
him by <hi>Nicomachus,</hi> he judged it to be but frivolous, and therefore forbore to
acquaint <hi>Alexander</hi> with it, till he could procure better information. This
errour of his (if it were but an errour) though <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the notable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
done by his Father <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Nicanor,</hi> lately dead, and
by <hi>Philotas</hi> himself, had freely pardoned him, and given him his hand for assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
Yet, by the instigation of <hi>Craterus,</hi> he falsified his Princely promise,
and made the Enemies of <hi>Philotas</hi> his Judges.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philotas</hi> accused.</note> 
               <hi>Craterus</hi> indeed perswaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he could never find a better occasion to oppress his private enemy,
than by pretending Piety, and Duty to his Prince. Whence a Poet saith,
<q>
                  <l>See how these Great men cloath their private hate</l>
                  <l>In these fair colours of the publick good;</l>
                  <l>And to effect their ends, pretend the State,</l>
                  <l>As if the State by their affection stood:</l>
                  <l>And Arm'd with Power, and Princes Jealousies,</l>
                  <l>Will put the least conceit of discontent</l>
                  <l>Into the greatest rank of Treacheries,</l>
                  <l>That no one action shall seem innocent.</l>
                  <l>Uea, Valour, Honour, Bounty shall be made</l>
                  <l>As accessaries unto ends unjust:</l>
                  <l>And even the service of the State must lade</l>
                  <l>The needful'st undertaking with distrust,</l>
                  <l>So that base vileness, idle Luxury,</l>
                  <l>Seem safer far than to do worthily.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now the King, following the advice of <hi>Craterus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander's</hi> dissimulation.</note> had resolved the next day
to put <hi>Philotas</hi> to the Torment, yet in the very evening of the same night, in
which he was apprehended, he called him to a Banquet, and discoursed as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
with him as at any other time. But, when in the dead of the night,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103996:34"/>
               <hi>Philotas</hi> was taken in his lodging, and that they which hated him, began to
bind him, he cried out upon the King, in these words: <hi>O</hi> Alexander, <hi>the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of mine enemies hath surmounted thy mercy, and their hatred is far more constant
than the word of a King.</hi> Many circumstances were urged against him by
<hi>Alexander</hi> himself; and this was not the least (not the least offence indeed
against the Kings humour, who desired to be adored as a God) that when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
wrote unto him concerning the Title given him by <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi>
he answered, <hi>That he could not but rejoyce that he was admitted into the Sacred
fellowship of the Gods, and yet he could not but withall grieve for those which
should live under such a one as would exceed the nature of man.</hi> This, said
<hi>Alexander,</hi> assured me that his heart was estranged, and that he despised my
Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philotas</hi> was brought before the multitude,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philotas</hi> accused by the King.</note> to hear the Kings Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against him. He was brought forth in vile Garments, and bound like
a Thief, where he heard himself, and his absent Father, the greatest Captain
in the World, accused, and also his two other Brothers, <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Nicanor,</hi>
who had lost their lives in these Wars; wherewith he was so overcome
with grief, that, for a while, he could utter nothing for tears; and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
had so wasted his Spirits, that he sank between those that led him.
In the end, the King asked him, in what Language he would make his
defence? He answered, <hi>In the same wherein it had pleased the King to accuse
him:</hi> which accordingly he did, to the end that the <hi>Persians</hi> as well as
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> might understand him. But hereof the King made this
advantage, perswading the Assembly, that he disdained the Language of
his own Countrey, and so withdrawing himself, he left him to his merciless
enemies.</p>
            <p>This proceeding of the Kings, <hi>Philotas</hi> greatly lamented, seeing the King,
who had so sharply inveighed against him, would not vouchsafe to hear
his answer. For hereby his enemies were emboldned against him, and
all the rest, having discovered the Kings mind and resolution, contended
amongst themselves, which of them should shew the greatest hatred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. Amongst many Arguments which he brought for his own
defence, this was not the least, that when <hi>Nicomachus</hi> desired to know of
<hi>Dimnus,</hi> of what quality and power his partners in the Conspiracy were,
seeming unwilling to adventure himself amongst mean and base Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<hi>Dimnus</hi> named unto him <hi>Demetrius,</hi> of the Kings Bed-Chamber,
<hi>Nicanor, Amyntas,</hi> and some others, but spake not a word of <hi>Philotas,</hi> who,
being Master of the Horse, would greatly have graced the cause, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<hi>Nicomachus.</hi> And to make it more clear that he knew nothing of
their intents, there was not any one of the Conspirators that in their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
would accuse him. Yet at the last, himself being put to extream
torments,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Philotas</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and tortured to death.</note> by the device of his professed enemies, <hi>Craterus, Cenus, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi>
and others, <hi>Philotas</hi> accused himself, hoping that they would have
slain him immediately: But he failed even in that miserable hope, and
suffering all that could be inflicted on flesh and blood, he was forced to
confess, not what was true, but what might best please them, who were far
more merciless than Death it self. <hi>Cruelty is not a humane vice: It is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of man: It's even a boasting rage to delight in bloud and wounds, and casting
away the nature of man, to become a savage Monster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whilst <hi>Alexanders</hi> hands were yet died in blood,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexanders</hi> cruelty.</note> he commanded
that <hi>Lyncestes,</hi> Son in Law to <hi>Antipater,</hi> who had been three years in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
should be slain. The same dispatch had all those that were accused
by <hi>Nicomachus.</hi> But <hi>Parmenio</hi> was yet living. <hi>Parmenio,</hi> who had served
with great fidelity, as well <hi>Philip,</hi> the Kings Father, as himself. <hi>Parmenio</hi>
that first opened <hi>Alexanders</hi> way into <hi>Asia:</hi> That had cast down <hi>Attalus</hi> the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103996:35"/>
Kings enemy: That had alwayes, and in all hazards, the leading of the
Kings Vaunt-guard: That was no less prudent in Counsel, than success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in all his enterprizes. A man, beloved of the men of War, and to say
the truth, he that had purchased for the King the Empire of the East, and
of all the Glory and Fame which he had attained to. That he might not
therefore revenge the Death of his Son, though not upon the King (for
it was unlikely that he would have stained his fidelity in his old age, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
now lived seventy years) yet upon those who by base Flattery had
possessed themselves of the Kings affection; It was resolved that he should
dye also: and <hi>Polydamus</hi> was employed in this business, a man, whom of
all others, <hi>Parmenio</hi> trusted most, and loved best. Who (to be short) find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in <hi>Media,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Parmenio</hi> mutthered.</note> and having <hi>Cleander,</hi> and other Murtherers with him,
slew him as he was walking in his Garden, and reading the Kings letters.
This was the end of <hi>Parmenio</hi> (saith <hi>Curtius</hi>) who had performed many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
things without the King; but the King without him did never effect any
thing worthy of Praise.</p>
            <p>These things being ended, <hi>Alexander</hi> marched on with his Army,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> marches for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> and
subdued the <hi>Araspitans,</hi> and made <hi>Amenides</hi> (sometime secretary to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>)
their Governour. Then he Conquered the <hi>Arachosians,</hi> and left <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
to command over them. Here the Army (that was sometime led by
<hi>Parmenio</hi>) found him, which consisted of twelve thousand <hi>Macedonians</hi>
and <hi>Greeks,</hi> with whom (though with much difficulty) he passed through
some cold Regions. At length, he came to the foot of the Mountain <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
towards the East,<note place="margin">Builds a City.</note> where he built a city, which he honoured with
his own Name, and peopled it with seven thousand of his old <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
worn out with age, and the travels of War. The <hi>Arians,</hi> who since
he left them, were revolted, he again subdued, by the industry and valour
of <hi>Caranus</hi> and <hi>Erigius:</hi> and now he resolved to find out the new King
<hi>Bessus</hi> in <hi>Bactria;</hi> who hearing of his coming, prepared to pass over the
great River of <hi>Oxus,</hi> which divides <hi>Bactria</hi> from <hi>Sogdiana. Bessus</hi> having
now abandoned <hi>Bactria, Alexander</hi> made <hi>Artabazus</hi> Governour of it, and
himself marching forward with his Army,<note place="margin">Wants water.</note> they suffered great want of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
insomuch as when they came to the River <hi>Oxus,</hi> there died more of
them by immoderate drinking, than <hi>Alexander</hi> had lost in any one Battel
against the <hi>Persians.</hi> He found upon the Banks of this great River, no
manner of Timber, or other materials wherewith to make Bridges, or
Boats, or Rafts, but was forced to sew together Hides that covered his
Carriages, and stuffing them with straw, he was six dayes in passing over
his Army after that manner, which <hi>Bessus</hi> might easily have distressed, if
he had dared but to look the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in the face. He had formerly
complained of <hi>Darius</hi> for neglecting to defend the Banks of <hi>Tigris,</hi> and
other Passes; and yet now, when this Traiterous slave had stiled himself a King,
he durst not perform any thing worthy of a slave: and therefore they
that were nearest to him, and whom he most trusted, to wit, <hi>Spicamenes,
Dataphernes, Cantanes,</hi> and others, the Commanders of his Army, moved,
both by the care of their own safety, and the remembrance of <hi>Bessus</hi> his
Treason and cruelty against <hi>Darius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bessus</hi> taken.</note> bound him, as he had done his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
only his chain was closed about his neck, like a Mastiff Dog, and so they
dragged him along to present him to <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Alexander</hi> was arrived at a certain Town inhabited
by <hi>Greeks</hi> of <hi>Miletum,</hi> brought thither by <hi>Xerxes,</hi> when long before he
returned out of <hi>Greece,</hi> whose children had now almost forgotten their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Language. These entertained him with great joy: but he most cruelly
put them all to the Sword,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexanders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi>
               </note> and destroyed their City. At this place he received
<hi>Bessus,</hi> and having rewarded <hi>Spitamenes,</hi> and his Associates, he delivered the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103996:35"/>
Traitor into the hands of <hi>Oxatre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bessus</hi> slain.</note> Brother to <hi>Darius,</hi> to be tormented by
him.</p>
            <p>But now when he thought himself most secure, and out of danger,
some twenty thousand Mountainers assaulted his Camp, in repelling
whom, he received a shot in his leg, the Arrow head sticking in the
flesh,<note place="margin">He is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> so that he was fain to be carried in a Horse-Litter for some time
after.</p>
            <p>Shortly after he came unto <hi>Maracanda,</hi> judged by some to be the same
with <hi>Samarcand,</hi> the Imperial City of the Great <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> which was in
compass seventy furlongs. Here he received the Ambassadors of the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
(called <hi>Avians</hi>) who offered to serve him.</p>
            <p>Presently after, the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> with the <hi>Sogdians,</hi> were again stirred up to
Rebellion, by the same <hi>Spitamenes,</hi> and <hi>Catanes,</hi> who had lately delivered
<hi>Bessus</hi> into <hi>Alexanders</hi> hands. Many Cities were stoutly defended against
him, all which, after he had subdued them, he utterly defaced, killing
all therein.<note place="margin">He is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again.</note> At the Siege of one of these he received a blow in the neck,
which struck him to the ground, and disabled him from action many dayes
after: In the mean while, <hi>Spitamenes</hi> had recovered <hi>Samarcand,</hi> against
whom he sent <hi>Menedemus,</hi> with three thousand Foot, and eight hundred
Horsemen.</p>
            <p>In the heat of these affairs, <hi>Alexander</hi> marched to the River <hi>Jaxartes,</hi>
that runs between <hi>Sogdiana</hi> and <hi>Scythia,</hi> which he passed over, while <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedemus</hi>
was employed in the recovery of <hi>Samarcand.</hi> Upon the Banks
of this River he built another <hi>Alexandria,</hi> sixty furlongs in compass, which
he beautified with Houses seventeen dayes after the walls were built: But
the <hi>Scythian</hi> King,<note place="margin">He builds a City.</note> perswading himself that this City was built on purpose
to keep him under, made some attempts to hinder the erection of this
new City; but being naked of defensive Arms, he was easily beaten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Sixty of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> are said to be slain in this conflict, and
eleven hundred wounded, which might easily be done in passing a great
River, defended against them by good Archer. Of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
eighteen hundred were brought into the Camp, and many Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Alexander</hi> was securing himself against those <hi>Scythians,</hi> border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon <hi>Jaxartes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Menedemus</hi> slain.</note> he received the ill news that <hi>Menedemus</hi> was slain by
<hi>Spitamenes,</hi> his Army broken, and most of them killed; to wit, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and three hundred Horse. He therefore, intending revenge
upon <hi>Spitamenes,</hi> made all the haste he could, but <hi>Spitamenes</hi> fled into
<hi>Bactria.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> killed, burned, and laid waste all before him,
not sparing the innocent Children, and so departed, leaving a new Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in that Province.</p>
            <p>To repair this loss, he received a great supply of nineteen thousand men
out of <hi>Greece, Lycia,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> with all which, and his old Army, he
returned towards the South, and passed the River of <hi>Oxus</hi> on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
whereof he built six Towns, near each to other, for their mutual se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
But he found a new upstart Rebell,<note place="margin">A Rebellion.</note> one <hi>Arimazes,</hi> (a <hi>Sogdian</hi>)
who was followed by thirty thousand Souldiers, that defended against him
a strong piece of ground on the top of an High and steep Hill. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
sought (but in vain) to win him with fair words: wherefore he
made choice of three hundred young men, and promised ten Talents to
the first, nine to the second, and so proportionably to the rest, that could
find a way to creep to the top thereof. This they performed with the loss
of thirty two of their number, and then made a sign to <hi>Alexander</hi> that
they had accomplished his Commandment. Hereupon he sent one <hi>Cophes</hi>
to perswade <hi>Arimazes</hi> to yield up the place; who, being shewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:103996:36"/>
that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were already gotten up, he yielded simply to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexanders</hi>
mercy, and was, with all his Kindred, scourged, and crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
which punishment they well deserved, for keeping no better a watch
in so dangerous a time. For the place might have been defended against
any power.</p>
            <p>After these <hi>Sogdian</hi> and <hi>Scythian</hi> Wars, <hi>Alexander</hi> committed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Samarcand,</hi> and the Country about it, to <hi>Clytus,</hi> whom yet
he slew soon after,<note place="margin">Clytus <hi>slain.</hi>
               </note> for preferring the Virtue of <hi>Philip</hi> the Father, before
that of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son; or rather, because he objected to the King the
Death of <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and derided the Oracle of <hi>Hammon:</hi> for therein he
touched him to the quick; his Speech being in publick, and at a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Banquet. <hi>Clytus,</hi> indeed, had deserved as much at the Kings hand as
any man living, having saved his life; which the King well remembred,
when he came to himself, and when it was too late to repent. As <hi>Clytus</hi>
in his Cups, forgat whom he offended, so <hi>Alexander</hi> in his drunkenness
forgat whom he slew; for grief whereof, he afterward tore his Face, and
sorrowed so inordinately, that had he not been over-perswaded by <hi>Calisthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
he would have slain himself.<note place="margin">The effect of Drunkenness.</note> 
               <hi>Drunkenness both kindles and discovers
every vice: It removes shame, which gives impediment to bad attempts. Where
Wine gets the Mastery, all the evil which before lay hidden, breaks out. Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
indeed rather discovers vices than makes them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after this, <hi>Spitamenes,</hi> who slew <hi>Bessus,</hi> and had lately revolted
from <hi>Alexander,</hi> was murthered by his own Wife, and his Head was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to <hi>Alexander. Spitamenes</hi> being thus taken away, the <hi>Dahans</hi> also sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
upon his fellow Conspirator, <hi>Dataphernes,</hi> and delivered him up: So
that <hi>Alexander</hi> being now freed from all those petty Rebels, and disposed
of the Provinces that he had quieted, marched on with his Army into
<hi>Gabaza,</hi> where it suffered so much Hunger, Cold, Lightning, Thunder,
and such Storms,<note place="margin">Deadful storms.</note> that in one of them he lost a thousand men. From
hence he invaded the <hi>Sacans,</hi> and destroyed their Country. Then came
he into the <hi>Territories</hi> of <hi>Cohortanes,</hi> who submitted himself to him, and
presented him with thirty beautiful Virgins; amongst whom, <hi>Roxane,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
his Wife, was one; which, although all the <hi>Macedonians</hi> sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mached,
yet none of them durst use any freedome of speech after the death
of <hi>Clytus.</hi> From hence he directed his course towards <hi>India,</hi> having so
increased his numbers, as amounted to one hundred and twenty thousand
Armed men.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, he would needs be honoured as a God, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
that he might allure his <hi>Macedonians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Ambition. <hi>Calisthenes</hi> speaks against it.</note> he implyed two of his Parasites,
<hi>Hagis</hi> and <hi>Cleo,</hi> whom <hi>Calisthenes</hi> opposed. For amongst many other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Arguments which he used in the Assembly, he told <hi>Cleo,</hi> that he
thought that <hi>Alexander</hi> would disdain the Title of a God from his Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals:
That the opinion of Sanctity, though it did sometimes follow the
Death of those, who in their Life-time had done the greatest things,
yet it never accompanied any one as yet living in the world: He said,
that neither <hi>Hercules,</hi> nor <hi>Bacchus,</hi> were Deified at a Banquet, and upon
drink, (for this matter was propounded by <hi>Cleo</hi> at a carousing Feast) but
for the more than manly acts performed by them in their Life-time, for
which they were in succeeding Ages numbred amongst the Gods. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
stood behind a partition, and heard all that was spoken, waiting but
for an opportunity to be revenged on <hi>Calisthenes,</hi> who, being free of speech,
Honest, Learned, and a Lover of the Kings Honour, was yet shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tormented to Death. For upon occasion of a Conspiracy made against
the King,<note place="margin">And is tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to Death.</note> by one <hi>Hermelaus,</hi> and others, who confessed it, he caused <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes,</hi>
without confession, accusation, or tryal to be torn asunder upon the
Rack.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:103996:36"/>
This deed, unworthy of a King, is thus censured by <hi>Seneca. Thus</hi> (saith
he) <hi>is the eternal crime of</hi> Alexander, <hi>which no Virtue, or felicity of his in
War, shall ever be able to blot out. For as often as any man shall say, He slew
many thousands of</hi> Persians, <hi>it will be replied, He did so, and he slew</hi> Calisthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
too. <hi>When it shall be said that he won all as far as to the very Ocean,
whereon also he adventured with unusual Navies, and extended his Empire from
a corner of</hi> Thrace, <hi>to the utmost bounds of the East; it shall be said withall;
But he killed</hi> Calisthenes. <hi>Let him have out-gone all the ancient Examples of
Captains and Kings, none of all his Acts make so much to his Glory, as the Death
of</hi> Calisthenes to his reproach.</p>
            <p>With the Army before mentioned,<note place="margin">He marches into <hi>India.</hi>
               </note> of one hundred and twenty thousand
Foot and Horse, <hi>Alexander</hi> entred into the borders of <hi>India,</hi> where, such
of the Princes as submitted themselves to him, he entertained lovingly,
the others he enforced, killing man, woman, and child, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.
He then came before <hi>Nisa,</hi> built by <hi>Bacchus,</hi> which, after a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dayes, was rendred to him. From thence he removed to a Hill at hand,
which on the top had goodly Gardens, filled with delicate fruits and Vines,
dedicated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to whom he made Feasts for ten dayes together. And when he had drank his fill,<note place="margin">His Feasts to <hi>Bacchus.</hi>
               </note> went on to <hi>Dedula,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Acadera,</hi> Countries spoiled, and abandoned by the Inhabitants; by reason whereof, Victuals failing,<note place="margin">He conquers many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> he divided his Army. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> led one part, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi>
another, and himself the rest. These took in many Towns, whereof,
that of greatest fame was <hi>Muzage,</hi> which had in it three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men, but after some resistance, it was yielded to him by <hi>Cleophe</hi> the
Queen, to whom he again restored it. At the Siege of this City he received
a wound in the leg.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Nola</hi> was taken by <hi>Polisperchon;</hi> and a Rock of great strength
by <hi>Alexander</hi> himself: He won also a passage from one <hi>Eryx,</hi> who was slain
by his own men, and his Head presented to <hi>Alexander:</hi> This was the sum
of his Actions in those parts, before he came to the great River <hi>Indus.</hi>
And when he came thither, he found there <hi>Ephestion,</hi> who (being sent before)
had prepared Boats for the transportation of his Army, and before <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
arrival, had prevailed with <hi>Omphis,</hi> King of that part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
to submit himself to this great Conquerour. And hereupon, soon
after <hi>Alexanders</hi> coming, <hi>Omphis</hi> presented himself, with all the strength
of his Country, and fifty six Elephants, unto him; offering him his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and assistance: He told <hi>Alexander</hi> also, that he was an enemy to the
two next great Kings of that part of <hi>India,</hi> named <hi>Abiasares,</hi> and <hi>Porus;</hi>
wherewith <hi>Alexander</hi> was not a little pleased, hoping by this their disunion,
to make his own Victory be the far more easie.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Omphis</hi> also presented <hi>Alexander</hi> with a Crown of Gold, the like did
the rest of his Commanders; and withall he gave him eight Talents of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

besides other <hi>Persian</hi> rarities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abiasares</hi> being informed that <hi>Alexander</hi> had received his enemy <hi>Omphis</hi>
into his protection, he resolved to make his own peace also. For, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his own strength did but equal that of <hi>Omphis,</hi> he thought it
but an ill match, when <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had already subdued all the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Princes of <hi>Asia,</hi> should make himself a party, and head of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.
So then now <hi>Alexander</hi> had none to stand in his way, but <hi>Porus,</hi>
to whom he sent a command, that he should attend him at the Borders
of his Kingdom,<note place="margin">He sends to <hi>Porus.</hi>
               </note> there to do him Homage: But the gallant <hi>Porus</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him this manly answer: <hi>That he would satisfie him in the first demand,
which was, to attend him on his Borders, and that well accompanied; but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103996:37"/>
for any other acknowledgment, he was resolved to take counsel of his Sword.</hi> To
be short, <hi>Alexander</hi> resolved to pass over the River of <hi>Hydaspes,</hi> and to
find out <hi>Porus</hi> at his own home: But <hi>Porus</hi> saved him that labour, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him on the farther bank, with thirty thousand Foot, ninety Elephants,
and three hundred armed Chariots, and a great Troop of Horse. The River
was half a mile broad, and withal, deep and swift. It had in it many
Islands, amongst which there was one much overgrown with Wood, and of
good capacity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> sent <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> with a good part of the Army up the River, shrowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rest from the sight of <hi>Porus</hi> under this Island, by this devise, <hi>Porus</hi>
being drawn from the place of his first encamping, set himself down op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> supposing that the whole Army of <hi>Alexander</hi> was there,
intending to force their passage: But in the mean while <hi>Alexander</hi> with his
men, recovered the the farther shore without resistance, and ordering his
Troops, he advanced towards <hi>Porus,</hi> who at first imagined them to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biasares</hi>
his confederate, come over <hi>Hydaspis</hi> to assist him: But finding it to
be otherwise, he sent his Brother <hi>Hagis</hi> with four thousand Horse, and a
hundred armed Chariots to entertain him. Each Chariot had in it four to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> and two to guide it: But they were at this time of little use, by reason
that much rain having fallen, the fields were so foul that the Horses could
hardly trot.</p>
            <p>In this fight the <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Dahans</hi> had <hi>Alexanders</hi> Vantguard, who
so galled the <hi>Indians</hi> with their Darts and Arrows, that the Horses brake
their reins, and overturned the Chariots, and those that were in them.
<hi>Perdiccas</hi> also charged the <hi>Indian</hi> Horsemen, who were by him forced to
recoil. Then did <hi>Porus</hi> move forward with the Gross of his Army, that
his Vantguard, who were scattered, might retreat into his Rear. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
being followed by <hi>Ephestion, Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> charged the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Horsemen in the left wing, commanding <hi>Cenon</hi> to set upon the right.
He directed also <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Leonatus</hi> to charge <hi>Porus</hi> his Battel of
Foot, strengthened with Elephants, <hi>Porus</hi> himself riding upon one of the
biggest of them. By these Beasts the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Foot received the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
dammage; but the Archers and Darters being well guarded with
the long and strong Pikes of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> so galled them, that the
Elephants being inraged, turned Head, and ran over their own Footmen
that followed them. In the end, after a long and doubtful fight, by the
advantage of weapons,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Porus</hi> beaten.</note> and the skill and courage of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
the Victory fell to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who also far exceeded <hi>Porus</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men. For, besides the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and other Eastern and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
Nations, <hi>Alexander</hi> was assisted by <hi>Porus</hi> his Confederates, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
people: Yet, for his own person, he never gave ground, otherwise
than with his Sword towards his enemies, till, being weakned by many
wounds, and abandoned by his Army, he became a Prisoner to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
from whom again he received his Kingdom,<note place="margin">He is restored to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> with a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.</p>
            <p>I forbear to mention other petty Victories which <hi>Alexander</hi> obtained
after this, in his sailing down the River of <hi>Indus.</hi> The description of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
about the Head, and branches thereof, are better known to us by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our late Navigations and Discoveries, than they were in former
times. The magnificence and Rights of those <hi>Indian</hi> Kings, we could in
no sort be perswaded to believe, till our own experience had taught us,
that there are many stranger things in the world than we see in our own
Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander,</hi> having by this time over-wearied his Army, he discovered
the rest of <hi>India</hi> by Fame. The <hi>Indian</hi> Kings whom he had subdued, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103996:37"/>
him, that a King called <hi>Aggramenes,</hi> ruled over many Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> who was able to bring into the Field two hundred
thousand Foot, twenty thousand Horse, three thousand Elephants, and
two thousand armed Chariots. With this report, though <hi>Alexander</hi> was
more enflamed than ever, to proceed in his Discoveries and Conquests,
yet all his Oratory could not prevail with his Souldiers to adventure over
those waste Desarts beyond <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> which were more terrible to
them, than the greatest Army that the East could gather. Yet at last they
were overcome by many perswasions to follow him towards the South, to
discover such parts of the Ocean as were nearer at hand, unto which the River
<hi>Indus</hi> was their infallible guide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> seeing it would be no otherwise, devised a pretty trick, by
which he hoped to beguile after-ages,<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> and make himself seem greater than
he was. For which end, he enlarged his Camp, made greater Trenches,
greater Cabins for Souldiers, greater Horse-stalls, and higher Mangers than
Horses could seed in. Yea, he caused all furniture both for Men and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
to be made larger than would serve for use, and scattered these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and Bridles about his Camp, to be kept as Reliques, and wondred at by
those barbarous People. Proportionable unto these, he raised up twelve great
Altars, to be Monuments of his Journeys end.</p>
            <p>This done, he returned again to the Banks of <hi>Asesines,</hi> and there deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to build his Fleet, where <hi>Ausines</hi> and <hi>Hydaspes</hi> meet; and to testifie
by a surer Monument, how far he had passed towards the East, he built
by those Rivers two Cities: the one he called <hi>Nicaea,</hi> and the other <hi>Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He builds two Cities.</note>
after the name of his beloved Horse <hi>Bucephalus.</hi> Here again he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a new supply of six thousand <hi>Thracian</hi> Horse-men, seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and from his Lieutenant of <hi>Babylon,</hi> twenty five thousand Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
garnished with Silver and Gold, which he distributed amongst his
Souldiers.</p>
            <p>About these Rivers he won many Towns, and committed great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on those that resisted.<note place="margin">His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> It's said, that besieging a City of the <hi>Oxidra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi>
he leaped from the top of the wall into it, and fought long against
all the Inhabitants, till his Souldiers, forcing a Gate, came in to his rescue.
Finally, he passed down the River with his Fleet, at which time news
was brought him of a Rebellion in <hi>Bactria,</hi> and then of the arrival of a
hundred Ambassadours from a King in <hi>India,</hi> who submitted himself to
him. These Ambassadours he Feasted upon a hundred Beds of Gold, with
all the sumptuousness that could be devised; who, soon after their dispatch,
returned again, and presented him with three hundred Horses, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty Wagons, and in each of them four Horses, a thousand Targets,
with many other things rare and rich.</p>
            <p>Then sailed <hi>Alexander</hi> towards the South,<note place="margin">He builds a City.</note> passing through many obscure
Nations, which all yielded to him, either quietly, or by force: Amongst
these, he built another <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Of the many places which he took in
his passage, one was called <hi>Samus,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof fought against
him with poysoned Swords; with one of which, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (afterwards King
of <hi>Egypt,</hi>) was wounded, and was cured by an Herb which <hi>Alexander</hi> dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he had seen in the mouth of a Serpent.</p>
            <p>When he came near to the out-let of <hi>Indus,</hi> (being ignorant of the Tides
of the Sea) his Gallies on a sudden were shuffled one against another, by
the coming of the Flood, and in the Ebb, they were left on the dry ground,
and on the Sandy banks in the River, wherewith the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were
much amazed: But after he had a few dayes observed the course of the
Sea, he passed out of the Rivers mouth some few miles, and then offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sacrifice to <hi>Neptune,</hi> he returned; and the better to inform himself,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103996:38"/>
he sent <hi>Nearchus</hi> and <hi>Onesicritus</hi> to discover the Coast towards the mouth of
<hi>Euphrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Near the out-lets of this River,<note place="margin">He wants food.</note> he spent some part of Winter, and from
thence, in eighteen dayes march, he recovered <hi>Gredosia,</hi> in which passage
his Army suffered such misery through the want of food, that of one hundred
and twenty thousand Foot, and twelve thousand Horse, which he carried into
<hi>India,</hi> not a fourth part returned alive.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Gredosia, Alexander</hi> led his Army into <hi>Caramania,</hi> and so drawing
near to <hi>Persia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</note> he gave himself wholly unto Feasting and Drinking, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
the Triumphs of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> And though this Swinish Vice be hateful
enough in it self; Yet it alwayes inflamed this King to cruelty. For (saith
<hi>Curtius) the Hangman followed the Feast:</hi> For <hi>Haspastes,</hi> one of his Provincial
Governours, he commanded to be slain; so as, <hi>Neither did the excess of
Voluptuousness qualifie his Cruelty, nor his Cruelty at all hinder his Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he refreshed his Army in these parts, there came a new supply
to him of five thousand Foot, and a thousand Horse, which were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him by <hi>Cleander</hi> and his Fellows, that had been employed in the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Parmenio.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He punishes his Officers.</note> Against these murtherers great complaints were made by
the Deputies of the Provinces, in which they had commanded; and their
offences were proved to be so outragious, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was perswaded,
that, had they not altogether despaired of his return out of <hi>India,</hi> they durst
not have committed them. All men were glad of the occasion, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the Virtue of him whom they had slain. The end was, that <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and the other chief, together with six hundred Souldiers, who had
been the instruments of their ravages, were delivered over to the Hangman;
every one rejoycing that the wrath of the King was at last poured out upon the
Ministers of his Anger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nearchus</hi> and <hi>Onesicritus</hi> were now returned from searching the Coast, and
made report of an Island they had discovered, rich in Gold, and of other
strange things; whereupon they were commanded to make some farther
discovery, after which they should come up <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and meet the King
at <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> drawing near to <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He visits the Sepulchre of <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
               </note> went to visit the Sepulchre of <hi>Cyrus</hi>
in <hi>Pesagardes,</hi> where he was presented with many rich Gifts by <hi>Orsanes,</hi>
one of the Princes of <hi>Persia,</hi> of the race of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But because <hi>Bagoas,</hi> an
Eunuch, who was in special favour with the King, was neglected, he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned
some loose fellows to accuse <hi>Orsanes</hi> for robbing <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Tomb;
for which he was condemned to dye,<note place="margin">His cruelty.</note> and <hi>Bagoas</hi> assisted the Hangman with
his own hands to torment him. At this time also <hi>Alexander</hi> caused <hi>Phradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
to be slain, suspecting his greatness. Hence (saith <hi>Curtius</hi>) he began un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably
to shed blood, and to believe false reports. Indeed he took the way
to make all men weary of him, and his Government, seeing Tyranny is more
dreadful than all adventures that can be made against it.</p>
            <p>About this time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calanus</hi> burnt himself.</note> 
               <hi>Calanus</hi> the Philosopher burnt himself, having lived se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
three years; and Historians say, that before his Death he foresaw, and
foreshewed the Death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> promising to meet him shortly after at
<hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Pesagardes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Marriage and Feasting.</note> 
               <hi>Alexander</hi> went to <hi>Susa,</hi> where he married <hi>Statyra,</hi> the
Eldest Daughter of <hi>Darius,</hi> giving her younger Sister to his beloved <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi>
and eighty other <hi>Persian</hi> Ladies to other of his Captains. To his Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Feast he invited six thousand Guests, to each of which he gave a Cup of
Gold.</p>
            <p>Unto this place came to him three thousand young Souldiers out of his
Conquered Provinces, whereat the <hi>Macedonians</hi> greatly murmured. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus,</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:103996:38"/>
his Treasurer in <hi>Babylon,</hi> having lavishly consumed the money in his
keeping, fled with five thousand Talents, and six thousand hired Souldiers;
but when he came into <hi>Greece,</hi> he was there slain.<note place="margin">Harpalus <hi>slain.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Alexander</hi> much rejoyced
at the fidelity of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who would not be corrupted with <hi>Harpalus</hi>
his Bribes: Yet he sent a command to them, that they should receive
their banished men again; whereunto they all for fear yielded, except the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> though they saw that it was a manifest preparation to their
bondage.</p>
            <p>After this,<note place="margin">His Army discontented.</note> there followed a marvellous discontent in his Army, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had resolved to send into <hi>Macedonia</hi> all those old Souldiers which
could no longer endure the travell of the War, and to keep the rest in
<hi>Asia.</hi> He made many Orations to satisfie them, but all his words were in
vain, during the heigth of their fury; Yet, when their first passions were
evaporated, they became more tractable. And with such as were licenced
to depart, he sent <hi>Craterus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He sends for <hi>Antipater.</hi>
               </note> to whom he gave the Lieutenantship of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,
Thessaly,</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> which <hi>Antipater</hi> had Governed from the time
of <hi>Alexanders</hi> departure out of <hi>Europe,</hi> who (during that time) had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
the rebellious <hi>Greeks,</hi> discharged the trust committed to him with
great fidelity, and sent him from time to time so many strong supplies into
<hi>Asia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, if <hi>Alexander</hi> had not taken counsel of his Cups, he would have
cast some better colour upon this alteration, and given <hi>Antipater</hi> some
stronger reasons of his remove, than to employ him in conducting a new sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of men to <hi>Babylon,</hi> the War being now at an end. For <hi>Antipater</hi> could
make no other construction of this remove, but that he had a purpose to send
him after <hi>Parmenio,</hi> and the rest. The truth is, the King, notwithstanding
his undauntedness, had no great mind to grapple with <hi>Antipater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> having thus sent for <hi>Antipater,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephestion</hi> dyes.</note> made a journey into <hi>Media,</hi>
to settle things there, where <hi>Ephestion,</hi> whom he loved and favoured above
all others, died. The King greatly lamented his loss, hanged the <hi>Physician</hi>
that could not cure him, and built him a Monument that cost twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Talents. After which he returned to <hi>Babylon.</hi> Thither <hi>Antipater</hi> came
not, but sent, and that, not to excuse, but to free himself; And if we may
believe <hi>Curtius,</hi> he suborned his Sons, <hi>Cassander, Philip,</hi> and <hi>Jolla,</hi> who were
<hi>Alexander</hi> Cup-bearers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> dyes.</note> to give him poyson; <hi>Thessalus</hi> (who was one of
the conspiracy) having invited him to a Drinking-Feast for that purpose.
Others say, that by his inordinate drinking he fell into a Fever, whereof he
died.</p>
            <p>A little before his Death,<note place="margin">His Will.</note> his Friends about him asked him, to whom
he would leave his Empire? He answered, <hi>To the most worthy man.</hi> Then
asked they him, when they should give him Divine Honours? He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>When they themselves were happy;</hi> which were the last words that he
spake, and so he died, having lived not all out thirty three years, nor reigned
thirteen.</p>
            <p>As soon as he was Dead,<note place="margin">The vanity of all earthly things.</note> his great Captains sought to inrich themselves by
his Spoils, and whilst they were sharing the World amongst themselves, his
dead Body lay many dayes in that hot Countrey unburied, stinking above
ground: <hi>A notable emblem of the Vanity of all Earthly things.</hi> Besides this,
his vast Empire was divided amongst his great Captains;<note place="margin">The confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after his death.</note> To <hi>Ptolomaeus Lagi</hi>
was allotted <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> To <hi>Laomedon, Syria</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia;</hi> To <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,

But these men, not contented with their shares, fell out amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103996:39"/>
making War one upon another to their own destruction; For,<note place="margin">Gods Justice.</note>

warring upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> was slain by his own Souldiers; <hi>Antipater</hi> died;
<hi>Eumenes</hi> was betrayed by his own Souldiers, and slain by <hi>Antigonus; Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi>
the Mother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> was slain by <hi>Cassander; Cleopatra,</hi> Sister to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
was slain by the treachery of <hi>Antigonus; Antigonus</hi> himself was slain
in Battel by <hi>Cassander</hi> and <hi>Lysimachus; Roxane,</hi> the beloved Wife of <hi>Alexander,</hi>
together with her Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Barsine,</hi> another of his Wives, which
was Daughter to <hi>Darius,</hi> were all slain by <hi>Cassander.</hi> And presently after,
the whole Family of <hi>Cassander</hi> was rooted out; <hi>Ptolomy</hi> died in <hi>Egypt; Lysima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
was slain by <hi>Seleuchus;</hi> and <hi>Seleuchus</hi> himself presently after by <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
So that all the Family of <hi>Alexander,</hi> within a few years after his Death, was
wholly extirpated; and all his Friends and great Captains, by their Ambition
and mutual contentions, came most of them to untimely ends.</p>
            <p>When the dead body of <hi>Alexander</hi> had lain seven dayes upon his Throne,
at last the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> were commanded from thenceforth to take
the care of it; But when they came about it, they durst not at first approach
to touch it: But anon after, saying their Prayers, that it might be no sin
unto them, being but mortals, to lay their hands upon so Divine a Body,
they fell to work, and dissected it; the Golden Throne whereon he lay, being
all stuffed with Spices, and hung about with Pendants and Banners, and other
Emblems of his high State and Honour.</p>
            <p>The care of his Funeral, and of providing a Chariot wherein to carry his
Body to the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Hammon,</hi> was committed to <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> who
spent two whole years in making provision for it; which made <hi>Olympias,</hi> his
Mother, (seeing him lye so long unburied) in great grief of heart to cry out,
and say, <hi>O my Son! Thou that wouldst needs be accounted amongst the Gods, and
keptest such adoe about it, canst not now have that which every poor man hath, a little
Earth, and Burial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Long after, when <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> had Conquered <hi>Pompey,</hi> and was idle in
<hi>Egypt, Lucan</hi> tells us, that he visited the Temples, and the Cave wherein the

considering that <hi>Achilles</hi> had a <hi>Homer</hi> to sing his Praises, and to perpetuate

Also he commanded, that no man should draw his Picture, but
<hi>Apelles,</hi> the most exquisite Painter in the World, and that none should

him, not his Talents of Gold and Silver, and such other precious things,
but his Friends.</p>
            <p>When he had overcome <hi>Darius,</hi> and gotten possession of all his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Treasures,<note place="margin">He degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated after his victories.</note> he began to degenerate into the <hi>Asian</hi> Luxury. His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
and Moderation were turned into Pride and Lust. He judged his
Country manners, and the Discipline of the former <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings, too
sordid and mean for him. He imitated the Pride of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings,
he made him a Crown, and Robes like unto <hi>Darius.</hi> He grew so proud
and insolent, that he suffered his Souldiers to fall down and worship him
like a God. Yea, he commanded his Servants, and Slaves to do so. He
cloathed his Captains and Horse-men like unto the <hi>Persians,</hi> which though
they disliked they durst not refuse. He gat him three hundred sixty five Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,
of the beautifullest Virgins that could be found in <hi>Asia,</hi> after the
manner of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings, one of which lay with him every night. He
had his Troops of <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> with Musicians, Jesters, Singing women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
He spent whole days and nights in profuse Feasting, and Revelling. All which
was very offensive to his old Captains, and Souldiers.</p>
            <p>When he was a Boy, he took both his hands full of perfumes, and cast
them into the fire as he was Sacrificing, whereupon <hi>Leonidas,</hi> one of his School-Masters
said to him: <hi>O</hi> Alexander, <hi>when thou hast Conquered those Countries
wherein these odors grow, then thou maist be so liberal, but in the mean time be
more sparing.</hi> Afterwards, when he had conquered <hi>Arabia Foelix,</hi> he sent to
<hi>Leonidas</hi> a hundred Tallents of <hi>Myrrhe,</hi> and five hundred of <hi>Frankincense,</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to be hereafter more liberal in his service of the Gods.</p>
            <p>He was of so bountiful a disposition,<note place="margin">His bounty.</note> that it was a greater trouble to him
not to be asked than not to give. He wrote to <hi>Phocian,</hi> that he would make
use of his friendship no more if he refused his Gifts. <hi>Serapion,</hi> a young Boy
that used to play at Ball with him, gat nothing because he asked nothing;
whereupon the next time he played, he threw the Ball to all but <hi>Alexander,</hi>
the King marvelling at it, asked him why he threw not the Ball to him? <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth</hi>
(said <hi>Serapion) because you asked it not. Alexander</hi> laughing at the jest,
sent him a liberal Gift.</p>
            <p>As he was travelling through the Desarts of <hi>Persia,</hi> himself and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
were in great straits for want of water: One of his Souldiers having
two Sons ready to dye of thirst, sought up and down, and at last found
a little water, wherewith he filled a leather Bottel, and was running with
it to his Sons: but meeting <hi>Alexander</hi> by the way, he filled it out into a
dish, and profered it to him. <hi>Alexander</hi> asked him, whither he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
it? the man told him that his two Sons were ready to die
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103996:40"/>
with thirst: <hi>But</hi> (said he) <hi>pray you Sir, do you drink it; For if my Sons die I can
get more, but if you die we shall not have such an other King. Alexander</hi> hearing
this, gave him the water again, and bid him carry it to his Sons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> in his younger days was so moderate,<note place="margin">His Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> and temperate, that
he would often open his chests, and look upon his Garments, to see if
his Mother had not provided him, either delicate or superfluous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel.</p>
            <p>Also when the Queen of <hi>Caria,</hi> to shew her great love to him, sent him
dayly variety of Dishes and Dainties, and at last sent her Cooks, and Bakers
to him, he returned them back again, saying, <hi>That he had no need of their
service; for his Master</hi> Leonidas <hi>had provided him better Cooks, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to dine and sup Frugally, and sparingly.</hi> Also when he had any
rare, and Dainty Fruits, or Fishes sent him from the Sea, he used to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute
them amongst his Friends, reserving very little or none for his
own use.</p>
            <p>One craving a small gift of him, he gave him a whole City, and when the
Poor man said, <hi>That it was too much for him to receive:</hi> Yea (said <hi>Alexander</hi>)
but not for me to give.</p>
            <p>As he was advanceing to conquer a Kingdom in <hi>India, Taxilis,</hi> who was
King thereof, came and met him, saying, <hi>O Alexander, What need we fight,
if thou comest not to take away my food and water, for which its only fit for wise men
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight? If thou seekest after Riches, if I have more than thou, I will give thee
part of mine: if thou hast more than I, I will not refuse part of thine. Alexander</hi>
being much taken with his speech, said to him, <hi>Go to, I will contend with thee
in bounty,</hi> and so they mutually gave and received many Gifts. At last <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
gave him a thousand Tallents, which much grieved his Friends, and
rejoyced the Barbarian.</p>
            <p>He shewed an admirable Example of his Chastity in the heat of his
youth,<note place="margin">His Chastity.</note> when having taken the Mother, Wives, and Daughters of
<hi>Darius,</hi> women of admirable beauty, yet, neither by word, nor deed
did he profer them the least indignity, thinking it a greater honour to
overcome himself than his Adversaries: And when he looked upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Captive Ladies that excelled in stature and beauty, he merrily said,
<hi>Persides oculorum dolores esse:</hi> That the <hi>Persian</hi> women were a disease
of the eyes, and yet he looked on them but as on so many Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
When he was informed that two of his Captains under <hi>Permenio,</hi>
had ravished two of the <hi>Persian</hi> Ladies, he wrote to him to enquire after
the matter, and if he found it true, he should cut off their Heads, as
of Beasts born for the hurt of mankind. He also sent him word, that
himself was so far from contemplating the Beauty of <hi>Darius</hi> his Wife,
that he would not so much as suffer her to be commended in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
and that he was so careful of their Chastity, that they lived in his
Camp, shut up in their Tent, as if they had been in a Temple.</p>
            <p>At the Death of <hi>Ephestion,</hi> his Favorite, he did not only clip the
Haire of his Horses, and Mules, but plucked down also the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the City walls, that they might seem to mourn for his
Minions Death, shewing now deformity instead of their former Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Porus,</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> King, fighting valiantly against him, receiving many
wounds, and at last, being overcome, and falling into his enemies hands,
they brought him to <hi>Alexander,</hi> who hearing of his coming, went forth,
with some of his Friends, to meet him, and asked him what he would
have him to do for him, <hi>Porus</hi> answered, <hi>My only desire is, that thou
use me like a King: Alexander,</hi> admiring his magnanimity, replyed, <hi>This I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103996:40"/>
will do for my own sake: but what wouldest thou have me do for thine? Porus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>That all was contained in his former demand of Kingly usage: Alexander</hi>
was so pleased with this, that he restored him to his Kingdom, and gave him
another bigger than his own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great (saith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) built seventy Cities, He brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
barbarous Nations to civility. He taught the People <hi>Hircani</hi> the use of
Marriage: and the <hi>Arachosians,</hi> Tillage and Husbandry: The <hi>Sogdians,</hi> that
they should nourish and cherish their aged Parents, and not kill them: The
<hi>Persians,</hi> to honour their Mothers, and not to use them for their Wives:
The <hi>Scythians,</hi> that they should not eat their Dead, but bury them in the
Earth. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Clemency to those whom he conquered, was very exemplary. The
same day that he took, he restored again the Kingdom to <hi>Porus</hi> King of <hi>India.
Darius</hi> his Mother he entertained honourably, as a Queen. <hi>Darius</hi> his Wife,
and beautiful Daughters, he would not so much as see, as careful to preserve
their Chastity.</p>
            <p>His Liberality and Magnificence exceeded all his other Virtues. He gave at
one time three and twenty thousand Talents among his Souldiers, to pay their
Debts. At his Marriage, he invited ten thousand Guests, and gave to every
one of them a Cup of Gold. To one that asked something of him, he gave
a City; and when the Party would have refufed it, as too great a Gift for
him, <hi>Alexander</hi> said, <hi>Non quaero quid te decet accipere, sed quid me decet dare:</hi>
I regard not what is meet for thee to take, but what is meet for me to give.
Whereupon <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, that those Virtues for the which severally sundry
worthy men have been commended, did all concur and meet in him: As the
Valour of <hi>Achilles:</hi> the Chastity of <hi>Agamemnon:</hi> the Piety of <hi>Diomedes:</hi> the
Courage of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> the Policy of <hi>Themistocles:</hi> the Boldness of <hi>Brassida:</hi> And
the Prudence of his Father <hi>Philip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Military Virt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es were remarkable: As, his Courage, in that with
thirty thousand Footmen, and five thousand Horsemen (for he had no more
when he first passed over into <hi>Asia</hi>) he durst bid defiance to all the World.
His Patience, in enduring Hunger and Thirst, Heat and Cold. His dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and celerity, in omitting no opportunity of advantage to his affairs, so
that in seven years he accomplished all his great Conquests: And to these
may be added, his singular success; For he never besieged any City, but
he took it.</p>
            <p>But after he had glutted himself with the Pleasures of <hi>Asia,</hi> the Vices
that he fell into were not inferiour to his afore-named Virtues. Among
the rest, these four notable Vices were apparent in him. First, <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
for he would drink so excessively, that he would lie two or three
dayes senseless, till he had slept out his Drink. Secondly, In his Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he was cruel and outragious: In one of those fits he slew his dear
Friend <hi>Clitus,</hi> whose loss he greatly bewailed afterwards. Thirdly, He was
much given to Wantonness, and Fleshly Lusts. Fourthly, At length he grew
so intolerably Proud, that he would needs be accounted the Son of <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
and commanded <hi>Calisthenes</hi> (one of his great Commanders,) to be slain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would not worship him.</p>
            <p>He accounted <hi>Achilles</hi> happy, because he had such a man as <hi>Homer</hi> to set
forth his Praises: But himself had many worthy men to Register his Acts;
As <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt: Hecataeus: Aristobulus: Calisthenes: Onesicratus:
Diodorus Siculus: Trogus Pompeius: Justin: Quintus Curtius:</hi> with divers
others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lycippus</hi> the Painter, made <hi>Alexanders</hi> Picture looking up to Heaven, with
this <hi>Motto,</hi>
               <q>Jupiter, <hi>asserui Terram mihi, tu assere Coelum.</hi>
               </q>

            <p>

O <hi>Jupiter,</hi> I have taken the Earth to my self; Take thou Heaven: with
which <hi>Alexander</hi> was so well pleased, that he published a Proclamation, that
none should draw his Picture but <hi>Lycippus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Apelles</hi> drew <hi>Alexander's</hi> Picture with a Thunderbolt in his hand, to shew
his admirable celerity, and unresistableness in his Conquests.</p>
            <p>This bloudy man lived not out half his Dayes, and not long after his Death
all his Posterity was rooted out.</p>
            <p>His Posterity and Kindred that he left behind him, were; his Mother
<hi>Olymtias;</hi> his Unkle <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> King of <hi>Epirus:</hi> His Brother <hi>Arideus,</hi> and
his Sister <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> His two Wives, with their two Sons; <hi>Roxane</hi> with
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Bursines</hi> with <hi>Hercules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Olympias</hi> caused <hi>Arideus</hi> to be Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
<hi>Cassander</hi> thereupon took occasion to put <hi>Olympias</hi> to death, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
fourscore years old: and then he poysoned both <hi>Alexanders</hi> Sons,
[<hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi>] with <hi>Roxane Alexanders</hi> Wife. <hi>Cleopatra, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>
Sister, the Governour of the <hi>Sardians,</hi> who was base Brother to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,
Alexanders</hi> Father, procured her to be killed, therein thinking to gratifie
<hi>Antigonus:</hi> And last of all, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was vanquished by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> by whom his Head was cut off.</p>

resemblance of a Snake. This <hi>Polymnis</hi> had two only
Sons, <hi>Caphisias,</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> whom he educated very
carefully, and had them very carefully, and had them
very well instructed in all the liberal Arts, and honest
Sciences: especially <hi>Epaminondas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> who had the more stayed wit, and was
most inclined to Virtue, desirous to learn, humble, obedient, and wonderful
docible: and of one <hi>Dyonisius</hi> he learned to be very skilful in Singing, and
Musick. And for Philosophy it happened well for him that he fell into
an excellent Masters hands by this means.</p>
            <p>The Colleges of the <hi>Pythagorian</hi> Phylosophers that were dispersed through
the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> were banished by the faction of the <hi>Cylonians,</hi> yet such
as still kept together, met in a Councel at <hi>Metapont</hi> to consider of their
affairs: But some seditious Persons rose up against them, and set the House
wherein they were on fire, and burnt them all; only <hi>Phylolaus</hi> and <hi>Lysis,</hi>
being lusty young men, escaped through the fire. <hi>Phylolaus</hi> fled into the
Country of the <hi>Lucanians,</hi> and resided there with his Friends: But <hi>Lysis</hi> got
to <hi>Thebes,</hi> where <hi>Polymnis</hi> intertained him, intreating him to undertake the
Tuition of his Son, <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who, though he was but a young Boy,
yet was he of good capacity, and of very good Hopes, This Phylosopher
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103996:42"/>
accordingly applied himself to manure this noble and quick wit of <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas,</hi>
and in a short time made him perfect in all Sciences and Virtue, so
that it was hard to find a more wise, grave, and virtuous Person than
he was.</p>
            <p>When he was but fifteen years of age,<note place="margin">He exercises and studies.</note> he gave himself to all manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of the Body, as to run, wrestle, use his Weapons, and all feats of
Arms: and having quickly attained to skill in these, he applied himself
to his Book, He was naturally silent, fearful to speak, but never a weary
to hear and learn; whereupon <hi>Spintharus,</hi> the <hi>Tarentine,</hi> being familiarly
acquainted with him in <hi>Thebes,</hi> used to say, <hi>that he never knew any man that
knew so much, and spake so little as</hi> Epaminondas, If he fell into any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
that discoursed of Philosophy, or of State matters, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leave them, till the matter propounded was at an end. He was of a
pleasant disposition, and so witty that he could break a jest as well as
any man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lysis</hi> after he had lived long in <hi>Thebes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Discourse with a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher.</note> died, and was honourably buried
by his Scholar <hi>Epaminondas.</hi> Not long after, <hi>Theanor,</hi> one of the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
in <hi>Sicily,</hi> was sent to bring <hi>Lysis</hi> thither, but when he came to <hi>Thebes,</hi>
he found him dead and buried, therefore going to <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> after salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he told him that his Companions, who were rich, willed him to give
<hi>Polymnis,</hi> and his Chidren, a good sum of mony in recompence of that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
entertainment which they had given to <hi>Lysis: Epaminondas,</hi> after
pleasant excuses made, told him that none could be received, saying fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jason,</hi> a Captain of the <hi>Thessalians</hi> thought that I gave him a rude
and uncivil answer, when he, having earnestly entreated me to receive a
good sum of Gold, I sent him word that he did me wrong, and began to
make War with me: for that he, aspiring to make himself a Lord, would
corrupt me with mony, who am a plain Citizen of a free Town, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
under the Law, But for thee <hi>Theanor,</hi> I commend thy good will,
because its honest and virtuous, but I tell thee thou bringest Physick to
them that are not sick. Admit that thou, hearing we had been in Wars,
hadst brought us Arms to defend us, and when on the contrary thou hadst
found us quiet, and at peace with all our neighbours, thou wouldst not have
thought fit to bestow these Arms, and leave them with those that had no
need of them. Even so, thou art come to relieve our poverty as though
it were a burden to us, whereas on the contrary, its an easie and pleasant
thing to us to carry, and we are glad we have it in our Houses amongst
us, and therefore we have no need of Arms, or mony against that which
doth us no hurt at all. But tell thy brethren that they use their goods ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
honestly: and also that they have Friends here which use their Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as well: and as for the intertainment, and burial of <hi>Lysis,</hi> he hath himself
fully recompenced us, having taught us, amongst many other good lessons,
not to be afraid of Poverty, nor to be grieved to see it amongst us. <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
having made some reply about the good and evil of Riches, and told
him that as Poverty was not evil in it self, so neither was Riches to be had
in contempt and dispised: No truly (said <hi>Epaminondas</hi>) yet considering with
my self that we have a World of covetous desires, some natural that are born
with us, and bred in our flesh by the lusts pertaining to it: Others strange
to us, grounded upon vain opinions, which taking setling, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an habit in us by tract of time, and long use through evil education, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
do draw us down, and weigh our Souls with more force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
than those that be connatural to us. For reason, through daily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of virtue, and practice thereof, is a means to free us from many of
those things that are born, and bred with us. Yet we must use continual
force and opposition against our concupiscences which are strangers to us,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103996:42"/>
to quench them, and by all possible means to repress, and subdue them
in us.</p>
            <p>And when this is done, there is also (said he) an exercise of justice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
greedy Covetousness, and a desire of getting, which is not, not to go
rob our Neighbours Houses, nor, not to rob men by the High Way, nor not
to betray our Friends, or Country for Mony: for such an one opposeth,
not covetousness, but possibility, its Law, or fear that bridleth his covetous
desire to offend: But that man that oftimes willingly abstains from just gains,
he it is that by exercise keeps himself far from unjust, and unlawful taking
of mony. For it is impossible in great pleasures that are wicked and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
the Soul should contain it self from lusting after them, unless for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
being oft at his choise to use them, he had contemned them. Its not
easite to overcome them, nor to refuse great Riches when they are offered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a man long before hath killed in him this covetous desire of getting,
the which, besides many other habits and actions, is still greedily bent
shamefully to gain, pleasing himself in the pursuit of Injustice, hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
to wrong an other so he may benefit himself. But that man that
disdaines to receive gifts from his Friends, and refuseth Presents offered him
by Kings, and that hath rejected the bounty of Fortune, putting by all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
desires of glistering Treasures laid before him, he shall never be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do that which is unjust, nor shall his mind be troubled, but he will
content himself quietly to do any thing that is honest, having an upright
heart, finding nothing in it but that which is good and commendable.
Yet was the Life of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> far more excellent than his discourse, as will
appear by that which follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diomedon,</hi> the <hi>Cizicenian,</hi> at the request of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to win <hi>Epaminondas</hi> to take the <hi>Persians</hi> part. To effect this, he came
to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and brought a great mass of Gold with him, and with three
Thousand Crowns of it, he bribed a young man called <hi>Mycethus,</hi> who
was greatly beloved by <hi>Epaminondas.</hi> This young man went to him and
told him the occasion of the other mans coming to <hi>Thebes:</hi> But <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omedon</hi>
being present, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> said to him, I have no need of mony:
If the King of <hi>Persia</hi> wish well to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> I am at his service without
taking one penny: If he hath any other meaning,<note place="margin">His contempt of Riches.</note> he hath not Gold nor

I bear to my Country for all the Gold in the World: and as for thee that
dost now tempt me, not knowing me, but judging me like unto thy self,
I pardon thee for this time, but get thee quickly out of the City lest thou
corrupt others, having failed to prevail over me: and for thee <hi>Mycethus,</hi>
deliver him his mony again, which if thou dost not presently, I will send
thee before a Justice.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Diomedon</hi> besought him that he would let him go away in safety,
and carry that with him which he brought thither: Yea (said <hi>Epaminondas</hi>)
but it shall not be for thy sake, but for my honour-sake, lest thy Gold
and Silver being taken from thee, some man should accuse me that I had a
share in that privately which I had refused openly. Saying further, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wouldst thou that I should cause thee to be conveyed? To <hi>Athens,</hi> said
<hi>Diomedon:</hi> This was done accordingly, and he had a strong convoy sent
with him, and that he might not be troubled by the way, betwixt the
Gates of <hi>Thebes</hi> and the Haven wherein he was to imbark himself, <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi>
gave <hi>Chabrias</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> charge of him, that he should see
him safe at his journeys end.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was very Poor,<note place="margin">His Poverty.</note> yet would he never take any thing
of his Citizens or Friends: and being so inured to poverty, he was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to bear it the more patiently by his study of Philosophy, For on a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103996:43"/>
time, having the leading of an Army of the <hi>Thebans</hi> into the Country of
<hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> he borrowed five Crowns of a Citizen for the defraying of his
necessary charges in that Journey. <hi>Pelopidas</hi> being a man of great wealth
and his very good Friend, could never possibly force upon him any part of
his Goods, but he rather learned of him to love poverty. For <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
taught him to think it an honour to go plainly in his Apparrel, to eat
moderately, to take pains willingly, and in War to fight lustily. Yet when
he had occasion to relieve others, he would make bold with his Friends
goods, which in such cases were common to him, If any of his Citizens
were taken Prisoners by the Enemy,<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> or if any Friend of his had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be married, and was not able to bestow her, he used to call his
Friends together, and to assess every one of them at a certain sum, after
which he brought him before them who was to receive the mony, and
told him how much every one had bestowed upon him, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
thanks to them all.</p>
            <p>But once he went far beyond this: For he sent a poor Friend of his to
a Rich Citizen of <hi>Thebes</hi> to ask of him six hundred Crowns, and to tell
him that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> desired him to let him have them. The Citizen
being amazed at his demand, went to <hi>Epaminondas</hi> to know what he
meant to charge him so deeply, as to make him to give six hundred Crowns
to the other? It is (said <hi>Epaminondas</hi>) because this man, being an honest
man, is poor, and thou who hast robbed the Commonwealth of much,
art rich.</p>
            <p>He lived so soberly,<note place="margin">His Sobriety.</note> and was such an enemy to all superfluity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
that being on a time invited to Supper to one of his Neighbours,
when he saw great preparation of dainty meats, made dishes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,
he said unto him, I thought thou hadst made a Sacrifice by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
and superfluity, and so immediatly went his way. The like also he
spake of his own Table, saying, that such an Ordinary, was never guilty
of Traitors, and Treason. On a time being at a Feast with some of his
Companions, he drank Vinegar, and when they asked him what he meant
by it, and whether he drank it for his health or no? I know not (said he)
but this I am sure of, it puts me in remembrance how I live at home. Now
it was not that his stomach was an enemy to dainty meats, or that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so penuriously at home, for he was marvelous noble minded: But he
did it, that by his strict and unreprovable life, he might bridle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
many insolencies and disorders which then raigned amongst the
<hi>Thebans,</hi> and to reduce them to the former temperance of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors.</p>
            <p>Upon a time, a Cook giving up an account to him and his Fellows of their
ordinary expences for certain days, he could find fault with nothing but
the quantity of Oyl that was spent: which his Companions marvelling
at; Tush (said he) it is not the expence which offends me, but because
we have poured in so much Oyl into our Bodies. The City of <hi>Thebes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an occasion made a publick Feast, where they were very merry, and jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
But on the contrary, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> went up and down without Oyl and
perfumes, or decked with brave apparel, seeming very sad: Some of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Friends meeting him in this Posture, and wondering at him, asked him
why he walked so alone, and ill apparelled through the City? Because (said
he) you may in the mean time freely and safely drink your selves drunk,<note place="margin">His Vigilance.</note> and
make merry, taking thought for nothing.</p>
            <p>His Modesty also was such, that it would in no wise suffer him to seek
advancement, but on the contrary he withdrew himself from Government,
that he might with the more quiet apply himself to the study of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
It happened upon a time that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> intreated aid of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103996:43"/>
the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who at that time were in League with them, and accordingly
they sent them certain Foot Companies: at which time <hi>Epaminondas</hi> being
about thirty five years old, Armed himself and went along with them.
At this time it was, that that intimate Friendship began betwixt <hi>Pelopidas</hi>
and him, which continued even to the end of their lives. These two being
in a Battel the one by the other against the <hi>Arcatians,</hi> whom they had in front
against them in the plains of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> it fell out that one of the points of the
Battel of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in which they were, retired, and many fled: But
these two resolved rather to die than flie, and accordingly they stood to it
gallantly, till <hi>Pelopid is</hi> being wounded in seven places, fell down upon a heap
of dead Bodies.<note place="margin">His Valour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Then did <hi>Epaminondas</hi> (though he took him for dead) step
resolutely before him to defend his Body and Arms, he alone sighting against
many, resolving rather to die in the place than to leave <hi>Pelopidas</hi> amongst the
dead men, until that himself being thrust into the Breast with a Pike, and
wounded in the Arm with a Sword, was ready to faint: at which time Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
so ordered it, that King <hi>Agesipolis</hi> came on with the other point
of the Battel, and saved them both.</p>
            <p>Not long after the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> by a stratagem, won the strong Castle
of <hi>Thebes</hi> called <hi>Cadmaea,</hi> and put a strong Garrison into it, and gave the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Thebes</hi> unto <hi>Archias, Philippus,</hi> and <hi>Leontidas,</hi> authors of all
the mischief:<note place="margin">Tyrants in <hi>Thebes.</hi>
               </note> whereupon, to avoid their Tyranny, <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were fain to save themselves by flight, upon which they were banished
by sound of Trumpet. But as for <hi>Epaminondas</hi> they as yet said nothing
to him, but let him alone in the City: for he was contemned as a man of
no account, because he was so much given to his Book: and if he should have
any mind to stir against them, yet they judged he could do nothing because
of his Poverty.</p>
            <p>Whilest <hi>Pelopida</hi> and his Companions were at <hi>Athens,</hi> they laid a plot to
free <hi>Thebes</hi> from those Tyrants: But <hi>Epaminondas</hi> not making a shew of any
thing, had devised another way to effect it, by raising the hearts and courages
of the young men of the City. For when they went out to play, and
exercise themselves, he always found out a way to make them wrestle
with the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> and when he saw the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> throw them,
and give them shrewd falls, they being the stronger, he would privately
rebuke the <hi>Thebans</hi> and tell them, that it was a shame for them to suffer the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to set their Feet upon their Throats for want of courage,
who yet were not half so strong, and boisterous as themselves were. All
this while <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and his followers went on in their Plot, and had such
good success, that one Night they got privily into the City of <hi>Thebes</hi> and
met at <hi>Charons</hi> House about forty eight in number.<note place="margin">His prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> knew all
this well enough, and at Night some took him aside and endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him to joyn with them in delivering their City from those Tyrants,
to whom he answered, that he had taken order with his Friends, and <hi>Gorgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
to put themselves into a readiness upon any such occasion, but for his
own part he would not have a hand in putting any of his Citizens to death,
unless they were legally condemned: yet (said he) if you will make an
attempt for the delivery of the City so as that it be without murther or
blood-shed, I vvill joyn with you vvith all my heart: But if you will perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
in your former determination, pray you let me alone, pure, and not
defiled vvith the blood of my Citizens, that being blameless I may take hold
of another occasion vvhich may tend more to the good of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
For the murthers that vvill be committed in this vvay, cannot be
contained vvithin any reasonable bounds. I know indeed that <hi>Pherecides,</hi>
and <hi>Pelopidas</hi> vvill especially set upon the Authors of the Tyranny: but <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molpidas,</hi>
and <hi>Samiadas,</hi> being fierce and Cholerick men, taking the liberty
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103996:44"/>
of the Night, will never sheath their Swords, till they have filled the whole
City with Murther, and slain many of the chief Citizens. Besides, its very
convenient for the People of <hi>Thebes,</hi> that some be left free, and blameless of
these Murthers, and guiltless of all that should be done in the fury of this
action.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all that vvas said,<note place="margin">The Tyrants slain.</note> the enterprise vvas executed, and
the Tyrants put to death, the City was restored to her ancient liberty, the
Castle of <hi>Cadmaea</hi> was rendred up by composition, and <hi>Lysandradas,</hi> the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian,</hi>
and other Commanders that were in it, vvere suffered safely to
depart, with their goods and Souldiers. This vvas the occasion of the long
Wars which followed between the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Thebans,</hi> vvith vvhom
the <hi>Athenians</hi> joyned in League.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> still applied himself to his Book:<note place="margin">His Modesty.</note> yet at last he vvas put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards
by <hi>Pammenes,</hi> a chief man amongst the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and he began to
follovv the Wars very eagerly, and in divers encounters gave good proof of
his prudence, hardiness, and valour, insomuch as by degrees he attained to
the highest charges of Government in the Commonvvealth:<note place="margin">He is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> and his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
vvho before made small account of him till he vvas forty years old,
after, vvhen they knevv him better, they trusted him vvith their Armies,
and he saved the City of <hi>Thebes,</hi> that vvas like to be undone, yea, and freed
all <hi>Greece</hi> from the servitude of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> making his Virtue, as
in a cleer light, to shine vvith Glory, shevving the effects vvhen time
served.</p>
            <p>Upon a time <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> entered into <hi>Boeotia</hi> vvith an
Army of tvventy thousand Foot, and five thousand Horse, vvherewith he
harrased and spoiled all the plain Country, and presented Battel to the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>
in the open Fields, which yet they would not accept of, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the weaker: Howbeit, they defended themselves so well by the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e conduct of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas,</hi>
that they caused <hi>Agesilaus</hi> to return home with his Army. But when he was
gone,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spartans</hi> beaten.</note> the <hi>Thebans</hi> went with their Companies before the City of <hi>Thespies,</hi>
which they surprized, and put to the Sword two hundred of the Garrison,
and afterwards returned back with their Army to <hi>Thebes;</hi> and <hi>Phaebidas,</hi> the
<hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> who was then Governour of that City, sallied out of the Town,
and charged upon the <hi>Thebans</hi> in their retreat, who intertained him so hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that he lost five hundred of his men, and himself was slain in the
Fight.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> returned with their former Army to
make War with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who having seized upon certain straights, and
places of advantage, so blocked up the way, that they could not over run the
Country, and spoil it as they had done before; yet did <hi>Agesilaus</hi> so molest,
and trouble them,<note place="margin">A Bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el,</note> that at last it came to a main Battel that held long, and was
very cruel: and though at the first <hi>Agesilaus</hi> had the better, yet the <hi>Thebans</hi>
charged him so furiously, that at the length he himself was wounded and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to retire, being well paid for teaching the <hi>Thebans</hi> Military Discipline.
And this was the first time that the <hi>Thebans</hi> knew themselves to be as strong
and lusty as the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whereupon they Triumphed in sign of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and from that time forward, they grew more couragious to make head
against the Enemy, and to present them battel. But that which most encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
them, was, the presence of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> who counselled, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and executed very Wisely, Valiantly, and with great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
            <p>At another time they went with a great number of chosen men before
the City of <hi>Orchomene,</hi> where yet they prevailed not, because there was
a strong Garrison of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> that sallied out upon them, and the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103996:44"/>
Fight was very sharp between them: yet, though the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were
far more in number,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spartans</hi> beaten.</note> the <hi>Thebans</hi> gave them the overthrow, which never
happened to them before. For all other Nations thought that they had done
excellent well, if with a far greater number they had overcome a small
number of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> But this Victory, and an other, which fell
out shortly after under the conduct of <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> did so lift up and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the <hi>Thebans,</hi> that they became more famous than ever they were
before.</p>
            <p>The year following, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> intending to make War
against <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and therein to intertain diverse strangers, laboured to make
Peace amongst the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in hope that they, being at Peace amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would be the more willing to have Souldiers lcavied amongst them.
For which end he sent Ambassadours to all the Towns of <hi>Greece,</hi> to perswade
and intreat them to be at Peace amongst themselves. The <hi>Greeks</hi> were very
willing to harken hereto, being wearied on all sides with such long Wars, and
so were easily drawn to make Peace;<note place="margin">Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
               </note> wherein it was especially agreed, and
concluded, that all the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> should be free, and use their own
Laws: and Commissioners were sent abroad to withdraw all the Garrisons
where any were kept. Unto this the <hi>Thebans</hi> only refused to agree, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Town should severally capitulate for it, requesting that the Towns in the
Country of <hi>Boeotia</hi> should be comprehended under the City of <hi>Thebes:</hi> but
the <hi>Athenians</hi> mightily opposed themselves against this, and <hi>Calistratus,</hi> one
of their Orators, made a notable Oration about it before all the States of
<hi>Greece. Epaminondas</hi> on the contrary, made an excellent and vehement
speech in defence of the right of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> insomuch as this controversie
was left undecided, and the Treaty of Peace was universally agreed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all the other <hi>Grecians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Thebans</hi> are excepted.</note> the <hi>Thebans</hi> only excepted, who were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
in it.</p>
            <p>At this time the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who had long contended
amongst themselves about the Principality of <hi>Greece,</hi> now agreed, that the
one should command by Sea, and the other by Land: And therefore they
could not endure that the <hi>Thebans</hi> should aspire to be chief, which
made them seek to dismember the other Towns of <hi>Boeotia</hi> from them, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for that the <hi>Thebans,</hi> being strong and lusty of Body, and much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by their late Victories over the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> would now contend with
them for their superiority, having a wonderful confidence in the Wisdom and
Prowess of their Captains, especially of <hi>Epaminondas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matters resting thus doubtful, the Citizens of <hi>Plataees,</hi> a Town of <hi>Boeotia,</hi>
were desirous, to enter into League with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> promising that if
they would send them Souldiers, they would put the Town into their hands:
But the Governours of <hi>Boeotia</hi> having intelligence of it, and being desirous to
prevent the <hi>Athenians,</hi> brought a party of Souldiers against it, who came
before <hi>Plataees</hi> before the Citizens heard any news of them, so that part of
them were surprised in the Field by the Horsemen, and the rest fled into the
Town: where having no aid, they were faign to accept of such tearms as it
pleased the <hi>Thebans</hi> to grant them, which were presently to depart the Town
with bag and baggage,<note place="margin">Plataees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</note> and never to return again into the Country of <hi>Boeotia.</hi>
Then did they raze the City to the ground, and sacked the Town of <hi>Thespies</hi>
which also was at enmity with them.</p>
            <p>The Ambassadours of <hi>Persia</hi> again solicited the Greeks to a General Peace,
and Commissioners from every Town were to meet at <hi>Sparta</hi> about it. <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi>
was yet scarce known, having laboured to conceal himself, and in
all his exploits of War, had ever preferred the advancement of his great
Friend, and Companion in Arms, <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> before himself. He was now
chosen by the <hi>Thebans</hi> to go to <hi>Sparta,</hi> where, finding that the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103996:45"/>
did much comply with <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> he spake boldly, and plainly,
not only in behalf of the <hi>Thebans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Wisdom.</note> but for all <hi>Greece</hi> also: making it evident
to all, that War still encreased the greatness of <hi>Sparta</hi> only, which kept all
the other Towns of <hi>Greece</hi> under. He therefore advised them to establish a
firm Peace, which would last the longer, when all comprized in it, should
be equals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agesilaus</hi> perceiving all the Commissioners to be very attentive to and well
pleased with this speech, he asked him a loud, if he thought it just, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
that all <hi>Boeotia</hi> should be set at liberty.<note place="margin">His Courage.</note> 
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> presently, and
boldly asked him, if he thought it not also just and reasonable that all <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi>
should be set at liberty? Thereupon <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> in great anger, stood up,
and commanded him to answer plainly, if they should not restore all the Towns
in <hi>Boeotia</hi> to their Liberty? and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> answered him as before. This
so displeased <hi>Agesilaus</hi> (who had an old grudg to the <hi>Thebans</hi>) that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
he put their Name out of the List of those that should be comprized
within the Treaty of Peace, and proclaimed open War against them, and
now there was no remedy but the <hi>Thebans</hi> must bear the whole brunt alone,
for there was no one Town that durst send them any aid, because they were
all sworn to the Peace, insomuch as all judged them to be utterly undone.
Friends pittied there estate, and there enemies rejoyced, verily believing that
they could never stand before the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> send King <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> with an Army towards
<hi>Thebes,</hi> who being come near to <hi>Chaeronea</hi> with ten thousand Foot, and a
thousand Horse, he pitched his Camp there staying for his Allies. The <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi>
being informed of the approach of the enemy, chose <hi>Epaminondas</hi> to be
their Captain General, giving him the charge of this War, with six other
Counsellers to be assisting to him. Now there came Oracles to <hi>Thebes</hi> from
all parts; some promising Victory, and others threatning their overthrow;
and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> commanded them to set those on the right hand of the chair
for Orations, that promised Victory, and the other on the left hand, which
being so disposed of, he gat up into the chair, and said to his Citizens, <hi>If you
will be obedient to your Captains,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> 
               <hi>and valiant against your enemies, these Oracles
on the right hand belong to you: But if through faintness of heart, ye refuse dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
those on the left hand shall be your Portion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did he list the Names of all the <hi>Thebans</hi> which were able to bear Arms,
and chose out of some parts of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> such as he thought fittest for the
Wars. His Presence exceedingly cheered up his Army, and all the the time that
he was Captain, the <hi>Thebans</hi> never saw in their Camp any of those which
they call <hi>sudden fears.</hi> He used to say, that there was no Death more honest
and desirable than to die in the Wars, and that the body of a Souldier should
be hardened to endure any labour or pains.<note place="margin">Fat men cashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> He could not abide fat men, and
therefore cashired a whole Company of them as unprofitable burdens in his
Army. He had in all, but six thousand fighting men: and as they marched
forwards, they met with some unlucky signs, as many esteemed them: but
he valued them not, thinking that a resolution to fight in a good cause,
ought to be much stronger, and of more force to raise in him good Hope,
than these evil signs that appeared, to make him fear the worst.</p>
            <p>As he was marching towards the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> they heard it Thunder,
and they that were neer him, asked him what that meant, He answered,
that it betokened that the Enemies brains were troubled, and beclouded,
who, having places of advantage hard by them, yet encamped in the plaines.
Indeed the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> waited there for their Allies, who yet failed them.
For all of them, having at leasure considered of the speech of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> at
<hi>Sparta,</hi> began to distast the ambition of the <hi>Lacedemonians. Epaminondas</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his advantage,<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> caused his Army to march with speed, and wan the

               </gap>
standing that the <hi>Thebans</hi> had possessed themselves of that pass, despairing to
recover it, he made his Army to march a great compass about the Country
of <hi>Phocide,</hi> going along the Sea Coast through a dangerous, and troublesome
way, and so at the last he entered into the Country of <hi>Boeotia:</hi> and as he went,
he took in some little Towns, and certain Gallies that lay upon the Coast,
and at the last arrived at <hi>Leuctres,</hi> and there sat down to refresh his men, who
were overwearied with their tedious march. Then did <hi>Epaminondas</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advance that way to meet them, and having passed over some little Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
he discovered them in the plain of <hi>Leuctres,</hi> where his men were much
amazed to see so great an Army of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The six Counsellers came together to consider whether they should go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and fight, few against many, or else retreat, waiting for some better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
In this Councel, their opinions fell out to be equal. Three judged
it best to retreat, the other, whereof <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was one, thought it best to
fight, and with these three, <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> who was Captain of the Sacred Band,
joyned,<note place="margin">And Policy.</note> whereupon they all agreed to give them Battel. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> seeing
his Souldiers somewhat affrighted at the former ill signs, to put courage into
them, he suborned some that were newly come from <hi>Thebes,</hi> to scatter a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that no man could tell at <hi>Thebes</hi> what was become of the Arms that
hung up in the Temple of <hi>Hercules;</hi> but it was commonly said, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migods,
their Ancestors, had taken them away, to aid their posterity, at
this present time. He caused another also, who was newly come from <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonius</hi>
hole, to report; that the God which gives his Oracles therein, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to tell the <hi>Boeotians</hi> that when they had overcome their enemies
in the plain of <hi>Leuctres,</hi> they should celebrate yearly Plays to the honour of
<hi>Jupiter:</hi> and to gain the more credit to these devices, <hi>Leandridas, a Spartan,</hi>
that was banished out of his own Country, and now was assisting the <hi>Boeoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
being brought before the Souldiers, he encouraged them to fight vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
that Day: for he swore unto them, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had many
Oracles, bidding them to beware of <hi>Leuctres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> also, assembling his Army, encouraged them with strong,
and lively reasons, to shew their valour, so that at last the Souldiers being
freed from their superstitious fears, longed for nothing more than to come to
blows. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> ever concluded his Orations to them with these Words:
<hi>O worthy men, embrace sacred Death: Advance your selves to a most honorable,
and famous Fight for your Country, for the Tombs of your Ancestors, and for your
Holy things.</hi> Just at this very time there came to the <hi>Thebans</hi> an aid of five
hundred Horse, and fifteen hundred Foot, all <hi>Thessalians,</hi> conducted by <hi>Jason.</hi>
This <hi>Jason</hi> endeavored to have made peace with both parties, but could not
prevail.</p>
            <p>Also as <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> retired with his Army out of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> he met a great sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and their Allies, brought to him by <hi>Archidamus,</hi> the
Son of <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> These he sent before, thinking to daunt the courage of the
<hi>Thebans</hi> with the sight of them, and himself with the rest of his Army sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
returned into the plain of <hi>Leuctres,</hi> being fully resolved to fight: and
the <hi>Boeotians</hi> for their part shrunk not an inch back, and so on both sides they
set their men in Battel array. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> ordered his Battel after a new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
never practised by any Captain: For having chosen out of his Army the
best, and most valiant Souldiers, he placed them together in one of the Points
of his Battel, where himself meant to fight in Person, seconded by <hi>Pelopidas,</hi>
and his three hundred chosen men, called the <hi>Holy Band:</hi> In the other Point
he placed his weaker men, commanding them expresly not to abide the charge
of their enemies that should assail them in Front, but fair, and softly retire
when they saw them come near them: and it fell out as he wished: and he
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103996:46"/>
hoped to determine the Battel by the Virtue, and prowess of those where he
had placed all the flower, and choice of his Army.</p>
            <p>Now the sign of Battel being given,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> advanced with the
two Horns of their Battel, ordered in the form of a Crescent. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
one of the wings of the Battel of the <hi>Boeotians</hi> began to give back, and
the other with great fury ran to charge the enemy in the Flank, and soon they
were come to the Swords point, At the first, because either side fought des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately,
the Victory for a time stood doubtful, but at last <hi>Epaminondas</hi> his
Troop brake in amongst the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and slew most of those that were
about <hi>Cleombrotus.</hi> Yet while the King was alive, he kept back the <hi>Thebans</hi>
from the Victory, being accompanied with all the flower of his Army, who
fought very valiantly about him: But after he fell dead to the ground, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received and given an infinite number of wounds, then thronged they
together on all sides, and there was a bloody and cruel fight about his Body,
where were heaps of men slain one upon another, and though <hi>Epaminondas</hi>
did all that possibly he could, yet the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> made such resistance,
that at last they forced the <hi>Thebans</hi> somewhat to give back, whereby they
conveyed the Body of the King out of the press: But this continued not long:
For <hi>Epaminondas</hi> both by his words and example, did so raise up and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the hearts of his men, that they fought like Lions, and gave so fierce a
second charge upon their enemies,<note place="margin">The <hi>Spartans</hi> beaten.</note> that they wholly routed them and made
them flie for life, and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> fiercely pusuing the flying enemy, made
a great slaughter of them, and obtained the most glorious Victory that ever
Captain won, having in a pitched Field overcome the most Noble, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Nation of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and that with a far smaller number of men than his
enemies had. He also rejoyced more in this, than in all his other Victories,
because it happened to him in his Fathers life-time: and he often used to say,
that of all the honest and happy Fortunes that befel him, nothing joyed his
heart more, than that he vanquished the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> at <hi>Leuctres,</hi> his Father
and Mother living to see it: and indeed, he that day, did not only preserve
their lives, but of all his Citizens besides, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
utterly to destroy the <hi>Thebans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> used at all other times to come abroad fine and neat,<note place="margin">His Humility.</note> and with
a pleasant countenance: but the next day after this Battel, he came out very
sad, heavy, and pensive, and when his Friends asked him, whether he had
heard any ill news which occasioned this posture, he said, <hi>No: but</hi> (said
he) <hi>I perceive by my self yesterday, that being overjoyed with the Victory I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
my heart was more elvated than it ought, and therefore to day I correct that
joy, which yesterday exceeded its due bounds.</hi> He knowing that it was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> as much as possible, to conceal their losses, he suffered
them not to carry away all their dead Bodies together, but every City one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, by which it appeared that there were four thousand of them
slain: But of the <hi>Boeotians</hi> there were not found above three hundred
dead. This Battel was fought in the beginning of the second year of the
hundred and second <hi>Olympiade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having by this overthrow lost the greatest part of their
honour, which they had maintained so long, yet lost not their courage; but
to keep their youth still in heart, and to take away all fear from such as
had escaped, they sent <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> with an Army into <hi>Arcadia,</hi> who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to take a few small Towns of the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> and so to return home
again. Some say that <hi>Lycomedes,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> making an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode
neer to <hi>Orchomene,</hi> slew in an encounter, <hi>Politropus,</hi> Captain of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi>
and two hundred <hi>Spartans</hi> with him, which provoked the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi>
against them: and thereupon the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> finding themselves
too weak for them, they sought alliance and aid from the <hi>Thebans.</hi> Sure
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103996:46"/>
it is that these two States were now at enmity, which occasioned the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
and <hi>Thebans</hi> to joyn together, who, with their Allies being led by <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi>
entred into <hi>Laconia,</hi> with an Army of forty thousand men, besides
thirty thousand others that followed the Camp. At this time the <hi>Athenians</hi>
sent Captian <hi>Iphecrates,</hi> with twelve thousand men, to aid the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
But before their coming,<note place="margin">He plunders <hi>Laconia,</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was entered into <hi>Laconia,</hi> and
had sacked all the Country which had not been wasted by any enemy for six
hundred years before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spartans</hi> seeing their Country thus plundred, and destroyed, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to have gone out with such Forces as they had, but <hi>Agesilaus</hi> would
not suffer them, telling them how dangerous it was for them to leave
their City, and to set upon such a potent, and numerous enemy. This made
them quiet, and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> in the mean time marched with his Army
towards the River <hi>Eurotas,</hi> which at that time was risen very high,
because of the Winter rains. He endeavoured all he could, to draw forth
<hi>Agesilaus</hi> to a Battel, who beholding <hi>Epaminondas</hi> a great while, marching
with his Army in Battel aray along the River side at the Head of his Troops,<note place="margin">He bravos the <hi>Spartans.</hi>
               </note>
he wondered at his boldness, and Valour, but would by no means adventure
out of his Fort: So that when this Army had plundred all <hi>Laconia, Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
led them back again with a very rich Booty. And though <hi>Agesilaus</hi> was
commended for preserving his City in safety; yet <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had by this
inrode, and especially by his Victory at <hi>Leuctres,</hi> so impoverished the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that <hi>Sparta</hi> could never after recover that loss, nor grow into that repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and power which it had before. Yea, notwithstanding the aid sent
by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the skill and experience of <hi>Iphecrates, Epaminondas</hi>
returned with his Army intire as he came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> that he might keep the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> still underfoot, and
heap new troubles upon them, gave Counsel to the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> and their
Allies, to reedifie, and replenish with People the City of <hi>Messina,</hi> which the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had long before destroyed, and when all the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
had given their consents to it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Messina</hi> reedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> he forthwith, by diligent enquiry sought
out all that had been ancient Inhabitants in that City, and in the space of
eighty five Days, having repaired the ruined Houses, he raised again one of
the most Noble, and ancient Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> and left there a strong Garrison
for their security. This gat him as much, if not more love and honour than
any other service which he had ever done.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being freed from a great fear by his departure, made
an agreement with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> leaving to them the chief command by
Sea, and reserving to themselves that by Land. And afterwards, by the
assistance of the <hi>Athenians</hi> and that aid which came to them out of <hi>Sicily,</hi>
by little and little they recovered their Towns again.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arcadians,</hi> to stop their proceedings, assaulted the City of <hi>Pallene</hi> in
<hi>Laconia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pallene</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</note> and taking it by storm, put all the Garrison therein to the Sword,
and then razed the Town, and plundred all the Country there abouts. And
expecting that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would seek revenge, they sent for aid to
the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who sent <hi>Epaminondas</hi> and the other Counsellers to assist them
with six thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse. The <hi>Athenians</hi> having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
hereof, sent their Army under the conduct of <hi>Chabrias,</hi> who march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
directly to <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he met with a good supply of Souldiers
from the <hi>Megarians, Pallenians,</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> so that now he
had a Brigade of ten thousand men. These intended to fortifie and stop
all the passages and entrances into the Country of <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> The
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and their Allies joyning also with them, made up an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of twenty thousand men:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> fortified.</note> And accordingly, beginning at the
City of <hi>Cencrees,</hi> unto the Haven of <hi>Lecheum,</hi> they blocked all the ways
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103996:47"/>
from one Sea to another with mighty great pieces of Timber laid across,
and with a marvellous deep Diteh: and this great work was followed
with such speed, both by reason of the great multitude of labourers, as
also through the frowardness of them that prosecuted it with such ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness,
that they had quite finished it before the <hi>Boeotians</hi> could arrive
there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> when he came thither, viewing this fortification, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that the easiest place to storm it, was that which the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
themselves guarded, he sent to give them defiance though they were thrice
as many in number as he was, yet for all this they durst not come out,
but kept close under their fortification: Notwithstanding he assaulted them
in it, and at last drave them out. In the heat of the fight every one do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his best, some assailing, others defending, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> chose out the
valiantest men in all his Army, and bravely charging the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
he forced them to give back, and in dispite of them, he entered into <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponnesus,</hi>
which of all other his Noble exploits, was the most wonderful
and memorable action. From thence he marched to the Cities of <hi>Epidaure,</hi>
and <hi>Trozen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He beats the <hi>Spartans.</hi>
               </note> and so pillaged all the Country: But he stayed not to take
any of the Towns, because they had strong Garrisons in them: Yet he
put <hi>Sicyone, Phuente,</hi> and some other Towns into such fear, that they
yielded themselves to him.</p>
            <p>This being done, he went to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and overcame the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in
a set Battel, and beat them home, even to the Gates of their City: Yea
some of his men were so unadvised, trusting to their own Valour, that they
entered the Gates of their City pel mel with those that fled, which put the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> into such a terrible fear, that they ran with all speed possible
to shelter themselves in their Houses: But <hi>Chabrias</hi> making head, beat
them out again, and slew some, whereupon he caused a token of Triumph
to be set up, as if he had given the <hi>Thebans</hi> an overthrow, for which <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi>
laughed him to scorn. The <hi>Boeotians</hi> brought their Army as neer
unto <hi>Corinth</hi> as they could, and <hi>Chabrias</hi> with his Army encamped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Walls in a very strong Place of advantage, and there were many
Skirmishes betwixt them, in which <hi>Chabrias</hi> behaved himself with such Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
that he gained great reputation even of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> himself, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a time being asked, whom he thought to be the greatest Captain, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Chabrias,</hi> or <hi>Iphecrates? Its hard</hi> (said he) <hi>to judg whilst we are all alive,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>News was brought to him that the <hi>Athenians</hi> had again sent an Army
into <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> furnished with new Armor: Indeed this Army consisted
of ten thousand <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> whom <hi>Dyonisius</hi> the Tyrant, sent out
of <hi>Sicily</hi> to aid the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> having paid them for five months: they
did some reasonable service in this War, and at the end of Summer return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
home again.</p>
            <p>It fell out in these last encounters that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> having forced the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> that guarded the fortification before mentioned, had many
of them in his power to have slain them: but he contented himself only
with this Glory, that in dispite of them, he had entered into <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
seeking to do them no more hurt; which gave occasion to those
that envied his Glory, to blame him, and to accuse him of Treason, as
having willingly spared the enemies,<note place="margin">His Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> because they should in particular
thank him only: But here it will not be improper to take notice how he
behaved himself amongst his Citizens, and how wisely he defended his own
Integrity.</p>
            <p>Amongst all those that envied his Glory and Virtue,<note place="margin">He is envied.</note> there was one <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neclides,</hi>
an Orator, and an eloquent man, but withall, most wicked,
and very malicious. He finding that <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aminondas</hi> won so much honour
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103996:47"/>
by the Wars, never left perswading the <hi>Thebans</hi> to embrace Peace; and
prefer it before War, and that because hereby they should not always
live under the obedience, and command of one man. But <hi>Epaminondas</hi>
one day told him in the open Counsel: Thou wilt (said he) deceive the
<hi>Thebans</hi> whilst thou advisest them to leave the Wars: and highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ease and Peace, thou goest about to put iron bolts upon their Feet.
For War begets Peace, which yet cannot hold long but amongst them that
know how to maintain it with the Sword. Then turning himself to the
Citizens, he said, If you will have the Principality and command of all
<hi>Greece,</hi> you must shroud your selves in your Tents, and lie in your Pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
in the open Fields, and not follow Sports and Pastimes here at home.
For he knew well enough that the <hi>Boeotians</hi> undid themselves by ease and
Idleness, which made him endeavour continually to keep them in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and War.</p>
            <p>Upon a time when the <hi>Thebans</hi> were to choose Captains, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to choose <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> one of the six Counsellours: whereupon he
said to them: <hi>My Masters, pray you consider of it now you are at leasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you choose me: For I tell you plainly, If I be chosen your Captain, you
must to the Wars.</hi> He used to call the Country of <hi>Boeotia,</hi> which was a
plain, and Champion Country, the Stage of War, saying, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to keep it, unless the Inhabitants had their Targets on their Arms,
and their Swords in their hands: and this was not, because he did not
love Peace, and privacy to study Philosophy, or that he was not more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of them that were under his charge than he was of himself, using al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to watch and forbear his meat, when the <hi>Thebans</hi> were at their
Banquets, and Feasts, giving themselves over to their pleasures: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he knew them well enough, and was never more careful of any thing
than to keep his Army from Idleness.</p>
            <p>Upon a time the <hi>Arcadians</hi> desired him that some of his Companions
might come into one of their Towns to lie dry and warm there, all the
Winter, but he would by no means yield to it. For (said he to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers)
now they see you exercising your selves in Arms, they wonder at
you as brave and valiant men; but if they should see you at the Fire side
parching of Beans, they would esteem no better of you than of themselves.
Neither could he endure Covetuousness: for if at sometimes he gave his
men leave to go a free booting, his meaning was, that whatsoever they
got, should be bestowed in furnishing them with good Arms: and if any
went about to fill his Purse with money, he judged him unworthy to be
a Souldier. Upon a time he understood that his Target-bearer had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a great sum of money for the ransom of a Prisoner, whereupon he said
to him: <hi>Give me my Target, and go thy ways home, and buy thee a Tavern
wherein to spend the rest of thy life: for I perceive thou wilt no more, like an
honest man, put thy self in danger in the wars, as formerly thou hast done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
now thou art grown rich and wealthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was thus virtuous, and unblameable in his life, yet
the aforementioned <hi>Meneclides</hi> would never cease contending, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him: and one day he went so far as to upbraid him because he
had no Children, and was not married, and that he magnified himself
more than ever King <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had done.<note place="margin">His prudence.</note> To this <hi>Epaminondas</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Thou hast nothing to do to counsel me to marry, and in this respect,
there is never a man here whose advise I would less make use of than
thine, (and this he spake because the other was taken notice of to be an
Adulterer,) And whereas thou thinkest that I envy the fame and renown
of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> thou art fouly deceived. Yet let me tell thee, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he was ten Years in winning one City, I on the contrary, by putting
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103996:48"/>
the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to flight in one day, have delivered not only our own
City, but all <hi>Greece</hi> from their slavery, But thanks be to you? My Lords
<hi>Thebans</hi> (speaking to all the Assembly) by your assistance I did it,
and thereby overthrew the power and government of our insulting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
            <p>Yet after all his brave deeds,<note place="margin">Heis accused and abused.</note> both he and <hi>Pelopidas:</hi> were ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
for all their good service, by their ingrateful Citizens: For at
their return from <hi>Laconia,</hi> they, with some other of the six Counsellers, were
accused, that after the time that their Government was expired, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their power four months after the time appointed by the Law.
With much ado <hi>Pelopidas</hi> was quitted: But <hi>Epaminondas</hi> willed all his other
Companions to lay the fault upon him, who by his Authority forced them
to it; and instead of excusing himself, he told them all the brave exploits
which he had done at that time: Adding withal, that he was willing and
ready to die, if they so pleased, Provided that they wrote upon his Tomb,
that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was put to death, because he had compelled the <hi>Thebans</hi>
against their wills to burn the Country of <hi>Laconia,</hi> which in five hundred
years before had never been plundered. That he had repeopled the City of
<hi>Messina</hi> with Inhabitants, two hundred and thirty years after it had been laid
wast by the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> That he had brought all the People and Towns
of <hi>Arcadia</hi> to be as one Body, in League together, and had set all the <hi>Greeks</hi> at
liberty: and all these things (said he) we did in that Journey. The
Judges when they heard this worthy and true defence, they all arose from
their seats, and laughed heartily, and would not take up their Balls to Ballot
against him.</p>
            <p>But for the second accusation, to wit, that he had shewed favour to the
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> for his own particular honour, he would make no particular
answer to it before the People, but rising out of the Theater, he passed
through the Assembly and went into the Park of Exercises. Upon this the
People being incensed against him, refused to chuse him into Office as they
had wont to do, though there was a great need of him, and created other
Counsellers to go into <hi>Thessaly:</hi> and the more (as they thought) to despite
him, they commanded him to go that expedition as a private Souldier, which
he refused not, but went very willingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pelopidas</hi> being sent a second time into <hi>Thessaly</hi> to make peace between the
People and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Pheres,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pelopidas</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned by a Tyrant.</note> was by this Tyrant (not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he was an Ambassadour, and a <hi>Theban</hi>) committed to Prison, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>Ismenias.</hi> Upon this, the <hi>Thebans</hi> being justly offended, sent an
Army of eight thousand Foot and five hundred Horse against him, howbeit
under the conduct of unskilful Captains, who, wanting judgment to use their
advantages, thought good to return home without doing any thing: But as
they went back, <hi>Alexander,</hi> being stronger in Horse than they, pressed hard
upon their Reer, killing some, and wounding others; so that the <hi>Thebans</hi>
knowing neither how to go forward nor backward, were in great distress;
and that which aggravated their misery was, that their Victuals were almost
spent. Being thus almost out of hope ever to get home in safety, <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
being at that time a common Souldier among the Foot, both the Captains
and Souldiers earnestly intreated him to help to redress this disorder. He
thereupon chose certain Footmen that were light armed,<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> and all the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and with these putting himself into the Rere of the Army, he so lusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repulsed the Enemy, that the rest of the Army afterwards march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in great safety, and still making Head, as occasion served, and
keeping his Troops in good order, he at last brought them all well
home.</p>
            <p>This brave Act Crowned him with new Glory, confounded his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103996:48"/>
and made him well spoken of every where, and by it he obtained the
love and good will of the Citizens, who set great Fines upon the heads of
those Captains who had behaved themselves so unworthily in that expedition.
And now the People seeing that by so many worthy deeds he had stopped
the slanderous mouths, and confuted the accusations of his ill willers, they
chose him again their Captain General to conduct a new Army into
<hi>Thessaly:</hi> At his coming all the Country wonderfully rejoyced, only the
Tyrant with his Captains, and Friends were exceedingly dejected, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with fear, being Thunderstruck with the fame of so Noble a Captain,
and his Subjects had a good mind to rise up against him, hoping that they
should shortly see the Tyrant fully recompenced for all the wicked and cursed
deeds that he had done amongst them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epaminondas</hi> when he came into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> preferred the safety and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his Friend <hi>Pelopidas</hi> before his own Honour and Glory,<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> and
fearing lest <hi>Alexander</hi> when he should see himself and his State in danger to
be overthrown, should in his rage revenge himself upon <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
purposely drew this War out in length, marching often about him, but
never setting upon him in good earnest, often seeming to make preparations,
and yet still delaying: and this he did, to mollifie the heart of this Tyrant,
and not to provoke (to the danger of his Friend) the inhumane and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled
passion of this cruel Bloud-sucker. Yet he being a Monster com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of cruelty, and cowardliness, was so afraid of the very name and
reputation of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> that he presently sent some to him to excuse his
fact, and to crave Peace. But <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was not willing that his <hi>Thebans</hi>
should make Peace and Alliance with so wicked a man, only he was content
to grant him a Truce for thirty Days,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pelopidas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased.</note> upon the delivering to him <hi>Pelopidas</hi>
and <hi>Ismenias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So with them he returned back to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and always continued a faithful
Friend to <hi>Pelopidas</hi> so long as they lived together: Yet would he never share
with him in his Riches, but did still persevere in his former strict Poverty and
Discipline. He was very bold, and yet it was mingled with a winning
sweetness, and a lively grace, as may appear in sundry Examples. Besides
his bold speech to <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> mentioned before: At another time the <hi>Argians</hi>
having made a League with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> sent their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
into <hi>Arcad<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a,</hi> to see if they could gain the <hi>Arcadians</hi> to be their Friends,
And these Ambassadors began roundly and hotly to charge and accuse both
the one and the other, and <hi>Callistratus</hi> speaking for them, reproached them
with <hi>Orestes,</hi> and <hi>Oedipus: Epaminondas</hi> being present at that Assembly,
stood up,<note place="margin">His witty Speeches.</note> and said, <hi>My Lords, we confess that in times past we had a man
that killed his Father, and in</hi> Argos, <hi>one that killed his Mother, but as for us
now, we have banished all such wicked Murtherers out of our Country, and the</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
<hi>have intertained them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time when the <hi>Spartans</hi> had laid many great and grievous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
to the charge of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> he said, <hi>If they have done nothing
else, my Lords of</hi> Sparta, <hi>yet at least they have made you forget to speak little.</hi>
But that which was most excellent, and observable in <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> and
which indeed did stop the mouth of envy it self was his moderation, and
temperance, knowing how to use any state or condition, and never to rage
either against himself or others, always, bearing this mind, that howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they took him, and in what place soever they set him, he was well
contented, so that he might but advance the good of his Country: As
may appear by this Example: on a time his evil-willers, thinking to bring
him into disgrace, and meerly out of spite, made him superintendant or
overseer of all the customs, whilst others of his inferiors, unworthy to be
compared with him, were placed in the most honourable Offices: Yet
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103996:49"/>
despised he not this mean Office,<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Humility.</note> but discharged it very Faithfully: For
(said he) <hi>the Office or Authority shews not only what the man is, but also the
man what the Office is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was returned out of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> the <hi>Arcadians</hi>
were overcome by <hi>Archidamus</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who in the fight
lost not a man, and therefore they called this journey the <hi>tearless Battel:</hi>
and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> foreseeing that the <hi>Arcadians</hi> would yet have another storm,
he gave them counsel to fortifie their Towns, which they did according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Megalopolis</hi> built.</note>
and built that City which afterwards was called <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> situated
in a very convenient place. Whilst the <hi>Thebans</hi> made War with the <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
their Neighbours, the mind of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was always lifted up to
high enterprizes for the good of his Country, wherefore in an Oration
which he made to his Citizens, he perswaded them to make themselves
strong by Sea, and to endeavour to get the principality, and to make
themselves the Lords thereof. This Oration was full of lively reason,
whereby he shewed and proved unto them, that the enterprize was both
honourable, and profitable, which he made out by sundry Arguments,
telling them that it was an easie thing for them, who were now the
stronger by Land, to make themselves also the stronger by Sea: and the
rather, for that the <hi>Athenians</hi> in the War against <hi>Xerxes,</hi> though they
had armed and set forth two hundred Gallies, armed and well appointed
with men, yet they willingly submitted themselves to the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
He alleadged many other reasons, whereby he prevailed so far, that the
<hi>Thebans</hi> were willing to undertake the enterprize, and thereupon gave
present order to build an hundred Gallies,<note place="margin">The <hi>Thebans</hi> build a Navy.</note> and an Arsenal with so many
Rooms that they might lay them under covert in the Dock: They or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
also to send to them of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and of <hi>Chio,</hi> and of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> to
desire their furtherance in this enterprize: for which end <hi>Epaminondas</hi>
was sent with an Army unto these Cities: In his Passage he met with
<hi>Leches,</hi> a Captain of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> with a number of Ships in his Fleet,
who was set on purpose to hinder this design of the <hi>Thebans:</hi> Yet <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi>
so affrighted him, that he made him retire back again, and
holding on his course he brought the aforenamed Cities to enter into
League with the <hi>Thebans.</hi> Shortly after the <hi>Thebans</hi> fell out with the
City of <hi>Orchomene,</hi> which had done them great hurt, and mischief, and
having won it by assault, slew all the men that were able to bear Arms, and
made all the women and children Slaves.</p>
            <p>Some time after the death of <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> certain private Persons of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinea,</hi>
fearing to be called to an account for their bad behaviours, and
robberies which they had committed, if the <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Elians</hi> should
agree, they so brought it about, that they raised a new quarrel in the
Country,<note place="margin">New Wars.</note> which was divided into two Factons, whereof the <hi>Mantineans</hi>
were the chief on the one side, and the <hi>Tageates</hi> on the other. This
quarrel went so far, that the Parties would needs try it by Arms. The
<hi>Tageates</hi> sent to request aid of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who accordingly chose <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas</hi>
their Captain General, and sent him with a good number of
men of War to aid the <hi>Tageates.</hi> The <hi>Mantineans</hi> being terrified with
this aid that came out of <hi>Boeotia</hi> to their enemies, and at the reputation
of their Captain, they immediately sent to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
the greatest enemies of the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> for their assistance, which
both the Cities granted. Upon this there fell out many and great skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
in divers parts of <hi>Peloponnesus:</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas</hi> being not far off
from <hi>Mantinea,</hi> understood by some of the Country men, that <hi>Agesilaus,</hi>
and his <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> were come into the Field, and that they wasted
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103996:49"/>
all the Territories of the <hi>Tageates;</hi> whereupon, judging that there were
but few men left in the City of <hi>Sparta</hi> to defend it, he undertook a
great exploit, and dangerous, and had certainly effected it, if the marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
good Fortune of <hi>Sparta</hi> had not hindred it.<note place="margin">A notable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note> His design was this:
He departed from <hi>Tegea,</hi> by Night, the <hi>Mantineans</hi> knowing nothing of
it, and taking a by way, he had certainly surprised <hi>Sparta</hi> without strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a stroak, had not a Post of <hi>Candia</hi> speedily carried word of it to
<hi>Agesilaus,</hi> who immediately dispatched away an Horse-man to give intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
to them of <hi>Sparta</hi> to stand upon their guard, and he himself
speedily hasted after, and arrived there a little before the coming of
the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who being very near the City a little before day, they
gave an assault to them that defended it. This made <hi>Agesilaus</hi> to bestir
himself wonderfully, even beyond the strength of so old a man: But his
Son <hi>Archidamus,</hi> and <hi>Isadas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Phoebidas</hi> fought valiantly on all
parts. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> seeing how prepared the <hi>Spartans</hi> were to oppose
him, began then to suspect that his design was discovered; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he left not off to force them all he could, though he fought
with great disadvantage, considering the places wherein he was: yea,
he continued fighting courageously, till the Army of the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
came on, and till the Night approached, whereupon he sounded a
retreat.</p>
            <p>Then being informed that the <hi>Mantineans</hi> came on also with their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he withdrew his Atmy somewhat father off from the Town, and
there Camped. After which he caused his men to refresh themselves
with Victuals, and leaving certain Horsemen in the Camp, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to make fires in the moring, and in the mean time himfelf
with the rest of his men,<note place="margin">Another but frustrated.</note> went to surprize <hi>Mantinea</hi> before any should
discover that he was departed. Yet herein also he failed of his purpose,
the prosperity of the <hi>Thebans</hi> being come to its height, and the course
of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> his Life drawing neer to an end, whereby <hi>Greece</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of this Noble and Famous Captain, from whom was taken a most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Victory, and that twice, by strange accidents.</p>
            <p>For at the second time, when he was come neer to <hi>Mantinea</hi> that was
left without guard and defence, just then, on the other side of the Town
there arrived six thousand <hi>Athenians,</hi> conducted by their Captain <hi>Hegele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
who having put sufficient force into the Town, ordered the rest of
his Army in Battel array without the Walls, and immediately also came
the <hi>Mantineans,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> together, who prepared to put all to
the hazard of a Battel, and therefore sent for their Allies from all parts:
and when they were come together they were in all twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and two thousand Horse. The <hi>Arcadians, Boeotians,</hi> and their
partakers were thirty thousand Foot,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> and three thousand Horse. When
they came to the Battel, first the Horse charged with great Fury, and
the Horsemen of the <hi>Athenians</hi> encountering with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> proved
too weak for them, not because they were less valiant, or hardy than
the other, but because they had not so good Chieftains, and had few
Archers amongst their Troops. The <hi>Thebans</hi> on the other side were all
excellently well appointed, and had <hi>Thessalians</hi> amongst them, men very
skilful in their Bows, who so plied the <hi>Athenians</hi> that they wholly
brake them, and put them to the rout, yet in their flight they did
not run amongst their Foot-men, which made them somewhat recover
their Honour which they had lost by running away. On the contrary
part, as they fled, they met with some Companies of <hi>Negropont,</hi>
whom the <hi>Arcadians</hi> had sent to take in certain Hills hard by the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103996:50"/>
plain where the Battel was fought, whom they put all to the
Sword.</p>
            <p>The men at Arms of the <hi>Thebans</hi> seeing them turn their backs, did
not pursue them at all, but presently gave charge upon a great Battalion
of Foot-men, forcing them all they could to break, and run through
them. So the fight was very cruel and sharp, yet in the end the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
were forced to quit the place: whereupon a Collonel of Horsemen
of the <hi>Elians,</hi> who stood as a reserve to guard the Rere, defended them,
and encountering with the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> he resisted them, and made them
give back, which reinforced the fault of the left point of their Army.
But in the right point, after the Horse-men had charged one another,
the fight was soon determined: For by reason of the great number
of men at Armes of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and <hi>Thessalians,</hi> the <hi>Mantineans</hi> and their
partakers were soon put to rout, and having lost a great number of their
men, they sheltered themselves under the Battalion of their Foot-men,
and this was the issue of the fight between the Horse-men,</p>
            <p>As for the infantry, after they came once to the Sword, it was a
marvellous bloody, and cruel fight. For never before that time was there
so many Greeks in the Field one against another, nor so great and
expert Captains, nor such Valiant Souldiers as were now. The
two Nations that at that time bare the Name to be the bravest Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in all the World, to wit, the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
were now set in Front one against the other, and they began to
charge, neither sparing Life nor Limb. The first charge they gave
was with their Pikes, which being soon broken with the huge blows
they gave each other, then they came to it with their Swords, and
lustily laying about them, Body to Body, Death raged in every place,
and there was a mighty carnage made: for neither part shrunk back,
or gave over with weariness, but stood to it like undaunted men.
And so continued this dangerous Fight for a long time, by reason of
the valiantness of either party, the Victory stood doubtful for a great
while, and it could not be judged which side was like to have the
upper hand, For every one that fought, had this resolution in his
heart, not to fear Death whatsoever befel them: But rather desiring
to make proof of their utmost Valour, they willingly parted with their
lives to lye in the Bed of Honour. By reason whereof, though the
fight was sharp and cruel, yet the event remained for a long space
so uncertain, that it could not be discerned to which side the Victory
should fall.</p>
            <p>But at last, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> seeing no other remedy, but that the issue of
this doubtful Fight depended upon his own Virtue and Valour, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
with himself to adventure his life upon it: and presenty gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about him all the best, and choisest men of his Army, and of them
having compounded a Company of stout and resolute Blades, he ran
with great fury into the thickest, and greatest press of all his enemies,
marching himsels the foremost man in all his Troop, with a Spear in his
hand, with the which at the first blow he gave, he slew the Captain
of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and straightway the rest of his Company began to
assail their enemies. But <hi>Epaminondas</hi> laying about him like a lion, slew
so many in the place where he stood with his own hands, that at last
he opened the Battel of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whom he pursued and laid
on them so lustily, that they being unable any longer to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the irresistable fury of himself and his followers, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to give back and leave the place to the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> who yet follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them at their heels, beating them down so eagerly, that in a short
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103996:50"/>
space the whole Field was covered with dead Bodies, lying on heaps one
upon another.</p>
            <p>But in the end, the <hi>Lacedomonians</hi> seeing that they could no way save
themselves, gathered courage out of despair, and a Company of them joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, all set upon <hi>Epaminondas</hi> throwing an infinte number of Darts
at him, of which some he avoided, others he received upon his Target,
but yet there were many that stuck in his Body which he pulled out,
and fought with the same Weapons against those that had thrown them
at him. At last, when he had done more than a man, and beyond all
humane strength, thereby to win Honour to his Country by gaining
them the Victory, a certain <hi>Laconian</hi> called <hi>Anticrates,</hi> thrust him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Breast with a Dart with such force,<note place="margin">He is deadly wounded.</note> as breaking the Wood, he
left the Iron Head sticking in his Body. Having received this deadly
wound he fell immediately to the ground: But then was there a more
cruel fight about him than ever there was before, which occasioned
great Slaughter on both sides, till the <hi>Thebans</hi> by fine force made
their enemies to flie for their lives, and when they had pursued them
a while, they returned back to their Camp that they might keep the
dead Bodies in their Power, which was a certain Sign that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
was theirs, and then they sounded a retreat, and so the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
ended.</p>
            <p>Both sides challenged the Victory and made Triumphs for it. The
<hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did it, because the <hi>Athenians</hi> had slain those of <hi>Negropont</hi>
that were sent to seize upon the Hills before mentioned, and kept their
bodies in their power.<note place="margin">The <hi>Spartans</hi> beaten.</note> The <hi>Thebans</hi> on the other side having overcome
the <hi>Spartans,</hi> had the bodies of them that were slain in the Battel, in
their power, which was by far the greater number, wherefore they
said, that they were the Victors, Thus both standing upon their tearms,
it was a good while before either would send a Trumpet or Herauld to
the other for leave to bury their dead. Yet at last the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
sent first, and then they all betook themselves to give the dead an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Burial. And as for him that had killed <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> he was
highly esteemed and honoured for his Valiant Act, and the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
gave him many rich Presents, and made him and his Posterity free
from all publick Taxes and contributions in the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Epaminondas</hi> he was brought yet alive into his Tent; howbeit
his Physitians, and Surgeons being called together to dress his Wounds:
they all concluded that so soon as they plucked the Head of the Dart
out of his body, he must needs die. And truly he made a most noble and
worthy end. For first he called for his Target-bearer, who was always
at his hand in the Battel, and asked him: <hi>Is my Target safe?</hi> He
brought it straight. Then he asked, <hi>Who had the Victory?</hi> The <hi>Boeoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
answered, the Target-bearer. Then he commanded them to bring
to him <hi>Diophantus</hi> and <hi>Jolidas:</hi> they told him they were both dead:
Upon this he advised his Citizens to make Peace with their enemies,<note place="margin">His advice to the <hi>Thebans.</hi>
               </note>
for that they had not any Captain of skill to lead them to the Wars.
<hi>And now</hi> (said he) <hi>it is time for me to die, and therefore pluck the
Dart Head out of my Body.</hi> At this word all his Friends that were about him
fetched grievous sighs, and even cryed out for sorrow: and one of
them weeping, said unto him: Alas <hi>Epaminondas!</hi> Thou diest now
and leavest no Children behind thee: <hi>Yea</hi> (said he) <hi>that I do: For
I leave two fair Daughters behind me, whereof the one is the Victory at</hi>
Leuctres,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> 
               <hi>and the other this of</hi> Mantinea. So they pulled out the Dart,
and immediately he gave up the Ghost, without shewing any sign that he
was at all troubled at it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:103996:51"/>
He used often to say, <hi>That War is the Bed of Honour, and that it is
a sweet Death to dye for ones Country.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> He was one of the bravest Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that ever we read of: For whereas others excelled in some one or
two Virtues by which they made their Fame great and glorious, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
in all the Vertues and good Parts that could be desired in a Grave,
Politick and great Captain, to make him compleat in all things that
could be expected in an Heathen. In his time he advanced his Country
to the Principality of all <hi>Greece.</hi> But after his Death they soon lost it:
and not long after <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> utterly brake them in pieces,
made Slaves of those that survived, and razed their City to the very
ground. As in his life time he had always detested covetousness, so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Death the <hi>Thebans</hi> were faign to bury him at the common charge
of the City,<note place="margin">His Poverty.</note> because they found no mony in his House to defray the

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Antipater,</hi> riding his circuit about the Province of <hi>Judea,</hi> whereof
<hi>Julius Caesar</hi> had made him Governour, repressed them who were desirous of
innovation, both by threats and counsel, telling them, that if they would be
content with their Prince <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> (whom <hi>Caesar</hi> also had confirmed in the
High-Priesthood) they might live happily in their own <hi>possessions:</hi> but if they
promised themselves new hopes, and thought that they should gain much
by innovations, they should have him a Master instead of a Governour, and
<hi>Hyrcanus</hi> a Tyrant instead of a King: and <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
instead of Princes; for that they would by no means suffer any thing to
be altered from what they had setled. But <hi>Antipater</hi> perceiving <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> to
be dull and idle, he settled the state of the Province as himself pleased, making
his elder Son, <hi>Phasaelus,</hi> Governour of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the Countries adjoyning;
and to <hi>Herod</hi> his second Son, being then a very young man, he committed the
care of <hi>Galilee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> being <hi>Praefect</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> is made Governour of <hi>Galilee.</hi>
               </note> there was one <hi>Esekias,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> who, associating
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103996:52"/>
to himself many other lewd persons, exercised thievery, and used to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions

he put him to Death; which fact of his, gat him much favour with the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
which Province also was then under his Government.</p>
            <p>The violence, and bold nature of <hi>Herod,</hi> who was desirous of the Tyranny,
much terrified the Princes of the <hi>Jews,</hi> wherefore they addressed themselves
to <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> and openly accused <hi>Antipater;</hi> but especially they complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Herod,</hi> for that he had put to death <hi>Esekias,</hi> with many others, without
any Commission from <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> in contempt of their Laws, by which, no
man ought to suffer, though never so wicked, unless he were first condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Judges. The Mothers also of them that were killed, ceased not
daily in the Temple to weary both the King and the people with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
exclamations, desiring that <hi>Herod</hi> might be made to give an account
of these his doings before the <hi>Sanhedrim:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is cted before the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi>
               </note> whereupon <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> moved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
commanded <hi>Herod</hi> to be called before the Council, and to plead his
own cause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod,</hi> having ordered the affairs of <hi>Galilee,</hi> as he thought best for his own
advantage, being fore-warned by his Father, that he should not come into the
Council as a Private Person, he took with him a moderate, but yet a sufficient
Guard: not too great, lest he should terrifie <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> nor too little, lest he
should expose himself to danger from the Judgment. When <hi>Herod</hi> therefore
presented himself before the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> in his Royal Robes,<note place="margin">Appears with his Guard.</note> and his Guard in
Arms, they were all astonished, neither durst any one of them that accused
him in his absence, now speak a word against him; but all of them kept
silence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sameas</hi> his boldness.</note> not knowing what to do. Then one of the Council, called <hi>Sameas,</hi>
a just man, being not at all distracted with fear, rose up, and not only accused
<hi>Herod</hi> of presumption and violence, but laid the fault upon the Judges, and
King himself, who had granted him so great a liberty, and told them,
that afterwards,<note place="margin">A prediction.</note> by the just Judgment of God, they should be punished by
<hi>Herod</hi> himself; and the event made him a true Prophet. For the Judges of
that Council, and <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> himself, were afterwards put to death by <hi>Herod,</hi>
when he came to be King. But <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> perceiving that the Judges were
inclining to pass sentence of Death upon <hi>Herod,</hi> put off the business till the
next day,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> slyes.</note> and privately advised him to shift for himself; and so he departed to
<hi>Damascus,</hi> as if he fled from the King, and presenting himself before <hi>Sextus
Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Refused to appear when again cited.</note> and having secured his own affairs, he professed openly, that if he were
again cited by the Judges, he would not appear; which they took in great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
and endeavoured to perswade <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> that all these things tended to
his destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod,</hi>

who thereupon made him Governour of <hi>Caelosyria:</hi> He, being elated with this

farther against him that had advanced him to his dignity; hereupon he desist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
judging it sufficient for his future hopes, that he had shewed to that Nation
of what power he was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Marcus,</hi>

also the Kingdom of <hi>Judea,</hi> after the War should be ended, which they were
waging with <hi>M. Anthony</hi> and young <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Antipater</hi> (the Father of <hi>Herod</hi>) was feasted at <hi>Hyrcanus</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:103996:52"/>
his house,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antipater</hi> poysoned.</note> at which time, one <hi>Malichus,</hi> corrupting the Kings Butler, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
<hi>Antipater,</hi> and presently raising a band of Souldiers, seized upon the
Government of the City of <hi>Jerusalem. Phasaelus</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> being grievously
offended hereat, charged <hi>Malichus</hi> with their Fathers death, which he stifly
denied: But <hi>Herod</hi> had a great mind presently to revenge the murther, and
to raise an Army for that purpose, had not <hi>Phasaelus</hi> interposed, who judged
it more meet to circumvent <hi>Malichus</hi> by Policy, lest they should seem to be
the beginners of a civil War, and accordingly <hi>Phasaelus</hi> made as though he
accepted of <hi>Malichus</hi> his justification, and believed that he was not guilty of
his Fathers Death, and so busied himself in building a stately Monument for
him.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, <hi>Herod</hi> coming to <hi>Samaria,</hi> and finding it in a desperate
estate, by reason of their civil Dissentions, he appeased the discords amongst
the Inhabitants, and restored it to peace: and not long after, the Feast of
<hi>Pentecost</hi> approaching,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> goes to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </note> he went to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> accompanied with some Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
of whom <hi>Malichus</hi> being afraid, perswaded <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> not to suffer him
to enter; which <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> accordingly did, alledging that amongst the holy
People that came to the Feast, it was not lawful to bring in a mix'd multitude
of prophane men. But <hi>Herod</hi> making small account of the prohibition, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the City by night, and thereby mightily terrified <hi>Malichus;</hi> who, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
according to his wonted dissimulations, openly bewailed with tears
the death of <hi>Antipater,</hi> as of his dear Friend: And it was judged meet by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi>
Friends, that he should take no notice of this dissimulation, but courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
again entertain <hi>Malichus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod,</hi> by Letters, certified <hi>Cassius</hi> of his Fathers death, who, very well
knowing the temper of <hi>Malichus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is excited to revenge his Fathers death.</note> wrote back unto <hi>Herod</hi> to revenge the same,
and secretly also gave order to the Tribunes that were at <hi>Tyre,</hi> to be aiding to
<hi>Herod</hi> in his so just undertaking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cassius</hi> afterwar, having taken the City of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Governours came from
every place, bringing Crowns and Presents to him: and here <hi>Herod,</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Malichus</hi> should do the like, intended to have him punished for the
Murther of his Father: But <hi>Malichus</hi> had another design on foot, purposing,
that whilest <hi>Cassius</hi> was busie in prosecuting the war against <hi>M. Anthony,</hi> to stir
up the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> to revolt from the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to depose <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi>
and get the Kingdom to himself; But <hi>Herod,</hi> being politick, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the treachery, invited him and <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> with some other of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
to supper: At which time he sent one of his Servants, under pretence
of providing for the Banquet, whereas indeed he sent him to the Tribunes,
to desire them to set upon <hi>Malichus</hi> with their weapons, who, being mindful
of the commands of <hi>Cassius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Malichus</hi> slain.</note> finding <hi>Malichus,</hi> they ran him through, and slew
him; at which, <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> being astonished, fell into a swoun, and being scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come to himself, he asked who had slain <hi>Malichus,</hi> and when one of the
Tribunes answered, that it was done by the command of <hi>Cassius,</hi> he said, <hi>Truly</hi>
Cassius <hi>hath preserved me and my Country, in killing him who was a Traitor to
both;</hi> but whether herein he spake as he thought, or that through fear only
he seemed to approve the fact, is uncertain.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Cassius</hi> was gone out of <hi>Syria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A sedition at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </note> there arose a Sedition at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> For
<hi>Faelix,</hi> who was left there by <hi>Cassius</hi> with Souldiers, in revenge of the death of
<hi>Malichus,</hi> set upon <hi>Phasaelus,</hi> and the people betook themselves to their Arms.
At which time, <hi>Herod</hi> was with <hi>Fabius,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Damascus,</hi> and had
a mind to help his Brother, but was hindred by a sudden sickness: Yet did
<hi>Phasaelus</hi> get the better of <hi>Faelix,</hi> forcing him into the Town, and afterwards
agreeing upon quarter, suffered him to go out: But he was very angry with
<hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> that after the receipt of so many favours from him, he yet favoured
<hi>Faelix,</hi> and suffered the Brother of <hi>Malichus</hi> to seize upon some Castles, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103996:53"/>
amongst the rest, of the Castle of <hi>Massada,</hi> which was a most strong
piece.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Herod</hi> was recovered, he went against the Brother of <hi>Malichus,</hi>
and took from him all the Castles that he had seized upon,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod's</hi> valour.</note> and <hi>Massada</hi> also,
where he took him Prisoner, yet afterwards set him at liberty upon composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He also recovered three Castles that were seized upon by <hi>Masion,</hi> the
Tyrant of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> but gave Quarter to all the Souldiers, and sent
them home well rewarded;<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> by which means he procured the love of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
but the greater hatred of the Tyrant.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Judea,</hi> being assisted by <hi>Ptolomei,</hi> the son of <hi>Menaeus,</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Damascus,</hi> and <hi>Masion,</hi> the Tyrant of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> who adhered to
him for the hatred that he bore to <hi>Herod,</hi> whom <hi>Herod</hi> meeting, when they

               <note place="margin">He overcomes <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
               </note> overcame them in Battel, and drave
them thence; whereupon <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> honoured him with Crowns, as soon as
he returned to <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> For he was already accounted as one of the Family

the Son of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> and of <hi>Alexandra,</hi> the daughter
of <hi>Hyrcanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Anthony</hi> having overcome <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> there met him Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
from all Nations in <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and amongst the rest, some of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to accuse <hi>Phasaelus</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> alledging that <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
only in shew, but in truth, all the power was in the two Brothers: Yet
<hi>Anthony</hi> highly honoured <hi>Herod,</hi> who was come thither to wipe of all those
objections, whereby it came to pass, that his Adversaries were not so much
as admitted to speak with <hi>Anthony:</hi> and this <hi>Herod</hi> had obtained by his
Bribes.</p>
            <p>Yet not long after,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> accused to <hi>Anthony.</hi>
               </note> there came an hundred of the most honourable amongst
the <hi>Jews,</hi> to <hi>Daphne,</hi> near <hi>Antioch,</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> to <hi>Anthony,</hi> to accuse <hi>Phasaelus</hi>
and <hi>Herod,</hi> having chosen out of their whole number the most Eloquent, to
manage their business: But <hi>Messala</hi> undertook the defence of the two
Brothers, with whom also <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> joyned, who had betrothed his Grand-daughter
to <hi>Herod.</hi> Both Parties being heard, <hi>Anthony</hi> asked <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the two parties were fittest to Govern a Commonwealth? who, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the young men,<note place="margin">But acquitted.</note> 
               <hi>Anthony</hi> that loved them for their Fathers sake, his old

<hi>Judea,</hi> writing his Letters to the same purpose, and clapped fifteen of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
into Prison, and would have put them to death, had not <hi>Herod</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated

in displeasure slew them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antigonus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aristobulus</hi> hired the <hi>Parthians</hi> to translate the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

               </note> who coming along with
him, and some <hi>Jews</hi> also joyning themselves to him, he came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
and they set upon the Kings House: But <hi>Phasaelus</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> defended it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; and in the Market place, overcoming them in a fight, forced
them to fly into the Temple, where they shut them in, and placed sixty men
in some adjoyning houses, to prevent their flight: but the people hating the
two brethren, set fire on those Houses, and burnt the men in them, which so
inraged <hi>Herod,</hi> that he slew many of the people: and each laying wait for the
other, every day some were murdered.</p>
            <p>The day of <hi>Pentecost</hi> being come, many thousands of men, as well armed
as unarmed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails.</note> gathered together about the Temple, from all parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and seized upon the Temple, and City, all but the Kings House, which <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
kept with a few Souldiers, as <hi>Phasaelus</hi> did the walls. These brothers assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103996:53"/>
of them to flie, some into the City, and some into the Temple, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
into a rampire that was near the City.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Antigonus</hi> desired that <hi>Pacorus,</hi> the General of the <hi>Parthians</hi>
might be admitted to make peace between them:<note place="margin">The <hi>Parthians</hi> falshhood.</note> which <hi>Phasaelus</hi> assented to,

(another General of the <hi>Parthians</hi>) laying an ambush for him by the way:
<hi>Phasaelus</hi> assented, though much against the mind of his Brother <hi>Herod,</hi> and
was willing to go with <hi>Pacorus,</hi> and took <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> along with him. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi>
leaving two hundred Horsemen with <hi>Herod,</hi> and ten whom they called
<hi>Eleutheri,</hi> went along with the Ambassadors. And as soon as they were come
into <hi>Galile, Barzapharnes</hi> entertained them with a cheerful countenance, and
bestowed gifts upon them, but watched an opportunity to intrap them:
and so <hi>Phasaelus</hi> was brought with his Company to a place near the Sea-side
called <hi>Ecdippon;</hi> where <hi>Ophellus,</hi> a rich <hi>Syrian,</hi> understanding of the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

But he unwilling to leave <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Herod</hi> in danger, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulated
with <hi>Barzapharnes</hi> about the injury offered to them who were Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
who swore that these things were not true, and presently went to

            </p>
            <p>No sooner was he gon, but <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> and <hi>Phasaelus</hi> were clapped up in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
much detesting the perfidiousness of the <hi>Parthians:</hi> and an Eunuch

               <hi>Herod</hi> having intelligence what had happened to his

            <p>In their journey, his Mother, by the overthrow of her Coach, was in

But being restrained by those which stood by, he went towards <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>

in contempt of the <hi>Romans:</hi> and when <hi>Anthony</hi> also had declared to the

<hi>Herod</hi> should be made King:<note place="margin">The Senate make him King.</note> 
               <hi>Antigonus</hi> was declared an enemy, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>Whilest these things were transacting at <hi>Rome, Ventidius,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

            <p>
               <hi>Ventidius</hi> encamped near to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and drew from <hi>Antigonus</hi> a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

should raise him some new troubles; which <hi>Antigonus</hi> submitted to, hoping
that the <hi>Parthians</hi> would shortly come to his aid.</p>
            <p>After the Senate was dismissed, <hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> went out, leading <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
between them, who also accompanied with the Consuls, and other

            <p>Shortly after <hi>Anthony</hi> being to go to the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, had all his Acts, as
well past as to come, confirmed by the Senate, whereupon he sent to some
Kings by his own authority to pay certain Tributes to him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom enlarged.</note> and he made <hi>Herod</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> being returned out of <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> quickly gathered store of
Souldiers, both of such as he hired, as also of his own Countrymen, passing
through <hi>Galile</hi> against <hi>Antigonus:</hi> being aided by <hi>Silo,</hi> and <hi>Ventidius,</hi> who
were commanded by <hi>Anthony</hi> to conduct him into his Kingdom; and as he
went on, his Forces daily increased, and all <hi>Galile,</hi> except a few, sided with
him.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Herod</hi> was marching towards <hi>Massada,</hi> where he was necessarily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his Kindred, <hi>Joppa</hi> would not let him pass, wherefore he was to reduce

               </note> he hasted to <hi>Massada</hi> to raise the Siege, and his

               </note> he hasted towards <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and
though <hi>Antigonus</hi> had laid ambushments for him in divers places, yet he drew
near to the City, <hi>Silo</hi> following, and the <hi>Jews</hi> being terrified with his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
When he had encamped on the West side of the City, they upon the Walls
shot at him with Darts and Arrows: others also sallying out in Troops, beat
up some of his quarters. Then did <hi>Herod</hi> by an Herald proclaim round about
the Walls, that he came for the publick good, and to preserve the City from
ruin, and withal, he promised pardon for all former actings. On the other
side <hi>Antigonus,</hi> directing his Speech to <hi>Silo,</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> told them, that
it was unjustly done of the Senate to give the Kingdom to <hi>Herod,</hi> a private
man, and an <hi>Idumaean,</hi> and so but an half-Jew, whereas by custom it was to
be given to one of the High-Priests line. His men also shooting valiantly from
the Towers, drave the enemy from the Walls: and <hi>Silo</hi> (who was beforehand
bribed by <hi>Antigonus</hi>) suborned some of his Souldiers to demand of <hi>Herod</hi> more
provisions, and larger pay, and to be withdrawn into commodious Winter-quarters.
The Army being thus troubled, and beginning to dislodg, <hi>Herod</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
the Captains, and Souldiers of <hi>Silo</hi>'s Army, that they would not now
forsake him, he being sent both by <hi>Anthony, Caesar,</hi> and the Senate, to take
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103996:55"/>
possession of the Kingdom; and withal he sent into all the Country, and
brought in such store of provisions, that there was no occasion for <hi>Silo,</hi> and
his Army to complain. He commanded his Friends also that inhabited about
<hi>Samaria,</hi> that they should bring to <hi>Jericho</hi> Corn, Wine, Oyl, Cattle, and
other necessaries, that the Souldiers for the future might have plenty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antigonus</hi> having intelligence hereof, sent forth some to intercept the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualers:
but <hi>Herod</hi> taking with him some Cohorts, <hi>viz.</hi> five of the <hi>Romans</hi>
and as many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> with some forreign Souldiers, and a few Horse mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> takes <hi>Jericho.</hi>
               </note> flew out to <hi>Jericho,</hi> and found the City forsaken of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
and five hundred Families of them were fled to the tops of the Hills,
whom he took, and dismissed in safety: But the <hi>Romans</hi> entring the City, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it, where they found all sorts of precious movables. <hi>Herod</hi> leaving a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
there, returned to his Camp before <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and then dismissed the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
sending them into Winter-quarters in <hi>Idumaea, Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Galile,</hi> which
Countries were lately surrendred to them: But <hi>Antigonus</hi> by bribes obtained of
<hi>Silo,</hi> that part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army should he quartered in <hi>Lydda,</hi> currying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
favour with <hi>Anthony:</hi> and thus the <hi>Romans</hi> lived in plenty, and without
bearing Arms.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Herod</hi> could not be idle:<note place="margin">His activity.</note> For sending his Brother <hi>Joseph</hi> into <hi>Idumaea,</hi> with
a thousand Foot, and four hundred Horse, himself went into <hi>Samaria,</hi> and there
setled his Mother, and the rest of his kindred, whom he had drawn out of <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sada:</hi>
Then did he march into <hi>Galile,</hi> where he surprized some places which were
yet held by <hi>Antigonus</hi> his Garrisons: and when he came to <hi>Sephorus</hi> in snowy
weather, <hi>Antigonus</hi> his men fled away, and there he found great store of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries.
From thence he sent a Troop of Horse, and three Companies of
Foot against some Thieves that dwelt in Caves,<note place="margin">He pursues the Thieves.</note> not far from the Village <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bela,</hi>
by which means he kept them from doing mischief. Then he marched
with his whole Army, whom the enemy met, and encountred resolutely, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
much as <hi>Herods</hi> left wing began to waver, till himself coming on with the
main body, encouraged his own men to stand their ground, and caused the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to flee, whom he followed as far as <hi>Jordan:</hi> by which Victory he brought all
<hi>Galile</hi> into his subjection,<note place="margin">Subdues <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile.</hi>
               </note> except those that dwelt in the Caves: and so giving to
every one of his Souldiers a hundred and fifty <hi>Drachmes,</hi> and more to his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
he dismissed them into their Winter-quarters.</p>
            <p>There came <hi>Silo</hi> to him with his Captains who had wintered with <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and who now would maintain, them no longer, commanding the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
thereabout to spoil the Country of all Victuals, and to retire to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that the <hi>Romans</hi> might perish through famine: But <hi>Herod</hi> committed the
charge of provisions to his Brother <hi>Pheroras,</hi> and withal, commanded him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build
<hi>Alexandrium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexandrium</hi> rebuilt.</note> who in a short time furnished the Souldiers with abundance
of all necessaries, and built again <hi>Alexandrium</hi> that had formerly been dismantled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ventidius</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> sent for <hi>Silo</hi> to assist him against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him first to assist <hi>Herod,</hi> and to bring <hi>Herod,</hi> and the rest of the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries
of those Provinces along with him: But <hi>Herod</hi> sending <hi>Silo</hi> to him, went
himself with his Souldiers against the Thieves that lived in Caves; and in the
mean time made <hi>Ptolomy</hi> Governour of the Country, which fell out ill for him;
for being set upon by those who had formerly disturbed the Country, he was
slain by them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ptolomy</hi> slain.</note> after which they retired into Fens, and inaccessible places, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing
with their inrodes, and robberies all the Country: But when <hi>Herod</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he made them pay dear for their Thieveries: for some of them he killed,
others flying to their fortified places he pursued,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> beats the Thieves.</note> and having taken them, put
them to death, and razed their strong holds, and sined the Cities in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Talents.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Anthony</hi> commanded <hi>Ventidius</hi> to send <hi>Machaeras</hi> to aid <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>
with two Legions, and a thousand Horse; but when he came, being
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103996:55"/>
corrupted by <hi>Antigonus</hi> with money, he would needs go to him, against <hi>Herods</hi>
mind, under a colour of observing his actions: but <hi>Antigonus</hi> suspecting him,
denied him admittance, and drave him away with slings, whereby he found
that <hi>Herod</hi> had given him good counsel, and blamed himself for not following
of it: whereupon he retired to <hi>Emmaus,</hi>

that came to hand, without distinction of Friend or Foe, being provoked by
<hi>Antigonus</hi> his dealing: At which cruelty <hi>Herod</hi> was much grieved, intending
to go to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and saying, that he needed other manner of men than those
who did him more hurt than his enemies, whereas of himself he was able to
subdue <hi>Antigonus:</hi> but <hi>Machaeras</hi> overtaking him, intreated him to stay, or if
he was resolved to go on, yet at least that he would leave with him his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Joseph,</hi> that with their united Forces they might make war upon <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus.</hi>
Thus, after much intreaty, he was reconciled to <hi>Machaeras,</hi> and so lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his brother <hi>Joseph</hi> with his Army, he commanded him in his absence,
that he should not put all to the hazard of a Battel;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> goes to <hi>Anthony.</hi>
               </note> but himself hasted

Foot. <hi>Anthony</hi> entertained him very honourably, and much praised him for
his valour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joseph,</hi> unmindful of his Brothers command, taking with him his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and five <hi>Roman</hi> Cohorts that were given him by <hi>Machaeras,</hi> went towards
<hi>Jericho,</hi> purposing to reap the enemies Corn, now that it was ripe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
in the mountains, because the <hi>Roman</hi> Cohorts were raw Souldiers,
most of them being lately taken up in <hi>Syria:</hi> yet there he was circumvented
by the enemy, in the midst of those fastnesses, and having lost six Cohorts, he
himself valiantly fighting,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joseph</hi> is slain.</note> was slain: <hi>Antigonus</hi> being in a rage, caused the
dead body of <hi>Joseph</hi> to be whipped, though <hi>Pheroras,</hi> his Brother, offered fifty
Talents to have redeemed it: After this loss, the <hi>Galileans</hi> revolting from their
Governours, drowned those that were of <hi>Herods</hi> party in the Lake: In <hi>Idumaea</hi>
also there were many innovations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> having made peace with his enemy, commanded <hi>Caius Sosius</hi> to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<hi>Herod</hi> against <hi>Antigonus,</hi> with two Cohorts: When <hi>Herod</hi> came to <hi>Daphne,</hi>
the Suburbs of <hi>Antioch,</hi> he heard of his Brother <hi>Josephs</hi> deah, which caused
him to hasten his journey, and coming to Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> he took thence
with him eight hundred men, and one Cohort of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and so came to
<hi>Ptolemais,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> from whence in the night he passed with his Army through <hi>Galilee:</hi>
Here his enemies met him, whom he overcame in fight, and forced them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Castle, from whence they had issued the day before: Them he assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but was compelled to desist, by reason of the extremity of the weather,
and to retreat into some neighbouring Villages: but upon the coming of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cohort from <hi>Anthony,</hi> they in the Castle were so affrighted, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
the same by night: <hi>Herod</hi> then hastned to <hi>Jericho,</hi> purposing to revenge
his Brothers death: and being come thither, he feasted his Nobles, and the
feast being ended,<note place="margin">A special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and his guests dismissed, he retired into his chamber, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
the room wherein they had supped, being now empty of company fell
down without hurting any, which made many to think, that surely <hi>Herod</hi> was
beloved of God, who had so miraculously preserved him.</p>
            <p>The next day, six thousand of the enemies came down from the Mountains
to fight with him, and their forlorn-hope with darts and stones so terrified the

            <p>
               <hi>Antigonus,</hi> desiring to have his strength seem greater than it was, sent one
of his Captains, named <hi>Pappus,</hi> with some forces into <hi>Samaria,</hi> whilst himself
went against <hi>Machaeras.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Herod</hi> took in five Towns, and
therein put two thousand of the Garrison Souldiers to the sword; and setting

he pitched his Tents before the Temple, intending to attempt them, as
<hi>Pompey</hi> had done in times past: and having encompassed the place with three
Bulworks, by the help of many workmen he raised his batteries; fetching
materials from all places thereabouts, and appointing fit men to oversee the
work;<note place="margin">Marries <hi>Mariamne.</hi>
               </note> and then himself went to <hi>Samaria</hi> to solemnize his Marriage with <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamne,</hi>

            <p>The Marriage ceremony being over, <hi>Sosius</hi> came with an Army of Horse

being come together, consisted of eleven Legions of Foot, and six thousand
Horse, besides the <hi>Syrian</hi> Auxiliaries, which were very many, and so they
pitched on the North-side of the City. Over this great Army were two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
<hi>Sosius</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> who purposed to displace <hi>Antigonus,</hi> as an enemy to
the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to establish <hi>Herod</hi> in the Kingdom, according to the

the City both for Man and Horse, whereby the Besiegers began to be
pinched: but <hi>Herod</hi> provided against their excursions, by placing ambush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

active and subtile to make void his endeavours; often sallying forth, and firing
their Works, both those that were finished, and others that were but begun,
and coming to handistrokes with the <hi>Romans,</hi> they were nothing inferiour to

The <hi>Sabbatical</hi> year now coming,<note place="margin">A Famine in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </note> brought a Famine upon the besieged
<hi>Jews,</hi> notwithstanding which, they built a new Wall within that which was
beaten down by the battering <hi>Rams,</hi> and so countermined the Enemies mines,
that many times they came to Handystrokes under ground, and making
use of despair instead of courage, they held it out unto the last, though
<hi>Pollio,</hi> the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> and <hi>Samias</hi> his Disciple, advised them to receive <hi>Herod</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the City, saying, <hi>that they could not avoid his being their King by reason of
their sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They held out the siege for five moneths space, though there was so
great an Army before the City: but at length twenty of <hi>Herods</hi> choicest Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
got upon the Wall, and after them the Centurions of <hi>Sosius.</hi> So that the
first Wall was taken on the forti'th day, and the second on the fiftieth, and
some Galleries about the Temple were burnt down, which <hi>Herod</hi> charged
(though falsly) upon <hi>Antigonus,</hi> thereby to bring him into hatred with the
people. When the outward part of the Temple was taken, and the lower
City, the <hi>Jews</hi> fled into the inward part of the Temple, and the upper City:
and fearing lest they should be hindred from offering their daily Sacrifices unto
God, they sent Ambassadours unto <hi>Herod,</hi> to desire leave, that such Beasts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
might be brought in which were to be sacrificed: This request <hi>Herod</hi> easily
granted, hoping that by this means they would leave their obstinacy, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to him. But perceiving that this courtesie prevailed not, and that they
were still resolute to continue the Sovereignty in <hi>Antigonus,</hi> he gave a

            </p>
            <p>The City being taken by assault,<note place="margin">Cruelty.</note> all places were filled with murthers: the
<hi>Romans</hi> being incensed against the <hi>Jews</hi> for holding out so long; and the <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Jews</hi> endeavouring to extirpate the contrary faction; so that there were
continual slaughters in the Porches and Houses; yea, the reverence of the
Temple, not saving the suppliants: They spared neither age nor sex, nor so
much as the little children: and though the Conquerour <hi>Herod</hi> besought, and
intreated them to forbear, yet none would hear, or obey him, but as if they had
been mad, they proceeded in their cruelty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antigonus</hi> coming down from the upper City, fell at <hi>Sosius</hi> his feet,

him <hi>Madam Antigonuus,</hi> and withall cast him into prison, and set keepers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him.</p>
            <p>And whereas a multitude of Strangers, that <hi>Herod</hi> had hired, came rushing
in, not into the Temple only, but even into the Sanctuary, some he thought
to restrain by intreaty, others by threats, and some by force, judging his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
worse than if he had been overthrown, if any of those things which
were not lawful to be seen, were exposed to the view of the prophane multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
He restrained also the plundering of the City, as much as in him lay;
intreating <hi>Sosius</hi> to do the like, asking, if the <hi>Romans</hi> would make him King of
a Wilderness, the City being so wasted by rapines and murthers: <hi>Sosius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that the Souldiers desired the plunder of the City, in regard of their
hard service in the siege:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> sayes the City.</note> To which <hi>Herod</hi> replied, that he would recompence
every man out of his own Treasury; and making good his promise, he freed
the City from further misery:<note place="margin">Rewards the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> For he bestowed gifts liberally upon the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and proportionably upon the Commanders, and bountifully upon <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius:</hi>
whereupon, <hi>Sosius</hi> offering a Crown of Gold unto GOD, withdrew
out of the City, leading <hi>Antigonus</hi> a Prisoner along with him to <hi>Anthony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> being thus setled in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> he advanced those of his own faction,
and daily put to death them of the contrary: Amongst whom, he slew all
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103996:57"/>
those of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> who had accused him of a capital crime, before he was
King, sparing only <hi>Pollio</hi> the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> and <hi>Samias,</hi> his Disciple, whom he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honoured.</p>
            <p>Then did he gather together all the Regal Ornaments, and much silver and
gold, which he exacted from rich men, all which he gave to <hi>Anthony</hi> and his
Souldiers.
He put to death also forty and five of <hi>Antigonus</hi> his chief Noble
men, setting watches at their doors, that none of them might be carried out
under pretence of being dead: and what gold or silver soever was found, was
all carried to <hi>Herod,</hi> so that there was no end of the peoples miseries, the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness
of the needy Conquerours consuming all their estates. The fields al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
lay untilled, because it was the <hi>Sabbatical</hi> year, in which it was unlawful to
sow the ground.</p>
            <p>Of these miserable times,<note place="margin">Who were spectators of it.</note> amongst others, were spectators, <hi>Zacharias</hi> the
Priest, with his Wife <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> Of the relicts of <hi>Davids</hi> stock, <hi>Hely</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph:
Anna</hi> also the Prophetess of the Tribe of <hi>Aser,</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> the just, who
received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that <hi>he should not see death, till he had

            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> being thus possessed of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> intended to keep him Prisoner
to adorn his Triumph; but <hi>Herod</hi> feared, that if <hi>Antigonus</hi> was brought to
<hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Anthony,</hi> he might there contend with him before the Senate for the
Kingdom: considering also how the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> hated him, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<hi>Antigonus;</hi> he thereupon gave great sums of money to <hi>Anthony,</hi> to cut

                  <hi>Anthony</hi> slew <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
               </note> which accordingly he did at <hi>Antioch: Antigonus</hi> being the first

               </note> freeing him from Prison, he suffered him to live in <hi>Babylon,</hi>
where were great store of <hi>Jews,</hi> who honoured him no less than as their King
and High-Priest: and not only they of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but all the rest of the Nation
of the <hi>Iews</hi> did the like; who in old time had been carried captive beyond the
River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> by the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> of whom there were many millions. But
<hi>Hyrcanus</hi> hearing that <hi>Herod</hi> was made King of the <hi>Iews,</hi> he began to cast his
hopes that wayes, expecting favour from <hi>Herod,</hi> whose life he had saved, when
he was called in question before the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> He consulted therefore with
the <hi>Iews</hi> that came to visit him, about his return into <hi>Iudea,</hi> who by all means
disswaded him from it, yet could they not prevail with him. Besides, <hi>Herod</hi>
desired by all means to get the poor old man into his clutches,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> and thereupon
wrote to him to get leave of <hi>Phraates</hi> and the <hi>Iews,</hi> that he might return, and
that they would not envy him the joynt rule with his Son in Law, the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now come, wherein he could requite the favours that <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, in being his nourisher and preserver. He sent also his Ambassadour
to <hi>Phraates</hi> with great Presents, intreating him that he would not hinder him
from being thankful to him that had deserved so well of him. <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> being
forward of himself, dismissed by the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and honourably furnished by
the <hi>Iews</hi> for the expences of his journey, he came at last to <hi>Herod,</hi> who enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him with all honour, gave him the upper hand in all Assemblies, and
the more honourable place at all Feasts, calling him <hi>Father,</hi> hereby to delude
him, lest he should suspect any treachery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> providing that none of the Nobility should be created High-Priest,<note place="margin">

her Son, and Brother of <hi>Mariamne,</hi> was neglected, and another from a strange

of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Anthonies</hi> darling, that she would procure the High-Priesthood
of <hi>Anthony</hi> for her Son. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> neglected her request; but shortly after,

then would deny her nothing: This she assented to, and sent them by <hi>Dellius,</hi>

whereupon he wrote to <hi>Alexandra,</hi> to send her Son to him, under some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
pretence: But these things coming to the ears of <hi>Herod,</hi> he thought it
not safe that <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> now in the flower of his age, being but sixteen, should
be sent to <hi>Anthony,</hi> the most potent man amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> and very much
given to his Lusts. Wherefore he wrote back, that if the youth did but step
out of the Kingdom, all the Country would be up in Arms; the <hi>Iews</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
for some innovations under a new King, and by this means he satisfied
<hi>Anthony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> being continually molested with the intreaties of his Wife <hi>Mariam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
that he would give the High-Priesthood to her Brother <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his right, he called a Council of his Friends, to whom he inveighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Mother-in-Law <hi>Alexandra,</hi> as if she had privately wrought Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against his Kingdom, and had endeavoured by <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s means to
translate it to young <hi>Aristobulus;</hi> yet, lest he should seem to neglect both
his piety to her,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aristobulus</hi> made High-Priest.</note> and the rest of that Kindred, he told them, he would now
restore the Priesthood to her Son, which hitherto <hi>Ananelius</hi> had supplied,
by reason of the young mans tender years: <hi>Alexandra</hi> being herewith
overjoyed, and withall grieved that she was suspected, fell a weeping, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her self of those accusations, and gave him many thanks for her Sons ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
promising that hereafter she would be most obedient unto him. And
thus <hi>Herod,</hi> in the life-time of <hi>Ananelius,</hi> gave the High-Priesthood to <hi>Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
being then but seventeen years old.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Herod,</hi>

                  <hi>Alexandra</hi> confined.</note> fearing lest his Mother-in-Law <hi>Alexandra</hi> should seek occasion
to raise new troubles, confined her to the Palace, and commanded her to do
nothing by her own authority: yea, he set so strict a guard over her, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was concealed from him of all she did, to the very expences of her Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This she took very heavily,<note place="margin">She complains to <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
               </note> and wrote to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> complaining of her

supposing that he had known all before? which, as soon as <hi>Sabbation</hi>
knew, though hitherto he was an enenmy of <hi>Herods,</hi> as being suspected

being thus informed of the plot, dissembled the matter till it was in
execution, and then surprized her in her flight, and brought her back:
Yet did he pardon her fault, not indeed daring to punish her, lest thereby he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103996:58"/>
should discontent <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> that was willing to take any occasion against him:
wherefore, under a colour of a magnanimous spirit, he made shew as if he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned

            <p>The Feast of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> being now come, the new High-Priest <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,</hi>
being just past seventeen years old, was to offer Sacrifice according to
the Law, and being clad in his Pontifical attire, he came to the Altar,
and performed the Ceremony with all Decency, whose excellent beauty
and stature, being higher than was usual for his age, and carrying in his
countenance the honour of his Lineage,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aristobulus</hi> highly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> drew the eyes, and love of all the
multitude upon him; every one calling to mind the worthy and memorable
actions of his Grand-father <hi>Aristobulus;</hi> and therefore, as overcome with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
towards him, they were so over-joyed, that they could not contain
themselves, but openly prayed for him, and wished him all joy, and that
more freely than was meet in those jealous times, under such a King, proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
openly, both the memory, and thanks they owed to the Family, for all the
benefits they had received from it.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Feast was ended, <hi>Aristobulus</hi> was entertained at a Banquet by
his Mother <hi>Alexandra: Herod</hi> also pretended favour to him, and enticed
him into a convenient place to sport with him after the manner of young
men, and when they were hot and weary, and left their sport, they walked
out to the Fish-ponds, which were near the Court, to take the fresh air, where
also they beheld some of the servants that were swimming: At last, by the
perswasion of <hi>Herod, Aristobulus</hi> undrest himself, and went in amongst them:
Then they, who were suborned by <hi>Herod,</hi> as it were in sport and jest, ducked
him as he was swimming, holding him under water, and never left off till
they had drowned him.<note place="margin">He is drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> This was the end of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> in the eighteenth
year of his age, and in the first year of his High-Priesthood, which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
returned to <hi>Ananelus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The report of these things coming to the Women, they were all on an
uprore, and did nothing but weep, and howl over the body of the young
man: Yea, sorrow overspread the whole City, every one bewailing the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
as if it had been his own: But <hi>Herod</hi> endeavoured by all means to
make the people believe, as if it had faln out by chance, without his privity,
not only feigning sorrow,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> but tears and grief also: and that he might the more
comfort the Women, he buried the body in a most magnificent manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
liberal in prodigality, in adorning his Monument, and in perfumes, and
other precious things.</p>
            <p>But his Mother <hi>Alexandra</hi> knowing the Treason, though she was oft ready
to lay violent hands upon her self, yet repressed her passion, seeming not to be
suspicious, till an opportunity of revenge might offer it self.</p>
            <p>And shortly after,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexandra</hi> complains to <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
               </note> she wrote to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> of the treachery of <hi>Herod,</hi> and
of the lamentable death of her Son. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> pitying her misfortune, took
a particular care of this business, as if it had been her own, and never rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from perswading <hi>Anthony</hi> to revenge the young mans death; telling
him that it was an unpardonable crime, that he, who by his help, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Kingdom that was anothers right, should rage so insolently against the
Family of the lawful Kings. <hi>Anthony</hi> being prevailed with hereby, when he
came to <hi>Laodicea</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> sent for <hi>Herod</hi> to come before him, to answer what
should be objected against him about the death of <hi>Aristobulus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod,</hi>

               </note> during the time of his absence, committed the care of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to his Unkle <hi>Ioseph,</hi> privately commanding him, that if <hi>Anthony</hi>
should do him any mischief, he should presently put his Wife <hi>Mariamne</hi>
to death; pretending that he so loved her, that he should esteem it a great
wrong, if any but himself should enjoy her beauty, yea, though it was after
his Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:103996:58"/>
When <hi>Herod</hi> came to <hi>Anthony,</hi> he so appeased him with rich Presents, that
he brought on purpose with him from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">But cleared by his Bribes.</note> and by his frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
with him, that afterwards <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> instigations prevailed little:
For <hi>Anthony</hi> said, that it was not fit that a King should be accountable for his
actions, otherwise he would cease to be a King: For having once given him
the honour, the free exercise of his Kingly power was to be admitted unto
him. He told <hi>Cleopatra</hi> also, that it was not fit for her too much to meddle
with other mens matters.</p>
            <p>During <hi>Herods</hi> absence, <hi>Ioseph</hi> Governing the Kingdom, he had occasion
many times to converse with <hi>Mariamne,</hi> partly upon business, and partly to do
her honour; and in their discourses there was often mention made how much
<hi>Herod</hi> loved her, which discourse was laughed at by the Ladies, especially by
<hi>Alexandra;</hi> But he was carried on with such a desire of provoking the Kings
love to them, that he told them what private command the King had given
him, supposing this was an infallible argument of his love, because he could
neither endure to live without her, nor in death to be disjoyned from her:
but the Ladies were not of his mind, rather abhorring the Tyranny of <hi>Herod,</hi>
who, though he were dead, yet would he seek their lives.</p>
            <p>Presently after, a rumour was spread about the City, that <hi>Anthony</hi> had put
<hi>Herod</hi> to death, which much troubled all the Court, especially the Ladies:
whereupon <hi>Alexandra</hi> perswaded <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that, taking them along with him,
he should fly to the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions that lay before the City, under the
command of the Tribune <hi>Iulius,</hi> so that if any trouble arose in the City, they
might be secured by the <hi>Romans;</hi> adding, that she hoped if <hi>Mariamne</hi> came
but once to the sight of <hi>Anthony,</hi> she might obtain any thing of him, yea, even
the Kingdom, with whatsoever belonged to the Royal Family.</p>
            <p>Whilst these things were under debate, there came Letters from <hi>Herod,</hi>
which dashed all, signifying how <hi>Anthony</hi> had honoured him, both in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Assemblies, and inviting him to his Feasts, and that, during the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> so that he feared her not for the time to come, but hoped
shortly to return to them, <hi>Anthony</hi> having given <hi>Coelosyria</hi> unto <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>Iudea,</hi> upon condition that she should not hereafter demand <hi>Iudea,</hi> nor
trouble him any further about that business.</p>
            <p>As soon as these Letters were received, the speech about flying to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
vanished,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> return.</note> but yet their debate about it was not hid: For as soon as <hi>Herod</hi>
had brought <hi>Anthony</hi> part of his way against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> he returned into
<hi>Iudea,</hi> and immediately his Sister <hi>Salome,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Cyprus</hi> told him what
<hi>Alexandra's</hi> counsel was; neither was she herewith contented, but she accused
her Husband <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as if he had been too familiar with <hi>Mariamne:</hi> and this she
did out of an old grudge, because the Queen (a woman of an high spirit) in
their womanly brabbles, had upbraided her with her obscure birth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mariamne</hi> by her Oath assured <hi>Herod</hi> of her chastity, who told her again,
how much he loved her; but she replied, that it was not the part of a lover,
to command that if he died, she should be put to death also. <hi>Herod</hi> judging
that this secret could never be known, except she had committed adultery
with <hi>Ioseph,</hi> had much ado to refrain from killing her immediately: but love
overcoming his passion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi> put to death.</note> he refrained; yed did he command <hi>Ioseph</hi> to be put to
death, without suffering him to plead for himself, <hi>Alexandra</hi> also he cast into
prison, as the cause of all these evils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleopatra</hi> having brought <hi>Anthony</hi> part of his way towards <hi>Parthia,</hi> returned
towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by the way, was entertained by <hi>Herod,</hi> who assured unto
her that part of <hi>Arabia</hi> which was granted unto her by <hi>Anthony,</hi> to which he
added the revenues of <hi>Iericho,</hi> where are great store of the best Date Trees, and
where Balsom grows,<note place="margin">Gardens of Balsom.</note> which being a precious Oyntment only grows there, in
two Gardens, both which are the Kings, the one of twenty acres, the other of
less.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:103996:59"/>
By this means <hi>Herod</hi> grew into great familiarity with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who sought
to allure him to her Lust, either through her great intemperance, or because
she sought by this means to betray him; but though she pretended love to
him, yet <hi>Herod</hi> refused, and held a consultation with his Friends about kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her, who disswaded him from it, and therefore having appeased her by
great Presents, and all manner of obsequiousness, he accompanied her as far as
<hi>Pelusium:</hi> yet fearing both her, and the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he reserved the
Castle as a refuge for himself, laying in as many Arms there, as were sufficient
for ten thousand men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> payed duely to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the Tributes of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
had given to her, not thinking it safe to give her any occasion of disgust
against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> being now free from troubles, and having taken <hi>Hyrcanium,</hi> a Town
which hitherto a Sister of <hi>Antigonus</hi> had kept, the <hi>Actian</hi> War brake forth,
between <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to assist <hi>Anthony.</hi>
               </note> whereupon <hi>Herod</hi> made great
preparation for the assisting of <hi>Anthony,</hi> but he freed him from the trouble,
telling him that he needed them not, and so dismissing him, <hi>Herod</hi> returned
home with a well-furnished Army, wherewith he invaded <hi>Arabia,</hi> going as
far as <hi>Diospolis,</hi> at which place the <hi>Arabians</hi> met him, and after a fierce conflict,
the <hi>Jews</hi> got the Victory.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Herod</hi> made many inrodes into <hi>Arabia,</hi> in the seventh year of
his Reign, after the death of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> at which time the <hi>Actian</hi> War being
begun,<note place="margin">A great Earthquake.</note> 
               <hi>Judea</hi> was shaken with such an Earthquake as never was the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in which ten thousand men were overwhelmed, by the ruins of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
yet the Souldiers received no dammage, because they lay in the open fields.
This being much aggravated by report, so emboldened the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that they
laid hold on the Ambassadours of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who, in this their affliction came
to demand peace, and slew them, and presently prepared for War with all
earnestness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> hearing hereof, encouraged his men, offered Sacrifice according to the
custome, and so in all haste marched with his Army over <hi>Iordan,</hi> and having
incamped at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> there the fight began, about the taking of a Castle
that lay between him and the <hi>Arabians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the <hi>Arabians.</hi>
               </note> in which the <hi>Iews</hi> got the better, and
after continual skirmishes, forced the <hi>Arabians</hi> to flight, who in their haste,
treading upon one another, they lost in all five thousand men: the rest were
besieged in their Camp, and extreamly wanting water, they sent Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
to <hi>Herod,</hi> who would not admit of them, and was more eager upon
them, for offering but fifty Talents for their freedom: They being parched
with continual thirst, came out of their Camp by great companies, offering
themselves to the <hi>Iews,</hi> by which means they took five thousand of them in
five dayes; and at last, the rest in the Camp came out to fight; but despairing
of any good success, there fell of them in the first conflict about seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
more. By this overthrow the courage of the <hi>Arabians</hi> was tamed, and
<hi>Herod</hi> was declared Governour of that Nation, and so returned home with
great Glory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Actian</hi> War being finished, wherein <hi>Caesar</hi> finally overthrew <hi>Anthony,
Alexandra</hi> hoped that <hi>Herod</hi> should be severely punished by <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexandra</hi>'s restlesness.</note> for assisting
<hi>Anthony</hi> against him; whereupon she sollicited her Father <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> not any
longer to suffer the affliction of their Family, but rather to reserve himself for
better times: For which end she advised him to seek for protection and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of <hi>Malchus</hi> the King of <hi>Arabia.</hi> These sollicitations her Father
at first repulsed, but at last being overcome by her Womanish importunity,
he sent Letters to <hi>Malchus,</hi> by one <hi>Dositheus</hi> a Friend of his, desiring him to
send some Horsemen to convey him to the Lake <hi>Asphaltitis,</hi> which is distant
from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> about three hundred furlongs. This <hi>Dositheus</hi> was Kinsman
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103996:59"/>
to <hi>Joseph,</hi> whom <hi>Herod</hi> had put to death, yet, to curry favour with the King,
he shewed him the Letters: <hi>Herod</hi> thanked him, and withal desired one cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
more, that he would seal up the Letters, and give them to <hi>Malchus,</hi> and
bring his answer to him. This he did, and the <hi>Arabian</hi> sent back word,
that he was ready to entertain <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> and his Family, and all the <hi>Jews</hi> that
were of his Party, and that he would send a band of Souldiers to conduct
them in safety, who should be obedient to <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> in all things. <hi>Herod</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received this answer, called <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> and asked him if he had any
confederacy with <hi>Malchus?</hi> who denying it, he produced the Letters
in the Councel of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and commaded him to be put to
death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> having thus dispatched <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herod</hi> goes to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </note> resolved to post unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and
expecting no good from him, because of his great Friendship to <hi>Anthony,</hi> he
was very jealous of <hi>Alexandra,</hi> lest, taking this opportunity, she should stir
up the people to rebel, and so fill the Kingdom with domestical seditions.
Wherefore committing the care of his Kingdom to his Brother <hi>Pheroras,</hi> he
left his Mother <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and his Sister <hi>Salome,</hi> and all his kindred in the strong
Castle of <hi>Massada:</hi> And commanded his Brother, that if any thing befel
him otherwise than well, he should retain the Government of the Kingdom
in his own hands: and because his Wife <hi>Mariamne,</hi> by reason of some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
could not live with his Mother, he placed her with her Mother
<hi>Alexandra</hi> in <hi>Alexandrion,</hi> committing the custody of them to his Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<hi>Joseph,</hi> and to <hi>Sohemus,</hi> an <hi>Iturian,</hi> under a colour of doing them honour,
but yet he gave them this command,<note place="margin">His cruel command.</note> that if they should certainly know that
any sinister hap befel him, they should presently put both the Ladies to death,
and to the uttermost of their power, keep the Kingdom for his Children,
and his Brother <hi>Pheroras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> having thus setled his affairs at home, posted to <hi>Rhodes</hi> to meet with
<hi>Caesar</hi> there, whither when he was come, laying only his Crown aside,
but retaining other his Princely Ornaments, he was admitted into <hi>Caesars</hi>
presence, where, with great constancy, and magnanimity of Spirit, he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confessed the love he bore to <hi>Anthony,</hi> as also the supplies he had sent
him of Corn, and Money: adding moreover that he was ready with the
same Faith to keep Friendship with <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> honours him.</note> This <hi>Caesar</hi> exhorted him to, and
restoring his Crown to him, exceedingly honoured him. Thus beyond all
expectation, is <hi>Herod</hi> again confirmed in his Kingdom, both by the free
gift of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and also by a Decree of the Senate, which <hi>Caesar</hi> procured
for him: and <hi>Herod</hi> gave great Presents both to <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, and to all
his Friends about him, even above his ability, to shew the greatness of
his mind.</p>
            <p>During his absence,<note place="margin">His Wife and Mother are full of discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</note> his Wife <hi>Mariamne,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Alexandra,</hi>
took it very ill that they were shut up in that Castle as in a Prison, so
that they could neither enjoy their own, nor make use of other mens goods:
especially when by their feminine flatteries they had fished out of <hi>Sohemus,</hi>
what <hi>Herod</hi> had commanded concerning them: She then began to wish that
he might never return home, supposing that she should live a most intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
life with him: all which she afterwards dissembled not, but openly
confessed what it was that did afflict her. For <hi>Herod</hi> returning beyond all
expectation, and relating to <hi>Mariamne</hi> what successes he had, she seemed
not to regard them, and at all the carasses that he made her, she would
sigh, so that <hi>Herod</hi> plainly perceived the hatred of his Wife against him,
insomuch that himself was wavering between love, and hatred towards
her.</p>
            <p>Not long after <hi>Caesar</hi> passing through <hi>Syria</hi> towards <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103996:60"/>
towards his Army, giving them plenty of all sorts of Victuals, by
which means he was counted one of <hi>Caesars</hi> chiefest Friends, and used to
ride about with him when he mustred his Army. He presented him also
and his Friends with a hundred and fifty Men, all clad in most sumptuous,
and rich apparel, yea, he suffered them to want nothing in their march
to <hi>Pelusium,</hi> through barren places, and such as wanted water, yet did he
provide plentifully for them, with which the Souldiers were much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted.
He also presented <hi>Caesar</hi> with eight hundred Talents: yea, he
gave such satisfaction to all, that they confessed that it was greater than
the Kingdom could afford.</p>

               </note> and that <hi>Caesar</hi> had won <hi>Egypt,</hi> and was coming back, whom in all

he commended <hi>Sohemus</hi> to <hi>Mariamne,</hi> professing that he owed him much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
for the care he had had of her: and gave to him also the Government
of a part of <hi>Iudea.</hi>

Father <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> so that <hi>Herod</hi> could scarce refrain from striking her,
and <hi>Salome</hi> by the noise, perceiving that <hi>Herod</hi> was much moved, she
sent in the Butler, whom long before she had suborned for that end, who
told <hi>Herod</hi> that he was solicited by <hi>Mariamne</hi> to deliver him a love potion,
which he had by him, but what it was he knew not. <hi>Herod</hi> hereupon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the most faithful servant of <hi>Mariamne</hi> by torture, being assured that
she would attempt nothing without his privity, who not enduring the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
confessed that she was offended for something that <hi>Sohemus</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
unto her, which when the King heard, he cryed out, that <hi>Sohemus</hi>
had declared unto her, which when the King heard, he cryed out, that
<hi>Sohemus,</hi> who had ever been most faithful both to him, and the Kingdom,
would never have spoken of these things, had there not been some more
secret familiarity between them than was fitting; and thereupon he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Sohemus</hi> to be apprehended and put to death; and having called his
Friends to Counsel, he accused his Wife for practising to poyson him,
which he so aggravated, that all that were present perceived that he had
a mind that she should be condemned,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mariamne</hi> condemned to death.</note> which was accordingly done by the
general consent of them all: and whereas they thought that the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should not be over speedy, but rather that she should be secured in
some of the Kings Castles, <hi>Salome</hi> exceedingly urged the King that she should
presently be put to death, for fear lest there should be some commotion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the People she being alive and in Prison: and thus was <hi>Mariamne</hi>
brought to her death.</p>

When her Mother <hi>Alexandra</hi> saw her going to execution, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

            <p>As <hi>Herod</hi> was thus tormenting himself,<note place="margin">A great Plague fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</note> there came a great Plague,
which swept away a great part both of the Nobility, and Commons, every
one judging that this Plague was sent by God for the unjust death of the

in a solitary Wilderness under a pretence of hunting;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and sickness.</note> where still afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself, he fell into a great sickness, which was accompanied with an
inflammation and great pain in his Neck, so that he began to rave; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could any applications ease him, but rather made the disease more
painful, so that those about him began to despair of his life: and his
Physicians, partly because of the stubborness of the disease, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in so great danger there was not any free election of diet, they gave him
leave to eat whatsoever he would.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> lying thus sick in <hi>Samaria,</hi>

the Governours of them to deliver them up unto her, and to the
Children of her and <hi>Mariamne,</hi> lest that <hi>Herod</hi> being dead, they should
be seized upon by others: But they who had ever been faithful to <hi>Herod,</hi>
were now much more diligent in their Office, both out of an hatred of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandra,</hi>
and because they thought it a great offence to despair of the recovery
of their Prince. Hereupon they presently sent Messengers to <hi>Herod,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with <hi>Alexandra</hi>'s attempt, who thereupon commanded her to
be slain. At length overcoming his disease, he recovered his strength both
of body and mind,<note place="margin">

that she preferred his love before her tye to her Husband: the reason which she
pretended was, that <hi>Cossaborus</hi> had practised some innovations with <hi>Lysima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,
Antipater,</hi> and <hi>Dositheus,</hi> confirming it from this, because he had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily

took out of the way all such as excelled in any dignity, that he might
do whatsoever seemed him good, there being none to resist him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> by these practises growing more secure, he began to degenerate more
and more from his Country fashions, violating them by forreign inventions.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103996:61"/>
For first he instituted Wrestlings every fifth year in the honour of <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He instituted Games to the discontent of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </note>
for the exhibiting of which, he began to build a Theatre in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
an <hi>Amphitheatre</hi> in the plain, both of them very sumptuous for the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
but clean contrary to the <hi>Iewish</hi> customs: Yea he would have this

and to remoter Nations, and by propounding greater rewards, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited,
not only those those were skilful Wrestlers, but also excellent Musicians,
and such as Played on several Instruments. Yet that which above all troubled
the <hi>Iews,</hi> were the Trophees, which being covered with Armour, they
thought to be Images, forbidden by their Law; but <hi>Herod</hi> to satisfie them,
commanded the Armour to be taken off, and shewed them that they
were meer stocks of Wood, whereupon all their anger was turned into
laughter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> having many ways provoked the <hi>Jews,</hi>

made a Conspiracy against him, amongst whom one was blind, who made
one, not because he could do any thing, but to shew how ready he was
to suffer with those that defended their Country rights: <hi>Herod</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
secret spies to discover such plots, one of which had fished this
matter out, and acquainted <hi>Herod</hi> with it, who caused them to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
and when they were brought before him, with undaunted countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they drew out their Weapons from under their Garments, protesting,
that, not out of any private respect, but in the behalf of the publick weal,
they had undertaken this conspiracy.<note place="margin">The Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators are put to Death.</note> Then were they led away, and put
to death with all manner of tortures. Not long after, their accuser being
hated of all men, was slain by some, and being cut in pieces, was thrown
to the Dogs. Yet were the authors hereof concealed, till after long, and
wearisome inquisitions, it was by torture wrung out from some silly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who were privy to it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> When <hi>Herod</hi> had thus found out the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
he punished them with death, and their whole Families.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> the better to secure himself from the seditions of the tumultuous
people,<note place="margin">He fortified <hi>Samaria,</hi> and built a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there.</note> in the thirteenth year of his Reign, began to fortifie <hi>Samaria,</hi>
which was a days journey from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and called it <hi>Sebaste</hi> (or <hi>Angusta,</hi>)
The circuit of it was twenty furlongs, in the midst whereof he built a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of a furlong and an half, which he wonderfully adorned, and so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that many of the Souldiers, and of the neighbouring Nations came and
dwelt there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> also built another Cidadel to be as a bridle to the whole Nation,
namely the Tower of <hi>Straton:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He built seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Castles.</note> Also in the great plain he built a Castle, and
chose of his Horsemen by lot, to keep it. Another he built in <hi>Galile,</hi> and
one in <hi>Peraea:</hi> which Castles being so conveniently disposed in several
parts of the Country, took away from the people all opportunity of
rebellion.</p>
            <p>About this time very grievous calamities befel the Nation of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plague, and Famine.</note>
First there was a long Drought, after which followed a Famine: After the
Famine, by reason of their ill diet, there came divers Sicknesses, and the
Plague; and <hi>Herod,</hi> having not wherewithal to supply the publick wants,
was forced to melt the Gold and Silver that was in his Pallace,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> care to provide for the People.</note> not sparing
any thing for the curiosity of the Workmanship: no not so much as the
Vessels which were for his own daily use. These being turned into money,
he sent to buy provisions into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where <hi>Petronius</hi> was Governour under
<hi>Caesar,</hi> who though he was pestered with multitudes that repaired to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the like necessity, yet being <hi>Herods</hi> Friend, he gave his Servants leave
to export Corn, and was assisting to them, both in the buying, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of it.</p>
            <p>When the Corn was brought to <hi>Herod,</hi> he was very careful to see it
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103996:61"/>
divided, first to such as had most need, and then because there were many
who by reason of old age, or some other weakness, were unable to dress it
themselves, he appointed them certain Bakers to provide their food for them:
By this means he procured the good will of the people, and the praise of a
prudent and provident Prince.</p>
            <p>He provided also for his Subjects against the sharpness of the Winter,
taking care that none should want clothing, their Cattel being dead,
and Wool, and other materials failing. And when he had made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for his own People,<note place="margin">His bounty to strangers.</note> he took care also for the neighbouring Cities
of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> to whom he allowed Seed for sowing of their ground:
and the Castles, and Cities; and those of the common People, who
had great Families, coming to him for succour, he found a remedy
for them also: Insomuch that he gave to those that were not his
Subjects ten thousand Cores of Corn, each Core containing ten <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
bushels.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Corn was ripe for harvest, <hi>Herod</hi> dismissed fifty thousand
Men, whom he had fed in the time of Famine, into their own Countries:
by which diligence he restored the almost ruined estate of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and did not a little relieve his Neighbours, who groaned under the
same calamities.</p>
            <p>At the same time also he sent aid to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He sends aid to <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               </note> to wit, five hundred chosen Men
of his own Guard, whom <hi>Aelius Gallus</hi> led into the <hi>Arabian</hi> Wars, where
they did most excellent service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> also built himself a Pallace in <hi>Sidon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He built him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Pallace.</note> in which he built two very large
and stately Houses, with which the Temple it self could in no wise compare,
and called one of them by the name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the other by the name
of <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> having removed from the Priesthood <hi>Jesus</hi> the Son of <hi>Phales,</hi>

<hi>Simon</hi> (a Priest of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> the Son of <hi>Boethus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>) Priest in his
room, and took also his Daughter <hi>Mariamne</hi> to Wife, that was the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Virgin of that age.</p>
            <p>The marriage solemnities being over,<note place="margin">He built ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pallace.</note> he began to build another new Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
unto which he adjoyned a Town, which he called <hi>Herodian,</hi> in a place
distant from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> about sixty furlongs towards <hi>Arabia,</hi> in the place where
he had overcome the <hi>Jews</hi> when he was thrust out by the Arms of <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He built also <hi>Sebaste,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And <hi>Sebaste,</hi> and a stately Haven.</note> and having finished that, he began to build another
most magnificent City in a place by the Sea-side, where <hi>Straton</hi> stood, which
he called <hi>Caesaria,</hi> and added to it an Haven of admirable work, equal in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Haven <hi>Piraetus:</hi> all which he finished in twelve years space, sparing
neither labour nor cost about them.</p>
            <p>Then did he send his two Sons,<note place="margin">He sent his Sons to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </note>

for whom Lodgings were prepared at the House of <hi>Pollio, Herods</hi> great Friend.
<hi>Caesar</hi> intertained the young men very courteously, and gave <hi>Herod</hi> power to

                  <hi>Caesar</hi> enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> he added also to
his Government <hi>Trachonitis, Batunaea,</hi> and <hi>Auranitis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Herod</hi> had received <hi>Trachonitis,</hi> he took guides, and went to the
Den of the Thieves,<note place="margin">He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the Thieves.</note> restraining their Villanies, whereby the people lived in
quiet: But <hi>Zenodorus,</hi> the former Governour, being moved, partly thorough
envy, and partly with the loss of his Government, went to <hi>Rome,</hi> to accuse
<hi>Herod,</hi> but could effect nothing.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Herod</hi> went to <hi>Mytelene,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He went to <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
               </note> to salute his chiefest Friend
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> and so returned into <hi>Judaea:</hi> and presently after some Citizens of
<hi>Gadara</hi> went to <hi>Agrippa</hi> to accuse <hi>Herod,</hi> whom he vouchsafed not so much as
to hear, but sent them bound to <hi>Herod:</hi> Yet did he spare them: for though
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103996:62"/>
he was inexorable towards his own People, yet did he willingly contemn,
and forgive injuries received from strangers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zenodorus</hi> had solemnly sworn to the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> that he would do his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
with <hi>Caesar</hi> to get them freed from the jurisdiction of <hi>Herod,</hi> and to be
annexed to the Province of <hi>Caesar:</hi> Many of themselves also exclaimed against

and rapines, and for rasing, and robbing their Temple: Yet was <hi>Herod</hi>
nothing herewith terrified, being ready to answer for himself: But <hi>Caesar</hi>
used him curteously, and was nothing alienated from him for all these
tumultuous complaints: The <hi>Gadarens</hi> therefore perceiving the inclination
of <hi>Caesar</hi> and his Friends towards <hi>Herod,</hi> despairing of good success, and
fearing to be delivered into <hi>Herods</hi> hands, some of them cut their
own Throats, others fearing torments brake their own Necks, or drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
themselves in the River, and thus, seeming to forejudg themselves,
<hi>Caesar</hi> absolved <hi>Herod</hi> from all their accusations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zenodorus</hi> also having his bowels burst, through much blood that came
from him, ended his life at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria;</hi> whereupon <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>
gave his Tetrarchy to <hi>Herod:</hi> he made him also one of the Governours of

                  <hi>Caesar</hi> still en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</note> commanding the rest of the Governours of that Province, to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> bestowed upon his Brother <hi>Pheroras</hi> a hundred Talents out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues

            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> coming into the East, having setled his affairs there, <hi>Herod</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted

He also remitted to his Subjects some part of their Tribute, under
pretence that he would ease them after the great dearth, but indeed to
appease the minds of his Subjects, who were offended at his vast works,
which seemed to tend to the destruction of Religion and good manners,
as was commonly talked. As also to prevent these reports, he forbad all
private meetings in the City,<note place="margin">His jealousies.</note> and to frequent Feastings: He had spies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
who would mingle themselves in all Companies, and mark what Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
said: yea himself would go about in the Night in the habit of a
private Person, and mingle himself in the company of People to hear
what they thought of him: and such as peremptorily disliked his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he would punish without all mercy: the rest of the multitude he
bound to him by Oath, requiring that they should not depart from their
fidelity, and duty: Yea he required this Oath of many of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
as of <hi>Pollio,</hi> and <hi>Sameas,</hi> &amp;c. which though he could not get them to
take, yet did he not punish them as he did others, in regard of that
respect that he bore to <hi>Pollio:</hi> Neither did he impose it upon the <hi>Esseans,</hi>
whom he much esteemed for one <hi>Manaherus</hi> sake, who was a Prophet, and
when <hi>Herod</hi> was but a Boy, he saluted him King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and foretold
that he should Reign above thirty years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> in the eighteenth year of his Reign, propounded to the <hi>Jews</hi>
his building the Temple at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He rebuilt the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </note> whom when he saw troubled least,
when he had pulled down the old, he should not be able to finish a
new one, he told them, that the old Temple should remain whole as
it was, till all the materials necessary for the new Fabrick, should be
fully prepared: neither did he deceive them for he provided a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Wagons to carry stones, and he chose out of all the Artificers ten
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103996:62"/>
thousand that were the most exquisite Work-men, and a thousand
Priests, clothed in their Priestly Garments at his cost, who were not
altogether ignorant of the Masons, and Carpenters Art, to oversee
them.</p>
            <p>All necessary materials for this stately work being provided in the space
of two years, <hi>Herod</hi> began to build the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> forty six
years before the first Passover of the Ministry of Christ and therefore that
Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 20. should be thus translated, <hi>This Temple hath been built
forty six years</hi> hitherto: So the learned Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man
<hi>Lydiat,</hi> read it.</p>
            <p>Indeed the building of the Temple under <hi>Zorobabel</hi> began in the first year
of the Monarchy of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and after some interruptions, was finished in
twenty years space, <hi>viz.</hi> in the sixth year of <hi>Darius Hystaspes:</hi> but the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
building of it,<note place="margin">Nine years it was in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> begun by <hi>Herod</hi> at this time was finished in nine years
space and an half: and truly the riches of <hi>Herod</hi> alone, were not sufficient to
perfect so magnificent a structure, but all the holy treasures of many ages,
that were sent to them from all the parts of the World to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> were
spent about it.</p>
            <p>Not long after <hi>Herod</hi> set sail for <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> to salute <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to see his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

but Judg of the <hi>Olympick</hi> exercises, where, observing that they did not
answer the resort that was to them, through the poverty of the <hi>Elienses,</hi>
he bestowed towards them a yearly revenew, that so their Sacrifices might
be made the more splendid, as also other things that tended to the gracing of
so great a meeting:<note place="margin">His bounty.</note> For which bounty he was declared perpetual Judg of
those exercises.</p>
            <p>When he came to <hi>Rome, Caesar</hi> intertained him courteously, and delivered
to him his Sons sufficiently instructed in the Liberal Sciences, and so from
thence he went into <hi>Galatia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by the diligence of the Priests, the building of the Temple
properly so called, that contained the Holy, and the Holy of Holies, was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in a year and a half; during which time, it is reported that it never
rained in the day time, but only in the Nights: and in the eight years fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
the Porches, the Ranges, and the rest of the buildings about the
Temple were all finished.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus</hi> were returned into <hi>Judea,</hi> and had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all mens love, <hi>Salome</hi> the Sister of <hi>Herod,</hi> and her Faction, fearing that at
some time or other they would revenge their Mothers death, cast out a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
amongst the people, that they hated their Father, because he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their Mother to be slain: But <hi>Herod</hi> as yet suspecting no ill, used them
with all Honour, as they deserved: and because they were now grown to
mens estate,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> Sons married.</note> he provided them Wives: for <hi>Alexander, Bernice,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>Then <hi>Herod</hi> hearing that <hi>Agrippa</hi> was again come into <hi>Asia,</hi> he went to
him, and begged of him that he would come into his Kingdom as to his

               </note> and Guest; and as he came, he entertained him in all the Cities
that he had newly built, shewing him the publick buildings, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting,
both to himself and friends all kind of delights which might set
forth his magnificence, at <hi>Sebaste,</hi> and the Port of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
of <hi>Alexandrion, Herodion,</hi> and <hi>Hyrcania.</hi> He brought him also into the
City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where all the People met him in their best, and Festival
attire, and with acclamations of joy: <hi>Agrippa</hi> also sacrificed an <hi>Hecatombe</hi>
to God, and feasted the People; and though he would willingly have
stayed longer there, yet, fearing storms, the Winter no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on, he hasted to sail into <hi>Jonia,</hi> both he and his Friends having been honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with great presents by <hi>Herod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As soon as the Spring came, <hi>Herod</hi> hearing that <hi>Agrippa</hi> was going with
an Army to <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> made hast to meet him, and taking his way by <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
and <hi>Chios,</hi> he came to <hi>Lesbos,</hi> thinking there to find him: But <hi>Agrippa</hi>
being driven back by contrary North-winds <hi>Herod</hi> stayed at <hi>Chios,</hi> to
whom many came privately to salute him, upon whom he bestowed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
princely gifts,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> great bounty.</note> and when he perceived that the Gate of the City that
was thrown down in the War against <hi>Methridates,</hi> as yet lay buryed in
its ruins, and that by reason of the poverty of the Inhabitants, it could
not by them be restored to its former beauty and greatness, he bestowed
upon them so much mony as would abundantly suffice to finish it, and
exhorted them to hasten the restoring of their City to its former beauty,
and grandure.</p>
            <p>As soon, as the wind served, he left <hi>Chios,</hi> and sailed to <hi>Mytilene,</hi> and
from thence to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> and there understanding that <hi>Agrippa</hi> had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
passed the <hi>Cyanian</hi> Rock, he followed him with all speed, and overtook
him at <hi>Sinopi,</hi> a City in <hi>Pontus,</hi> where, beyond <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s expectation, he
arrived with his Navy: His coming was yery grateful to him, and they
embraced each other with singular affection,<note place="margin">His love to <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> looking upon it as
an evident argument of his fidelity and friendship, that leaving his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
occasions, he would come to him in so seasonable a time. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Herod</hi> still abode with him in the Army, was Companion with him
in his labours, and partaker of his counsels: He was also present with him
when he went to be merry, and was the only man that he used in difficult
matters, for the love that he bore unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> having forced the <hi>Bosphorans</hi> to lay down their Arms, in his whole
journey thorough many Countries and Cities, he gratified <hi>Herod</hi> in many
things,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s love to him.</note> and at his intreaty, relieved the necessities of many: If any one
needed an Intercessor to <hi>Agrippa, Herod</hi> was the only man, by whom he
could obtain his suit, and assisted many in whatsoever they had need
of.</p>
            <p>When they were come into <hi>Jonia,</hi> a great multitude of <hi>Iews</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
that Country, complained of the great injuries that they suffered
from the <hi>Jonians,</hi> who would not permit them to live after their own
Laws, but that upon their Festival days, they haled them before their
Tribunals, and forbad them to send holy money to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which also
they perverted to secular affairs, contrary to the priviledges granted them
by the <hi>Romans:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> 
               <hi>Herod</hi> took care that <hi>Agrippa</hi> should hear their complaints,
and allowed them <hi>Nicholas Damascene,</hi> one of his Friends, to plead their
cause, which when he had largely performed before <hi>Agrippa</hi> (many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<hi>Romans,</hi> and some Kings and Princes being present) the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
denyed the thing, excusing themselves that the <hi>Iews</hi> were troublesom
to them: But they on the contrary proved that they were free-born Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
and that they lived according to their own Laws without injuring
of any; wherefore <hi>Agrippa</hi> answered that both for his Friend <hi>Herod</hi>'s sake, as
also because that which they demanded was just, he would gratifie them
therein: He ordered therefore that the priviledges which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
granted them, should remain inviolable, and that none should mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
them for living after their Country Laws. Then <hi>Herod</hi> rose up,
and gave him thanks in the name of them all: and so after mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
embraces, they took their leave each of other, and departed from
<hi>Lesbos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> in a few days after, having a prosperous Gale, arrived at <hi>Caesarea,</hi>
and from thence went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where, calling all the People together,

he professed that he would remit to them the fourth part of his Tribute; with

of the Kingdom into his Son <hi>Antipater,</hi> whom he begat when he was a private

            <p>

sailed with them to <hi>Rome</hi> to accuse them before <hi>Augustus,</hi> and not finding him
there, he followed him as far as <hi>Aquileia,</hi> before whom he accused them of
treachery against him; but the young men satisfied all that were present by
their Apology for themselves mixed with prayers and tears, so that they were
reconciled to their Father: After which, giving thanks unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together, and with them <hi>Antipater</hi> also, who pretended much joy that
they were received into favour again.</p>
            <p>A few days after <hi>Herod</hi> gave <hi>Caesar</hi> three hundred Talents,<note place="margin">

gave him half the revenues of the mettal Mines in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and the other half

               <hi>Herod</hi> being returned into <hi>Iudea,</hi> called the people together, and told them

who being above forty years old, was healed, by <hi>Peter,</hi> at the Beautiful Gate of

            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> having finished <hi>Caesarea Stratonis,</hi> in the twenty eighth year of his
Reign, he dedicated it with great solemnity, and many sports and pastimes:
After which,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> great bnildings.</note> he began to build another Town in a field called <hi>Capharsala,</hi>
which he called <hi>Antipatris,</hi> after his Fathers name; and a Castle also, which
he called <hi>Cyprus,</hi> after his Mothers name. In honour also of his dead Brother,
he built in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a very fair Tower, not inferiour to the <hi>Egyptian Pharos,</hi>
and called it <hi>Phasaelus:</hi> and afterwards he built a Town of the same name in
the Valley of <hi>Iericho,</hi> from whence the Countrey thereabouts is called <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod,</hi> having wasted his wealth by his great Prodigality, and now wanting
mony, after the example of <hi>John Hyrcanus,</hi> in the night, without the knowledg

Hereupon <hi>Herod</hi> commended his Steward <hi>Ptolomy</hi> unto <hi>Antipater,</hi> and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
all his Counsels with his Mother <hi>Doris,</hi> so that all things were done as
they pleased, and still the King was imbittered against those, whom it was
their profit that he should be angry with.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Pheroras (Herods</hi> Brother) fell so madly in love with his

who by their incursions had often wasted his Country. They, when
they heard hereof, being increased to the number of a thousand, began to
waste both Fields and Villages, cutting the throats of all that fell into
their hands; wherefore <hi>Herod</hi> demanded those Thieves to be delivered over
to him, and withall, required the sixty Talents that he had lent <hi>Obodas,</hi>
upon <hi>Syllaeus</hi> his security, who had thrust <hi>Obodas</hi> from the Government, and
now ruled all himself: But <hi>Syllaeus</hi> denied that the Thieves were in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi>

                  <hi>Herod</hi> falls out with his Sons, and imprisons them.</note> But in the mean time the discord with his Sons
that he had by <hi>Mariamne,</hi> was greatly heightned by the artifices of <hi>Eurichus</hi>
a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> which occasioned <hi>Herod,</hi> to find out their supposed Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to put to death by various torments, many both of his own, and of his
Sons Friends, yet could he find no other evil by them; but some too free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of improvident young men, concerning their Fathers immoderate cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
and his too easie hearkning to base pick-thanks, of the wicked deceits of
their Brother <hi>Antipater,</hi> and of the faction that was combined against them,
and that, to free themselves from these mischiefs, they were said to think of
flying to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which thing indeed they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
Hereupon <hi>Herod</hi> cast them into Prison, as if they had been convicted
of Treason against their Father, resolving to punish them according as
his affairs went at <hi>Rome:</hi> and concerning this business he sent Letters to
<hi>Caesar</hi> by <hi>Volumnius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General, and <hi>Olympius,</hi> his Friend.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rome, Nicholas Damascene</hi> joyned himself to the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that came to
accuse <hi>Syllaeus,</hi> professing that he was his accuser also before <hi>Augustus,</hi> and not
<hi>Herods</hi> defender, and this he did, lest he should be repulsed as others had been
before him. When by this means he had gotten access into <hi>Caesars</hi> presence,
he indeed laid open many of <hi>Syllaeus</hi> his crimes, and withall added, that <hi>Caesar</hi>
was circumvented with his lyes in the cause of <hi>Herod,</hi> which he confirmed
by certain authentick records: This so prevailed with <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<hi>Syllaeus,</hi> and remanded him into the Province, that when he had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
the debt he might be punished.</p>
            <p>From this time <hi>Augustus</hi> was reconciled to <hi>Aretas,</hi>

            <p>About this time the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> (who long before had foretold to <hi>Daniel</hi>

               <hi>Herod</hi> having received <hi>Augustus</hi> his Letters, rejoyced exceedingly, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was returned into his favour, and for that he had granted him power
to do what he would with his Sons, and hereupon he convened by messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

that they were to be punished with death, whose opinion the <hi>major</hi>

to her Father <hi>Archelaus</hi> the King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and gave her a Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>At this time, two of <hi>Pheroras</hi>'s freed men declared to <hi>Herod,</hi> how he was
killed by poyson, given him by <hi>Doris,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Antipater,</hi> which, whilst
<hi>Herod</hi> enquired into, by little and little he found out greater Villanies, and

                  <hi>Antipaters'</hi> Treason.</note> who, when he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> had

that so the suspition of the Parricide should not lye upon him, being so
far absent.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, <hi>Herod</hi> put <hi>Doris</hi> out of the Palace, and took from her Jewels
that were worth many Talents: He also put from him his Wife <hi>Mariamne,</hi>
the Daughter of the High Priest, as a Partner of all these secrets, and blotted
her Son out of his <hi>Will,</hi> and deprived her Father of the High Priesthood, and
substituted in his room <hi>Matthias,</hi> the Son of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that was born at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Presently after came <hi>Bathillus, Antipaters</hi> freed man, from <hi>Rome,</hi> who being
tortured, confessed, that formerly he had brought poyson, and given it to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
and <hi>Pheroras,</hi> that if the first proved too weak, they should be sure to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
<hi>Herod</hi> with the second. There came also Letters from his Friends at
<hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antipaters</hi> Craft.</note> to the King, written by the entreaty of <hi>Antipater,</hi> in which <hi>Archelaus</hi>

<hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> pitying the misfortune of their murthered Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
For these young men were studying at <hi>Rome,</hi> and their Father had now
commanded their return: whereupon <hi>Antipater</hi> by great gifts corrupted those
Friends, that by their Letters they might make the young men suspected to
their Father, who, if they lived, might be an hindrance to his hopes.</p>
            <p>About this time,<note place="margin">Christ is born.</note>

            <p>Shortly after, there came Wise men from the East, the Star being their

            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> receiving Letters from <hi>Antipater</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> in which he signified,

he promised that he would remit all differences at his return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antipater</hi> heard uo news all this while either of the death of <hi>Pheroras,</hi> or of

journey, at <hi>Tarentum</hi> he met with a Letter of the death of <hi>Pheroras,</hi> and in <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi>
those Letters of his Father that called him back so hastily; and when
he came to <hi>Celenderis,</hi> a Town of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> he began to doubt of his return,
hearing of, and being extream sorrowful for the disgrace of his Mother, yet
failing forwards, he came to <hi>Sebaste,</hi> a Port of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> where, being saluted by
none, he went to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It happened that <hi>Quintilius Varus</hi> was the same time at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> being sent

that he used to wear, entring the Palace; but himself being entred, the
Guards suffered none of his followers to come in with him: As he was coming
near, his Father thrust him from him, reproaching him with the murther of
his Brethren, and his intention of poysoning his Father, telling him that the

himself first began the accusation, and left the prosecution and confirmation

and when <hi>Antipater</hi> could not clear himself from the crimes objected against
him, <hi>Varus</hi> commanded the poyson that he had prepared for his Father to be

after which, <hi>Varus</hi> rose from the Council, and the next day went to

not to be a stranger to that fact, and made his Successor <hi>Jazer,</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Wife <hi>Mariamne,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Simon</hi> the High Priest; but he
burned alive the other <hi>Matthias,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Herods</hi> disease began now to grow worse:<note place="margin">His sickness encreaseth.</note> for he was burned with a slow
fire, which was not perceived so much by the outward touch, as by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
effects of it, which burnt up his very Bowels: He had also the disease cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Bulemia,</hi> or Dog-like appetite, which provoked him to a continual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of eating, and yet nothing would satisfie him: He was also continually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
with ulcers in his Bowels, and pains of the Cholick: His feet swelled
with a moist phlegm, and his thighs also: His members rotted, and were full
of worms, which occasioned an intolerable stink: He was no less troubled with
a <hi>Priapisme:</hi> and moreover was vexed with grievous convulsions, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of breathing.</p>
            <p>And though he was so grievously tormented,<note place="margin">All means of cure fall him.</note> that every one judged that he
could not be able to endure it long, yet he hoped that he should break through
it, being very careful to send for the ablest <hi>Physicians,</hi> and sought medicines
from every place: He went also beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> to the Hot Baths at <hi>Callirhoe,</hi>
which run into the <hi>Asphaltite</hi> Lake, which, beside the medicinal virtue, are
pleasant, and good to be drunk: There being, by the advice of his <hi>Physicians,</hi>
set into a Bathing tub of oyl, he seemed to them to be giving up the Ghost, yet
by the sudden crying out, and lamentations of his Friends, he came to himself
again, and now seeing no hope of recovery, he commanded fifty <hi>Drachmaes</hi> to
be given to every Souldier, and having shewed much liberality to his Captains
and Friends, he returned again to <hi>Iericho.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> being told, that amongst the Children which <hi>Herod</hi> had caused to
be slain at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> there was a Son also of his own slain, He said, <hi>That it was
better to be</hi> Herods <hi>Hog than his Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> an Edict called together to <hi>Iericho</hi> all the most Noble of the <hi>Iews,</hi>
and when they came, he shut them all up together in a place called the <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podrome,</hi>
giving command to his Sister <hi>Salome,</hi> and her Husband <hi>Alexus,</hi> that
as soon as He was dead,<note place="margin">His cruelty.</note> they should cause his Souldiers to slay them all, that so
the people might have cause of sorrow, who otherwise (he feared) would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
at his death.</p>
            <p>At this time Letters came from <hi>Rome,</hi> from the Ambassadours whom He
had sent to <hi>Caesar,</hi> wherein they certified him, that the Emperour left <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to his Fathers pleasure, either to banish, or to put him to death. <hi>Herod</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, was a little cheared: but presently his torments returning, and being
greedy of meat,<note place="margin">He attempts to murther himself.</note> He called for an apple, and a knife to pare it, intending with
the knife to have stabbed himself, which also he attempted: but <hi>Archelaus,</hi>
his Nephew, prevented him, and holding his right Hand, called for help. This
accident caused much sorrow, fear, and tumult through the whole Palace, as
if <hi>Herod</hi> had been dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antipater</hi> perceiving the noise, thought verily that his Father was dead,
and thereupon began to tamper with his Keeper about letting him out, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
him great Rewards, both for the present, and for the future, when it
would lye in his power amply to reward him: This his practice the Keeper
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103996:67"/>
told to the King, who, for indignation cryed, and though he was so near death
yet did he raise up himself on his Bed, and commanded one of his Guard to go
presently and kill <hi>Antipater,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antipater</hi> slain.</note> and to bury him in the Castle of <hi>Hyrcanion,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any honour, which was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>Then did He make a new Testament: for <hi>Antipas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Herods</hi> Will.</note> whom before he had
made Successor to his Kingdom, he made <hi>Tetrarch</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Petrea:</hi> To
his Son <hi>Philip</hi> he assigned the Regions of <hi>Gaulanitis, Trachonitis, Batanaea</hi> and
<hi>Pancada,</hi> the name of a Tetrarchy, but he gave the Kingdom to his Son <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus:</hi>
To his sister <hi>Salome</hi> he gave <hi>Jamnia, Azotus,</hi> and <hi>Thasaelis,</hi> with five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand <hi>Drachmaes:</hi> To the rest of his Kindred he gave money and year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Plate, as well of Gold as of Silver, and a great quantity of precious moveables:
and to <hi>Livia, Caesars</hi> Wife, and some certain Friends, he gave five Millions of
<hi>Drachmaes.</hi>

            <p>Having thus ordered these things,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> five dayes after <hi>Antipater</hi> was put to
death, he dyed himself, having enjoyed the Kingdom 34 years after the death

LIFE and DEATH
OF
HANNIBAL
THE
GREAT,</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ANNIBAL,</hi> the Son of <hi>Amilcar</hi> was about twenty
six years old,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen General.</note> when he was chosen General of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi>
Forces in <hi>Spain.</hi> He was elected by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
as soon as <hi>Asdrabal</hi> (their late General) was dead,
and the election was approved, and confirmed by the
Senate or <hi>Carthage,</hi> wherewith <hi>Hanno,</hi> and his faction was
nothing pleased. This was now the third of the <hi>Barchine</hi>
Family (so called of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> whose surname was <hi>Barcas</hi>)
that commanded in chief over the men of War. <hi>Hanno</hi> therefore and
his Partizans, being neither able to tax the Virtue of their enemies, nor
to perform the like services to the Common-wealth, had nothing left
whereby to value themselves, excepting the general reprehensions of War,
and cautelous advise of not provoking the <hi>Romans:</hi> but they were little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.
For the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> saw apparently, that the Oath of the <hi>Romans</hi> to
the Articles of Peace, was like to hold no longer, than till the <hi>Romans</hi>
could find some good advantage to renew the War. It was therefore rather
desired by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> that whilst they were in a fit condition, the
War should begin, rather than in some unhappy time of Famine or Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or after some great loss in their Army or Fleet, they should
be driven to yield to the impudent demands of their insulting ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>This disposition of his Citizens <hi>Hannibal</hi> well enough understood. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was he ignorant that in making War with the <hi>Romans</hi> it was no small
advantage to get the start of them. Could he but bring his Army into
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103996:68"/>
               <hi>Italy,</hi> he hoped to find Friends and assistance, even from those People,
that helped to encrease the Armies of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But his design must be
carried privately, or else it would be prevented. He resolved therefore to
lay Siege to <hi>Saguntum</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he now was with his Army, which
might seem not greatly to concern the <hi>Romans,</hi> and would highly please the
<hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having resolved hereupon, nevertheless he went orderly to work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with those that lay next in his way. First therefore he entered
into the Territory of the <hi>Olcades,</hi> and besieging <hi>Althaea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He besieges, and takes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towns.</note> in a few days he
became Master, not only of it, but of all the other Towns in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and the Winter coming on, he rest his Army in <hi>New Carthage,</hi> or <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena,</hi>
imparting liberally to his Souldiers of the Spoils that he had gotten
in his late Conquests.</p>
            <p>In the Spring he made War upon the <hi>Vaccaei,</hi> and with little difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
wan, first <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and after it <hi>Arbucala,</hi> though not without a long
Siege and much difficulty: But in his return he was put to the height both
of his Valour,<note place="margin">His Valour, and Policy.</note> and Prudence. For all such of the <hi>Vaccaei</hi> that could bear
Arms, being made desperate by the spoil of their Country, with divers
others that had escaped in the late overthrow, joyning with the <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
made up an Army of one hundred thousand able men, waiting for
<hi>Hannibal</hi> on the Banks of the River <hi>Tagus.</hi> They knew that he was very
adventurous, and had never turned his back upon any enemy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hoped, that having him at such an advantage, they should easily have
foiled him. But at this time our Great Man of War, knew as well how
to dissemble his Courage, as at other times to make good use of it. For he
withdrew himself from the River side, as seeming fearful to pass over it,
aiming thereby to draw over that great multitude from their Banks of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as <hi>Hannibal</hi> expected and desired, thinking that
he retreated out of fear, thrust themselves in a disordered manner into the
River, to pursue him. But when <hi>Hannibal</hi> saw them well near over, he
turned back his Elephants to entertain them at their landing, and thrust
his Horsemen, both above and beneath them into the River, who by the
advantage of their Weapons slew almost all of those in the River without
resistance,<note place="margin">His Victory.</note> and then pursued the rest, who being amazed, fled, and so he made
a very great slaughter of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Saguntines</hi> perceiving the strom drawing near to them, hastened
their Ambassadours to <hi>Rome,</hi> who complained that they were like to be
undone, only for their Friendship to the <hi>Romans.</hi> This so moved the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
that some would have War presently proclaimed, both by Sea, and
Land, and the Consuls sent with Armies, one into <hi>Spain,</hi> the other into
<hi>Africk:</hi> But others went more soberly to work (according to the <hi>Roman</hi>
gravity) whereby it was concluded, that Ambassadours should be sent into
<hi>Spain,</hi> to view the State of their Confederates.</p>
            <p>These Ambassadours found <hi>Hannibal</hi> at <hi>Carthagena,</hi> where they had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with him, who carried himself so reservedly, that they departed,
as doubtful as they came. But whilst they were passing to and fro,
<hi>Hannibal</hi> prepared, not only his Forces, but some <hi>Roman</hi> pretences against
<hi>Saguntum.</hi> For the <hi>Tudetani,</hi> who were Neighbours to the <hi>Saguntines,</hi>
complained to him of sundry wrongs that they had received from them
of <hi>Saguntum:</hi> Probably <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself had hatched some of them. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therefore such an occasion, he sat down with his whole Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Saguntum.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He besieges <hi>Saguntum.</hi>
               </note> The <hi>Romans</hi> were glad of the Quarrel, as hoping that
<hi>Carthage,</hi> with all belonging thereto, would in short space become their
own. Yet were they not hasty to threaten before they were ready to
strike; but meant to temporize until they had an Army in readiness to be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103996:69"/>
sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> where they intended to make <hi>Saguntum,</hi> the seat of
War.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Siege, his <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by reason of the brave Sallies which the <hi>Saguntines</hi> made upon
them, in one of which <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself received a dangerus wound in the
Thigh that made him unable to stir for many days. Yet in the mean
time he was not unmindful of his business, but gave order to build cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
movable Towers that might equal those upon the City Walls, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to batter the Curtains, and to make a breach. These being sinished and
applied, had soon wrought their desired effect. A large breach was made by
the fall of some Towers, whereat a hot assault was given: But it was so gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
defended by the besieged, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were not only bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from the breach, and out of some ground within the City, which in
the first fury they had wan, but they were pursued even to their own
Trenches and Camp. Yet at length the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army (wherein were
one hundred and fifty thousand men) did so tire out the Townsmen
by their continual Allarms, that at length it gat into the Town, and had
been Masters of it, but that they were hindred by some Counter-works which
the besieged had raised.</p>
            <p>In this extremity there was one <hi>Alcon,</hi> that came out of the City to treat
with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who would give no other terms but these hard ones, That
they should deliver up to him all the Gold, Silver, and Plate, and other
Riches which they had in the City; That the Citizens should leave the
City, and take up such other habitations as he should appoint them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should they carry any more out with them, save the cloaths on their
back. These terms seemed so unreasonable to <hi>Alcon,</hi> that he durst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into the City to propound them to the Citizens. Yet might they
far better have submitted thereto, how hard soever, because thereby they
might have saved their lives,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Saguntum</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> and the honour of their Wives and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whereas, the City being shortly after taken by storm, they saw their
Wives and Daughters defloured before their Faces, and all put to the Sword
that were above fourteen years of age. The Treasures found in <hi>Saguntum,</hi>
which were very great, <hi>Hannibal</hi> reserved, therewith to pay his Army. The
Slaves, and other booty, he divided amongst his Souldiers, reserving some
choise things, wherewith to present his Friends at <hi>Carthage,</hi> to encourage
them to the War.</p>
            <p>This news exceedingly vexed the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors sent to <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </note> being angry at their own slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to send help to <hi>Saguntum,</hi> which held out eight Months, looking still
for succour but in vain. Then did the <hi>Romans</hi> send Ambassadors to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
to demand whether this act were done by their done by their consents, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were <hi>Hannibals</hi> presumption alone? If they granted the former,
they were to give them defiance. Answer was made them in the Senate
of <hi>Carthage</hi> by one of the Senators, to this effect. That by this Message
the Commonwealth of <hi>Carthage,</hi> was urged to plead Guilty, or nor <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
That it belonged to them to call their own Commanders in question,<note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> answer.</note>
and to punish them according to their Faults; but to the <hi>Romans</hi> to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
them if they had done any thing contrary to their late League and
Covenant. <hi>Its true</hi> (said this Speaker) <hi>that in our negotiations with</hi> Lucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
<hi>your Ambassador, the Allies of both Nations were comprehended, but the</hi>
Sanguntines <hi>were not then your Allies, and therefore no parties to the Peace
then made: For of your Allies for the future, or of ours, there was no question:
As for the last agreement between you and</hi> Asdrubal, <hi>wherein you will say that the</hi>
Saguntines <hi>were comprehended, its you that have taught us how to answer that
particular. For whatsoever you found in the Treaty between us and</hi> Luctatius, <hi>to your
disadvantage, you said it was his presumption, as promising those things for which he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103996:69"/>
had not Commission from your Senate: If then it be lawful for you to disavow
the Actions of your Ambassadors and Commanders, concluding any thing without
precise Warrant from you; the same liberty may we also assume, and hold our
selves no way bound in honour to perform the contract that</hi> Asdrubal <hi>made for us,
without our Command, and Consent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In conclusion, the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Senate moved the <hi>Romane</hi> Ambassadors to
tell them plainly the purposes of those that sent them? whereupon <hi>Q. Fabius,</hi>
gathering up the skirt of his Gown, as if something had been in the hallow
thereof, made this short reply, <hi>I have here in my Gown-skirt both Peace and War;
Make you (my Masters of the Senate) election which you will have.</hi> All answered,
even which of them you have a fancy to offer us.<note place="margin">War denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note> Then (quoth <hi>Fabius) take War,
and share it amongst you.</hi> Which all the Assembly willingly accepted.</p>
            <p>War being thus proclaimed, <hi>Hannibal</hi> resolved not to put up his Sword
which he had drawn against the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> till he had therewith opened
his passage to the Gates of <hi>Rome.</hi> So began the second <hi>Punick</hi> War; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
second to none that ever the People of <hi>Rome</hi> met with. <hi>Hannibal</hi>
wintered at <hi>Carthagena,</hi> giving license to his <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldiers to visit their
Friends, and refresh themselves against the Spring. In the mean while he
gave Instructions to his Brother <hi>Asdrubal</hi> for the Government of <hi>Spain</hi> in
his absence.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> He also took order to send many Troops of <hi>Spaniards</hi> into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi>
to supply the rooms of those <hi>Africans</hi> which he had drawn into <hi>Spain,</hi>
as also that the one Nation might remain as Pledges for the other. He
selected also four thousand Foot, all young Men, and Persons of Quallity,
out of the best Cities of <hi>Spain,</hi> which were to be Garrisoned in <hi>Carthage</hi>
it self, not so much to strengthen it, as that they might serve for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages.
He also left with his Brother, to guard the Coasts, and Ports, fifty
seven Gallies, whereof thirty seven were ready Armed. Of <hi>Africans</hi>
and other Nations, Strangers, he left with him above twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and two thousand Horse, besides one and twenty Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</p>
            <p>Having thus taken order for the defence of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> he sent
some to discover the Passages of the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains that part <hi>Spain</hi>
from <hi>France;</hi> and of the <hi>Alps,</hi> that part <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Italy.</hi> He sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to the Inhabitants of the <hi>Pyrenes,</hi> and to the <hi>Gauls</hi> to obtain a quiet
passage, that he might bring his Army intire into <hi>Italy.</hi> These being returned
with good satisfaction: In the beginning of the Spring he passed over the
River of <hi>Iberus</hi> with an Army of ninety thousand Foot, and twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse.</p>
            <p>All those parts of <hi>Spain</hi> which had not before been entered,<note place="margin">He Conquers much of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> he now subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and appointed one <hi>Hanno</hi> to Govern <hi>Spain</hi> on the east side of <hi>Iberus,</hi> with
whom he left ten thousand Foot, and one thousand Horse. When he
came to the borders of <hi>Spain,</hi> some of his <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldiers returned home
without asking leave; which, that others also might not attempt, he
courteously dismissed such as were willing to be gone: Hereby the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
seemed the less tedious to such as accompanied him voluntarily. With
the rest of his Army, consisting now but of fifty thousand Foot, and nine
thousand Horse, he passed the <hi>Pyrenes,</hi> and entered into <hi>Gaul</hi> (now
<hi>France:</hi>)<note place="margin">His passage through France.</note> But he found the <hi>Gauls</hi> bounding upon <hi>Spain</hi> ready in Arms,
to forbid his entrance into their Country: but with gentle Speech, and
rich Presents, which he sent to their Leaders, he wan them to favour
his expedition. So without any other molestation, he came to the Banks
of <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> where dwelt on each side of the River a People called <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae.</hi>
These being unacquainted with the cause of his coming, sought to
stop his passage over the Water: But he was greatly assisted by those of
<hi>Vivarets,</hi> and <hi>Lionois:</hi> for though many of them had transported themselves,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103996:70"/>
and their goods into <hi>Daulphine,</hi> thinking to defend the Banks against him;
yet such as remained, being willing to free their Countrey from such unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Guests, they helped him to make Boats: informed him of a better pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
higher up the River, and sent him Guides.</p>
            <p>When his Boats were ready,<note place="margin">He is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> he sent <hi>Hanno</hi> the Son of <hi>Bomilcar,</hi> up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
to the Ford, and himself in the mean time made a shew of entring the
Ford below, that <hi>Hanno</hi> charging the <hi>Gauls</hi> on their own side, and himself at
the same time passing the River in their faces, might win the further Bank,
which was done accordingly,<note place="margin">His Victory in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> though with some difficulty, and thereby the
enemies were dispersed.</p>
            <p>Having passed this first brunt, and overcome both the rage of the River, and
those that defended it, he was visited by the Princes of the <hi>Cisalpine-Gauls,</hi>
that inhabited <hi>Piemout</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> who had lately revolted from the <hi>Romans.</hi>
These informed him that the passage over the <hi>Alps</hi> was not so difficult as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
made it,<note place="margin">Some <hi>Gauls</hi> incourage him.</note> and gave him Guides, with many other encouragements. Yet
found he himself extremly incumbred by the <hi>Savoyards,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He passeth the <hi>Alps.</hi>
               </note> and lost more of his
Carriages and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> than he could well spare. For he was twice strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
assaulted by them before he could recover the Plains on the other side. He
was fifteen dayes passing over the <hi>Alps,</hi> wherein, besides the trouble of his
enemies, he was much assaulted by foul weather, and Snow, it being now
the beginning of Winter. But the fair and fertile plains which they now
were entring into, with the assistance and encouragement of the <hi>Cisalpine
Gauls,</hi> gave them much comfort, having nothing else of difficulty remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but that which from the beginning they made account to overcome
by their proper Valour and Resolution, namely, the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Ambassadours who had denounced War at <hi>Carthage,</hi> in their
return homewards, took <hi>Spain</hi> in their way, with a purpose to draw into their
Alliance as many Cities and Princes as they could. The first that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
were the <hi>Volcians,</hi> from whom they received this answer: that they
would never joyn with them who had forsaken the <hi>Saguntines</hi> in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
need; and that themselves had found the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> such good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
that they meant still to adhere to them. From <hi>Spain</hi> the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
passed through <hi>Gaul,</hi> perswading them not to suffer <hi>Hannibal</hi> to pass
through their Countrey, and gloried much in their own strength: But the
<hi>Gauls</hi> laughed them to scorn, and had scarce Patience to hear them speak:
telling them that they meant not to set their own Houses on fire, to
save the <hi>Romans</hi> from burning; that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had never offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them as the <hi>Romans</hi> had done, who had already forced some of them out
of their habitations, and made others Tributaries, who were as free as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>With these unpleasing answers the Ambassadours returned home; carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no good news of Friends like to help them, but rather that the <hi>Gauls</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to take part with their enemies. And accordingly when the <hi>Cisal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine-Gauls</hi>
heard that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had passed <hi>Iberus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Gauls</hi> rise against the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> and were marching
towards <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Boij,</hi> and <hi>Insubrians</hi> rose up against the <hi>Romans:</hi> Their
quarrel was the late planting of <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies at <hi>Cremona,</hi> and <hi>Placentia,</hi>
within Territories. Relying therefore upon the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> succour,
which they thought to be at hand, laying aside all regard of those Hostages,
that they had lately given to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they fell upon those Colonies. The
Towns they could not win, but they forced the <hi>Roman</hi> Commissioners which
were abroad,<note place="margin">They besiege <hi>Modena.</hi>
               </note> to fly into <hi>Modena,</hi> where they besieged them. But the <hi>Gauls,</hi>
having little skill in besieging Cities, grew weary, and were desirous of Peace:
This they did on purpose to draw on some meeting, that laying hands on the
<hi>Roman</hi> Deputies, they might with them redeem their Hostages; and it fell
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103996:70"/>
out in part according to their wish: For Ambassadours coming to them from
<hi>Rome</hi> to treat with them, they made them Prisoners. <hi>Manlius</hi> the <hi>Praetor</hi>
hearing of this outrage, marched with his Army to relieve the Besieged. But
the <hi>Gauls</hi> laid an Ambush in his way, that falling upon him, utterly routed
him, and slew most of his Army, except a few that escaped into a defensible
place upon the River <hi>Po.</hi> This being heard of at <hi>Rome, C. Atilius,</hi> the other
<hi>Praetor,</hi> hasted with another Army to relieve the besieged.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Gauls</hi> were too hastly,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> send an Army, into <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> so the <hi>Romans</hi> were too slow in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this War. For they could not believe that <hi>Carthage,</hi> which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
servilely endured so many indignities from them in the late peace, durst
be so bold on a sudden, as to attempt the Conquest of <hi>Italy</hi> it self. Wherefore
they appointed one of their Consuls to make War in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the other in
<hi>Africk. Titus Sempronius</hi> went into <hi>Africk</hi> with one hundred and sixty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of five to an Oar, which preparations seemed to threaten <hi>Carthage</hi> her
self. <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio,</hi> the other Consul, hasted towards <hi>Spain,</hi> and by the
way, touching at <hi>Massilia,</hi> he was there informed, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had passed
the River <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> whom he had thought to have found busie in <hi>Spain.
Hannibal</hi> also heard of the Consuls arrival, with whom he meant to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do. Yet both sent forth Scouts, <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent out five hundred <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians,</hi>
and <hi>Scipio</hi> three hundred of his best Horse. They met, and fought,
and the <hi>Romans</hi> had the better of it. But when <hi>Scipio</hi> drew near, thinking to
have met with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he found that they were gone three dayes
before, with an intent to see the Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> hereupon sent his Brother <hi>Cn. Cornelius Scipio</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> with the
greatest part of the Army, against <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> and himself with the choicest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
back, and landing at <hi>Pisa,</hi> he marched through <hi>Tuscany</hi> and <hi>Lumbardy,</hi>
where he drew together the broken Bands of <hi>Manlius</hi> and <hi>Atilius,</hi> who were
lately beaten by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> intending therewith to oppose the enemy, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to find them tired with their long Journey.</p>
            <p>Five moneths <hi>Hannibal</hi> had spent in that tedious march from <hi>Carthagena.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> losses in his march.</note>
When he had passed <hi>Rhodanus,</hi> he had in his Army but thirty eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and eight thousand Horse, the rest having perished with Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Enemies, Rivers, and Mountains. Having newly passed the <hi>Alps,</hi> and
scarce refreshed his wearied Army in <hi>Piemont,</hi> he sought the Friendship of the
<hi>Taurini,</hi> who being at this time in War with the <hi>Insubrians,</hi> (his good Friends)
the <hi>Taurini</hi> refused it; whereupon he besieged their chief Town, and in three
dayes wan it, the spoil whereof did much encourage his Army, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
Calamity terrified their Neighbours. Most of those parts would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
have joyned with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but when the Consul <hi>Scipio</hi> came amongst
them, they began to be better advised. This wavering affection amongst the
People, made the Generals to hasten to a Battel. Their meeting was at
<hi>Ticinum</hi> [now <hi>Pavia</hi>] where each of them wondred at the others expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>The Senate at <hi>Rome</hi> were much amazed at <hi>Hannibals</hi> arrival in <hi>Italy:</hi>
wherefore they sent presently to <hi>Sempronius</hi> and the other Consul, now in
<hi>Sicily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to fight.</note> to give him notice of it, and to require him speedily to return with
his Army for the safeguard of <hi>Italy,</hi> which accordingly he did. <hi>Scipio</hi> and
<hi>Hannibal</hi> were now so near, that fight they must e're they could part, and
therefore each of them encouraged their Souldiers by the best Arguments
they had: <hi>Hannibal</hi> assuring his men, that there was no mean betwixt <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and Death.</p>
            <p>When the Armies approached near each to other,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> 
               <hi>Scipio</hi> sent forth his
Horsemen of the <hi>Gauls</hi> to begin the fight, lining them with his Darters
for their assistance; himself, with his men at Arms followed slowly in good
order. The <hi>Gauls,</hi> being in their Generals sight, behaved themselves gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103996:71"/>
and were as bravely opposed; but their Darters at the very first, ran cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly
away without casting a Dart, for fear of being trodden down by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Horse. Yet did the <hi>Gauls</hi> maintain it stoutly, and did more hurt than
they received: neither was <hi>Scipio</hi> unmindful to relieve them; wherefore he
adventured him self so far, that he received a dangerous wound, and had there
perished, if his Son (afterwards called <hi>Africanus</hi>) had not brought him off.
Whilst the <hi>Romans</hi> were busie in helping their Consul, an unexpected storm
assailed them at their backs: <hi>Hannibal</hi> had appointed his <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to charge the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Flank, so and to compass them about, whilst
he, with his men at Arms, sustained their charge, and met them in the face.
The <hi>Numidians</hi> performed it well, cutting in pieces the scattered Foot that
ran away at the first encounter, and then falling on the backs of those that
charged <hi>Hannibal,</hi> by this impression the <hi>Romans</hi> were shuffled together, and
routed,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> betaking themselves to their heels, and leaving to their enemies the
honour of the day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> perceiving how things were like to go, almost stole the Retreat with
most of his Footmen yet unbroken, and recovered the Bridge over <hi>Ticinus:</hi>
but notwithstanding his hast, he lost six hundred of his men which brought
up his Rear, and should have broken down the Bridge. It was two dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
e're <hi>Hannibal</hi> could pass the River; <hi>Scipio</hi> in the mean time refreshing his
men, and easing himself of his wound in <hi>Placentia:</hi> But when <hi>Hannibal</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
them Battel again, and they durst not accept of it; the <hi>Gauls</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
assisted the <hi>Romans</hi> out of fear, took courage, and left them; and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that now the time was come for the recovery of their Liberty, that night
they fell upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, wounded, and slew many, especially of
those that kept the Guard,<note place="margin">The <hi>Gauls</hi> forsake the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> with whose Heads in their hands they fled over to
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and presented their service: <hi>Hannibal</hi> received them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
courteously, and sent them to their own homes, that they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the rest of the Nation to become his Confederates.</p>
            <p>The same night the Consul stole a retreat, as he had done before, but not
with the like success: For <hi>Hannibal</hi> had an eye upon him, and e're he was
gone far,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> beats the Consul.</note> he sent his <hi>Numidians</hi> after him, and himself followed with the
Body of his Army. Then had the <hi>Romans</hi> received a great blow, but the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians,</hi>
greedy of prey, fell to ransacking their Camp, and thereby gave
them liberty of escaping, only some in the Rear were either slain, or taken
Prisoners. <hi>Scipio</hi> being unable to travel by reason of his wound, and judging
it meet to stay for the coming of his fellow Consul, intrenched himself strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the Banks of the River <hi>Trebia;</hi> which so diminished his Reputation,
that every day more of the <hi>Gauls</hi> fell to <hi>Hannibal;</hi> amongst whom came in the
<hi>Boij,</hi> that brought with them the <hi>Roman</hi> Commissioners: Hitherto they had
kept them as Pledges, wherewith to recover their own Hostages; but now
they delivered them to <hi>Hannibal</hi> as tokens of their affection to him. <hi>Hannibal</hi>
being in great want of Victuals he attempted the taking of <hi>Clastidium,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Romans</hi> had laid all their Store and Ammunition,<note place="margin">He wins <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stidium.</hi>
               </note> and a <hi>Brundusian</hi> that
had the keeping of it, surrendred it to him for a little money.</p>
            <p>The news of these disasters coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> filled the Senate and People
with a desire of revenge, their Foot wherein their greatest strength lay, being
yet entire: they therefore hasted away <hi>Sempronius</hi> with his Army, who, by
speedy marches came to <hi>Scipio,</hi> upon the Banks of <hi>Trebia.</hi> The Consuls
took Counsel what was fittest to be done, now that their Armies were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned:
<hi>Sempronius</hi> was eager to fight before <hi>Scipio</hi> recovered of his wound,
that he might get the whole glory of the Victory: He also feared the election
of new Consuls, his time being almost expired: But <hi>Scipio</hi> perswaded the
contrary, by many arguments: yet would not <hi>Sempronius</hi> be taken off,
wherewith <hi>Hannibal</hi> was exceedingly pleased, who feared nothing so much
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103996:71"/>
as delays. To further the desire of <hi>Sempronius,</hi> the <hi>Gauls</hi> that inhabited near
to <hi>Trebia,</hi> complained of injuries done to them by the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they neglected to supply <hi>Hannibal</hi> with necessaries, and therefore he
was bold to be his own Carver. Hereupon <hi>Sempronius</hi> sent forth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Forrages bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> which coming unlooked for upon <hi>Hannibals</hi> Forragers, who
were heavy laden, they cut many of them in pieces, and chased the rest
even to their Camp. This indignity made the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to sally out,
who caused them to retire faster than they came: <hi>Sempronius</hi> relieved his
own men, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> did the like: So that at length the <hi>Roman</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was drawn forth, and Battel offered, if the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
it.</p>
            <p>This Victory (for so the Consul would name it) made the <hi>Romans</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
desirous to try it out in open Field, notwithstanding <hi>Scipios</hi> diswasion
from it. This <hi>Hannibal</hi> was informed of by the <hi>Gauls</hi> that were in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Camp: therefore he resolved to secure the Victory by adding a Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
to his Forces. He found in a hallow place overgrown with Reeds,
a fit Trench to cover an Ambush: Therein he cast his Brother <hi>Mago</hi>
with a thousand choise Horse, and as many Foot. The rest of his Army,
when he had well fed, and refreshed them, he led into the Field and
marched towards the Consuls. Early in the morning he had sent over the
River some <hi>Numidian</hi> Horsemen to brave the enemy, and draw him forth to
a bad Dinner before he had broken his Fast. <hi>Sempronius</hi> readily embraced
the opportunity of fighting, and forthwith sent over the River in a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cold day,
his Footmen, who were almost to the Arm-holes, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the want of Food, did much enfeeble them: The <hi>Romans</hi> were
stoing in Foot,<note place="margin">Another Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</note> having in all thirty six thousand: The Mass of those were
ranged in a gross Battalion, guarded on the Flanks with three thousand
Horse, thrusting their light armed and Darters in loose Companies before the
rest in the nature of a Vaunt-guard. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> equalled them in
Foot, and exceeded them in Horse: when therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse were
broken by the <hi>Numidians:</hi> when their Foot were charged, both in Front and
Flank, by the <hi>Spaniards, Gauls,</hi> and Elephants, and when all were pressed in
the Rear by <hi>Mago</hi> and his Men out of the Ambush, then fell the <hi>Romans</hi> by
heaps under their Enemies Swords,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> and were beaten down as well fighting as
flying, so that of thirty six thousand, there escaped no more than ten thousand
of all sorts.</p>
            <p>The remainder of this broken Army was collected by <hi>Scipio,</hi> who got there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with
into <hi>Placentia,</hi> stealing away the same Night, which was very rainy.
<hi>Sempronius</hi> escaped with great danger, and fled to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he did his
Office in choosing new Consuls for the year following, and then returned
to his Province with a fresh supply against <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Winter proved very sharp, and unfit for service, which well pleased
the <hi>Romans,</hi> who lay warm in <hi>Placentia,</hi> and <hi>Cremona.</hi> Yet did not <hi>Hannibal</hi>
suffer them to lie very quiet, but vexed them with continual Alarms,
assaulting divers places, and taking some. He also wan the <hi>Lygurians</hi> to
him, who, to testifie their faithful love, presented him with two <hi>Roman
Questors,</hi> [Treasurers,] two Collonels, and five young Gentlemen; the
Sons of Senators.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Policy.</note> These and all his other Prisoners, <hi>Hannibal</hi> held in streight
places, loaden with Irons, and miserably fed. But there followers he intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
courteously, and sent them to their own Countries without ransome,
protesting that he undertook the War in <hi>Italy</hi> to free them from the oppression
of the <hi>Romans.</hi> By these means he drew many to his party, and assistance.
But some of the <hi>Gauls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Treacheries against him.</note> fearing that their Country should be made the seat of
War, conspired against his Life: others discovered the danger to him, who
yet, soon after, were ready to practice the same; which enforced <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:103996:72"/>
to use Perukes and false Beards the better to conceal himself from
them.</p>
            <p>At length when Summer was come, he resolved to leave these giddy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
and so passed the <hi>Appenine</hi> Hills that he might approach nearer to
<hi>Rome.</hi> So away he went having his Army much recruted with <hi>Ligurians</hi> and
<hi>Gauls;</hi> and to prevent the obstructions in the ordinary way, he chose to
travel through the <hi>Fennes</hi> of <hi>Tuscany.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His dangerous march.</note> In those Marshes and Bogs he lost all
his Elephants save one, with one of his own eyes, through the moistness of
the Air, and by lodging on the cold Ground: Yet at last with much
ado, he recovered the firm and fertile Plains, and Quartered about <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retium,</hi>
where he somewhat refreshed his weary Army, and heard news
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Consuls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Cn. Servilius,</hi> were newly chosen Consuls for this
year: The first a tractable man, wholly governed by the Senate; the other
a hot-headed man, who fearing some obstruction, gat him out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
before the day of Election, that he might, as soon as he was chosen,
take possession of his Office: fearing lest he should lose his Honour, which
he hoped to gain in the War. The Senators were so displeased at this,
that they sent for him back; but he neglected their Command, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to meet with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> whom he found at <hi>Arretium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> was well pleased with the fiery disposition of this Consul, and
therefore provoked him by many indignities, hoping thereby to draw him to
fight, ere <hi>Servilius</hi> came with the rest of the Army. For which end he
put to Fire and Sword all the Country round about him, even under the
Consuls Nose. By this <hi>Flaminius</hi> thought his Honour to be much impaired,
and therefore advanced towards the Enemy. Many advised him to stay for
his Colleague, but he would not be perswaded: Then he commanded the
Army to march.</p>
            <p>All the Territory of <hi>Cortona</hi> as far as to the Lake of <hi>Thrasymene</hi> was on a
light Fire, which, whilst <hi>Flaminius</hi> thought to quench with his enemies blood,
he pursued <hi>Hannibal</hi> so unadvisedly, that he fell, with his whole Army into
an Ambush: from thence he was charged unaware from all sides, so that he
knew not which way to turn, nor how to make resistance. There was he
slain in that place, accompanied with the Carcasses of fifteen thousand of
his Countrymen: About six thousand of his Vantguard took courage out
of desparation, and breaking through their Enemies, they recovered the
tops of the Mountains: but being discovered there, <hi>Maharbal</hi> was sent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten again.</note> who overtook them by Night in a Village, and surrounded them
with his Horse, and so they yielded, rendring up their Arms upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of life and liberty. This accord <hi>Hannibal</hi> refused to confirm, and so
made them all Prisoners.</p>
            <p>At this time he had about fifteen thousand Prisoners: all that were not
<hi>Romans</hi> he set free without ransome, still protesting, that for their sakes he
came into <hi>Italy:</hi> But the <hi>Romans</hi> he kept in streight Prison, and held them
to hard meat.</p>
            <p>Presently after the Battel of <hi>Thrasymene, C. Sempronius,</hi> with four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse came neer to <hi>Hannibals</hi> Camp. He was sent from <hi>Ariminum</hi> by
<hi>Servilius,</hi> the other Consul, to encrease the strength of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> but
coming too late, he only encreased the misadventure. <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent out
<hi>Maharbal</hi> to intercept him, who finding them amazed at the ill news of
the late loss,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> charged, and brake them, killing almost half of them, and
drew the rest simply to yield to mercy. <hi>Servilius</hi> hearing of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
and death of his Colleague, hasted to <hi>Rome</hi> for the defence
of it.</p>
            <p>Greatly were the <hi>Romans</hi> amazed at these disasters,<note place="margin">Great fear at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and their approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103996:72"/>
danger. Wherefore they had recourse to a remedy which had been long
out of use, and that was, to choose a <hi>Dictator,</hi> whose power was above
the Consuls, and scarcely subject to the Control of the whole City: And
now they chose <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A <hi>Dictator</hi> chosen.</note> the best reputed Man of War in the
City, and <hi>Fabius</hi> chose <hi>M. Minutius Rufus,</hi> Master of the Horse, who was as
the <hi>Dictators</hi> Lieutenant.</p>
            <p>The first act of <hi>Fabius</hi> was the reformation of somewhat that was amiss in
matter of Religion: then were the Walls and Towers of <hi>Rome</hi> repaired, and
fortified, the Bridges upon Rivers were broken down, and all care taken for
the defence of <hi>Rome</hi> it self. Four Legions the <hi>Dictator</hi> raised in hast, and
from <hi>Ariminum</hi> he received the Army which <hi>Servilius</hi> had conducted thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
With these he marched apace after <hi>Hannibal,</hi> not to fight, but to
affront him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fabius</hi> his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness.</note> He always lodged upon high grounds, and of hard access,
knowing that the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse were far inferiour to the <hi>Numidians. Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
in the mean while pursued his Victory, and ranged over all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
using all manner of cruelty towards the Inhabitants, especially those
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Nation, of whom he put all to the Sword that were able
to bear Arms. Passing by <hi>Spoletum,</hi> and <hi>Ancona,</hi> he encamped upon the
<hi>Adriatick</hi> shores, refreshing his diseased and over travelled Army: and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his <hi>Africans,</hi> after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, and made his dispatches for
<hi>Carthage,</hi> presenting his Friends, (which were very many) with part of
the Spoils that he had gotten.</p>
            <p>Having refreshed his Army, cured his wounded, and fed his Horses, he
followed the course of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Shore towards <hi>Apulia,</hi> a Northern
Province of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> spoiling all that lay in his way. Yet
took he not one City in all those Countries. Indeed he assaied <hi>Spoletum,</hi> but
finding it well defended,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Policy.</note> he presently gave it over. All his care was to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the <hi>Romans</hi> in force and reputation; knowing that when he was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Master of the Field, if would not be long before the walled Cities would
open their Gates to him. To this end he presented <hi>Fabius</hi> with Battel, and
provoked him with all manner of bravado's; but <hi>Fabius</hi> would not bite: His
design was to attend the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> so neer as to keep them from strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fabius</hi> his Wisdom.</note>
and to preserve the Country from utter spoil. Thus by degrees
he inured his Men to dangers, and brought them first to look on the
Lion afar off, that at length they might adventure to sit on his tail.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Minutius</hi> had a contrary disposition, and was as fiery as <hi>Flaminius,</hi>
taxing <hi>Fabius</hi> with cowardliness and fear; yet nothing moved this wary <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator:</hi>
He suffered <hi>Hannibal</hi> to cross the <hi>Apennine</hi> Mountains, and to fall
upon the rich and pleasant Territories of <hi>Campania: Fabius</hi> still keeping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Hills, and fast grounds. When <hi>Hannibal</hi> saw that he could by no
means draw him to fight, and that the Winter drew on, he resolved to rest his
Army that was loaden with spoil, in some safe and plentiful Country till the
Spring came again. But before he could do this, he must pass along by
the <hi>Dictators</hi> Camp, that hung over his head: For there was no other way
for him to get out of this fertile Country which he had already wasted. But
by the errour of his Guide he was brought (as it were) into a pinfold. Now
began the wisdom of <hi>Fabius</hi> to be admired, and applauded, as if he had caught
the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in a trap. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> freed himself by a fine invention:
He had gotten about two thousand Kine,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Stratagem.</note> upon whose Horns he tyed dry Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots,
and in the dark Night setting them on fire, he caused them to be driven
up the Hill. The sight was strange and terrible to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
himself thinking it to be a devise to circumvent him, kept within his Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
So <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his Army escaped the danger, and gat into a safe
Country. Then did he make semblance of marching towards <hi>Rome,</hi> the
<hi>Dictator</hi> coasting him after the wonted manner; and keeping still on the high
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103996:73"/>
grounds betwixt him and the City, whilst the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> wasted all the
plain Countries, and taking <hi>Geryon</hi> in <hi>Apulia,</hi> he turned it into Barns and
Storehouses for the Winter, and encamped under the broken Walls. Thus
little was done till the <hi>Dictator</hi> was called home to <hi>Rome</hi> about some business of
Religion; and when he went, he left the Army in charge with <hi>Minutius,</hi> the
Master of the Horse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Minutius</hi> was glad of this opportunity to shew his sufficiency. He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that the <hi>Romans</hi> in plain Field would beat the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who had
got the former Victories by subtilty, and ambushes. All the Army was
of his opinion, and therefore they preferred his forwardness before the cold
wariness of <hi>Fabius:</hi> Hereupon he resolved to Fight, though he had been
peremtorily forbidden by the <hi>Dictator,</hi> and the breach of whose command
was Death: But <hi>Minutius</hi> thought that the honour of the Victory, and
love of the Army, would secure him. <hi>Hannibal</hi> on the other side was
very glad that he should play with a more adventurous Gamster: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he drew neer, and provoked the <hi>Romans,</hi> sending forth a third part
of his Army to wast the Country. There was a piece of high and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
Ground between the two Armies: <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse to seize upon it: But <hi>Minutius</hi> by fine force, won it from
them, and encamped upon it, whereby he became a nearer Neighbour to
<hi>Hannibal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Minutius</hi> for many days not stirring, <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent forth many of his men
to fetch in Harvest. This advantage <hi>Minutius</hi> wisely espied, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
drawing forth his Army, presented Battel to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but he was
not now in case to accept of it; wherefere <hi>Minutius</hi> sent out some against
the Forragers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers beaten.</note> who were scattered all over the Fields, and loaden with Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so were easily overthrown. It angred <hi>Hannibal</hi> that he was not
able to help them, but it angred him worse when the <hi>Romans</hi> took heart
to assault his Trenches. But in the heat of this business <hi>Asdrubal</hi> came
from <hi>Geryon</hi> with four thousand Horse, which emboldned <hi>Hannibal</hi> to issue
forth against the <hi>Romans,</hi> to whom he did not so much hurt as he had
received.</p>
            <p>For this piece of service <hi>Minutius</hi> was highly honoured by the Army,
and more cryed up by the People at <hi>Rome,</hi> all judging him more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Command than <hi>Fabius.</hi> But the <hi>Dictator</hi> was not so joyful of the
news, as angry that <hi>Minutius</hi> had disobeyed his command. He said, that
he knew his own place, and that he would teach the Master of the Horse
to know it also; and that he would make him give an account for what he
had done in his absence.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Minutius</hi> made equal with <hi>Fabius.</hi>
               </note> The People much disliked these his Speeches, and
made an Act, that <hi>Minutius</hi> should be joyned in equal authority with the
<hi>Dictator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before this Business was effected, <hi>Fabius</hi> seeing how things were like to
go, dispatched the election of a new Consul in the room of <hi>Flaminius,</hi>
and having finished his business, went out of the City towards his Army.
But the news of <hi>Minutius</hi> his advancement was at the Camp as soon as
he, so that his Lieutenant treated with him now as his Colleague, asking
him how they should divide their authority: <hi>Fabius</hi> briefly told him,
that seeing the Citizens had made the Master of the Horse equal with the
<hi>Dictator,</hi> he would divide the Legions with him by Lot, according to the
custom: <hi>Minutius</hi> was ill pleased with this, for with half the Army he could
not work such wonders as he hoped for. Yet meant he to do his best:
and so taking half the Army, he encamped about a mile and a half from
<hi>Fabius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It behoved the Master of the Horse to make good the opinion which
had thus advanced him; therefore he sought good occasion to fight, to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103996:73"/>
which <hi>Hannibal,</hi> was as forward as he. The Country between them was
open and bare, yet <hi>Hannibal</hi> found means to lay an ambush in it: For the
sides of the Valley had many spacious Caves, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the Night,
thrust into them five hundred Horse,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> and five thousand Foot: and least
they should be discovered, he made offer betimes in the Morning to seize
upon a piece of ground that lay on the other side from the Caves, thereby
turning all their eyes that way. <hi>Minutius</hi> hoping to increase his honour
as he had gotten it, sent first his light Armuture, then his Horse, and at
length he followed in Person with the Legions. He was soon caught, and
so invironed on all hands, that he neither knew how to make resistance,
nor a safe retreat. In this dangerous case, whilst the <hi>Romans</hi> defended
themselves,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> they lost many of their best men. But <hi>Fabius</hi> drew neer in
good order to relieve them, and doing therein the office of a good Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
regarding more the good of his Country, than the disgrace which he
had wrongfully sustained.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Fabius</hi> his approach, <hi>Hannibal</hi> retired: <hi>Fearing</hi> (as he said) <hi>to be
well wet with the Cloud that had hung so long upon the Hill-tops. Minutius</hi>
forthwith submitted himself to <hi>Fabius,</hi> by whose favour he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that his life was preserved. Thence forward the War went on slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whilst <hi>Fabius</hi> his <hi>Dictatorship</hi> lasted, and the year following also
when he had delivered up his charge to to the Consuls, that followed his
instructions.</p>
            <p>With little pleasure did they of the poorer sort in <hi>Rome</hi> hear the great
commendations which were given to <hi>Fabius</hi> by the principal Citizens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the War was not finished, nor much done tending thereto: And this
affection was very helpful to <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> in his suit for the Consulship;
and farther to help him, he had a kinsman, <hi>Bibius Herennius,</hi> Tribune of
the People: He boldly affirmed that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was drawn into <hi>Italy,</hi> and
suffered there to range at his pleasure by the Noblemen; that without a Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian
Consul the War would never be ended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which perswasions the
multitude were won to be wholly for <hi>Terentius,</hi> to the great vexation of
the Nobles, who could not endure such an upstart: But nothing could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the choise of <hi>Terentius:</hi> Wherefore the Nobles, (to ballast this hot-headed man) set up <hi>L. Aemilius Paulus,</hi> a gallant man and a brave
Captain, to stand for the other Consuls place, and he easily carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</p>
            <p>These new Consuls, <hi>Varro,</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> omitted no diligence in preparing
for the War, wherein, though <hi>Varro</hi> made the greatest noife, boasting what
wonders he would do if he could but once see <hi>Hannibal,</hi> yet the care, and
prudence of <hi>Paulus</hi> did tend much more towards the effecting of it. He
wrote to the two old Consuls to forbear fighting, and yet to ply the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
with daily Skirmishes, and so to weaken them by degrees, that
when he and his Fellow Consul came with the new Army, they might
find the four old Legions well accustomed to the Enemy, and the Enemy
well weakened. These new Consuls raised an Army of above eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot, and six thousand Horse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> all this while lay at <hi>Geryon,</hi> where all his provision, and store
was. The <hi>Romans,</hi> to be neer him, lodged about <hi>Canusium,</hi> laying up
most of their provisions in the Castle of <hi>Cannae.</hi>

                  <hi>Cannae</hi> Castle taken.</note> This place <hi>Hannibal</hi> wan,
and thereby not only furnished himself, but compelled his Enemies to
want many necessaries: Hereby he also enabled himself to stay in that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Country, fit for the service of the Horse. Of this mishap when <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
had informed the Senate, it then seemed needful to them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:103996:74"/>
When all things vvere ready in the City, and the season of the year
commodious, the two Consuls, with their Army set forward against <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</hi>
This was done with great solemnity: Sacrifices and solemn Vows were
made to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the other Gods, for good success and Victory: and
the Generals were accompanied with a great number that brought them out
of the City, and dismissed them with Friendly leave-taking, and good wishes.</p>
            <p>These new Generals arriving at the Camp, dismissed <hi>M. Atilius,</hi> one of
the last years Consuls, because of his age, and retained <hi>Servilius</hi> with them,
as their assistant. <hi>Aemilius</hi> laboured to encourage his men, telling them,
that the enemy had stole all the former Victories by his Ambushes; that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
the <hi>Romans</hi> were far beyond them in Valour <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore
he exhorted them to play the men and do their best. This set them on fire
to be dealing with the <hi>Carthagiuians,</hi> and herein <hi>Varro</hi> concurred with
them, longing for an opportunity to get the honour which he promised
to himself, having now such a numerous Army. By this means the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
fell into a great inconvenience by the disagreement of their Generals;
<hi>Varro</hi> would fight,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Varro</hi> makes hast to figh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> and <hi>Aemilius</hi> would not for the present, hoping for
better advantage ere long, when the enemy should be forced to dislodg
out of the plain Country. The Consuls command in turns every day.
<hi>Aemilius</hi> lodged six miles from <hi>Hannibal</hi> where the ground was uneven.
<hi>Terentius</hi> the next day descended into the plains, his Colleague beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to stay, but could not prevail. He sat down neer to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian,</hi>
who yet gave him but a rude vvelcome, and entertainment. The
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse, and light Armature fell upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Vaunt-Courriers,
and put the whole Army into a tumult, whilst it was yet in its march;
but the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were beaten off; though not without loss. The
next day <hi>Aemilius,</hi> who could not securely draw back the Army, encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the River <hi>Aufidus,</hi> sending part of his Forces over the River where they
encamped themselves, with the rest he fortified and kept within his Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
<hi>Varro</hi> was perswaded that it concerned him in honour to make good
his word to the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> When therefore it was his turn to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
at the break of Day he began to pass the River, without staying
to bid his Colleague good morrow: But <hi>Paulus</hi> came to him, labouring by
all means to disswade him. <hi>Terentius</hi> had norhing to answer but that his
honour was engaged. <hi>Hannibal</hi> had twice or thrice braved them, which
must not be endured. When <hi>Aemilius</hi> perceived that he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
he was careful that what must be done, might be done well. Ten
thousand Foot he caused to be left behind in the Camp, opposite to the
<hi>Carthaginians,</hi> to the intent that <hi>Hannibal</hi> might be forced to do the like,
or else when they were in fight, these might fall upon his Camp, and
take it,<note place="margin">They prepare to fight.</note> with all the wealth therein, which would much distract the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians.</hi>
This done the Consuls drew forth their Army over the Water, and
ranged them in order of Battel.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hannibal</hi> was very glad of, and therefore without any delay, passed
over the River also, leaving in his own Camp enow to defend it, and no
more. To encourage his men, he told them how fit the ground was
wherein they were to fight; and that therefore they were to thank the
Gods who had so infatuated the enemies as to choose such a place where
the stronger in Horse was sure to prevail. Besides (said he) <hi>These are the
men whom you have beaten as often as you have seen them: and now you are
to fight for their Cities, and all the Riches that are in them, and ere many
hours pass ye shall be Lords of all that the</hi> Romans <hi>enjoy.</hi> This set his men
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to be it; and at the same time came his Brother <hi>Mago,</hi> whom
he had sent to view the countenance of the Enemy, to whom he said,
<hi>What news? What works are we like to have?</hi> Work enough, answered
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103996:74"/>
               <hi>Mago,</hi> for they are a horrible Company; As horrible a many as they be,
said <hi>Hannibal,</hi> I tell thee that amongst them all, there is not one man
whose name is <hi>Mago,</hi> and therewith he fell a laughing, which all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
also took for a good Omen.</p>
            <p>In this great day the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> excelled himself, expressing abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Military skill,<note place="margin">The great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel at <hi>Cannae.</hi>
               </note> and of greatness of spirit, and courage. He so
marshalled his Army, that all hands were brought to fight, where every
one might do the best service. His Darters, and Slingers he sent before
to encounter the <hi>Roman Velites:</hi> His <hi>Africans</hi> Armed after the <hi>Roman</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
made the two Wings, very deep in File. Between these he ranged
the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> armed, the first vvith broad Swords, and the other
vvith short and vvell-pointed Blades. The <hi>Gauls</hi> vvere strong of Body,
and furious in giving the Charge, but soon vvearied, spending their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
at the first brunt. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> vvere less eager but more wary.
These <hi>Hannibal</hi> caused to advance, leaving void the place wherein they
had stood, and into vvhich they might fall back, if they vvere overhard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pressed. Between the left Batallion by the River side, vvere the <hi>Gauls</hi>
and <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse under <hi>Asdrubal:</hi> On the right Wing vvas <hi>Maharbal</hi> vvith
the <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse. <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself vvith his Brother <hi>Mago,</hi> led the
Rear. His Army this day vvas ten thousand Horse, and forty thousand
Foot: His Enemies had two to one against him in Foot, and he five to three
against them in Horse.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Army vvas marshelled after their usual manner. On the right
hand vvere the <hi>Roman</hi> Horsemen under the Consul <hi>Paulus:</hi> On the left
Wing vvas <hi>Varro</hi> with the rest of the Horse vvich were of the <hi>Latines</hi>
and other associates, and <hi>Servilius</hi> had the leading of the Battel. The
Sun was newly ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en, and offended neither part, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> having
their faces Northward, and the <hi>Romans</hi> Southward.</p>
            <p>After some light Skirmirshes betvveen the tvvo Forlorns, <hi>Asdrubal</hi> brake
in upon the Consul <hi>Paulus,</hi> and after a rough charge, and much executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
done, the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse vvere overborn, and driven by plain force to
a staggering recoil. When the Battels came to joyning, the <hi>Roman</hi> Legio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries
found vvork enough, and more than enough to break that Body
upon vvhich at first they fell: yet at last <hi>Hannibals</hi> men vvere forced to
a hasty retreat. But vvhilst the Legions, follovving their supposed Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
rushed on upon those that stood before them, and thereby engaged
themselves deeply vvithin the principal strength of the Enemy, the two
<hi>African</hi> Battalions on either side, advanced so far, that getting beyond the
Rear of them, they almost vvholly inclosed them. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> having bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Troops of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse, follovved them along upon the River
side, beating dovvn, and killing most of them vvithout regard of taking
Prisoners. The Consul <hi>Paulus</hi> left his Horse, and cast himself amongst
the Legions, as hoping by them to make good the day. But he failed of
his expectation: Yet did he cheer up his men as vvell as he could both
by Words, and Example, slaying many vvith his ovvn hands. The like
did <hi>Hannibal</hi> amongst his <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in the same part of the Battel,
but vvith better success. For the Consul received a blovv from a Sling
that vvounded him much, and though a Troop of <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen did
their best to save him from further harm, yet vvas he so hardly laid at,
that by vvounds and vveakness he vvas compelled to forsake his Horse:
vvhereupon all his Company also allighted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> being near, and seeing this, said, pleasantly, <hi>I had rather he
would have delivered them to me bound, hand and foot,</hi> meaning, that he had
them almost as safe as if they had been so bound. All this vvhile <hi>Varro,</hi>
vvith his associates in the left Wing, vvas marvellously troubled with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103996:75"/>
               <hi>Maharbal,</hi> and his <hi>Numidians;</hi> who beating up and down upon the great
Sandy plain, raised a foul dust, which by a strong South wind, was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into the eyes and mouths of the <hi>Romans.</hi> These using the advantage
both of their number and lightness, wearied the Consul and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
exceedingly, neither giving nor sustaining any charge, but continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
making offers and then wheeling about. Yet at the first, they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to promise him a happy day of it. For when the Battels were even rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to joyn, five hundred of these <hi>Numidians</hi> came pricking away from
their Fellows, with their Shields on their backs, as was the manner of
those which yielded, and throwing down their Arms, yielded themselves,
<hi>Varro</hi> had no leasure then to examine them, but bad them to rest quietly
behind his Army till all was done. These crafty Marchants did as he bad
them for a while, till they had opportunity to put their design in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Under their Jackets they had short Swords and Poniards, with
which and other Weapons that they gathered up of those that were slain,
they flew upon the hindmost of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whilst all eyes were bent ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>The last blow that put an end to all, was given by the same hand that
gave the first. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> having routed and slain all the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse, save
the Company of <hi>A milius</hi> that joyned themselves to the Foot, did not stay
to charge upon the face of the Legions, but, fetching a compass, he came
up to the <hi>Numidi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ns</hi> with whom he joyned, and gave upon <hi>Terentius.</hi> This
fearful Cloud prognosticated a dismal storm; wherefore <hi>Terentius</hi> his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
having wearied themselves much in doing little, and seeing more
work towards then they were like to sustain, thought it their saffest way
to secure themselves by present flight. The Consul also was as careful to
provide for his own security as were they. Now he found that it was one
thing to talk of <hi>Hannibal</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and another to encounter him. Close at
the heels of him and his flying Troops were <hi>Numidians,</hi> appointed by <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
to the pursute as fittest for that service. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> himself with his
<hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse, fetching a compass, fell upon the backs of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who were almost surrounded, and much distressed before. Here
began a miserable slaughter, the vanquished multitude thronging each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not finding which way to turn. <hi>Aemilius,</hi> who could not sit his
Horse before, whilst the spaces were open by which he might have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
himself, was now unable to fly, his way being stopt by a throng of
his miserable followers, and heaps of Bodies, that fell apace in that great
Carnage.</p>
            <p>In this terrible overthrow dyed all the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot, save two or three
thousand, who escaped into their lesser Camp; and the Night following
about four thousand Foot and two hundred Horse fled into <hi>Canusium.</hi> The
Camps were both yielded to <hi>Hannibal</hi> by those who yet remained in them.
<hi>Terentius</hi> the Consul recovered <hi>Venusia</hi> with seventy at most in his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
the rest of his Troops were scattered over the Fields, and gathered
up by the <hi>Numidians</hi> and made Prisoners. There died in this great Battel
of <hi>Cannae,</hi> besides the Consul <hi>Paulus,</hi> two of the <hi>Roman Questors,</hi> twenty
one Collonels, eighty Senators, or such as had born Office; amongst whom
was <hi>Servilius,</hi> the last years Consul, and <hi>Minutius,</hi> late Master of the Horse,
and about eight thousand were taken Prisoners. <hi>Hannibal</hi> lost about four
thousand <hi>Gauls:</hi> fifteen hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Africans,</hi> and about two
hundred Horse. A loss not sensible in the joy of so great a Victory; which
if he had pursued, as <hi>Maharbal</hi> advised him, and forthwith marched against
<hi>Rome,</hi> probably the War had presently been at an end. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> knew
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103996:75"/>
how to get, not how to use a Victory: and God had otherwise deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Hannibal</hi> had sacked the <hi>Roman</hi> Camps, and trused up the spoils, he
dislodged and marched away to <hi>Samnium,</hi> finding a disposition in many
People thereabouts to forsake the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to make aliance with him.
The first Town that opened their Gates to him,<note place="margin">Many Towns intertain <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal.</hi>
               </note> was <hi>Cossag,</hi> where he laid up his
Baggage; and leaving his Brother <hi>Mago</hi> to take in other places, he hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Campania.</hi> He dismissed all his Prisoners that were nor <hi>Romans,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ransom; whereby he won the affections of most of the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in <hi>Italy,</hi> to incline to him. He also gave leave to his <hi>Roman</hi> Prisoners
to sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to procure their ransom, with whom he sent <hi>Carthalo,</hi> the
General of his Horse, to see how <hi>Rome</hi> stood affected to peace. The Senate
commanded <hi>Carthalo</hi> to depart out of their Territories, and refused to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
their Prisoners; probably, because they wanted Mony wherewithal
to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Campania</hi> is a most pleasant and fruitful Country, and <hi>Capua,</hi> the chief
City in it, rich and wealthy, the Citizens despised now the unfortunate vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and sent Ambassadours to <hi>Hannibal</hi> with whom these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
were agreed upon: That the <hi>Campans</hi> should be absolutely free, and
Governed by their own Laws: That no Citizens of theirs should be subject
to any <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Magistrate in War or Peace; and that <hi>Hannibal</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
to the <hi>Campans</hi> three hundred <hi>Roman</hi> Prisoners, such as themselves should
choose, whom they might exchange for their Gentlemen that were Hostages
with the <hi>Romans.</hi> Then did <hi>Hannibal</hi> hasten towards <hi>Capua,</hi> leaving <hi>Naples</hi>
that he had thought to take in by <hi>Scalado,</hi> but found the Walls too high,
and himself not fully furnished for a Siege.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Capua</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains him.</note> At <hi>Capua</hi> he was intertained
with great solemnity and Pomp; all the Town being so earnestly in love
with their new Guests that they murthered all the <hi>Romans</hi> that at present they
could come by.</p>
            <p>The same course with these of <hi>Capua,</hi> ran the other Cities thereabout, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Nola, Nuceria, Naples, Cassiline,</hi> and <hi>Acenae,</hi> which yet stood out for the
<hi>Romans. Rome</hi> it self was in great fear of <hi>Hannibals</hi> coming at the first report
of the overthrow at <hi>Cannae;</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> mourn.</note> and the grief of that loss was so general, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate,
that it much hindred their provision against apparent danger.
All the Senators found work enough to quiet the Peoples lamentations. Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
were sent forth to bring them certain tidings how things went, whereof
when Letters from the Consul <hi>Varro</hi> had fully informed them, they were so
amazed, that they ran into Barbarous Superstition, and by the advice of their
Southsayers, they buried two Men, and two Women alive in the Ox-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.
Ambassadours also were sent to the Oracle at <hi>Delphi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</note> to enquire with
what Prayers and Supplications they might pacifie the Gods, and obtain an
end of their calamities.</p>
            <p>In the midst of these extremities they called home their Consul <hi>Terentius</hi>
that he might name a <hi>Dictator,</hi> and all sorts of people went forth to meet
him, and welcome him home, which was done to hold up their reputation.
<hi>M. Junius</hi> was chosen for the <hi>Dictator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A <hi>Dictator</hi> chosen.</note> and <hi>T. Sempronius</hi> Master of the
Horse. These fell presently to the mustring of Forces, and raised four Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
and a thousand Horse, yet were they faign to take some that were
very Boys, and they encreased their number by adding to them eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
sturdy Slaves, to whom liberty was promised if they would deserve it by
their manly service: The <hi>Dictator</hi> also Proclaimed, that whosoever were in
debt and could not pay it, or that had committed any capital offence,
should be pardoned if they would serve in the War: and to Arm these
they were faign to take down out of their Temples the spoils of their enemies
that had been there hung up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:103996:76"/>
The <hi>Dictator</hi> having dispatched all needful businesses in the City, took the
Field with twenty five thousand Men, with whom he marched into <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania,</hi>
and did little more then to keep <hi>Hannibal</hi> from spoiling the Country.
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> one of the <hi>Roman Praetors,</hi> lying at <hi>Ostia</hi> with a Legion and fifteen
hundred Souldiers newly taken up, with whom he should have gone into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
hearing of the overthrow at <hi>Cannae,</hi> sent his new levied men to <hi>Rome</hi> for
the defence of it, and with his Legion marched to <hi>Nola</hi> to help the Citizens
there: <hi>Hannibal</hi> had many Friends in <hi>Nola</hi> amongst the common People,
and therefore brought his Army thither; and on a day seeing the Walls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manned,
he bad his Souldiers bring the Ladders and scale them:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> beaten.</note> But whilst
they did it, and were in confusion. <hi>Marcellus</hi> with his men, issued out at
three several Gates, and set upon the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> expecting no such thing,
and did such execution amongst them, that this was accounted a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and reputed the bravect act in all those Wars, from whence they
concluded that <hi>Hannibal</hi> might be overcome.</p>
            <p>From thence <hi>Hannibal</hi> went to <hi>Acerrae,</hi> where being refused entrance,
he laid Siege to it on every side,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acerrae</hi> taken by <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> wherewith the Citizens being terrified, before
his works were finished, they stole out by Night, and left the Town
empty; which <hi>Hannibal</hi> sackt and burnt, then hearing that the <hi>Dictator</hi>
was about <hi>Cassiline,</hi> thither vvent he, but found him not; only many
Companies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Confederats vvere gotten into the Town, and kept
it: The Citizens vvere affected to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and vvould faign have
been free from there Guests, vvho finding their intent, in a Night slew
all the Citizens,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cassiline</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.</note> and fortified a part of the City against the enemy. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
gave divers assaults to it, but vvas still repelled vvith loss, and may sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
they made vvith variable success: <hi>Hannibal</hi> mined, and they counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
so that he vvas driven to enclose them, that he might vvin it
by Famine. <hi>T. Sempronius Gracchus,</hi> Master of the Horse lay up the River
vvith the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and vvould faign have relieved the Besieged, but
durst not venture. Barrels of Corn he sent floating down the River to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, which, being discovered, came into <hi>Hannibals</hi> hands. <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
cost abundance of Nuts into the stream, vvhich faintly sustained the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.
At length vvhen all their food vvas spent, and vvhatsoever green
thing grevv under the Walls, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> plovved up the ground,
and the besieged presently sovved it vvith Rape-seed. <hi>Hannibal</hi> admired
their patience, and said, <hi>That he meant not to stay there till the Rapes were
grown,</hi> and therefore, vvhereas he had intended to have made them an
example for their obstinacy, he vvas novv content to grant them their
lives upon an easie ransom, and so quietly dismissed them. The time of the
year novv being come, <hi>Hannibal</hi> retired into <hi>Capua,</hi> vvhere he vvintered, and
vvhere (as some say) his Army vvas corrupted vvith the pleasures and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
there, and made more effeminate than before.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent his Brother <hi>Mago</hi> to <hi>Carthage</hi> vvith the
joyful nevvs of this great Victory.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mago</hi> sent to <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </note> He told the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Senate, vvith
hovv many <hi>Roman</hi> Generals his Brother had fought, hovv many Consuls
he had chased, vvounded, or slain. Hovv the <hi>Romans,</hi> vvho never used
to shun a Battel, vvere novv grown so cold that they thought their <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
Fabius</hi> the only good Captain. That not vvithout reason their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
were thus abated, since <hi>Hannibal</hi> had slain above two hundred and six
thousand of them, and taken above fifty thousand Prisoners. He told
them how many States in <hi>Italy</hi> followed the Fortune of those great Victories.
He told them that the War was even at an end, if they vvould follovv it
close and give the <hi>Romans</hi> no time of breathing. He wished them to consider
that the War was carried into an enemies Country, that so many Battels had
diminished his Brothers Army, that the Souldiers that had deserved so well,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103996:76"/>
ought to be well rewarded, and that it was not good to burden their new <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Friends with exactions of Mony, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that these must be sent
from <hi>Carthage.</hi> Lastly he caused the Gold Rings, taken from the Fingers of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights that were slain, to be powred out before them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
measured, filled three Bushels.</p>
            <p>This errand of <hi>Mago</hi> for the present found extraordinary good welcome;
And large supplies vvere voted to be sent to him:<note place="margin">Large supplies promised to <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
               </note> But his old enemy <hi>Hanno,</hi>
obstructed them, and the too much Parsimony, of the Citizens was the cause
that there was very little done, and that which was done came too late. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<hi>Mago</hi> brings the news of the great supply which was decreed to be
sent; which much rejoyced <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his new confederates. The Spring
drew on vvhen the supply was expected, but there came no more than a few
Elephants, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> was forced to rest contented with them. Then did
he take the Field, and sought to make himself Master of some good Haven
Town that might serve to intertain the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Fleet when it should ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
with the supplies. For this end he sent <hi>Himilco,</hi> who by the help of his
good Friends the <hi>Brusians,</hi> won <hi>Petilia;</hi> he won also <hi>Concentia</hi> and <hi>Crotan,</hi> and
the City of <hi>Locri,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Divers Cities taken.</note> and many other places; only the Town of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> over
against <hi>Sicily,</hi> held out against him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> at this time were in such a case, that <hi>Hannibal</hi> vvith a little
help from <hi>Carthage,</hi> might have reduced them to great extremity. But his
own Citizens suffered him to languish with expectation of their promised sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,
which being still deferred from year to year, caused as great opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to be lost,<note place="margin">The promised supplies come not.</note> as a Conqueror could have desired. But whatsoever <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
thought, he was faign to apply himself to his <hi>Italian</hi> Friends, and to
feed them with Hopes, and to trifle way his time about <hi>Nola, Naples, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi>
&amp;c. being loath to weaken his Army by a hard Siege; that was to be
reserved for a vvork of more importance. Many offers he made upon <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
but always vvith bad success. Once <hi>Mercellus</hi> fought a Battel with
him there, under the Walls of the City, having the Citizens to assist
him, vvherein <hi>Hannibal</hi> lost a thousand men; which was no great
marvail; his forces being then divided, and imployed in sundry parts of
<hi>Italy</hi> at once.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>T. Sempronius Gracchus,</hi> and <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus,</hi> the late
famous <hi>Dictator,</hi> were chosen Consuls. But <hi>Fabius</hi> was detained at <hi>Rome</hi>
about matters of Religion, or Superstition rather, vvherewith the City
vvas commonly, especially in the times of danger, very much troubled,
so <hi>Gracchus</hi> alone, vvith a Consular Army, waited upon <hi>Hannibal</hi> amongst
the <hi>Campanes,</hi> not able to meet him in the Field, yet attentive to all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
that should be presented. The Slaves, that lately had been Armed,
were a great part of his followers. These and the rest of his men <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
continnally trained,<note place="margin">

skilful in the exercises of War, than in keeping it from quarrels that
might arise by their upbrading one another vvith their base condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gracchus</hi> at this time had a bickering vvith the <hi>Capuans,</hi> upon whom
he came at unawares,<note place="margin">The <hi>Capuans</hi> beaten.</note> and slew above two thousand of them, and took

               </gap>le it for fear of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that lay
not far off. By this his Providence he escaped a greater loss, than he brought
upon the <hi>Capuans:</hi> For vvhen <hi>Hannibal</hi> heard hovv things vvent, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
marched thither, hoping to find these young Souldiers and Slaves bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
in loading themselves vvith the Booty: But they were all gotten safe
into <hi>Cumae,</hi> which so angred <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that at the earnest request of the
<hi>Capuans,</hi> he assailed it the next day. Much labour, and vvith ill success he spent
about this Town.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103996:77"/>
thereby to assault it, but they vvithin built a higher Tower, vvhence they
made resistance, and found means to set <hi>Hannibals</hi> Tower on fire, and
vvhilst the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were busie in quenching the fire, they issued
out, charged them valiantly and drove them to their Trenches. The
Consul vvisely sounded a retreat in time, or <hi>Hannibal</hi> had requited them.
The day following, <hi>Hannibal</hi> presented Battel to them, but <hi>Gracchus</hi> refused
it:<note place="margin">The Siege rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> Seeing therefore no likelyhood to prevail, he raised his Siege and
departed.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Fabius,</hi> the other Consul, took the Field, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
some small Towns that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had taken, and punished the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
severely for their revolt, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Army vvas too small to
Garrison all the Towns that had yielded to them, and withall, to abide (as
it must do) strong in the Field. Wherefore <hi>Hannibal,</hi> attending the
supply from <hi>Carthage</hi> that would enable him to strike at <hi>Rome</hi> it self,
vvas driven in the mean time to alter his course of War; and instead
of making (as he had formerly done) a general invasion upon the
vvhole Country, he vvas faign to vvait upon occasions, that grevv
daily more commodious to the Enemy,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies.</note> than to him. When <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
vvas gone to Winter into <hi>Apulia, Marcellus</hi> vvasted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the <hi>Hirpines,</hi> and <hi>Samnites:</hi> the like did <hi>Fabius</hi> in <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The People of <hi>Rome</hi> vvere very intentive upon the Work they had in
hand, they continued <hi>Fabius</hi> in his Consulship, and joyned vvith him <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
Marcellus.</hi> Of these two, <hi>Fabius</hi> vvas called the <hi>Shield,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi>
the <hi>Roman Sword.</hi> The great Name of these Consuls, and the great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they made, put the <hi>Campans</hi> in fear that <hi>Capua</hi> it self should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
wherefore at their earnest request <hi>Hannibal</hi> came from <hi>Arpi,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
comforted his Friends, on a sudden he fell upon <hi>Puteoli,</hi> a Sea-town of
<hi>Campania,</hi> about vvhich he spent three days in vain, there being six thousand
in Garrison, vvherefore he left it, and marched to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> vvherein he
had great intelligence.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Hanno</hi> made a journy against <hi>Beneventum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Battel.</note> where
<hi>T. Gracchus</hi> met him. <hi>Hanno</hi> had vvith him about seventeen thousand
Foot, <hi>Brutians,</hi> and <hi>Lucans,</hi> besides twelve hundred Horse, most of them
<hi>Numidians</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi> Four hours he held the <hi>Romans</hi> vvork ere it could be
perceived to vvhich side Victory would incline. But <hi>Gracchus</hi> his Souldiers,
which were most of them Slaves, had received from him a peremptory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,
that this day or never they must purchase their Liberty, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every man an Enemies Head. The sweet reward of Liberty vvas so
desireable, that they feared no danger in earning it, though the cutting
off their Enemies Heads troubled them exceedingly, vvhich <hi>Gracchus</hi>
perceiving, proclaimed that they should cast away the Heads, assuring
them that they should have their liberty presently after the Battel, if they
wan the day. This made them run headlong upon the Enemy, vvhom their
desperate fury had soon overthrown, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse could have made their
party good against the <hi>Numidians.</hi> But though <hi>Hanno</hi> did vvhat he could, and
pressed so hard upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Battel, that four thousand of the Slaves reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to a ground of strength,<note place="margin">The <hi>Cartbagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> beaten.</note> yet was he glad at length to save himself by flight
vvith two thousand Horse, all the rest being either slain or taken. <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
performed his promise to the Slaves, making them free: only on those
four thousand, that vvent aside in the Battel, he inflicted this slight punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that as long as they served in the Wars, they should eat standing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
sickness forced them to break this order. So <hi>Gracchus</hi> vvith his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
returned into <hi>Beneventum,</hi> vvhere the newly-enfranchised Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
were Feasted in publike by the Townsmen, some sitting, some
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103996:77"/>
standing and all vvith their Heads covered, as the manner of such was,
vvith vvhite Caps. This vvas the first Battel vvorthy of note, that the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
lost since the coming of <hi>Hannibal</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Romans</hi> by degrees began to get heart, and repair their breaches,
only their Treasury was very empty, vvhereupon the People vvere called
together,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> poverty, how supplied.</note> and vvere plainly told, that in this exigent, there must be no ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of mony for Victuals, Weapons, Apparel, or other necessaries for the
Souldiers, but that they must trust the Common-vvealth with the loan of these
things till the Wars vvere ended. This vvas vvillingly assented to, and the
Armies vvere vvell supplyed both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals omitted no part of industry in
seeking to recover what had been lost.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cassiline</hi> taken by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Cassiline</hi> was besieged by <hi>Fabius,</hi>
unto whose assistance <hi>Marcellus</hi> came; The Town was well defended by a
<hi>Carthaginian</hi> Garrison for a long time, but at length, the Inhabitants grew
fearful, craved a Parlee, and agreed to deliver it up, so as all might have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to depart whither they pleased. This was consented to, yet as they were
issuing out, <hi>Marcellus</hi> seizing upon a Gate, entred with his Army and put all
to the Sword: only about fifty that had gotten out, ran to <hi>Fabius,</hi> who saved
them, and sent them to <hi>Capua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> was this while about <hi>Terentum,</hi> but after long expectation of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it delivered to him, he was faign to depart without it. So he went
to <hi>Salapia,</hi> which he intended to make his wintring place, and began to
Victual it.</p>
            <p>The new Consuls chosen at <hi>Rome,</hi> were <hi>Q. Fabius,</hi> the Son of the present
Consul, and <hi>T. Sempronius Gracchus</hi> the second time. The old <hi>Fabius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Lieutenant to his Son; and on a time when the old man came to
the Camp, his Son rode out to meet him. Eleven of the twelve <hi>Lictiors,</hi>
let him pass by on Horse-back, which was against the custom; but the Son
perceiving this, bad the last of the <hi>Lictiors</hi> to take notice of it, who thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bad old <hi>Fabius</hi> alight, and come to the Consul on Foot: the Father
cheerfully did so, saying, <hi>It was my mind, Son, to make tryal, whether
thou didst understand thy Self to be Consul. Altinius</hi> a wealthy Citizen of
<hi>Arpi,</hi> came to <hi>Fabius</hi> and offered to deliver the Town into his hands.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> hearing of it, was glad, and sent for the Wife and Children of
<hi>Altinius</hi> into his Camp, he examined them by torment, and being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of the Treason, he commanded them to be burnt, and seized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all <hi>Altinius</hi> his wealth.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arpi</hi> taken by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Fabius</hi> shortly after came to <hi>Arpi,</hi> which he
took by <hi>Scalado</hi> in a stormy Night. Five thousand of <hi>Hannibals</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
lay in the Town, and of the <hi>Arpines</hi> there were about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
These were thrust formest by the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Garrison, who sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
them, and therefore thought it no wisdom to trust them at their backs.
But after some little resistance, the <hi>Arpines</hi> gave over the sight, and Parlied
with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Arpine Pretor,</hi> going to the <hi>Roman</hi> Consul, received
his Faith for the security of the Town, wherefore they presently made head
against the Garrison, yet did the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> make stout resistance, till it
was agreed that they should pass safely, and return to <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Cliternum</hi> was taken by <hi>Sempronius Tuditanus,</hi> one of the
<hi>Roman Praetors.</hi> Also one hundred and twelve Gentlemen of <hi>Capua</hi> offered their
service to <hi>C. Fulvius,</hi> the other <hi>Praetor,</hi> only upon condition to have their goods
restored to them: which shewed that their affections were turned from <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
to the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Consentines</hi> also and the <hi>Thurines,</hi> which had yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when there was no appearance of those great succours which
were promised from <hi>Carthage,</hi> returned to their old allegiance again. Others
would have done the like,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> but that at this time <hi>Hanno</hi> met with, and slew <hi>L.

               <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the mean time had all his care about <hi>Tarentum,</hi> which if he
could take, it would be very commodious for the Landing of the supplies,
which he yet expected. Long he waited for an opportunity, and at last by
the help of his Friends within it,<note place="margin">

               </note> he one night entered at the two Gates that
were opened for him, and presently made to the Market<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>place; which the
Governour perceiving, fled to the Port, and taking Boat, got into the Citadel
that stood at the mouth of the Haven. <hi>Hannibal</hi> having gotten the spoil of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers Goods, he addressed himself against the Citadel, which
stood upon a <hi>Poninsula,</hi> and was joyned to the Town by a causway, which
was fortified with a Wall and a Ditch. Against this <hi>Hannibal</hi> raised some
works, hoping in a short time to take it, but whilst he was thus busied, there
came in a strong supply by Sea to them, which made his attempt hopeless.
The <hi>Tarentins</hi> Fleet lay in the Haven and could not go forth by reason of the
Citadel, whereby the Citizens were likely in a short time to suffer want: To
help this, <hi>Hannibal</hi> caused their Ships to be drawn up, and carried through
the streets, which were long and plain, and lanched them into the Sea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
which done, they so cut off all supplies, that the Citadel began to suffer
want.</p>
            <p>Now this while the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces grew strong, and <hi>Q. Fulvius Flaccus,</hi>
with <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> the new Consuls, prepared to besiege the great City of
<hi>Capua,</hi> having now armed twenty three Legions, though to fill them up,
they had listed many Boyes, and they made a Law for their encouragement,
that their years should go on from that time, as if they had been of lawful
age.</p>
            <p>Before the <hi>Roman</hi> Army drew near, the <hi>Capuans,</hi> through their own wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness,
began to feel want of Victuals, they sent therefore to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
him to succour them before they were closed up, and he sent <hi>Hanno</hi> with
an Army to supply their wants. <hi>Hanno</hi> appointed them a day to bring store
of carriages to convey in the provisions which he should make, but when the
day came, they brought only fourty Waggons, with a few pack-Horses.
<hi>Hanno</hi> was much vexed at it, and appointed them another day when they
should come better provided:<note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> beaten.</note> But in the mean while <hi>Q. Fulvius</hi> the Consul,
came privately to <hi>Beneventum,</hi> and having heard that <hi>Hanno</hi> was gone abroad
a Forraging, he marched all night, and by the break a day, assaulted his
Camp, which for a long time was gallantly defended, but at last, though
with great loss, he won it, in which six thousand were slain, seven thousand
taken Prisoners, besides a great Booty that <hi>Hanno</hi> had lately gotten from the
<hi>Roman</hi> Confederates. This misadventure, and the neer approach of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Consuls, made them of <hi>Capua</hi> to send a pitiful message to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
him to hasten to their relief, considering how faithful they had
been to him. <hi>Hannibal</hi> answered them with fair promises, and sent away
two thousand Horse to keep their Lands from spoil, whilst himself was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
about taking the Citadel, and some other Towns in those parts.</p>
            <p>The Consuls, fortifying <hi>Beneventum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Capua</hi> besieged by the Consuls.</note> to secure their backs, addressed
themselves to the siege of <hi>Capua.</hi> Many disasters befell the <hi>Romans</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of this great enterprise. <hi>Gracchus,</hi> a brave Souldier, and lately
twice Consul, was slain. He was honourably interred by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> some of
whose straglers had slain him, the <hi>Manumissed</hi> Slaves that served under him,
took this opportunity to go every man whither he pleased, so that it was
long ere they could be got together again. Yet the Consuls proceed in their
work. <hi>Mago</hi> and the Citizens gave them but bad welcome, sallying out,
and slaying fifteen hundred of their men.<note place="margin">The Siege rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</hi>
               </note> Neither was it long ere <hi>Hannibal</hi>
himself came, fought with them, and caused them to dislodge. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
by night and went several vvays: <hi>Fulvius,</hi> towards <hi>Cannae,</hi> and <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
into <hi>Lucania. Hannibal</hi> follovved <hi>Claudius,</hi> but could not reach him.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103996:78"/>
Yet by the way he met with one <hi>Penula,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> a stout man that had the charge of
neer sixteen thousand men, with him he fought, and slew him, and almost
all his men, scarce a thousand of them escaping. Then was <hi>Hannibal</hi> informed
that <hi>Cneus Fulvius,</hi> a <hi>Roman Praetor,</hi> was in <hi>Apulia</hi> with about eighteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men. Coming to <hi>Fulvius,</hi> so forward he was, that needs he would
have fought with him that night.<note place="margin">Another Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note> 
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> set <hi>Mago</hi> with three thousand
men in an Ambush, then offering Battel to <hi>Fulvius,</hi> he soon had him in the
Trap, whence he was glad to escape himself, leaving all, save two thousand
of his men, dead behind him.</p>
            <p>These two great blows much astonished the <hi>Romans.</hi> Yet when they had
gathered the remainders of those Armies, the Consuls fell hard again to the
Siege of <hi>Capua.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Capua</hi> besieged again.</note> At the first sitting down of the Consuls they proclaimed, that
whosoever would come out of <hi>Capua</hi> by such a day, should be pardoned, and
enjoy his estate, if not, no grace was to be expected: the <hi>Capuans</hi> relying on
their own strength, and the assistance of <hi>Hannibal</hi> rejected this offer with scorn:
And before they were wholly closed up, they sent to <hi>Hannibal</hi> requesting his
help: He gave them good words, and dismissed them. But he, thinking
that they were well able to hold out for a long time, staid to dispatch his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
before he went, by which means the Consuls had time enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench
and secure themselves.</p>
            <p>When the Consulship of <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Fulvius</hi> was expired, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in their charge of the Army as Proconsuls, and their design was to take
<hi>Capua</hi> by Famine.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> comes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them.</note> But <hi>Hannibal</hi> came before he was expected by the <hi>Romans,</hi>
and took one of their Forts, and fell upon their Camp; the <hi>Capuans</hi> also at the
same time sallyed out but were beaten in again; Yet did <hi>Claudius</hi> in pursuing
them, receive a wound, that ere long brought him to his Grave. <hi>Hannibal</hi>
followed his business better and had almost taken the Camp, yet at length was
repelled.</p>
            <p>This extreamly angred <hi>Hannibal</hi> and made him entertain a haughty resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even to set upon <hi>Rome,</hi> which accordingly he pursued, and because that
work must be done with celerity, he caused his men to provide victuals for ten
days, and so marched forward. This news coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> they sent to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
their Generals with it, wishing them to do what they judged
best for the safety of the City. And thereupon <hi>Q. Fulvius</hi> took fifteen
thousand choise Foot, and a thousand Horse, and with them hasted towards
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Hannibal</hi> drew neer, making woful havock as he went, all the streets
and Temples in <hi>Rome</hi> were filled with women,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for <hi>Rome</hi> and leaves it.</note> crying, and praying, rubbing
the Altars with their hair, the Senators were all in the Great market place,
ready to give advice upon all emergencies. But <hi>Fulvius</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> arrived
at <hi>Rome</hi> neer together. The Consuls and <hi>Fulvius</hi> encamped without the Gate
of <hi>Rome,</hi> attending <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who coming within three miles of the City,
advanced with two thousand Horse, and rode along a great way under the
Walls, viewing, and considering how he might best approach them. Yet
went he back without doing or receiving any hurt. Many tumults were at
this time raised in the City, and the multitude were so affrighted, that
they would have run out of the Gates if they could have done it with
safety.</p>
            <p>The day following <hi>Hannibal</hi> brought up his Army and presented Battel to
the <hi>Romans,</hi> who would have accepted it, had not a terrible shower of Rain
caused both the Armies to return into their Camps; and this happened two
days together, and the weather cleered up presently after. But <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
who had brought but ten days provision with him, could not stay any longer,
he therefore made all the spoil he could in the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories, passing like
a Tempest over the Country, and run towards the Eastern Sea so fast, that he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103996:79"/>
had almost taken <hi>Regium</hi> before his arrival was suspected. As for <hi>Capua</hi> he
gave it for lost, and cursed the faction of <hi>Hanno,</hi> which thus disabled him to
relieve that fair City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fulvius</hi> returned back to the Siege of <hi>Capua,</hi> which now began to suffer
want. And faign they would have sent again to <hi>Hannibal</hi> but that all ways
were intercepted. The truth is, <hi>Hannibal</hi> had already done his best, and now
began to faint under the burden of that War, wherein (as he afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested)
he was vanquished by <hi>Hanno</hi> and his Partizans in the Senate of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
rather than by any force of the <hi>Romans. Capua</hi> being novv brought to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
the multitude forced the Senators to consult about the delivering of it
up to the <hi>Romans:</hi> The bravest of the Senators foresavv what the issue vvould
be, and therefore one of them invited the rest home to Supper, telling them
that vvhen they had Feasted themselves he vvould begin to them such a health
as should for ever free them from the malice of their enemies, the <hi>Romans:</hi>
Tvventy seven of the Senators imbraced the motion,<note place="margin">Capu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>taken.</hi>
               </note> and vvhen they had Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
drank Poyson, vvhereof they died: The rest, hoping for mercy, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to discretion. So a Gate vvas opened whereat a <hi>Roman</hi> Legion entred, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
the Citizens, and made the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> Prisoners; The Senators
vvere laid in Irons; and presently after, <hi>Fulvius</hi> caused all the <hi>Campane</hi> Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to be bound to stakes,<note place="margin">The Consuls cruelty.</note> and scourged a good vvhile vvith Rods, after
which he struck off their heads. The like rigor <hi>Fulvius</hi> used to all the Towns
of the <hi>Campanians:</hi> most of the Inhabitants, with their Wives and Children
he sold for Slaves, the rest were banished; after which the Glory of <hi>Hannibal</hi>
began to shine more dim, and most of <hi>Italy</hi> by the terrible example of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puans,</hi>
had a General inclination, upon good conditions, to return to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
side.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Levinus</hi> being chosen Consuls, <hi>Levinus</hi> went into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
<hi>Marcellus</hi> was to make War vvith <hi>Hannibal:</hi> They vvere busy in raising Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but wanted mony extreamly; many ways were proposed how to supply
that want.<note place="margin">The publick wants suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> At last the Consuls said, that no perswasions would be so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
with the People, as good examples; wherefore they propounded and it
was presently resolved, that every one should bring and put into the Treasury
all the mony, Jewels, and Plate that they had, and none reserve more than
one Salt, and a Bowle wherewith to make their offerings to the Gods: as also
a Ring for himself: and some other small Ornaments for his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
and this was accordingly done by all, with much cheerfulness.</p>
            <p>Then went forth <hi>Marcellus</hi> against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whose Army was now greatly
diminished by long and hard service. His credit also amongst his <hi>Italian</hi> Friends
was much weakned by the loss of <hi>Capua:</hi> This put him upon pillaging those
Towns which he could not keep, thinking that the best way both to enrich
himself, and to preserve it from his enemies: but this farther alienated them
from him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Salapia</hi> yielded to <hi>Marcellus.</hi>
               </note> whereupon <hi>Salapia</hi> yielded to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and betrayed to him a
gallant Regiment of <hi>Numidians,</hi> the very best that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had. After this
the Consul took two Cities of the <hi>Samnites,</hi> wherein he slew above three
thousand of <hi>Hannibals</hi> men; which <hi>Hannibal</hi> could not prevent, the <hi>Romans</hi>
being grown stronger in the Field than he. But now came news that <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>
was at <hi>Carthage,</hi> with five thousand Horse, ready to set sail for <hi>Spain,</hi>
whither, when he came, he was to accompany <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
into <hi>Italy.</hi> This did not more comfort <hi>Hannibal</hi> and his followers, than
it terrified the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Hannibal</hi> was informed that <hi>Cn. Fulvius,</hi> a <hi>Roman Praetor,</hi> lay
neer to <hi>Herdonea,</hi> to get the Town by practice: <hi>Hannibal</hi> made great marches
thitherward, and when he came, offered Battel to <hi>Fulvius,</hi> who readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
it.<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> The <hi>Roman</hi> Legions made good resistance a vvhile, till they vvere
compassed round vvith the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse: then fell they to rout, and a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103996:79"/>
great slaughter was made of them; <hi>Fulvius,</hi> with twelve Collonels, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thirteen thousand were slain, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> set <hi>Herdonea</hi> on fire because it
was appointed to be delivered up to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcellus</hi> hearing this,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> hasted thither: At <hi>Venusia</hi> they met, and
fought a Battel from Morning till the Night parted them, and ended
with uncertain Victory. Many more skirmishes they had, but none of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus,</hi> and <hi>Q. Fulvius</hi> were again chosen Consuls: and
<hi>Fabius</hi> resolved to besiege <hi>Tarentum,</hi> which if he could win, like it was that
scarce any one good City would remain true to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and in the mean
time he desired <hi>Fulvius,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> with their Army, to press <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
so hard that he might have no leisure to help <hi>Tarentum. Marcellus</hi>
was glad of this opportunity, judging that no <hi>Roman</hi> was so fit to deal
with <hi>Hannibal</hi> as himself: He followed him therefore from place to place,
desiring ever to come to Battel, but upon unequal terms. <hi>Hannibal</hi> only
entertained him with skirmishes, meaning to keep his Army intire, till
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> came to him. But <hi>Marcellus</hi> was so importunate, that he could
not be rid of him, wherefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> bad his men to beat soundly this
hotspur <hi>Roman</hi> Captain of whom he could not be rid till he had let him
blood.<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> Then followed a Battel wherein <hi>Hannibal</hi> had the Victory, took
six Ensigns and slew about three thousand of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> 
               <hi>Marcellus</hi> rated
his men exceedingly, and called them cowards, which did so shame them,
that they asked pardon, and desired him to lead them forth again against the
enemy. <hi>Hannibal</hi> was angry to see that nothing would make them quiet,
and so they fought again, and though the <hi>Romans</hi> had the better of it, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very desperately, yet they lost so many men that they had little cause to
boast of the Victory: Only this advantage they had, that hereby <hi>Fabius</hi> got
time to prosecute his Siege at <hi>Tarentum</hi> without disturbance. <hi>Fulvius</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Consul this vvhile took in diverse Towns of the <hi>Hirpines, Lucans,</hi> and
<hi>Volscentes,</hi> that vvillingly rendred themselves and betrayed <hi>Hannibals</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fabius,</hi> by the Treason of a <hi>Brusian</hi> Captain in <hi>Tarentum</hi> had the Town de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
into his hands,<note place="margin">Tarentum <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>
               </note> and yet vvhen he vvas entered he put all to the Sword,
<hi>Brutians</hi> as vvell as others, vvhereby his credit vvas much impaired. All the
Riches of the Town he sought out, vvhich vvas very great, and sent it to the
Treasury at <hi>Rome</hi> vvhere there vvas much need of it. <hi>Hannibal</hi> having gotten
cleer of <hi>Marcellus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> fell upon those that besieged <hi>Caulonia,</hi> all vvhom he slew
or took Prisoners, and then he hasted to relieve <hi>Tarentum;</hi> But vvhen he came
vvithin five miles, he heard that it vvas lost. This grieved him, yet he said
no more than this, <hi>The</hi> Romans <hi>have also their</hi> Hannibal: <hi>We have lost</hi> Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
<hi>in like sort as we got it.</hi> But lest he should seem to retreat out of fear, he
encamped there four or five days, and thence departing to <hi>Metapont,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
himself how to take <hi>Fabius</hi> in a Trap. He caused the chief of <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont</hi>
to write to <hi>Fabius;</hi> offering to betray it into his hand. These letters were
sent by two young men of the City, who did thir errand so well, that the
Consul wrote back, and appointed the day when they should expect him.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> being glad of this, at leasure made ready his Ambushes for the
wary <hi>Fabius;</hi> but something hindred him from coming, and so all was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. Claudius Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>T. Quintus Crispinus</hi> were chosen Consuls,
who had a strong desire to make War upon <hi>Hannibal,</hi> assuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of Victory. <hi>Crispinus</hi> had also a desire to make his Consulship Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
by taking some good Town, as <hi>Fulvius</hi> and <hi>Fabius</hi> had done by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Capua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Loory</hi> besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and <hi>Tarentum:</hi> wherefore he went and besieged <hi>Locri,</hi>
the best City in <hi>Italy</hi> that held for the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> bringing all sorts of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103996:80"/>
to promote the work. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> was not slow to relieve the City, at
whose approach, <hi>Crispinus</hi> rose and retreated to his fellow Consul. Thither
followed <hi>Hannibal,</hi> to whom the Consuls offered Battel: He refused it, yet
dayly entertained them with Skirmishes, waiting for some advantage, and
reserved his Army to a time of greater imployment when his Brother <hi>Asdrubal</hi>
should come into <hi>Italy. Marcellus</hi> was not well pleased with this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sought to force him to fight; for which end he commanded a Navy by
Sea,<note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> and the Garrison of <hi>Tarentum</hi> again to besiege <hi>Locri:</hi> But <hi>Hannibal</hi> had
an eye behind him, and by the way, laid an Ambush for those of <hi>Tarentum,</hi>
slew three thousand of them, and made the rest to fly back into <hi>Tarentum.</hi> As
for the Consuls, <hi>Hannibals</hi> desire was to wast them by little, and little. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and them was a little Hill, overgrown with Bushes, amongst them
he hid some <hi>Numidians,</hi> willing them to attend every advantage. To this
Hill the Consuls thought fit to remove their Camp; thither therefore they
rode to view the place, taking with them the Son of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> a few Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
and other principal men, and about two hundred Horse. The <hi>Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Centinel gave warning of their approach, and the other discovered not
themselves till they had surrounded the Consuls and their Company. The
Consuls defended themselves hoping to be quickly relieved from the Camp
that was neer at hand:<note place="margin">The Consuls slain.</note> But all their Horse save four, forsook them and fled.
<hi>Marcellus</hi> was slain with a Lance; <hi>Crispinus</hi> had his deaths wound, and young
<hi>Marcellus</hi> was wounded, yet got to the Camp, the rest were all slain. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
gave an honourable Funeral to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> bestowing his ashes in a Silver
pot, covered with a Crown of Gold, and sent it to his Son to be interred where
he pleased.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Licinius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Admiral laid hard Siege to <hi>Locri,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Romans</hi> beaten.</note> wherefore <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
went thither again, but as soon as his Vant-couriers appeared, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
ran in confused heaps to their Ships, leaving all their Engins, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
was in their Camp to <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>C. Claudius Nero,</hi> and <hi>M. Livius</hi> were chosen Consuls, at which time <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi>
was already come into <hi>France,</hi> and was approaching towards <hi>Italy. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
would not stir against him, but with a considerable Army, and those of
the choisest men: and <hi>Claudius</hi> with another Army, was sent against <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</hi>
By this time news came that <hi>Asdrubal</hi> was passing the <hi>Alps,</hi> and that the
<hi>Ligurians,</hi> and those about <hi>Genoa</hi> were ready to joyn with him. When all was
ordered according to the Consuls minds, they went forth of the City, each
his several way.<note place="margin">Great fear at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> The Citizens were full of fears, there being another Son of
<hi>Amilcar</hi> come into <hi>Italy,</hi> and one that in this expedition seemed to be of more
sufficiency than <hi>Hannibal.</hi> For whereas in that long and dangerous march
through so many Barbarous Nations, over great Rivers, and Mountains, <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
had lost a great part of his Army, <hi>Asdrubal</hi> in the same Journey had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
his, descended from the <hi>Alps</hi> like a rowling Snowball, far greater than
when he came over the <hi>Pyrenes.</hi> This made the People wait upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
out a Town, like a pensive train of Mourners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Asdrubal</hi> at his first coming into <hi>Italy</hi> set upon <hi>Placentia;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Asdrubal</hi> comes into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> but there he
lost a great deal of time, and yet was faign at last to leave it, whereby he
gave the <hi>Roman</hi> Consuls leasure to make ready for him, and caused his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Hannibal</hi> to make no hast to meet him, knowing that <hi>Placentia</hi> would not
be taken in hast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nero</hi> made what speed he could to meet with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and stop him
from joyning with his Brother. He had with him fourty thousand Foot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Horse, with which he oft offered <hi>Hannibal</hi> Battel, and in diverse Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
had the better of him. At <hi>Grumentum Hannibal</hi> fought with him,
but was worsted, yet gat he off and marched away to <hi>Venusia,</hi> vvith <hi>Nero</hi> still
at his heels. Thence he vvent to <hi>Canusium,</hi> and sat dovvn there near the place
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103996:80"/>
where he had obtained his most memorable Victory. There also <hi>Nero</hi> sat
down by him, thinking it enough to hinder him from joyning with his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.
There was he advertised of <hi>Asdrubals</hi> approach by Letters that were
going to <hi>Hannibal</hi> which he intercepted: wherefore he resolved that it was
better to run some desperate adventure than to suffer them to joyn together.
He therefore took six thousand Foot and a thousand Horse, all of his choisest
men, and away he posted as fast as he could to assist his Fellow Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul.
<hi>Livy</hi> at that time lay encamped neer to <hi>Serea Gallica,</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal</hi>
within half a Mile of him. In six days <hi>Nero</hi> finished his journy thither, and
by the way his company was encreased by some voluntaries. The next day
after his coming, they consulted together, and resolved to fight the Enemy,
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> perceiving that both the Consuls were now together, and thereupon
feared that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was slain, and though before he was forward to fight,
yet now he thought it no shame to retreat farther from them. So he dislodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
secretly by Night, intending to get over the River <hi>Metaurus:</hi> but being
misled by his Guides, he had not gone far before <hi>Nero</hi> was at his heels with
all the Horse, which hindred him from going any farther, and the other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
followed with the Legions in order of Battel. <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> seeing a necessity to
fight, omitted no care, or circumspection. His <hi>Gauls</hi> he placed in the left Wing
upon a Hill, which the Enemy could not ascend without much difficulty. In
the right Wing he stood himself, with his <hi>Africans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards:</hi> His <hi>Lygu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
he placed in the midst,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> and his Elephants in the Front of the Battel. On
the <hi>Romans</hi> side <hi>Nero</hi> had the right Wing, <hi>Livius</hi> the left, and <hi>Portius</hi> led the
Battel, <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Portius</hi> found strong opposition, and with great slaughter on
both sides, prevailed little of nothing. <hi>Nero</hi> laboured much in vain against
the steep Hill, where the <hi>Gauls</hi> stood out of his reach: wherefore taking part
of his Forces, he led them round behind <hi>Livy</hi> and <hi>Portius,</hi> and charged <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
in the Flank, which made the Victory incline to the <hi>Romans:</hi> For <hi>Nero</hi>
ran all along the depth of <hi>Asdrubals</hi> Battel, and put it to rout. Of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
and <hi>Africans</hi> the greatest part were slain: the <hi>Ligurians</hi> and <hi>Gauls</hi> saved
themselves by flight: Of the Elephants only four were taken alive: the
rest were slain, most by their Riders, the Guide having in readiness a
mallet and a chissel wherewith he gave a stroak between the Ears in
the joynt next the Head, wherewith he killed the Beast upon a
sudden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Asdrubal</hi> strove with great Patience and against many difficulties, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
all the duties of a worthy General, and stout Souldier, and when he
saw the loss irreparable, he rode manfully into the thickest of the Enemies,
where fighting bravely,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Asdrubal</hi> slain.</note> he was slain. The number of the slain on both
sides is variously reported, the Camp and all the Riches in it fell into the hands
of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When it was known at <hi>Rome</hi> how <hi>Nero</hi> had left his Army, they were much
amazed and full of fears: The People filled the Market place, the Women
ran to the Temple with Vows and Prayers, and all were filled with melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
therefore the news of this Victory was intertained with exceeding joy,
as if <hi>Hannibal</hi> were already driven out of <hi>Italy. Nero</hi> returning to his Camp,
threw the Head of <hi>Asdrubal</hi> before the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and brought forth his
<hi>African</hi> Prisoners bound, sending two of them to give <hi>Hannibal</hi> notice what
had happened.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> having in this unhappy fight, lost, besides his worthy Brother,
all hope that had so long sustained him in <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires into <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.</hi>
               </note> withdrew himself into the
Country of the <hi>Brusians,</hi> and thither he caused all the <hi>Lucans,</hi> his Friends, to
remove, as likewise all that dwelt in <hi>Metapontum.</hi> For he wanted men to
defend so many places as he held, lying so far asunder. Wherefore he drew
them all into a lesser compass in the utmost cornet of <hi>Italy;</hi> it being a Country of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103996:81"/>
much fastness, and the People exceedingly devoted unto his Service. This
was in the thirteenth year after his coming into <hi>Italy;</hi> and from thence to the
eighteenth year wherein he departed, there was no memorable thing done.
For <hi>Hannibal</hi> wanted strength wherewith to make any great attempt, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
had little mind to provoke him, but thought it well that he was
quiet. This commendation is given him by the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
That making War upon a People, of all others the most Warlike,
he obtained so many Victories by his own good conduct: And that leading
an Army compounded of so many sundry Nations <hi>Africans, Spaniards, Gauls,
Carthaginians, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> which were neither in Language,
Laws,<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> Conditions, or any other thing, one like to another, yet he held
them all in such good order, that they never fell to sedition amongst
themselves, or against their General. And here we must leave him till he be
drawn into <hi>Africk</hi> by <hi>Scipio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio</hi> having conquered <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scipio <hi>comes from</hi> Spain.</note> returned home to <hi>Rome,</hi> where
he made suit for the Honour of a Triumph, which was denied him, because
he only had the place of a Proconsul:<note place="margin">Is chosen Consul.</note> Yet to make him amends, they chose
him Consul, together with <hi>P. Licinius Crassus,</hi> who being high Priest also,
might not go ar from the City, as being to attend the matters of their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition:
which made well for <hi>Scipio,</hi> who was desirous to be sent into <hi>Africk,</hi>
to trasfer the War thither. Some there were of the Senators, especially <hi>Q. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
Maximus,</hi> that opposed him therein: yet at length he obtained to have
the Isle of <hi>Sicily</hi> for his Province, with leave to pass into <hi>Africk</hi> if he found it
expedient.</p>
            <p>The Treasury at <hi>Rome</hi> being extremely exhausted, no mony was given to
<hi>Scipio,</hi> neither was he allowed to press Souldiers for his <hi>African</hi> Voyage: But
the People made up the backwardness of the Senate with their forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
For besides his <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, he had about seven thousand Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
that came to him from sundry parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> Several Towns also
furnished him, with Corn, Iron, Handmills, and all other necessaries, so
that having his Navy in readiness,<note place="margin">He goes into <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </note> he transported his Army into <hi>Sicily,</hi>
where he found, besides other Forces, two gallant Legions of old Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
that had served at <hi>Cannae.</hi> For encreasing his number of Horse, he pressed
three hundred young and rich Gentlemen of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and then discharged
them again, upon condition that they should deliver their Horse and Arms to
as many <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen whom he had brought along with him for the
same purpose.</p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Scipio</hi> imploy <hi>Laelius</hi> into <hi>Africk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sends into <hi>Africk.</hi>
               </note> rather to make discover than to
do any thing, who yet took a great Booty, and struck no little terrour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> who saw their affairs now to be upon the terms of change.
He also procured King <hi>Massanissa</hi> to revolt from the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and to joyn
with the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">And goes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> Then did <hi>Scipio</hi> embark his Army for <hi>Africk,</hi> where he
landed neer the <hi>Faire Promontory,</hi> and presently after encamped before
<hi>Utica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> at this time had no Captain of note in their City,
nor a better Army than of raw Souldiers that were levied in hast. <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi>
the Son of <hi>Gesco,</hi> that was lately chased out of <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Scipio,</hi> was
their best Man of War. But before he was ready to take the Field, <hi>Scipio</hi> had
beaten the Troop of <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse that were sent to impead his landing,
and slain <hi>Hanno</hi> their Captain; he had also sacked one of their Towns,
and taken eight thousand Prisoners, and sent them into <hi>Sicily.</hi> He took
also <hi>Salva</hi> which he fortified.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Utica</hi> besieged.</note> Then passed he to <hi>Utica</hi> and besieged it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
days with all sorts of Engines, but prevailed not. By this time <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
had gotten thirty thousand Foot, and three thousand Horse, but
all raw Souldiers, and King <hi>Syphax</hi> brought to their help fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103996:81"/>
Foot and ten thousand Horse, with which they marched bravely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who thereupon lest the Siege, and encamped upon the Shore
in a place of advantage which he strongly fortified, and Winter drawing on,
<hi>Massanissa,</hi> brought in great store of Corn, Cattel, and other Provisions to
him. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> and <hi>Syphax</hi> encamped neer unto him: their Souldiers covered
their Huts with Mats and Reeds, and dry Boughs, and being held in hand
about a treaty of Peace, they grew remiss, and careless in keeping their Guard,
which <hi>Scipio</hi> being informed of, took his opportunity in the Night to set
their Camps on fire,<note place="margin">The <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> beaten.</note> and in the confusion slew, and took Prisoners most of
them.</p>
            <p>Yet did the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> make shift to raise another Army of neer
thirty thousand, reckoning in <hi>Syphax,</hi> and his men, and four thousand
<hi>Spaniards,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And a second time.</note> Mercenaries, that were lately come to them: <hi>Scipio</hi> went
to meet them, and another Battel was fought, and the Victory easily
obtained by <hi>Scipio</hi> against those raw and untrained men. Thus <hi>Scipio</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Master of the Field, and took in divers Cities, and sent <hi>Massanissa</hi>
and <hi>Laelius</hi> after <hi>Syphax</hi> into his Kingdom, whom they beat again, took
him Prisoner, and partly by fair means, and partly by soul, became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of most of his Kingdom, which <hi>Scipio</hi> bestowed upon <hi>Massanissa.</hi>
And this was the first time that the <hi>Romans</hi> took upon them to make
Kings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were extremely dismayed, when they heard this news,
and for the calamity which had befaln their good Friend <hi>Syphax,</hi> and
when they understood that <hi>Massanissa,</hi> their immortal Enemy, had gotten
possession of his Kingdom.<note place="margin">They sue for Peace.</note> This made them send forth Ambassadours to
<hi>Scipio</hi> to make suit for Peace. When these came into <hi>Scipios</hi> presence,
they basely prostrated themselves on the ground, and kissed his Feet, and
made as unworthy a Speech, beseeching him to pass by their offences, and to
grant them Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> knew well in what a poor case <hi>Rome</hi> then was, and how unable to
defray the charge of the War if it should be continued, and therefore he
was willing to grant them Peace upon these conditions: That they should
render up all the Prisoners, and all their Renigadoes, and Slaves; That
they should withdraw their Armies out of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Gaul:</hi> That they
should not meddle with <hi>Spain,</hi> nor with any Islands betwixt <hi>Italy</hi> and
<hi>Africk:</hi> That they should deliver up all their Ships of War, save twenty:
That they should pay him a great sum of Money, with some hundred
thousand Bushels of Wheat and Barley: All these they assented to, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he granted them a Truce that they might send their Ambassadors to the
Senate of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">They dealt deceltfully<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> But the truth was, they desired only to get time till <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
might come back, in whom they reposed all their confidence: And
therefore they took occasion to pick new Quarrels with the <hi>Romans,</hi>
which they were the rather encouraged to, hearing news that <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
was already landed in <hi>Africk,</hi> by whose means they hoped either
to drive the <hi>Romans</hi> out of <hi>Africk,</hi> or to procure better tearms of
Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> departed out of <hi>Italy</hi> no less passionate then men are wont to
be,<note place="margin">Hannibal <hi>leaves</hi> Italy.</note> when they leave their own Countries to go into Exile: He looked back
to the shore, accusing both Gods and Men, and cursing his own dulness in
that he had not led his Army from <hi>Cannae,</hi> hot and bloodied as it was, to the
Walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Arriving in <hi>Africk</hi> he disembarked his Army at <hi>Leptis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Comes into <hi>Africk,</hi>
               </note> almost one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Miles from <hi>Carthage.</hi> He was ill provided of Horse, which he could
not easily transport out of <hi>Italy.</hi> From thence he passed through the
inland Country, gathering Friends by the way. <hi>Tychaeus, a Numidian</hi> Prince
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103996:82"/>
that had the best Horses, he allured to joyn with him: and one <hi>Maze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallus,</hi>
another Prince brought him a thousand Horse. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
in the mean time neglected to make those preparations that would have
secured the Victory, and yet they sent to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> requiring him without
delay to do what he could. <hi>Hannibal</hi> answered, that they were his Lords,
and therefore might dispose of him and his Army, but since he was General
of their Forces, he desired that he might have leave to make choise of his
own time. Yet to please them, he made long marches to <hi>Zama,</hi> and there
encamped.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Zama</hi> he sent forth his Scouts to learn where the <hi>Romans</hi> lay, and
what they were doing. Some of these were taken and brought to <hi>Scipio,</hi>
who shewed them all his Camp and so dismissed them. <hi>Hannibal</hi> admired at
his Generosity, and had a very great desire of an interview that he might
talk with him: and this he signified by a Messenger. <hi>Scipio</hi> imbraced the
motion and sent him word when and where he might meet with him. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the two Generals rode forth,<note place="margin">An interview of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> with each of them a Troop of Horse
till they met, and then their men were bid to stand off: Each of them had
his Enterpreter, and when they met they stood silent for a while, viewing
one the other with mutual admiration. Then began <hi>Hannibal</hi> to salute the
<hi>Roman</hi> to this effect.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hannibals</hi> Speech to</note> That it had been better for <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> if they
could have contained their ambition within the shoars of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Italy:</hi>
for that the Countries of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> were no suffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent recompence for so
many Fleets as had been lost, and so much blood as had been shed, in making
those costly purchases: But since what was past could not be recalled, he said,
<hi>That it was time for them at the length to put an end to those contentions, and
to Pray the Gods to endue them with more Wisdom for hereafter. To which
peaceable disposition his own years, and long tryal of Fortune, both good and bad,
made him inclinable: But he feared that</hi> Scipio, <hi>for want of such experiences,
would rather fix his mind upon uncertain hopes, than upon the contemplation of that
mutability, whereunto all humane affairs are subject: Yet</hi> (said he) <hi>my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
may peradventure teach thee moderation. For I am that same</hi> Hannibal <hi>that
after my Victory at</hi> Cannae, <hi>wan the greatest part of</hi> Italy, <hi>and devised what I
should do with your City of</hi> Rome <hi>which I hoped verily to have taken. Once I brought
my Army to your Walls, as thou hast since brought thine to ours of</hi> Carthage: <hi>But
see the change, I now stand here intreating thee for Peace. This may teach thee For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
instability. I fought with thy Father</hi> Scipio. <hi>He was the first</hi> Roman <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
I met with in the Field: I did then little think that the time would come when
I should have such business with his Son: and thou maist have experience of the like
in thy self, who knows how soon? what saist thou? Canst thou be content that we
leave to you</hi> Spain, <hi>and all the Islands between</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Africk? <hi>By effecting this
thou shalt have Glory enough, and the</hi> Romans <hi>may well be glad of such a bargain:
and we will be faithful in observing the Peace with you. If thou refusest this, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what an hazzard thou must run to get a little more? If thou stayest but till to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow
Night, thou must take such Fortune as the Gods shall allot. The issue of
Battels is uncertain, and oft beguiles expectation. Let us therefore without more
ado make Peace. Say not that some false-hearted Citizens of ours, dealt fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
of late in the like Treaty. Its I</hi> Hannibal <hi>that now desire Peace, which I
would never do but that I think it expedient for our Country: and judging it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

            <p>To this <hi>Scipio</hi> answered,<note place="margin">Scipio replies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> That he was not ignorant of the mutability of

Hereupon they brake off, and each returned to his own Camp, bidding
ther Souldiers to prepare for Battel,<note place="margin">They prepare to fight.</note> wherein should be decided the quarrel
between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage.</hi> The next Morning at broak of Day they issued
into the Field, each of them ordering their Men as they judged most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
After which <hi>Scipio</hi> rode up and down his Army, bidding them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what they had atchieved since they came into <hi>Africk.</hi> He told
them, that if they wan the Day, the War was at an end, and this Victory
would make them Lords of all the World, for after this, none should be able
to resist them: But if they were beaten, there was no possibility of escaping;
they must either conquer or die, or be miserable Slaves under most merciless
enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> was far the weaker in Horse and a great part of his Army were
raw Souldiers, yet his Lords of <hi>Carthage</hi> would brook no delay. He encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
therefore his men as was most furtable to their qualities. To the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries
he promised bountiful rewards. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> he threatned
with inevitable servitude if they lost the day: but especially he animated
his old fellow Souldiers by the many Victories which they had gotten over
those that far exceeded them in number. He bad them look on their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and see whether they were not by far fewer than that huge Army they
had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>laughtered at <hi>Cannae.</hi> He bad them remember that it was the Father of
this <hi>Scipio</hi> whom they had made to run away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore he intreated
them, upon whose virtue he meant wholly to repose himself, that they would
strive that day to make good their honour, and to purchase the fame of <hi>Men
Invincible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Armies drew neer, the <hi>Numidian</hi> Horse-men on both sides began
to Skirmish:<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> the Trumpets, and other Instruments sounded to Battel. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals</hi>
Elephants (which were always an uncertain kind of help) were to
break upon the <hi>Romans:</hi> But some of them ran back upon their own Horse,
which they so disordered, that <hi>Massanissa,</hi> taking the advantage, before they
could re-ally, charged them, and drave them quite out of the Field. The
rest of these Beasts, made a great spoil amongst the <hi>Roman Velites,</hi> but being
wounded, they ran back upon the right point of their own Battel, and
disordered the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Horse that were in the Wing; vvhich gave such
advantage to the <hi>Roman</hi> Horse, that charging them vvhen they vvere in
disorder, they drave them away likewise. Then did the Battels of Foot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and ran one at the other, and the Mercenaries at the first seemed to
have the better of the <hi>Romans:</hi> But at length the <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
boisterous strength. And whereas the <hi>Romans,</hi> were seconded by their
Friends, these Mercenaries received no help from those that should have second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. For the new raised <hi>Africans,</hi> when they saw the Mercenaries give back,
they retired also, which made the hired Souldiers think themselves, betrayed,
whereupon they declined the fight. The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Battel was herewith
more terrified than before, so that refusing to give way to the Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
they fell out amongst themselves, and forbore to make head against
their Enemies. Thus were many of them beaten down and slain
through their own indiscretion: And this gave the <hi>Romans</hi> such advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that they made a great slaughter both of the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and
Mercenaries, who could neither sight nor easily flie. Such as could, ran
towards <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who kept his ground and would not stir to help these
run-aways.</p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Scipio</hi> advance against <hi>Hannibal</hi> who intertained him after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
manner than ever he had been received in his Life before. All the
former days work, seemed but a Pastime in comparison of this. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
were encouraged because they had prevailed all the day before; they
were also far more in number: But <hi>Hannibals</hi> old Blades were fresh and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103996:83"/>
the better men. They fought with such obstinate resolution that no man
gave back one Foot, but rather chose to die than to lose their ground, so
that for a long time the Victory was uncertain: But the return of <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>
and <hi>Laeli is</hi> with the Horse from the pursute of the Enemies, was to
the <hi>Romans</hi> most happy and in a needful time. These upon a suddain, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Hannibal</hi> upon the Reer,<note place="margin">Hannibal <hi>beaten.</hi>
               </note> overbore them with meer violence and put them
to rout.</p>
            <p>Hannibal with a few Horse saved himself by flight,<note place="margin">He flies to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and perswades them to seek Peace.</note> and staid not till he
came to <hi>Carthage;</hi> where, coming into the Senate, he told them plainly,
that there was no other way left but to make such a Peace as could be
procured. Amongst other things it was agreed, that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
should pay to the <hi>Romans</hi> two hundred Talents a year for fifty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Which mony, when it came to be collected, there was pitious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
amonst the People, the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoak beginning to pinch them
already, that some of the Senators could not forbear Weeping; but <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
could not refrain from Laughter: For which <hi>Asdrubal Haedus</hi> (one of
<hi>Hanno</hi>'s faction) checked him, saying, that it ill becommed him to laugh,
since he had been the cause why all others did Weep. He answered, that
Laughter did not always proceed from Joy, but sometimes from indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Yet</hi> (said he) <hi>My Laughter is more seasonable, and less obsurd, than
your Tears. For you should have wept when you gave up your Ships and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
and when you bound up your hands from use of Arms without the
good leave of the</hi> Romans. <hi>This miserable condition keeps us under, and
holds us in assured servitude. But of these things you had no feeling: Now
when a little mony is wrung from you, you are very sensible of that.
God grant that the time come not, wherein you shall acknowledg,
that it was the least part of your misery for which you have shed these
Teares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the Civil administration of the City,<note place="margin">His Civil imployment.</note> gave an
overthrow or two, to the Judges which at that time bore all the sway
in <hi>Carthage,</hi> having all the lives, goods, and fame of the rest in their
power. Shortly after <hi>Hannibal</hi> was chosen <hi>Praetor,</hi> by virtue of which Office,
he was superiour to them for that year. He sent upon an occasion for one of
the Treasurers to come to him, but he proudly refused, whereupon <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
sent a Pursevant for him, and brought him in Judgment before the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
accusing not only him, but the rest of the Judges for their insolency,
and unbridled Power, withall, propounding a Law that the Judges should be
chosen from Year to Year. He found also that they had robbed the Treasury,
which caused the Taxes to be laid upon the common People, whereof he
made such plain demonstration, that they were compelled to restore with
shame what they had gotten by Knavery. This so irritated his Enemies,
who were of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faction,<note place="margin">He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </note> that they complained to the <hi>Roman</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
that the <hi>Barchine</hi> Faction grew strong again, and that <hi>Hannibal</hi> would
shortly be in Arms: For he was like a Wild Beast that could never be tamed:
that he held secret intelligence with King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who was an enemy to the
<hi>Romans, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon the Senate sent three Ambassadors to <hi>Carthage</hi> to demand <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
but he kept such good espial upon the <hi>Romans</hi> that he was informed of
their intentions, against which he was never unprepared: And therefore
when Night was come, he stole out of the City, accompanied with two
Friends whom he could trust, and having Horses in a readiness, he rode all
Night, and came to a Tower of his own by the Sea side, and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
a Ship in a readiness,<note place="margin">He flies from <hi>Carthage to Tyre.</hi>
               </note> he bad <hi>Africk,</hi> farewel, lamenting the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune

in whose worth and honour the <hi>Tyrians</hi> thought themselves to have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est because of the affinity between the Cities,<note place="margin">He goes to <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
               </note> Thence went he to <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
who was exceeding glad of his coming, intending War against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To him <hi>Hannibal</hi> gave excellent advice how he might carry on his War
against the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His counsel neglected.</note> vvith best advantage; but <hi>Antiochus</hi> hearkned more
to his Courtiers than to him, and so was shamefully beaten by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
at vvhich time he admired <hi>Hannibal</hi> as a Wise Man, yea as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
who long before had foreseen, and foretold him vvhat novv vvas come
to pass, and vvhen it vvas too late, wished that he had followed his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.
To be brief, <hi>Antiochus</hi> vvas forced by the <hi>Romans</hi> to sue for Peace,
which at last the <hi>Romans</hi> yielded to: Provided amongst other things, that
<hi>Hannibal</hi> might be delivered into their hands. <hi>Hannibal</hi> getting an incling
of this, fled to <hi>Gortina</hi> in <hi>Creet,</hi> vvhere he lived a long time very quietly,
but at length he fell into the envy of many by reason of his great wealth,
vvhereupon he filled certain great Chests vvith Lead, and deposited them
in the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> there, as if he kept the Treasure for a dead lift:
and thereupon the People, having such a Pledg as that of him, looked
less after him:<note place="margin">He flies to <hi>Prusias.</hi>
               </note> But he in the mean time stole avvay to <hi>Prusias,</hi>
King of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> having first molten his Gold, and povvered it
into some hollovv Statues of Brass, vvhich he carried avvay vvith
him.</p>
            <p>Shortly after there fell a War betvveen <hi>Prusias,</hi> and <hi>Eumenes,</hi> King of
<hi>Pergamus, Prusias</hi> being encouraged to break his League and to make War
upon him, by his considence in <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whom he had their to manage
his War for him. The War therefore grew hot betwixt them, both by
Land and Sea. But <hi>Eumenes,</hi> by the assistance of the <hi>Romans,</hi> overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Prusias</hi> in both: And whereas <hi>Prusias</hi> was but weak of himself, <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
procured him the assistance of some other Kings and States, and those
of very Warlike Nations: and amongst them the aid of <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
who sent him <hi>Philocles</hi> his General, with a very considerable Army to
help him.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Prusias</hi> had received an overthrow from <hi>Eumenes</hi> by Land, he
sought to try his Fortune by Sea, wherein yet he was too weak for him:
wherefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> advised him to try whether he could not do that by
Policy, which by plain force he was not able to effect. He put therefore a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of all sorts of Serpents into Earthen Pitchers, to be hurled aboard the
Enemies Ships when they were in sight: giving order to the Souldiers and
Sea-men to set all upon the Ship wherein <hi>Eumenes</hi> himself was, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves from the rest as vvell as they could: and that he might
the more certainly know in vvhich Ship <hi>Eumenes</hi> was, he sent an Herauld
beforehand with a Letter, containing nothing but a meer flout to <hi>Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi>
and full of abuses to his Person. Whenas therefore <hi>Prus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>is</hi> his men
came to it, they fought neither against great nor small, but only against the
Ship wherein <hi>Eumenes</hi> was, whereupon he was faign to seek his safety by
flight; yet had he perished had he not trust in upon the next shore, where he
had placed, for a relief upon all occasions, a company of his men.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Eumenes</hi> his other Ships, when they pressed hard upon the Enemy,
they let flie amongst them their Earthern Pitchers full of Snakes, which at
first Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>med to them a ridiculous thing: but when the Pitchers, falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Deeks, brake in pieces, out flew the Snakes, so that they could stir
no where in the Ships by reason of the Serpents, whereby they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
no less annoied by their stings, than with the Arrows of their Enemies,
which caused them to give over fighting, and to flie to their Camp which
was upon the Shoar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:103996:84"/>
Thus <hi>Hannibal</hi> by this trick, got the better of <hi>Eumenes</hi> in that fight.
Nor then only, but also in sundry other encounters; and by one Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
or other, he ever put <hi>Eumenes</hi> to the worst. And once when he
advised <hi>Prusias</hi> to fight, and he durst not, because the entrails of the Beast
(said he) forbid me. <hi>What</hi> (said <hi>Hannibal) will you rely more upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
piece of flesh in a Calf, than upon the Judgment of an old experienced Captain
in the Field?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as soon as news of these things came to the Senate at <hi>Rome,</hi> they
sent <hi>T. Quintius Flaminius</hi> Ambassador to <hi>Prusias,</hi> not so much to withdraw
him from prosecuting the War against <hi>Eumenes,</hi> as to intreat him to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to them <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the most spiteful Enemy they had in all the
World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prusias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Who betrays him.</note> to gratifie the <hi>Romans</hi> resolved either to kill <hi>Hannibal,</hi> or to
deliver him alive into the hands of <hi>Flaminius,</hi> for which end he sent a
Troop of Souldiers to inviron the lodging where <hi>Hannibal</hi> lay. But <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
having before found cause to suspect the faith of <hi>Prusias,</hi> had
made some secret sallies under ground to save himself from any Treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
or sudden assault. But finding now that all passages were shut up
against him, he had recourse to his last remedy, which he was constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to put in practice as well to frustrate his Enemies from their Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
over him, as to save himself from their torture and merciless
hands, who, as he well knew, would neither respect his famous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises,
his Honour, nor his Age. When therefore he saw no other way
of escaping he took the Poyson, which he always had in readiness for
such an exigent, and being ready to swallow it down, he uttered these
Words.<note place="margin">His last Speech.</note> 
               <hi>I will now</hi> (said he) <hi>deliver the</hi> Romans <hi>from that fear which
hath so long possessed them: that fear which makes them impatient of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the Death of an Old Man. This Victory of</hi> Flaminius <hi>over me,
which am disarmed, and betrayed into his hands, shall never be numbred
in the rest of his Heroical deeds. No: it shall make it manifest to all the
Nations of the World, how far the Antient</hi> Roman <hi>Virtue is degenerated,
and corrupted. For such was the Nobleness of their Fore-fathers, as when
King</hi> Pyrrhus <hi>invaded them in</hi> Italy, <hi>and was ready to give them Battel
at their own Doors, they gave him intelligence of the Treason intended
against him by Poyson: whenas these of a latter race, have imployed</hi> Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,
<hi>a Man who heretofore had been one of their Consuls, to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
with</hi> Prusias, <hi>contrary to the honour of a King, contrary to his
Faith given for my safety, and contrary to the Laws of Hospitality, to slay,
or deliver up his own Guest.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He Poysons himself.</note> Then drank he off that Poyson, and
died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P. Scipio Africanus</hi> in a discourse which he had with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> asked
him, which of all the famous Captains that ever lived, he judged
most Worthy? <hi>Hannibal</hi> gave to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, the first place:
to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the second: and the third he challenged to himself. But
<hi>Scipio,</hi> who thought his own Title better, than that it ought to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
asked yet further, <hi>What then wouldest thou have said,</hi> Hannibal,
<hi>if thou hadst vanquished me?</hi> The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> replied, <hi>Then would I not
have given the first place to</hi> Alexander, <hi>but have claimed it as due unto
my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the conditions of Peace granted by the <hi>Romdns</hi> to the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi>
were reported to the Citizens, they were very unpleasing,
whereupon one <hi>Gesco,</hi> stood up to speak against them, perswading
the People not to yield to such intollerable demands: But <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
observing what favourable audience was given to this vain Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
by the unquiet, yet unwarlike Multitude, he was bold to pull
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103996:84"/>
him down from his standing by plain force: Hereat all the People mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured,
as if their common liberty were too much wronged by such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
of this presumptuous Captain: Which <hi>Hannibal</hi> perceiving, rose
up and spake unto them, saying; That they ought to pardon him if he
had done otherwise than the customs of the City would allow, for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

much as he had been thence absent ever since he was a Boy of nine
years old, until he was now a Man of five and forty. Having thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
himself, he exhorted them to embrace the Peace, as wanting abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

at which time the unruly Souldiers, breaking into his House, plundered him
of all that he had. This matter had many days of hearing before it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
in which time <hi>Pompey</hi> shewed so much courage, and prudence in
managing of it, that he wan such credit, and favour by it, that <hi>Antistius,</hi>
vvho at that time was <hi>Praetor,</hi> and Judg of the cause, fell into such a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him, that secretly he offered him his Daughter in Marriage, and
<hi>Pompey</hi> liked so well of the Match, that the Parties were privately
made sure each to other: And not long after, through the care, and
pains of <hi>Antistius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And cleered.</note> when the Judges came to pass Sentence, <hi>Pompey</hi> was
cleered.</p>
            <p>This business being over,<note place="margin">His marriage.</note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> married <hi>Antistia:</hi> after which going into
<hi>Cinna</hi>'s Camp, he was wrongfully accused of some misdemeanours; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being afraid of the Tyrant, he secretly stole away; and when he could
not be found in <hi>Cinna</hi>'s Camp, there went a rumour abroad that <hi>Cinna</hi>
had murthered him, which so irritated some, vvho of a long time had
hated <hi>Cinna,</hi> that upon this occasion, they rose up against him: But he
thinking to save himself by flight, was pursued by a Captain with a drawn
Sword; <hi>Cinna</hi> seeing him, fell down on his knees to him, and profered him
his Signet Ring, vvhich vvas of great price, to spare his life: <hi>Tush</hi> (said
the Captain) <hi>I come not to seal any Covenant, but to be revenged upon a Villain,
and cruel Tyrant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cinna</hi> slain.</note> and vvithall ran him through and slevv him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cinna</hi> being thus dispatched,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carbo</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</note> 
               <hi>Carbo</hi> took upon him the Govenment, a
more cruel Tyrant than the former: And after him, <hi>Sylla</hi> succeeded; and
at this time the <hi>Romans,</hi> being grievously oppressed by one Tyrant after
another, thought themselves happy in the change of Governours. For
their City vvas brought into such misery, as hoping no more to see
<hi>Rome</hi> recover her lost liberty, they desired yet a more tollerable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sylla</hi>'s time,<note place="margin">And <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> vvas at a place in <hi>Italy</hi> called <hi>Picenum,</hi> in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Anconae,</hi> vvhere he had certain Lands, but much more the love
and favour of the Citizens for his Fathers sake. He seeing that the most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Men of <hi>Rome</hi> forsook their Houses, and estates to repair to the Camp of <hi>Sylla,</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:103996:86"/>
as unto a place of safety, he also resolved to go thither, yet not in a base
manner, like a Fugitive, but purposed to raise an Army, and to go in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
manner as one that could do <hi>Sylla</hi> good service. So he made tryal
of the good will of the <hi>Picentines,</hi> who readily joyned with him, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there was amongst them one <hi>Vindius,</hi> who opposed <hi>Pompey,</hi> saying, <hi>That
a Boy that came from School but the other day, must now in hast be a Captain,</hi> the
rest of the Citizens were so incensed against him, that they ran upon him and
slew him.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> being but twenty three years old, not tarrying for Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from any man, took upon himself Authority, and causing a Tribunal to
be set up in the midst of the Market place of <hi>Auximum,</hi> a great, and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
City, he commanded the two Brethren, called the <hi>Ventidians</hi> (the
chiefest men of the City, but his Enemies) presently to avoid the City:
Then began he to leavy men to constitute Captains, Lieutenants, Sergeants,
and such other Officers as appertain to an Army. And from thence he went
to the other neighbouring Cities, where he did the like, so that in a short space
he had gotten three compleat Legions together,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> raised an Army.</note> as also Ammunition, Carts,
and all other necessaries for them.</p>
            <p>In this sort did <hi>Pompey</hi> advance towards <hi>Sylla;</hi>
               <note place="margin">He goes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </note> not in hast, as a man that
was afraid to be met with by the way, but by small Journeys, lodging still
where he might have the best advantage against an Enemy, causing the Cities
wheresoever he came to declare against <hi>Carbo,</hi> and for <hi>Sylla.</hi> Yet three
Captains who adhered to <hi>Carbo, Carinna, Caelius,</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> did in three
several places compass him in on every side, thinking to have destroyed him.
<hi>Pompey</hi> was nothing amazed hereat,<note place="margin">His danger by the way.</note> but marshalling his Army, he first set
upon <hi>Brutus,</hi> having placed his Horsemen (amongst whom himself was in
Person) before the Battel of his Footmen, and when the Men at Arms of his
Enemy (who were <hi>Gauls</hi>) came to charge upon him, he singled out the
chiefest amongst them, and ran him through with his Spear, and
slew him.<note place="margin">His Victories.</note> The other <hi>Gauls</hi> seeing their Champion slain, turned their backs,
and in their flight, over ran their own Footmen; so that at last they all fled for
their lives.</p>
            <p>Then the Cities round about, being terrified with this overthrow, came
in and yielded themselves to <hi>Pompey:</hi> Afterwards <hi>Scipio</hi> also the Consul,
coming against <hi>Pompey</hi> to fight him, when the Battels were ready to joyn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they threw their Darts, <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Souldiers saluted <hi>Pompey,</hi> and went over
to his side, whereupon <hi>Scipio</hi> was faign to fly. And lastly <hi>Carbo</hi> himself send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
divers Troops of Horse against him by the Riuer <hi>Arsis, Pompey</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them so furiously, and drave them into such a place of disadvantage,
that being neither able to fight nor fly, they delivered up themselves with their
Horses, Arms, and all to his mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylla</hi> all this while heard nothing of these overthrows which <hi>Pompey</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to his Enemies, but understanding his danger, being environed with so
many Arms, fearing lest he should miscarry, he made hast, and marched to
his relief.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> being informed of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s approach, commanded his Captains to
Arm themselves and to set their Army in good array, that their General <hi>Sylla</hi>
might see how bravely they were appointed. For he expected that <hi>Sylla</hi>
would do him great honour, as indeed he did, even beyond his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For when <hi>Sylla</hi> saw him afar off,<note place="margin">He meets <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </note> coming towards him, and his
Army marshelled in such good order of Battel, and his men so bravely advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
themselves, being elated with their late Victories, he allighted from his
Horse; and when <hi>Pompey</hi> came to do his duty to him, and called him Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
or Soveraign Prince, <hi>Sylla</hi> resaluted him with the same Title, which made
all that were present to wonder that he would give so honourable a name
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103996:86"/>
to so young a man as <hi>Pompey</hi> was,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> honours him.</note> who as yet was not made a Senator: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
also that <hi>Sylla</hi> himself did now contend for that Title, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with <hi>Marius,</hi> and <hi>Scipio.</hi> The intertainment also that <hi>Sylla</hi> gave him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
was every way answerable to the first kindness that he shewed him.
For when <hi>Pompey</hi> at any time came to him, he would rise up, and put off his
Cap to him, which he did not to any other Noble Man that was about him:
Yet was not <hi>Pompey</hi> puffed up with all this, nor the prouder for it.</p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Sylla</hi> would have sent <hi>Pompey</hi> into <hi>Gaul</hi> (now <hi>France</hi>) because
that <hi>Metellus,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General there, was thought to have done no
exploit worthy of so great an Army as he had with him: But <hi>Pompey</hi>
answered, that there was no reason to displace an ancient Captain that
was of greater fame,<note place="margin">His Modesty.</note> and experience then himself, <hi>Yet</hi> (said he) <hi>if Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus
himself be contented, and will desire it of me, I will willingingly go, and
help him to end this War. Metellus</hi> being informed hereof, wrote for him to
come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mpey</hi> then entering <hi>Gaul,</hi> did of himself wonderful exploits, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
the courage,<note place="margin">His acts in <hi>Gaul.</hi>
               </note> and valour of old <hi>Metellus,</hi> that the War prospered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
in their Hands: But these were but <hi>Pompey</hi>'s first beginnings, and
were wholly obscured by the luster of those many Wars, and great Battels
which he fought afterwards.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Sylla</hi> had overcome all <hi>Italy,</hi> and was proclaimed <hi>Dictator,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
all the great Captains, and Lieutenants that had taken his part, and
advanced them to honourable places, and Dignities in the Commonwealth,
freely granting whatsoever they requested of him; But for <hi>Pompey,</hi> highly
esteeming him for his Valour, and thinking that he would be a great support
to him in all his Wars, he sought by some means to ally him to himself, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella,</hi>
his Wife being also of the same opinion, they both perswaded him to
put away his Wife <hi>Antistia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His second marriage.</note> and to marry <hi>Aemilia,</hi> who was Daughter to
<hi>Metella</hi> by a former Husband, though she was married to another, and now
with child by him.<note place="margin">Tyrannical proceedings.</note> These marriages were wicked, and Tyrannical, fitter
for <hi>Sylla</hi>'s time, than agreeable to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s nature, and condition. And
truly it was a shameful thing for <hi>Pompey</hi> to forsake his Wife <hi>Antistia,</hi> who for
his sake, a little before had lost her Father, that was murthered in the very
Senate House upon suspition that he took part with <hi>Sylla</hi> for his Son <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
sake: and to take <hi>Aemilia</hi> from her lawful Husband, by whom she was
great vvith child, and to vvhom she had been married not long before:
vvhich also caused the Mother of <hi>Antistia</hi> to lay violent hands upon her self,
seeing her Daughter to receive such open and notorious wrong. But God
who hates such injustice, and cruelty, followed <hi>Pompey</hi> vvith this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that his Wife <hi>Aemilia</hi> died miserably presently after in childbirth in
his House.</p>
            <p>About this time news was brought to <hi>Sylla,</hi> that <hi>Perpenna</hi> was gotten into
<hi>Sicily,</hi> and had brought all that Island into subjection to him, where he might
safely intertain all <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Enemies: That <hi>Carbo</hi> also kept the Seas thereabouts
with a certain number of Ships: That <hi>Domitius</hi> was gone into <hi>Africk,</hi> to whom
resorted many other Noblemen who were escaped from the proscriptions and
outlaries of <hi>Sylla.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against all these was <hi>Pompey</hi> sent by his Father in Law with a great Army,<note place="margin">He is sent into <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </note>
who no sooner was arrived in <hi>Sicily</hi> but <hi>Perpenna</hi> fled, and left the Island to him.
Then did <hi>Pompey</hi> deal friendly and favourably with all the Citizens vvhich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had endured great troubles and misery,<note place="margin">And conquer<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it.</note> and set them again at liberty, the
<hi>Mamertines</hi> only excepted, who dwelt in <hi>Messina:</hi> they despising his jurisdiction
and Government, pleaded the ancient priviledges of the <hi>Romans</hi> which had been
formerly granted unto them.<note place="margin">His cruelty.</note> But <hi>Pompey</hi> ansvvered them angerly, <hi>What do you
prating to us of your Law that have our Swords by our sides?</hi> He dealt also too cruelly
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103996:87"/>
vvith <hi>Carbo</hi> in his misery; for he might have killed him in hot blood when he
first fell into his hands with less blame: But <hi>Pompey,</hi> when he was taken, caused
him to be brought before him, though he had been thrice Consul, and to be
publickly examined, sitting himself in his Tribunal, and condemned him to dye
in the presence of them all, to the great distast, and offence of all that were
present: Yet he bad them take him away to execution, which was done
accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> dealt as cruelly also with <hi>Quintus Valerius,</hi> a man of rare parts, and
excellent Learning, who being brought to <hi>Pompey,</hi> he took him aside, and
walked a few turns with him, and when he had learned what he could of him,
he commanded his Guard to take him away and dispatch him. <hi>Pompey</hi> indeed
was compelled to make away all <hi>Sylla</hi>'s enemies that fell into his hands: But
for the rest, all that he could suffer secretly to steal away, he willingly conniv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at it, and would not take notice of it, yea, himself did help many to save
themselves by flight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> had determined to have taken sharp revenge of the City of the
<hi>Himerians,</hi> who had stoutly taken the enemies part: But <hi>Sthenes,</hi> one of
the Governours of the City, craved audience of <hi>Pompey,</hi> told him boldly,
that he should do great injustice if he should pardon him, who was the only
offender, and destroyed them who were not guilty. <hi>Pompey</hi> then asking
him who he was that durst take upon himself the offence of them all?
<hi>Sthenes</hi> answered, <hi>That it was himself who had perswaded his Friends, and
compelled his enemies to do what was done: Pompey</hi> being much pleased to hear
the frank speech, and boldness of the man, he forgave both him, and all the
Citizens.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Pompey</hi> being informed that his Soldiers did kill divers in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
he caused all their Swords to be sealed up,<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> and whose seal soever was
broken, he punished them soundly for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> being busy about these matters in <hi>Sicily,</hi> he received instructions,
and a Commission from <hi>Sylla,</hi> and the Senate at <hi>Rome,</hi> to depart thence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
into <hi>Africk,</hi> with all his power to make War against <hi>Domitius,</hi> who
had a very great Army. <hi>Pompey</hi> accordingly speedily prepared to take the Seas,
leaving <hi>Memmius,</hi> his Sisters Husband, to Govern <hi>Sicily,</hi> and so imbarking in
sixscore Gallies and eight hundred other Ships,<note place="margin">He passes into <hi>Africk.</hi>
               </note> wherein he transported his
Victuals, Ammunition, Money, Engines for Battery, and all other his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
provision, he hoised Sail, and Landed one part of his Army at <hi>Utica,</hi> and
the other at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and presently after his landing, there came to him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thousand Soldiers from his enemies to take his part, besides seven whole
Legions that he brought with him.</p>
            <p>Against him came <hi>Domitius</hi> with his Army in Battel array; but before
him there was a Quagmire,<note place="margin">His great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories there.</note> that ran with a very swift stream, very hard
to get over; Besides, it had rained exceedingly all that morning, so that
<hi>Domitius</hi> judging it impossible then to fight, bad his men truss up and
be gone, <hi>Pompey</hi> on the other side, spying this advantage, caused his
men to advance, and coming upon the enemy, who was now out of order,
had a cheap Victory over them, wherein he slew about seventeen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of them, whereupon he was by his Souldiers saluted with the name
<hi>Imperator,</hi> or Emperour, but he told them he would not accept of that
honourable Title, so long as he saw his enemies Camp yet standing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they ran presently and assaulted it, and took it by force, and slew <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
therein.</p>
            <p>After this overthrow, all the Cities in that Country, came and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and those that refused were taken by force. They took also
King <hi>Jarbas,</hi> who had sided with <hi>Domitius,</hi> and gave his Kingdom to <hi>Heimpsal.</hi>
But <hi>Pompey</hi> being desirous further to imploy his Army, he went many days
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103996:87"/>
Journey into the main Land, conquering all wheresoever he came, making
the power of the <hi>Romans</hi> dreadful to those Barbarous Nations, who before
made small account of them. He caused also the Wild Beasts of <hi>Africk</hi> to feel
his force, bestowing some days in Hunting of Lyons, and Elephants: And in
fourty days he conquered his enemies, subdued <hi>Africk,</hi> and setled the affaires
of the Kings, and Kingdoms of that part of the Country, being then but twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four years old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> being returned to <hi>Utica,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> he received Letters from <hi>Sylla,</hi> willing
him to discharge his Army, and to retain only one Legion with himself till
the coming of another Captain that was to succeed him in the Government of
that Country. This grieved him not a little, though he made no shew of it
at all: But the Souldiers were much offended at it, and when <hi>Pompey</hi> prayed
them to depart, they gave out broad speeches against <hi>Sylla,</hi> and told him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
that they were resolved not to leave him whatsoever became of them,
and that they would not leave him to trust to a Tyrant.<note place="margin">His Souldiers love to him.</note> 
               <hi>Pompey,</hi> seeing that
he could not prevail with them, rose out of his seat, and went into his Tent
weeping: But the Souldiers followed him, and brought him again to his Chair
of State, intreating him to remain there, and command them, and he desired
them to obey <hi>Sylla,</hi> and to leave their mutinies. In fine, he seeing they were
resolved to press him, swore that he would kill himself rather then they should
compel him, yet scarce did they leave him thus.</p>
            <p>Hereupon it was reported to <hi>Sylla</hi> that <hi>Pompey</hi> was rebelled against him;
which when he heard, he said to his Friends, <hi>Well, I see then that it is my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny
in my old age to fight with Children.</hi> This he said, because of <hi>Marius</hi> the
younger, who had done him much mischief, and had greatly endangered
him.<note place="margin">His return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> But afterwards, understanding the truth, and hearing that all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in <hi>Rome</hi> would go to meet <hi>Pompey,</hi> and receive him with all the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
they could, he resolved to go beyond them all in shew of good will:
wherefore going out of his House to meet him, he embraced him with
great affection,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> honours him.</note> and welcomed him home, calling him <hi>Magnus,</hi> that
is Great, and commanded all that were present to give him that Name
also.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Pompey</hi> required the honour of a Triumph, which <hi>Sylla</hi> opposed,
affirming that this honour should be granted to none but to such as had been
Consuls, or at least <hi>Praetors:</hi> He told him also, that if he should stand for it
he would oppose him. <hi>Pompey</hi> was not discouraged herewith, but boldly
told him, <hi>That all men did honour, not the setting, but the rising Sun. Sylla</hi>
heard not well what he said, and therefore enquired, and when it was told
him, he wondred at the confidence of so young a man, and cryed out twice,
<hi>Let him then Triumph on Gods Name.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His first Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</note> Yet many were offended at it, but
<hi>Pompey</hi> to anger them more, would be brought in his Triumphant Chariot
drawn by four Elephants, many of which Beasts he had taken from the Kings,
and Princes whom he had subdued: Howbeit the City Gates being to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for them, he was faign to leave his Elephants, and to be drawn in with
Horses.</p>
            <p>Now his Souldiers that had not all they looked for, nor that was promised
to them, sought to hinder his Triumph, which being reported to him, he
said. <hi>That he would rather lose all his preparations, than be forced to flatter them:</hi>
He might have been made a Senator if he had sought after it, but in that he
did not,<note place="margin">

                  </gap> him,</note> being so young, it pleased the People exceedingly, especially when
after his Triumph they saw him still amongst the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights: On the
other side <hi>Sylla</hi> was much vexed to see him come so fast forward, and so soon
to rise to so great credit: yet being ashamed to hinder him, he suppressed it,
till <hi>Pompey,</hi> contrary to his mind, brought in <hi>Lepidus</hi> to be Consul, through
the good will of the People that furthered his desire. Hereupon <hi>Sylla</hi> seeing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103996:88"/>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> returning cross the Market place after the election,<note place="margin">The People love him.</note> with a great train
of followers, he said to him, <hi>O young man! I see thou art glad of this Victory,
and so thou hast cause: for questionless its a brave thing that through the favour of
the People thou hast brought in</hi> Lepidus (<hi>the vilest person of all other) to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
before</hi> Catulus <hi>the honestest man in the City: But let me advise thee to
look well to thy self, for thou hast advanced one that will be a dangerous enemy to
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylla</hi> also discovered his ill will to <hi>Pompey,</hi> in that when he made his
Will, he gave Legacies to every one of his Friends, and left <hi>Pompey</hi> wholly
out:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sylla's</hi> Death.</note> yet did <hi>Pompey</hi> take it well enough, and whereas <hi>Lepidus,</hi> with some
others, after <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Death, would have kept his Body from being Buried in
the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> and from Funeral solemnities, <hi>Pompey</hi> prevailed to bury him
honourably.</p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Death, his Prophecy to <hi>Pompey</hi> concerning <hi>Lepidus</hi>
proved true; For <hi>Lepidus</hi> openly usurping the power which <hi>Sylla</hi> had, raised
an Army of those of <hi>Marius</hi> his faction, whom <hi>Sylla</hi> had hitherto suppressed,
which put <hi>Pompey</hi> upon his best skill,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompeys</hi> Wars with <hi>Lepidus.</hi>
               </note> and experience; For which end he
presently took part with the Nobility, and the honester part of the People,
by whom he was imployed to raise an Army against <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
the greatest part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and by the help of <hi>Brutus,</hi> kept <hi>Gaul</hi> on
this side the Mountains: the rest, <hi>Pompey</hi> easily subjected to himself,
only he was somewhat long in besieging <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Modena.</hi> During which
time, <hi>Lepidus</hi> brought his Army to the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> demanding his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Consulship, which much affrighted the People: But they were soon
comforted by a Letter which <hi>Pompey</hi> sent, wherein he informed them that he
had ended his Wars without bloodshed. For <hi>Brutus</hi> had yielded himself to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
who had slain him.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, <hi>Lepidus</hi> was driven out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Sardinia,</hi> where he fell
sick, and died. At this time <hi>Sertorius</hi> was in <hi>Spain,</hi> who kept the <hi>Romans</hi> in
great awe, being a valiant Captain, and one to whom all the Fugitives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted.
He had already overthrown many inferiour Captains, and was now
grapling with <hi>Metellus Pius,</hi> who in his youth had been a Noble Souldier, but
now being old, and too wary, he neglected many opportunities, which <hi>Serto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
by his dexterity took out of his hands.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Pompey</hi> keeping his Army together, endeavoured, by the help
of his Friends, to be sent into <hi>Spain,</hi> as an assistant to <hi>Metellus:</hi> and at last,
by the endeavour of <hi>Lucius Philippicus,</hi> he obtained the Government of that
Country.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pompey</hi> was arrived in <hi>Spain, Sertorius</hi> gave out bitter jeers against
him,<note place="margin">He goes into <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> saying, <hi>That he would use no other weapons against the young Boy but
Rods:</hi> and that, <hi>if he were not afraid of the old woman,</hi> meaning <hi>Metellus,
much less was he afraid of him.</hi> Yet for all these brags, he stood better upon
his guard, and went stronger to fight than he did before, being afraid of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</hi>
In this War the success was very various, yet nothing grieved <hi>Pompey</hi>
more than <hi>Sertorius</hi> his winning the City <hi>Lauron.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Wars there.</note> Yet shortly after in a
set Battel, near the City of <hi>Valentia,</hi> he slew <hi>Herennius,</hi> and <hi>Perpena,</hi> both
Gallant Souldiers, and Lieutenants to <hi>Sertorius,</hi> with ten thousand of their
men. This Victory so encouraged <hi>Pompey,</hi> that he hasted to fight with <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius</hi>
himself before <hi>Metellus</hi> came to him, that he might have the sole Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Conquest. So they both met by the River of <hi>Sucron</hi> in the evening,
both fearing the comming of <hi>Metellus,</hi> the one that he might fight alone, the
other that he might fight with one alone. But when it came to trial, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
fell out doubtful, for either of their wings had the upper hand: <hi>Sertorius</hi>
wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> great honour in this Battel, bearing all before him wheresoever he
went: and <hi>Pompey</hi> encountering a great man at Armes, cut off one of his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103996:88"/>
hands, yet he escaped by turning up his Horse with very rich caparisons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s followers, and whilst they were contending about the Horse,
he escaped.</p>
            <p>The next morning very early, both the Generals brought their Armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into the Field, to confirm the Victory, which either of them supposed
that he had gotten: But <hi>Metellus,</hi> coming to <hi>Pompey</hi> at that present, <hi>Sertorius</hi>
retreated, and dispersed his Army. <hi>Pompey</hi> going to meet <hi>Metellus;</hi> when
they came near, he commanded his Sergeants, and Officers to put down their
bundles of Rods, and Axes which they carried before him, to honour <hi>Metellus</hi>
the more, being a better man than himself: But <hi>Metellus</hi> would not suffer it,
but in every thing made <hi>Pompey</hi> his equal, only when they Camped together,
<hi>Metellus</hi> gave the watch word to all the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sertorius</hi> with a running Army, cut them short of Victuals, spoiling the
Country, and keeping the Sea-side, so that they were forced to divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and to go into other places for Provision. <hi>Pompey</hi> in the mean time
having spent most of his estate in this War, sent to <hi>Rome</hi> for mony to pay his
Souldiers, threatning that if they would send him no money, he would return
with his Army into <hi>Italy. Lucullus</hi> being now Consul, though he was <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
enemy, yet procured the money for him, that himself might the better
prevail to be sent against King <hi>Methridates:</hi> For he feared that if <hi>Pompey</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into <hi>Italy,</hi> he would procure to have that imployment.</p>
            <p>In the men time <hi>Sertorius</hi> died, and <hi>Perpenna,</hi> who was chiefest man
about him, supplied his room. But though he had the same Army, the same
means, and the same power, yet had he not the same wit, and skill to use
it. <hi>Pompey</hi> therefore marching directly against him, quickly discovered his
insufficiency, and laid a bait for him, sending ten Troops to prey in the
Fields, commanding them to disperse themselves abroad, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they did, and <hi>Perpenna,</hi> took the opportunity, and charged upon them,
and had them in chase, but <hi>Pompey</hi> tarrying for them at a Foord, was ready
with his Army in good order,<note place="margin">His Victory.</note> gave them Battel, and obtained the Victory,
and thus ended all the War: For most of the Captains were slain, and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penna</hi>
himself taken Prisoner, whom he presently put to Death. <hi>Perpenna</hi>
shewed to <hi>Pompey</hi> Letters from the greatest Noblemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were
desirous of change of Government, willing him to return into <hi>Italy.</hi> But <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
fearing that they might occasion great commotions in <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> put <hi>Perpenna</hi>
presently to Death, and burned all the writings, not so much as reading any
one of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> after this,<note place="margin">His return into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> remained in <hi>Spain</hi> till he had pacified all tumults,
and then went with his Army back into <hi>Italy,</hi> and arrived just when
the War of the Bondmen and Fencers, led by <hi>Spartacus,</hi> was in the
greatest fury. Upon <hi>Pompey</hi>'s coming, <hi>Crassus</hi> being sent General against
them, made hast to give them Battel, wherein he overcame them and
slew twelve thousand and three hundred of these fugitive Slaves. Yet
Fortune intending to give <hi>Pompey</hi> some part of the honour,<note place="margin">His Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> five thousand
of these Bondmen, who escaped from the Battel, fell into his hands,
whom he overcame, and wrote to the Senate at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Perpenna</hi> had
overcome the Fencers in Battel, and that he had plucked up this War by
the roots. The <hi>Romans</hi> receiving these Letters, were very glad of the news
for the love which they bore to him. Yet for all the great honour and
love they did bear to him, they suspected, and were afraid of him, because
he did not disband his Army, fearing that he would follow <hi>Sylla</hi>'s steps,
and rule over them by force: Hereupon as many went forth to meet him
out of fear, as out of good will. But when he told them, that he would
disband his Army so soon as he had Triumphed, then his ill-willers could
blame him for nothing, but that he inclined more to the People than to the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103996:89"/>
Nobles; and because he desired to restore the Tribuneship to the People, which
<hi>Sylla</hi> had put down.</p>
            <p>Indeed the common People at <hi>Rome</hi> never longed for any thing more than
they did to see the Office of the Tribunes set up again:<note place="margin">His favour with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> and <hi>Pompey</hi> was
very glad that he had such an opportunity, thereby to ingratiate himself with
them, and to requite the love which they had shewed to him. This was the
second Triumph, and the first Consulship which the Senate decreed to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
which made him neither the greater, nor the better man, Yet was it
such an honour, as <hi>Crassus</hi> (the richest, greatest, and eloquentest man in <hi>Rome</hi>)
durst not demand before he had requested <hi>Pompey</hi>'s good will therein: And
truely <hi>Pompey</hi> was very glad of the request, having of a long time sought an
opportunity whereby to gratifie him, and therefore he made earnest suit to
the People for him, assuring them that he would as much thank them for
making <hi>Crassus</hi> his fellow-consul, and Colleage, as he would for making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Consul.</p>
            <p>Yet when <hi>Pompey</hi> had obtained his request, and they were both created
Consuls, they were in all things contrary one to the other, and never agreed
in any one thing whilst they ruled together: <hi>Crassus</hi> had the more authority
with the Senate, and <hi>Pompey</hi> with the People: for he restored to them the
Office of Tribunes, and passed by Edict, that the Knights of <hi>Rome</hi> should have
power again to Judge in causes both civil and criminal. This wonderfully
pleased the people, when himself came in Person to the Censors, and pray'd
that he might be dispensed with for going into the Wars.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Gellius</hi> and <hi>Lentulus</hi> were the Censors, who being honourably
set in their Tribunal seats, taking a view of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights that muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before them, they marvelled when they saw <hi>Pompey</hi> comming, with all
the Ensigns of a Consul born before him, and himself (as other Knights did)
leading his Horse by the Bridle: and when he came near, he commanded
the Sergeants that carried the Axes before him, to make room for him to pass
by the Barrs with his Horse, where the Censors sate. This made the People
to flock about him, wondring and rejoycing with great silence: the Censors
themselves also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>were marvellous glad to see him so obedient to the Law,<note place="margin">His Humility,</note>
and did him great reverence. Then did the elder of the Censors examine
him thus; <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, <hi>I pray thee tell me, if thous didst serve so long in
the War as the Law doth appoint? Pompey</hi> answered aloud, Yes verily have I
done, and that under no Captain but my self. The People hearing this, shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
aloud for joy, and the Censors themselves came down from their seats, and
accompanied <hi>Pompey</hi> to his House, to please the great multitude that followed
him, clapping their hands for joy.</p>
            <p>At the end of their Consulship, grudges growing higher between <hi>Crassus,</hi>
and <hi>Pompey,</hi> there was one <hi>Gaius Aurelius,</hi> a Knight, who till then had never
spoken in the publick Assembly: He getting up into the Pulpit for Orations,
told the People openly, that that night <hi>Jupiter</hi> had appeared to him, and
commanded him to tell both the Consuls from him, that they should not
leave their Office before they were reconciled together: Yet for all this <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
stirred not: But <hi>Crassus</hi> took him by the hand, and spake thus before the
People; <hi>My Lords! I think it no dishonour to me to give place to</hi> Pompey, <hi>sith
you your selves have thought him worthy to be called</hi> the Great, <hi>befor he had any hair
on his face, and to whom you granted the honour of two Triumphs before he came to be
a Senator.</hi> Having thus spoken, they were reconciled together, and so gave
up thier Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crassus</hi> after this, retired to his former manner of life, and <hi>Pompey,</hi> as much
as he could, avoided pleading mens causes in publick, and by degrees with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
himself from frequenting the Market-place, and came seldom abroad,
but when he did,<note place="margin">His Pride.</note> he had always a great train following him. It was a rare
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103996:89"/>
thing to see him to be familiar with any one, or to come abroad but with a
great company of attendants.</p>
            <p>The power of the Pirats upon the Seas began in <hi>Cilicia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The power of the Pirats.</note> of which at first
there was no great account made, till they grew bold and venturous in King
<hi>Methridates</hi> Wars, being hired to serve him: and when the <hi>Romans</hi> engaged
in Civil Wars at home, they neglected looking after them, which made
them more audacious. For they did not only rob and spoil all Merchants by
Sea, but plundred Islands, and Citics upon the Sea-coast, insomuch as men
of great Nobility, and Wealth joyned with them, and they set up store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses
in divers places, and had Beacons to give warning by fire all along the
Sea-coasts, which were well watched: they had also great Fleets of Ships well
furnished, with excellent Galliots, skilful Pilots, and Marriners: their Ships
were swift of Sail, and Pinnaces for discovery. All the Sea-coast over there
was musick, singing, and rioting amongst them: Prizes were daily brought
in, Persons of quality taken prisoners, and put to great ransom. Their Ships
were a thousand in number, and they had taken four hundred Towns. They
had spoiled and destroyed many Temples that had never heen profained before.
They had many strange Sacrifices and Ceremonies of Religion amongst them,
and besides all other insolences and injuries whcih they did the <hi>Romans</hi> by Sea,
they often went on Land, and Plundred and destroyed their Country Houses;
and once they took two <hi>Roman Praetors</hi> in their Purple Robes, with their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants
and Officers, and carried them quite away. At another time they sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
the Daughter of <hi>Antonius</hi> (a man that had the honour of a Triumph)
as she was vvalking in the Fields, and put her to a great ransom. And further
to dispite the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they had taken any of them, and they told them
that they were Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> they would cloath them like <hi>Romans,</hi>
and putting out the Ship-ladder they vvould bid them be gon to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and if they refused they vvould throw them overboard, and drown
them.</p>
            <p>These Pirats had all the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas at their command, that a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
durst scarce look out, or traffick any whether. This moved the <hi>Romans</hi>
(fearing a famine by their means) to send <hi>Pompey</hi> to recove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Dominion<note place="margin">Pompey sent against them.</note>
of the Seas from them. The first man that moved that <hi>Pompey</hi> might not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be made Admiral at Sea, but have absolute power to command all Persons
whatsoever without giving any account of his doings, was <hi>Gabinius, Pompey</hi>'s
Friend:<note place="margin">His large Commssion.</note> which was done accordingly, and absolute authority was given unto
him, not only of the Seas, but for the space of four hundred Furlongs from
the Sea, within which compass were many great Nations, and mighty Kings.
It gave him power also to choose out of the Senate fifteen Lieutenants, and to
give to every one of them several Provinces in charge, and also to take mony
out of the Treasury to defray the charges of a Fleet of two hundred Sail, with
full power besides to leavy what men of War he thought good, and as many
Galliots, and Marriners as he pleased.</p>
            <p>This Law was confirmed by the People. Yet the Nobility, and chief Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
thought that this authority did exceed, not only all envy, but that it
gave them apparent cause of fear to give such unlimited power to a single Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
whereupon they were all against it but <hi>Caesar,</hi> who promoted it, not so
much to favour <hi>Pompey,</hi> as to ingratiate himself with the People, But the
Noblemen fell out with <hi>Pompey,</hi> and one of the Consuls was very hot with
him, told him that he sought to follow <hi>Romulus</hi> his steps, but peradventure
he would come short of that end he made: This so provoked the People that
they had thought to have killed him: But <hi>Catulus,</hi> a worthy man, spake also
against this Edict, yet spake much in the praise of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and in conclusion,
advised the People not to adventure a man of so great account in such danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Wars; <hi>For</hi> (said he) <hi>if you chance to lose him, whom have ye then to put in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103996:90"/>
his place?</hi> The People cryed out, <hi>Your self.</hi> After this, seeing how the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were bent, he spake on more.</p>
            <p>Next after him <hi>Rosoius</hi> would have perswaded them to have sent another
with <hi>Pompey</hi> as his Colleague, but the People made such an outcry against
him, that a Crow flying over the Market place fell to the ground. Upon
the day when the Decree was to be fully passed,<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> went forth of the
City, and when he understood that it was confirmed, he returned the same
Night privately, to avoid the envy they would have born him if the People
should have flocked in multitudes to have waited on him home.</p>
            <p>The next morning he came abroad, and Sacrificed to the Gods, and audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
being given him in a publick meeting, he so handled the matter that
they much inlarged his power, almost doubling the preparations, which
were at first Decreed to him. For it was ordained that he should have five
hundred Ships, one hundred and twenty thousand Footmen, and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horsemen. He chose also twenty four Senators, all of them having been
Generals of Armies, and two General Treasurers. Whilest these things were
preparing, the price of Victuals fell, which rejoyced the People much, and
they said openly, that the very Name of <hi>Pompey</hi> had almost ended the War
already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> divided all the Sea into thirteen Divisions, and in each of them he
appointed a certain number of Ships, and a Lieutenant over each of them:
and by thus dispersing his Navy all abroad, he brought all the Pirats Ships that
were in a Fleet within his danger,<note place="margin">His Victories over the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats.</note> and when he had taken them, he brought
them all into an Harbour. But such of them as could escape, fled into <hi>Cilicia,</hi>
as the surest place of retreat: These <hi>Pompey</hi> would needs follow in his own
Person with sixty of his best Ships: Yet went he not till he had scowred the
<hi>Tuscan</hi> Seas, with the coast of <hi>Libia, Sardinia, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Corsica,</hi> of all
those Thieves that had wont to keep thereabouts, and this he did within
the space of forty Days, taking infinite pains, both himself and his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Piso,</hi> one of the Consuls, did all he could to hinder <hi>Pompey</hi>'s preparations,
and supplies O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>men, out of envy to his prosperity. <hi>Pompey</hi> being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of it,<note place="margin">He comes pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> sent his Ships to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> himself in the mean time passing
through <hi>Tuscany</hi> came to <hi>Rome;</hi> where so soon as his coming was known, the
People ran out to meet him, as if he had been a long time absent; and that
which made them more joyful was, that now Victuals came in freely out of
all parts, the Seas being cleared from Pirates. <hi>Pompey</hi> could have had <hi>Piso</hi> put
out of his Consulship, but would not. So having setled all things in quiet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his desire,<note place="margin">His return to his Navy.</note> he hasted to his Navy at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and hoising Sail,
passed to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he landed and Sacrificed to the Gods, and so returned
to his Ships. At his going out of the City there were two Writings in his praise
affixed to the Gate. That within was this,
<q>
                  <l>The humbler that thou dost thy self as Man behave,</l>
                  <l>The more thou dost deserve the Name of God to have.</l>
               </q>
That on the outside of the Gate was this,
<q>
                  <l>We wisht for thee, we wait for thee,</l>
                  <l>We worship thee, we wait on thee.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Pompey</hi> having taken many of these Pirots, upon their submission spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their lives, which so encouraged the rest, that flying from his Captains,
and Lieutenants,<note place="margin">His Clemency, and Wisdom.</note> they came and delivered up themselves with their Wives
and Children into his hands. <hi>Pompey</hi> pardoned all that thus came to him,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103996:90"/>
and by that means came to have knowledg of the rest, whom he pursued, and
in the end took. The most and richest of them had convaied their Wives,
Children and goods into strong Castles and Towns upon Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> and
they that were fit for service, imbarked, and lay before a City of <hi>Corasesium,</hi>
where they tarried for <hi>Pompey,</hi> and gave him Battel by Sea, and after endured
a Siege by Land: Yet after a while, they besought him to receive them to
mercy, yielding themselves, their Towns, and Islands, which they had
strongly fortified, into his hands. Thus was this War ended, and
all the Pirats, within less than three Months space, driven out of the
Seas.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> won also a great number of Ships, and ninety Gallies armed with
Copper Spurs. As for those whom he had taken (who were in number
about twenty thousand lusty Men and good Souldiers) he would not put
them to Death, but planted them in inland Countries in certain small Towns
of the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> that were scarce inhabited, who were very glad of them and
gave them Lands to maintain them: and whereas the City of the <hi>Solians</hi> had
not long before been destroyed by <hi>Tygranes,</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> he replenished
it again by placing many of them there. He bestowed others of them in the
City of <hi>Dyma</hi> in the Country of <hi>Achaia,</hi> which lacked Inhabitants, and had
great store of good Land belonging to it, though many of his Enemies great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
blamed him for it.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Pompey</hi> was chosen General against the Pirats, young <hi>Metellus</hi> was
sent <hi>Praetor</hi> into <hi>Creet,</hi> who finding it to be a Den of these Thieves, he took
many of them, and put them to Death: the rest that escaped, being straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
besieged by him, sent unto <hi>Pompey,</hi> craving pardon, and desiring him to
receive them to mercy: <hi>Pompey</hi> accordingly pardoned them, and wrote to
<hi>Metellus,</hi> requiring him to give over that War, commanding the Cities also
that they should not obey <hi>Metellus.</hi> He sent also <hi>Lucius Octavius,</hi> one of his
Lieutenants, who entered into the Towns besieged by <hi>Metellus,</hi> and sought
against him in the behalf of the Pirats.<note place="margin">His Envy.</note> This act of <hi>Pompey</hi> procured him much
ill will, for that he fought for the common Enemies of the World, who
had neither God nor Law, and that only to deprive a <hi>Roman Praetor</hi> of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
who had done such good service against them. Yet <hi>Metellus</hi> left not
off his Wars for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Letters, but having taken the Pirats, he put them to
Death.</p>
            <p>When the news came to <hi>Rome</hi> that the Piratick War was ended, and that
<hi>Pompey</hi> had no more to do, but to go from City to City to visit them, one
<hi>Manlius</hi> a Tribune of the People, brought in another Law, that <hi>Pompey,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Army from <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and all the Provinces under his Government,
with all <hi>Bythinia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged.</note> which <hi>Glabrio</hi> kept, should go and War upon <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and
<hi>Methridates;</hi> and yet reserve in his hands all his jurisdiction, and Army by Sea
in as royal a manner as he had it before, which was to make him an absolute
Monarch over all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. The Senate stuck not so much at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
offered to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> depriving him of the honour of his doings, and giving
it to another, but that which most grived them was, to see <hi>Pompey</hi>'s power
established into a plain Tyranny: Hereupon they encouraged one another to
oppose it to the uttermost: yet when the day came for the passing of this Law,
they all drew back for fear of angring the People, and none durst oppose it:
Only <hi>Catulus</hi> inveied against it a long time together: But say what he could,
the Decree passed by the voices of the Tribes. And thus was <hi>Pompey</hi> in his
absence, made Lord of all that which <hi>Sylla,</hi> with much effusion of blood had
attained to with great difficulty.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pompey</hi> by Letters from <hi>Rome</hi> was informed what Law the People
had past in his behalf, he seemed to be much grieved that such great Offices,
and charges should be laid upon him one in the neck of another, and clapping
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103996:91"/>
his hands on his Thigh,<note place="margin">His Dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> he said, <hi>O Gods! shall I never see an end of these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?
Had it not been better for me to have been a mean Man, and unknown, than
thus continually to be ingaged in War? What! shall I never see the time, that
breaking the neck of spite, and envy against me, I may yet once in my life live qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
at hone in my Country with my Wife and Children.</hi> His Friends that were
about him were much displeased with this his deep dissimulation, knowing
that his ambitious desire to rule, made him glad at heart to be thus imployed,
the rather because of the contention between him and <hi>Lucullus,</hi> which his deeds
forthwith discovered.</p>
            <p>Hereupon he sent forth his Preceps into all quarters, requiring all Souldiers
immediately to repare to him,<note place="margin">His Pride.</note> and caused all the Kings, and Princes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his jurisdiction to attend him, and so, going through all the Countries, he
changed all that <hi>Lucullus</hi> had before established, He also released the penalties
that were imposed upon them, and took from them all the favours that <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
had granted them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucullus</hi> finding himself so hardly dealt with, Friends on both sides media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a meeting betwixt them, that they might talk together, and accordingly
they met in <hi>Galatia,</hi> having their Sergeants, and Officers with Rods wreath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about vvith Lawrel carried before them, vvhich shevved that <hi>Pompey</hi> came
to take <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s honour from him. Indeed <hi>Lucullus</hi> had been Consul before
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and was the older man, yet <hi>Pompey</hi> exceeded him in dignity having
Triumphed twice. At their first meeting they discoursed very courteously, each
commending the others deeds, and each rejoycing at the others good success:
but at parting they fell to hot words; <hi>Pompey</hi> upbraiding <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and <hi>Lucullus Pompey</hi>'s ambition, so that their Friends had much ado to
part them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucullus</hi> when he was gone, divided the Lands in <hi>Galatia</hi> which he had
conquered,<note place="margin">He crosses <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus.</hi>
               </note> and bestowed other gifts upon them. <hi>Pompey</hi> on the other side,
camping hard by him, commanded the People every where not to obey him:
He took his Souldiers also from him, leaving him only sixteen hundred, choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
out such as he thought would do him small service. He blemished his
Glory also, telling every one that <hi>Lucullus</hi> had fought only with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
and pomp of those two Kings, and that he had left him to fight with all
their force, and power. <hi>Lucullus</hi> on the other side said, that <hi>Pompey</hi> went on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to fight with such as himself had subdued, and that he sought the honour
of Triumph over <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> as he had formerly practised to Triumph
for overcoming a few Slaves and Fugitives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucullus</hi> being now gone, <hi>Pompey</hi> sent strong Garrisons into all the Sea
coast from <hi>Phoenicia</hi> to the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> and then marched towards <hi>Methri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
who had in his Camp thirty thousand Footmen, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horsemen, yet durst he not fight, but encamped upon an high
Mountain till he was forced to leave it for lack of Water. He was no
sooner gone but <hi>Pompey</hi> seized upon the place,<note place="margin">His Wars with <hi>Methridates.</hi>
               </note> and setting his Souldiers
to dig, he found Water enough for all his Army. Then he encamped
round about <hi>Methridates</hi> besieging him in his own Camp: <hi>Methrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
endured it forty five days, and then slaying all the sick and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
in his Camp, with the choise of his Army he escaped by
Night.</p>
            <p>Another time <hi>Pompey</hi> found him by the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and lodged hard
by him: <hi>Methridates</hi> prepared, suspecting that <hi>Pompey</hi> would that Night
storm his Camp; but <hi>Pompey</hi> thought it not safe to fight in the dark, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
resolved rather to encompass him that he might not fly, and to fight him
in the morning: but <hi>Pompey</hi>'s old Captains would needs fight presently,
which <hi>Pompey</hi> at last consented to, and the <hi>Romans</hi> ran upon them with
great cries, which so affrighted their Enemies, that they presently turned their
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103996:91"/>
backs and fled, so that the <hi>Romans</hi> slew ten thousand of them, and took their
Camp. <hi>Methridates</hi> himself with eight hundred Horse-men, made a Lane
through the <hi>Romans</hi> and so escaped: Yet as soon as they were passed, his men
dispersed, some one way, some another, that himself was left but with three
Persons only, whereof <hi>Hypsicratea,</hi> a manlike woman was one, who never
left him, but always looked to his Horse, being armed after the <hi>Persian</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
till he came to a strong Castle called <hi>Inora,</hi> where was store of Gold, and
Silver, and the Kings chiefest Treasure. Here <hi>Methridates</hi> divided all his
richest Apparel amongst his Friends, and to each of them a mortal Poyson to
carry about them, whereby they might prevent falling into their Enemies
hands alive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> built a City in the place where he gained this Victory betwixt the
Rivers of <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He build<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a City.</note> and <hi>Araxes,</hi> situate in <hi>Armenia</hi> the Less, which he called
<hi>Nicopolis.</hi> This City he gave by the consent of his Souldiers, to such of them
as were old, lame, sick, wounded, or disbanded: to whom many of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
afterwards repairing, the <hi>Nicopolitans</hi> lived after the manner of the
<hi>Cappadocians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence <hi>Methridates</hi> had intended to have gone into <hi>Armenia,</hi> but King
<hi>Tigranes</hi> prohibited it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Methridates</hi> flight.</note> and promised an hundred Tallents to him that could
kill him: Passing therefore by the head of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> he fled through the
Country of <hi>Colchide:</hi> In the mean time <hi>Pompey</hi> invaded <hi>Armenia,</hi> being soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
thereto by <hi>Tigranes</hi> the younger, who rebelled against his Father, and
met <hi>Pompey</hi> at the River of <hi>Araxes,</hi> which falleth into the <hi>Caspian Sea.</hi> Then
did <hi>Pompey</hi> and he march forward, taking in such Towns as yielded unto them.
<hi>Tigranes,</hi> who had been much weakned by <hi>Lucullus,</hi> understanding that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
was of a mild and Gentle nature, he put his Souldiers into Garrisons, and
himself with his Friends, and Kinsman went to meet <hi>Pompey.</hi> When he
came near his Camp, being on Horseback, there came two Sergeants to him
commanding him to alight, which he did accordingly, and put off his Sword
and gave it them,<note place="margin">Base flattery.</note> and when he came before <hi>Pompey</hi> he shamefully fell upon
the ground, and imbraced his knees; but <hi>Pompey</hi> took him by the hand, rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him up, and made him sit down by him on the one side, and his Son on
the other, saying to them both, <hi>As for your former losses you may thank</hi> Lucullus
<hi>for them, who hath taken from you</hi> Syria, Phoenicia, Cilicia, Galatia, <hi>and</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phena,
<hi>but for what you have left till my coming, you shall enjoy it, paying to the</hi>
Romans <hi>six thousand Tallents, for the wrong you have done them: Provided also
that your Son shall have</hi> Sophena <hi>for his part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tigranes</hi> accepted of the conditions, whereupon the <hi>Romans</hi> saluted him
King, and he gave great sums of money amongst the Army: But his Son was
much discontented, and when <hi>Pompey</hi> sent for him to come to Sup with him,
he refused, wherefore <hi>Pompey</hi> imprisoned him, and kept him to be led in his
Triumph at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Phraates,</hi> King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> sent Ambassadors to desire this
young Prince who was his Son in Law, and to tell <hi>Pompey</hi> that <hi>Euphrates</hi> must
be the uttermost bounds of his Conquest. <hi>Pompey</hi> answered, that <hi>Tygranes</hi>
had more right to his Son than <hi>Phraates,</hi> and as for limiting his borders, he
would do it with Justice. So leaving <hi>Afranius</hi> to keep <hi>Armenia,</hi> he passed by
other Nations that inhabited about the Mountain of <hi>Caucasus,</hi> having <hi>Methri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
in chase. Two of the chiefest of these Nations were the <hi>Iberians,</hi> and
the <hi>Albanians,</hi> near to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. These, upon his request, suffered
him to pass through their Countries. But Winter hasting on apace, these
Barbarous People raised an Army of fourty thousand fighting men, and passed
over the River of <hi>Cyrnus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His War with the <hi>Albanians.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> could have hindred their passage, but yet let
them come over, and then fought with them, and overcame them, and slew
multitudes of them in the Field, whereupon they submitted, and made peace
with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:103996:92"/>
Then <hi>Pompey</hi> went against the <hi>Iberians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And <hi>Illyrians.</hi>
               </note> who took part with <hi>Methridates.</hi>
They were more and better Souldiers than the <hi>Albanians:</hi> they were never
subject to the <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> nor to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great. These <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
overcame also in a bloody fight, and slew nine thousand of them, and
took ten thousand Prisoners. From thence he went into the Country of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chide,</hi>
where <hi>Servilius</hi> met him by the River of <hi>Phasis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> with his Fleet with
which he kept the <hi>Pontick</hi> Sea: He found it a hard work to pursue <hi>Methridates</hi>
any further, who had hid himself amongst a People that bordered upon the
Lake of <hi>Maeotis.</hi> He heard also that the <hi>Albanians</hi> had rebelled, wherefore he
went back to be revenged on them, passing over the River of <hi>Cyrnus</hi> again,
yet with much difficulty, because the Barbarous People had made a defence
on the further side, by felling, and laying many Trees across all along the
Bank of the River: and when he was got over, he was to travel through a
dry Country a great way before he came to any Water, whereupon he caused
ten thousand Goats skins to be filled with Water, and so marched over it. At
the River <hi>Abas</hi> he met with his Enemies, who had now an Army of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty thousand Footmen, and ten thousand Horsemen, but Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only in Beast skins. There General was <hi>Cosis,</hi> the Kings Brother. In the
Battel this <hi>Cosis</hi> flew upon <hi>Pompey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Valour.</note> and throwing a Dart at him, wounded him
in the flank; but <hi>Pompey</hi> ran him through with a Lance and slew him. Some
say that some <hi>Amazons</hi> assisted this People against <hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Battel <hi>Pompey</hi> going back to invade the Country of <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> as
far as the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea,<note place="margin">Serpents drive him back.</note> was forced to retreat by reason of an infinite number
of deadly Serpents that he met withal, wherefore he went back into <hi>Armenia</hi>
the less, to which place he had many rich presents sent him from the Kings of
the <hi>Elymians,</hi> and the <hi>Medes,</hi> to whom he returned courteous answers. Yet
he sent <hi>Afranius</hi> with part of his Army, against the King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> who had
much harrased and plundred the Country of <hi>Tygranes,</hi> and he drave him
out.</p>
            <p>At this time the Concubines of <hi>Methridates</hi> were brought to him, but he
would not touch any one of them,<note place="margin">His Chastity.</note> but sent them all home again to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and Friends, being most of them the Daughters of Princes, and other
Noble Captains, Only <hi>Stratonice</hi> whom <hi>Methridates</hi> loved above all the rest,
with whom he had left the custody of his Castle where lay all his Treasures of
Gold and Silver, was but a Singers Daughter. She delivered the Castle into
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s hands,<note place="margin">His self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal.</note> and besides, offered him rich and goodly presents, all which
he refused, saving such as might serve to adorn the Temples of the Gods, and
that might beautifie his Triumph, leaving the rest to <hi>Stratonice</hi> to dispose of
as she pleased. The King also of the <hi>Iberians</hi> sent him a Bedstead, Table, and
Chair, all of pure Gold, praying him to accept it as a token of his love, he
delivered them into the Treasurers hands to be accountable for them to the
State.</p>
            <p>From hence <hi>Pompey</hi> went to the City of <hi>Amisus,</hi> where he did such things
as he had before condemned in <hi>Lucullus,</hi> taking upon him to establish Laws,
to give Gifts, and to distribute such honours, as Victorious Generals used
to do when they had ended all their Wars. And this he did to gratifie
twelve Barbarous Kings, and Princes, and Captains that came to him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Writing also to the King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> he gave him not that Title which
others used to do, who stiled him <hi>King of Kings.</hi> He had also a wonderful
desire to win <hi>Syria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Ambition.</note> and to pass through <hi>Arabia</hi> even to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> that he
might enlarge his Victories every way, even to the Great Ocean. As he
did when he conquered <hi>Lybia,</hi> and in <hi>Spain</hi> had enlarged the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to
the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea; and in pursuit of the <hi>Albanians</hi> he went almost to the
<hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>As he passed on towards the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> he commanded his Souldiers, with
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103996:92"/>
a sufficient number of Ships to wait for the Merchants that sailed to <hi>Bosphorus;</hi>
and to seize upon the Victuals, and other Merchandize that they carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and so passing on with the greatest part of his Army, he came to the
place where he found the Bodies of the <hi>Romans</hi> that were slain by <hi>Methridates</hi>
under their Captain <hi>Trierius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Charity.</note> which he caused to be honourably buried,
which thing <hi>Lucullus</hi> had neglected to do, which made his Souldiers
hate him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> having now by <hi>Afranius</hi> conquered the <hi>Albanians</hi> dwelling about
Mount <hi>Amanus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His acts in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and <hi>Judaea.</hi>
               </note> he marched into <hi>Syria,</hi> and conquered it, making it a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Province: He conquered also all <hi>Judaea,</hi> where he took King <hi>Aristobulus:</hi>
He built certain Cities there, and delivered others from bondage, sharply pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the Tyrants in them. He also spent much of his time there, in deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
controversies, and in pacifying the contentions which fell out betwixt
free Cities, Princes, and Kings. And truly if <hi>Pompey</hi>'s fame, and renown
was great, so was his Vertue, Justice, and Liberality, which covered many
faults which his familiar Friends about him did commit. For he was of such
a gentle nature, that he could neither keep them from offending, nor punish
them when they had offended.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Pompey</hi> was in <hi>Judaea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey's</hi> acts in <hi>Judaea.</hi>
               </note> being angry with <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> he marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> (the Brother of <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> who contended with him
for the Kingdom) provoking him thereunto. <hi>Pompey</hi> understanding that
<hi>Aristobulus</hi> was fled into <hi>Alexandrion,</hi> a strong and stately Castle, seated upon
a high Hill, he sent and summoned him to come unto him, and <hi>Aristobulus</hi>
being advised not to make War against the <hi>Romans,</hi> he came to <hi>Pompey:</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had debated his Title to the Kingdom, with his Brother <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> by
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s permission he retired into the Castle again. This he did two or three
times, always flattering <hi>Pompey</hi> out of hope to prevail in his suit. Yet
<hi>Pompey</hi> required that he should deliver up his Castles into his hands, which
he was fain to do, though he was much discontentedat it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he went to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with a purpose to prepare for War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> not thinking it fit to give him any time for preparation, followed
him immediately,<note place="margin">He comes to <hi>Jericho.</hi>
               </note> and first encamped at <hi>Jericho,</hi> where were most excellent
Dates, and Balsom, the most precious of all other Ointments, and from
thence he marched towards <hi>Jerusalem. Aristobulus</hi> repenting what he had
done, came and met him, promising him mony, and that he would yield
up, both himself and the City in a peacable way. <hi>Pompey</hi> pardoned him,
and sent <hi>Gabinius</hi> with a party of Souldiers to receive the mony: Yet were
they faign to return without it: for <hi>Aristobulus</hi>'s Souldiers would not stand
to what he had promised. <hi>Pompey</hi> being much provoked hereby
committed <hi>Aristobulus</hi> into custody,<note place="margin">He marches to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               </note> and presently marched against <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Citizens being at this time divided amongst themselves, they
that stood for <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> were willing to open the Gates to <hi>Pompey:</hi> But
the faction of <hi>Aristobulus</hi> refused, and prepared for War, becausey <hi>Pompey</hi>
kept their King Prisoner: and accordingly they seized upon the Temple,
and cut down the Bridg which led into the City. <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> and his Friends,
let in the Army, and delivered over to them, both the City, and the
Kings Pallace, the custody of both which, <hi>Pompey</hi> committed to <hi>Piso,</hi>
who fortified the Houses and buildings that were neer the Temple, first
offering to the Besieged conditions of Peace, and when they refused, he
prepared to give a General assault, being assisted by <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> with all things
needful.</p>
            <p>On the North side of the City <hi>Pompey</hi> encamped, which was the easiest to
be assaulted: yet were there high Towers, and a deep Ditch made with
hands,<note place="margin">The Temple besieged.</note> besides a deep Valley which begirt the Temple, and towards the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103996:93"/>
the place was very steep when the Bridg was taken away. To overcome
these difficulties, the <hi>Romans</hi> raised Mounts, cutting down Trees round about,
and filling up the Trench with materials which the Souldies brought. This
work proved very difficult, considering the vast depth of the Trench, and the
resistance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> made from above. But when <hi>Pompey</hi> observed that the
<hi>Jews</hi> rested every seventh Day (for though they would defend themselves
from an assailing Enemy, yet they held it unlawful on that day to hinder any
work that the Enemy did) he chose those Days especially wherein to
carry on his work: So that in time the Trench was filled, and the Tower fitted
upon the Mount, and the Engins planted, which shot huge Stones wherewith
they battered the Temple, yet was it long before those strong and stately
Towers yielded to the assaults of the Besiegers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> being much tired, <hi>Pompey</hi> wondered at the obstinacy of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> especially considering that all this while they never intermitted their
daily Sacrifices, which the Priests every Morning and Evening offered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Altar, not omitting the same in their greatest extremities. In the
third month of the Siege, the greatest Tower, being shaken by the battering
Rams, at last fell, and brake down a great piece of the Wall, at which breach
many of the <hi>Romans</hi> rushed into the Temple.<note place="margin">The Temple taken.</note> These running up and down,
while some of the <hi>Jews</hi> sought to hide themselves, and others made small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
slew them all. Many of the Priests, though they saw the Enemies
rushing in with their drawn Swords, yet being nothing at all dismai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
continued their Sacrifices and were slain at the very Altar, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
the duty which they owed to their Religion before their own
lives.</p>
            <p>All places were full of slaughters. Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> were slain by the
<hi>Romans,</hi> others by their own Countrymen that were of the contrary faction.
Many threw themselves down headlong from the Rocks:<note place="margin">The <hi>Jews</hi> slain.</note> others setting their
Houses on fire, burnt themselves, not enduring to behold those things that
were done by the Enemy. Here fell twelve thousand of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whereas of
the <hi>Romans</hi> there were but few slain, though many wounded. Amongst the
Captives that were taken, was <hi>Absolon,</hi> the Uncle and Father in Law of <hi>Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
the Son of <hi>John Hyrcanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the same day and in the same month was the Temple taken by <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>

as it had been taken by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> five hundred and forty three years
before: and it fell out also to be on their <hi>Sabbath,</hi> about the twenty eight day
of our <hi>December, Pompey,</hi> entered into the Temple, and many others with
him, and there beheld those things which were not lawful to be seen by any,
but the High Priests only. And whereas there were in the Temple, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Candlesticks with the Lamps, all Vessels for Sacrifice, and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
all of pure Gold, and a huge heap of Spices, and in the Treasuries of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
mony above two thousand Talents, yet <hi>Pompey</hi> medled not with any of
these, but the next day he commanded them which had the charge of the
Temple, to purifie, and cleanse it, and to offer their solemn Sacrifices unto
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> then restored the High Priesthood to <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> made Prince and Priest.</note> both because he had
shewed himself so forward all the time of the Siege, as also for that he hindred
the <hi>Jews</hi> that were in all the Country from joyning with <hi>Aristobulus:</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Priesthood he gave him the Principality also, only forbidding
him to wear a Crown. Then did he put to death those that were the chiefest
cause of the War, and made the <hi>Jews</hi> Tributaries to the <hi>Romans</hi> and the
Cities which they had formerly conquered in <hi>Caelosyria,</hi> he took from them,
commanding them to obey their own Governours: and the whole Nation of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> formerly advanced through prosperity, he contracted within their
ancient bounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:103996:93"/>
The King of the <hi>Arabians</hi> that dwelt at the Castle of <hi>Petra,</hi> that never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made any account of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was now greatly afraid, and wrote to
<hi>Pompey</hi> that he was at his devotion to do what he commanded. <hi>Pompey</hi> to try
him, brought his Army before his Castle of <hi>Petra,</hi> and lodged them for that
day, and fell to riding, and mannaging his Horse up and down the Camp:
In the mean time Posts came riding from the Realm of <hi>Pontus</hi> with Letters of
good news, as appeared by their Javelins wreathed about with Lawrel: the
Souldiers seeing that, flocked about the place to hear the news, but <hi>Pompey</hi>
would make an end of his riding before he would read the Letters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
many cryed to him to alight, which he did: But then he wanted a
high place to stand upon, and the Souldiers were so impatient to hear the
news that they would not stay to make one, they heaped Saddles one upon
another,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Methridates</hi> Death.</note> and <hi>Pompey</hi> getting up upon them, told them, that <hi>Methridates</hi> was
dead, having killed himself because his Son <hi>Pharnaces</hi> rebelled against him,
and had wan all which his Father possessed, writing to him that he kept it for
himself and the <hi>Romans.</hi> Upon this news all the Camp rejoyced wonderfully,
and Sacrificed to the Gods with great mirth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> finding this troublesome War to be so easily ended, presently left
<hi>Arabia,</hi> and by speedy marches he came to the City of <hi>Amisus.</hi> There he
met with great Presents which were sent him from <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> and many dead
Bodies of the Kings Kindred, and the Body of <hi>Methridates</hi> himself, who was
known by certain scars in his Face.<note place="margin">His <hi>Policy.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> would by no means see him, but
to avoid envy he sent him away to the City of <hi>Sinope.</hi> He much wondered at
his rich Apparel, and Weapons: The Scabbard of his Sword cost four hundred
Talents: His Hat also was of wondrous Workmanship. <hi>Pompey</hi> having here
ordered all things according to his mind, he went homewards with great
pomp and Glory. Coming to <hi>Mytylene,</hi> he eased the City of all Taxes for <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophanes</hi>
his sake, and was present at certain Plays, the subjects whereof were
the great acts of <hi>Pompey</hi> He so liked the Theater where these Plays were
made, that he drew a moddle of it to make a statelier than it in <hi>Rome.</hi> As he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the City of <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> he heard the <hi>Rhetoricians</hi> dispute, and gave each
of them a Talent. The like he did at <hi>Athens</hi> unto the <hi>Philosophers</hi>
there, and towards the beautifying of the City he gave them fifty
Talents.</p>
            <p>At his return into <hi>Italy</hi> he expected to have been received very honourably,<note place="margin">He <hi>returns</hi> in to Italy.</note>
and longed to see his Wife, and Children, thinking also that they longed as
much to see him: But God so ordered it, that in his own House he met with
occasion of sorrow: For his Wife <hi>Mutia</hi> in his absence had played the Harlot.
Yet whilst he was a far off, he made no account of the reports which were
made to him of her:<note place="margin">He divorceth his Wife.</note> But when he drew neer to <hi>Italy,</hi> he was more attentive to
them, whereupon he sent her word he would own her no more for his Wife.
There were also rumours spread abroad in <hi>Rome</hi> which much troubled him; it
being given out that he would bring his Army strait to <hi>Rome,</hi> and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
absolute Lord of the Empire. <hi>Crassus</hi> hereupon, to give more credit to
the report, and to procure the greater envy against <hi>Pompey,</hi> conveyed himself,
Family, and Goods out of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when <hi>Pompey</hi> came to <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He disband<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his Army.</note> calling his Souldiers together, he made an
Oration to them as the time and occasion required, and then commanded
them to disband, and every one to return to his own home, and to follow
his business till the time of his Triumph. As he passed, such was the love
of the People to him,<note place="margin">The People honour him.</note> that multitudes of them accompanied him to
<hi>Rome</hi> whether he would or no, and that with a greater power than he
brought with him into <hi>Italy,</hi> so that if he had been disposed to
have made Innovation, he needed not the assistance of his Army
therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:103996:94"/>
At this time there was a Law that no man should enter into <hi>Rome</hi> before
his Triumph, wherefore <hi>Pompey</hi> sent to the Senate, requesting them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the choise of Consuls for a few days, that he might further <hi>Piso,</hi> who
sued for the Consulship that year: But through <hi>Caetoes</hi> means they denyed his
request.<note place="margin">He seeks to win <hi>Catio.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> marvelling to hear of his boldness and free Speech, was very
desirous to make him his Friend. So <hi>Cato</hi> having two Neeces, he desired to
marry one himself, and to have the other for his Son; but <hi>Cato</hi> flatly denied
him, though his Wife, and Sister were angry that he refused to make alliance
with <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Pompey</hi> being desirous to prefer <hi>Afranius</hi> to be Consul, he
caused mony to be given to the Tribes of the People, which being reported
abroad, made every man speak evil of him, as having put the Consulship
to sale for money, whereas himself had purchased it by his Noble and Valiant
deeds.</p>
            <p>The time for his Triumph being come, the stateliness, and magnificence
was such,<note place="margin">His second Triumph.</note> that though he had two days to shew it, yet lacked he time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all. For there were many things prepared for the shew which were
not seen, and would have set forth another Triumph. First the Tables were
carried wherein were written the Names of the Nations for which he Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed:
as the Kingdoms of <hi>Pontus, Armenia, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia,
Media, Colchis, Iberia, Albania, Syria, Cilicia,</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia:</hi> As also
the People that dwell in <hi>Phoenicia, Palestina, Judaea,</hi> and <hi>Arabia:</hi> And all
the Pirats that he had overcome by Sea, and Land. In all these Countries he
had taken a thousand Castles, and neer nine hundred Towns, and Cities.
Of Pirats Ships eight hundred. Moreover he had replenished with Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
thirty nine desolate Towns. These Tables also declared, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of <hi>Rome,</hi> before these his conquests, arose but to five thousand Myriads,
but now he had improved them to eight thousand, and five hundred Myri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads.
Besides, he now brought into the Treasury to the value of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Talents in Silver, Gold, Plate, and Jewels, besides what had been distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
already among the Souldiers, of which he that had least, had fifteen
hundred Drachma's for his share.</p>
            <p>The Prisoners that were led in this Triumph, were the Son of <hi>Tygranes,</hi>
King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> with his Wife, and Daughter: The Wife of King <hi>Tygra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
himself, called <hi>Zozime: Aristobulus</hi> King of <hi>Judaea.</hi> The Sister of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
with her five Sons: And some Ladies of <hi>Scythia.</hi> The Hostages
of the <hi>Iberians</hi> and <hi>Albanians,</hi> as also the Kings of the <hi>Commagenians:</hi> Besides
a great number of Marks of Triumph which himself and his Lieutenants had
won in several Battels. But the greatest honour that ever he wan, and which
no other of the Consuls ever attained to, was, that his three Triumphs were of
the three Parts of the World, to wit, his first of <hi>Africk:</hi> his second of <hi>Europe:</hi>
And his third <hi>Asia;</hi> and all this before he was forty yeards old. But from
this time forward <hi>Pompey</hi> began to decline, till (with his Life) he had lost all
his Honour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucullus</hi> at his return out of <hi>Asia,</hi> was well received by the Senate, and
much more after <hi>Pompey</hi> was come to <hi>Rome.</hi> For the Senate cncouraged him
to deal in affairs of State, being of himself slow, and much given to his
ease and pleasure, because of his great Riches. So when <hi>Pompey</hi> was come,
he began to speak against him, and through <hi>Catoes</hi> assistance, gat all things
confirmed which he had done in <hi>Asia,</hi> and which had been undone by <hi>Pompey.
Pompey,</hi> having such an afront put upon him by the Senate, had recourse to
the Tribunes of the People, the vilest of whom was <hi>Clodius,</hi> who closed with
him, and had <hi>Pompey</hi> ever at his Elbow, ready to second what motion soever
he had to make to the People: He also desired <hi>Pompey</hi> to forsake <hi>Cicero,</hi> his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Friend, but <hi>Clodius</hi> his utter Enemy. By this means <hi>Cicero</hi> was brought
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103996:94"/>
into danger, and when he required <hi>Pompey</hi>'s assistance, he shut the door a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him,<note place="margin">Cicero <hi>leaves</hi> Rome.</note> and went out at a back-door; whereupon <hi>Cicero</hi> was forced to
forsake <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> returning from his Praetorship out of <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> Policy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> laid
such a plot as quickly brought himself into favour, but tended to the ruin of
<hi>Pompey.</hi> He was now to sue for his first Consulship, and considering the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
between <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> he considered that if he joyned with one,
he made the other his Enemy, he therefore made them Friends, which indeed
undid the Commonwealth. For by this means <hi>Caesar</hi> was chosen Consul,
who strait fell to flattering of the People,<note place="margin">He flatters the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and made Laws for their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
distributing to them Lands, which embased the Majesty of the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestrate,
and made a Consulship no better than the Tribuneship of the People.
<hi>Bibulus,</hi> his Fellow Consul, opposed him what he could, and <hi>Cato</hi> also, till
<hi>Caesar</hi> brought <hi>Pompey</hi> into the Pulpit for Orations, where he asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he consented to the Decree which he had set forth? <hi>Pompey</hi> answered
<hi>That he did: und that he would defend it with the Sword.</hi> This gat him much
ill will.</p>
            <p>Not many days after,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>Caesars</hi> Daughter.</note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> married <hi>Julia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Caesar,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
betrothed to <hi>Servilius Caepio:</hi> and to pacifie <hi>Caepio, Pompey</hi> gave him
his own Daughter in marriage, whom yet he had promised to <hi>Faustus,</hi> the
Son of <hi>Sylla. Caesar</hi> also married <hi>Calphurnia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Piso.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Pompey</hi> filling <hi>Rame</hi> with Souldiers, carried all by force. For as <hi>Bibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
came to the Market place accompanied with <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Lucullus,</hi> they were
basely abused, and many were wounded, and when they were driven away,
they passed the Act for dividing of the Lands as they pleased. The People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
encouraged hereby, never stuck at any matter that <hi>Pompey</hi> and
<hi>Caesar</hi> would have done. And by this means all <hi>Pompey</hi>'s former Acts
were confirmed, though <hi>Lucullus</hi> opposed what he could. <hi>Caesar</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
was appointed to the Government of both <hi>Gauls</hi> with four whole
Legions.</p>
            <p>Then were chosen Consuls, <hi>Piso,</hi> Father in Law to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Gabinius,
Pompey</hi>'s great flatterer.<note place="margin">He dotes on his young Wife.</note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> now so doted on his young Wife, that he
suffered himself wholly to be ruled by her, and leaving all publick affairs, he
went with her to Country Houses, and places of pleasure, which encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Clodius,</hi> a Tribune of the people to despise him, and to enter into seditious
attempts. For when he had driven <hi>Cicero</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and sent away <hi>Cato</hi> to
make War in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> was occupied in <hi>Gaul,</hi> finding that the people
were at his beck, because he flattered them, he then attempted to undo some
things that <hi>Pompey</hi> had established. Amongst others he took young <hi>Tygra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
out of prison, and carried him up and down with him, and continually
picked quarrels against <hi>Pompey's</hi> Friends. <hi>Pompey</hi> coming abroad one day to
hear how a matter of his was handled, this <hi>Clodius</hi> having gotten a company
of desperate Ruffians about him, gat up into a high place, and asked aloud,
<hi>Who is the most licentious Captain in all the City?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pompey dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced.</note> They answered, <hi>Pompey.</hi>
And <hi>Who</hi> (said he) <hi>is he that scratched his head with one finger?</hi> They again
answered, <hi>Pompey,</hi> clapping their hands with great scorn. This went to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey's</hi>
heart, who never used to be thus abused, and he was yet more vexed,
when he saw that the Senate was well pleased with this his disgrace, because
he had forsaken, and betrayed <hi>Cicero.</hi> Upon this a great uprore was made in
the Market place, and many were hurt, whereupon <hi>Pompey</hi> would come no
more abroad whilst <hi>Clodius</hi> was Tribune, but advised with his Friends how he
might ingratiate himself with the Senate: they advised him to put away his
Wife <hi>Julia,</hi> to renounce <hi>Caesars</hi> Friendship, and to stick again to the Senate.
Some of these things he disliked, yet was content to call home <hi>Cicero,</hi> who was
<hi>Clodius</hi> his mortal Enemy, and in great favour with the Senate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:103996:95"/>
Hereupon <hi>Pompey</hi> brought <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Brother into the Market place to move
the matter to the People, with many men about him, and they fell to blows,
so that many were slain,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> yet he overcome <hi>Clodius,</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> was called
home by the Decree of the People, who also brought <hi>Pompey</hi> into favour
with the Senate, and caused a Law to be made whereby to enable <hi>Pompey</hi> to
bring Corn to <hi>Rome;</hi> and thus by <hi>Cicero</hi>'s means <hi>Pompey</hi> had once again pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
given him both by Sea and Land over all the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories. For all the
Havens, Marts, and Fairs, and all Store-houses, and Merchandizes, yea, and
Tillage, came into his hand.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>Clodius</hi> accused him, saying, that the Senate had made this Law,
not because of a dearth of Victuals, but that they made a dearth that so the
Law might pass for restoring <hi>Pompey's</hi> power, which was almost come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<hi>Pompey</hi> having now full Authority to cause Corn to be brought to
<hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> sent for Corn.</note> he sent his Friends, and Lieutenants abroad, and himself went into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily;</hi>
and when he was ready to return again, there arose such a storm, that
the Mariners feared to weigh their Anchors; but he commanded them to do
it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> saying, <hi>Its necessary that the People should have Corn, but its not necessary that
I should live.</hi> Thus by his prudence and courage he filled all the Markets with
Corn, and the Seas with Ships, and so great plenty of Provision was brought
in, as fully furnished, not only <hi>Rome,</hi> but all <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Caesars</hi> great conquests in <hi>Gaul</hi> wan him much credit. But
whilst they thought him to be Warring afar off,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> comes privately to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> he appeared in the midst of
the People at <hi>Rome,</hi> and much opposed <hi>Pompey</hi> in the weightiest matter of the
Commonwealth. For he had the power of an Army which he hardened with
pains, and continual exercise, not only to fight against the Barbarous People,
but to make himself invincible, and dreadful to the World. Moreover, by
that infinite quantity of Gold, and Silver, and other Treasures that he gat
from the Enemy, he purchased many Friends to himself, sending great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He bribes the Officers.</note> to the <hi>Aediles, Praetors, Consuls,</hi> and their Wives; therefore
when he was come back over the <hi>Alps,</hi> and Wintered in the City of <hi>Luca,</hi>
multitudes of the People, yea, two hundred of the Senate themselves, amongst
whom were <hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> went out of <hi>Rome</hi> unto him. All these <hi>Caesar</hi>
returned back again, some with store of mony, others with good Words:
But with <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> he agreed, that they two should sue to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,</hi>
and that himself would send good store of voices upon the day of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and that if they were chosen they should get a Decree of the People,
that they should have some new Provinces, and Armies assigned to them, and
withal, that they should procure his Government to continue for five years
longer. This Plot being discovered, and spread abroad, gave great distast
to honest men, and many who had intended to sue for the Consulship, gave
it over. Only <hi>Lucius Domitius,</hi> being encouraged by <hi>Cato,</hi> stood for it. For
(said he) <hi>Thou doest not contend for the Consulship, but to defend the liberty of thy
Country against two Tyrants. Pompey</hi> fearing <hi>Catoes</hi> faction, thought it not safe
to let <hi>Domitius</hi> come into the Market place: He sent therefore armed men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, who slew the Torch-bearer that came before him, and made all
the rest to flie, amongst whom <hi>Cato</hi> was the last man that retired, who, whilst
he defended <hi>Domitius,</hi> was wounded in the Elbow.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> came to be Consuls,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> chosen Consul.</note> wherein they carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
very dishonestly. For the People being about to choose <hi>Cato, Praetor:
Pompey</hi> perceiving of it, brake up the Assembly, falsly alleadging that he had
certain ill signs, and afterwards, corrupting the Tribes, they chose <hi>Antias,</hi>
and <hi>Vatinias, Praetors,</hi> and then by <hi>Trebonius,</hi> a Tribune of the People, they
published an Edict that <hi>Caesar</hi> should hold his Government five years longer:
Unto <hi>Crassus</hi> they appointed the Province of <hi>Syria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Provinces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</note> and to make War against
the <hi>Parthians.</hi> Unto <hi>Pompey</hi> they allotted <hi>Africk</hi> and both the <hi>Spains,</hi> with
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103996:95"/>
four whole Legions, of the which, at <hi>Caesars</hi> request, he sent him two, to
assist him in his Wars in <hi>Gaul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Crassus,</hi> at the going out of his Consulship, departed into <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>

People, though to his very great cost, and he procured much love to himself
thereby. But he got more envy from others by committing the Government
of his Provinces, and Legions, unto his Lieutenants, whilst himself with his

Swords were drawn and many were slain about <hi>Pompey,</hi> so that he was saign
to send home his Garments that were sprinkled with their blood and to fetch
others. His young Wife that was great with child, seeing his clothes bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

                  <hi>Julia</hi> dieth.</note> and as <hi>Pompey</hi> was carrying her into the Country to bury
her neer unto the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Alba</hi> at his Country House, the people took her corps,
and carrying it into the Field of Mars, buried it there: and this they did more
for <hi>Caesar,</hi> than for <hi>Pompey's</hi> sake.</p>
            <p>This alliance between <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> being thus broken,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompcy</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> quarrel.</note> which rather
covered than bridled their ambition to Rule, there arose a new stir in <hi>Rome,</hi>
and every mans mouth was full of seditious words: About which time news
came that <hi>Crassus</hi> was overcome and slain in <hi>Parthia,</hi> who was the only bar to
hinder these two from civil War: for they both feared him, and therefore
kept themselves quiet. Yet they thought the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> was too little
for them. <hi>Pompey</hi> thinking that <hi>Caesar</hi> would not disband his Army, sought
to strengthen himself against him by procuring Offices in the City: and when
he could not procure them, the people being bribed by <hi>Caesar,</hi> he left the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
without a Magistrate, so that there were none to command, or whom the
people might obey. Hereupon a rumour was spread that a <hi>Dictator</hi> must be
chosen, and that <hi>Pompey</hi> must be the man: This <hi>Cato</hi> opposed with all his
power: Bnt when <hi>Pompey's</hi> Friends excused him, saying, that he neither
sought, nor would accept of it, then <hi>Cato</hi> highly commended him, and pray'd
him to see good order kept in the Commonwealth, which accordingly he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook.</p>
            <p>Then were <hi>Domitius</hi> and <hi>Massala</hi> chosen Consuls, but after a while one of
them died, vvhereupon many vvere earnestly bent to have a <hi>Dictator,</hi> and
<hi>Cato</hi> fearing great disorders, was willing that <hi>Pompey</hi> should have some Office
to keep him from that vvhich was more Tyrannical. <hi>Bibulus</hi> a chief man in
the Senate, and <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Enemy, was the first man that moved that <hi>Pompey</hi>
might be chosen Consul alone: For (said he) by this means the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvealth
shall be rid of present trouble, or it shall be in bondage to an honest
man. It vvas expected that <hi>Cato</hi> vvould have opposed this motion; but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up, he told them, that he vvould not first have made this motion, but
seeing it vvas propounded by another, he thought it meet, and reasonable to
be follovved. For (said he) <hi>Its better to have an Officer to command, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he be, than to have none at all, and that there was none so sit to command in
so troublesome a time as</hi> Pompey.</p>
            <p>All the Senate consented hereto,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> made Consul.</note> and ordained that <hi>Pompey</hi> only should be
Consul, and that if he savv it needful to have the assistance of an other, he
might name whom he saw good, yet not till two months vvere past. <hi>Pompey</hi>
being thus made Consul alone, he carried it very friendly unto <hi>Cato,</hi> and
thanked him for the honour he had done him, intreating his assistance in the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103996:96"/>
execution of his Office. <hi>Cato</hi> replied that he had no reason to thank him;
for what he had done, he had not done it for his sake, but out of his respect
to the publick good: and that if he asked his counsel in any thing, he
would give it him privately, if not, that he would openly speak that which
he thought best,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> then married <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He marries Cornelia,</note> the Daughter of <hi>Metellus Scipio,</hi> the late
Wife of young <hi>Publius Crassus,</hi> slain with his Father in <hi>Parthia.</hi> This Lady
was of excellent beauty, and gifts, well learned, skilful in Musick, Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Philosophy; she was modest, and sober, free from brawling, or fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
curiosity. Her Father was Noble both by Birth, and deportment. Yet
many disliked <hi>Pompey</hi>'s marrying so young a Wife, and giving himself to Feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Jollity, when he should have looked to his Consulship in so trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
a time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> proceeded sharply against those that by Bribery, and indirect means
came to their Offices.<note place="margin">His <hi>justice,</hi>
               </note> He made Laws, and Ordinances for the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Justice, and himself dealt uprightly in all things, and took order that
Judgment should be administred with silence, safety, and gravity. But when
his Father in Law was accused, he sent for three hundred and sixty Judges
home to his House, praying them to help him, which the accuser of <hi>Scipio</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
let fall his suit,<note place="margin">And injustice.</note> 
               <hi>Plancus</hi> also being accused, <hi>Pompey</hi> (contrary
to the Law) spake in his commendation; whereupon <hi>Cato,</hi> who was one of
the Judges, stopped his Ears, saying, that he would not hear an offender prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
being contrary to the Law: <hi>Plancus</hi> was condemned by all the Judges to
the great shame of <hi>Pompey,</hi> Yet otherwise he set all things in good order, and
chose his Father <hi>Scipio</hi> for his fellow Consul for the five last Months. Then he
caused the Government of his Provinces to be assigned to him for four years
more, with commission to take out of the Treasury a thousand Talents year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for to defray the charges of his Wars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends seeing this, moved that some consideration might be had
of him also, who made great Wars for the Commonvvealth, and by his good
service had deserved either to be chosen Consul again, or else that they
should prolong his charge, and Goverment, that no other successor might
reap the fruit of his labours; Much stir arose about this matter: But <hi>Pompey</hi>
said, that he had received Letters from <hi>Caesar,</hi> by which he requested a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,
and to be discharged of this War: adding that he thought it fit they
should grant him the priviledg to demand the second Consulship though he
was absent. This <hi>Cato</hi> stoutly withstood, saying, that leaving his Army he
must return home as a private man, and in his own Person crave recompence
of his Country. <hi>Pompey</hi> replying nothing hereto, made many think he bore
no great good vvill to <hi>Caesar;</hi> the rather because he had sent to him for the
two Legions which he had lent him under colour of his War against the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi>
Though <hi>Caesar</hi> smelt his design,<note place="margin">He sends to <hi>Caesar</hi> for his two Legions.</note> yet he sent his Souldiers, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them liberally.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Pompey</hi> fell dangerously sick at <hi>Naples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His sickness, and recovery.</note> whereof he yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
again, and the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> sacrificed to the Gods, for his recovery;
the like also did their Neighbours round about, and it ran so generally through
<hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The People honour him.</note> that there was no City or Town wherein they did not make open
Feasting, and rejoyced for many days together. The infinite number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
also which went to meet him out of all places was such, that there was not
room enough for them all, but the High-ways, Cities, Towns, and Ports
were full of People, Feasting and sacrificing to the Gods for his recovery.
Divers also went to meet him that were Crowned with Garlands, casting
Nosegays, and Flowers upon him. Yet some thought that this was the cause
of the civil Wars that ensued.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Pride.</note> For hereupon he grew so proud to see himself
thus honoured, that forgetting his former Government, he began to despise
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103996:96"/>
               <hi>Caesar,</hi> thinking that he could easily overcome him when he pleased, Besides,
<hi>Appius</hi> that brought him his two Legions from <hi>Caesar</hi> out of <hi>Gaul,</hi> reproached
much his doings there, and gave out many foul words against <hi>Caesar.</hi> For
he said that <hi>Pompey</hi> knew not his own strength, who might overcome <hi>Caesar</hi>
with his own Legions, for that when they saw <hi>Pompey</hi> they would forsake <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
and turn to him.</p>
            <p>These flattering Speeches made <hi>Pompey</hi> so secure, that he laughed them to
scorn who were afraid of War; and such as said that if <hi>Caesar</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi>
they knew not how his power could be resisted, he smilingly bad them take
no thought, for if he did but stamp on the ground, he could fill <hi>Italy</hi> with
Armies both of Horse and Foot out of all places.<note place="margin">Note.</note> In the mean time <hi>Caesar</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
his Army, and drew neer to <hi>Italy,</hi> and sent some of his Souldiers daily
to <hi>Rome</hi> to be present at the election of Magistrates, and many of those that
were in Office he wan with mony: amongst whom was <hi>Paulus,</hi> one of the
Consuls, whom he drew to his side by giving him fifteen hundred Talents,
The like he did to <hi>Curio,</hi> a Tribune of the People by paying his vast debts, and
he gained thereby <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who was engaged for a great part of <hi>Curio</hi>'s
debt. A Captain also sent from <hi>Caesar,</hi> being at the Senate door, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that they would not prolong <hi>Caesars</hi> Government as he desired,<note place="margin">The miseries of War.</note> clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his hand on his Sword, he said, <hi>Well! this shall give it him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curio</hi> requested in the behalf of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that they would either cause <hi>Pompey</hi>
to disband his Army, or else licence <hi>Caesar</hi> to have his Army as well as he.
For (said he) being private men they will either agree between themselves,
or both being of like strength, neither will seek any alteration for fear of the
other. But <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Consul, opposed this hotly, calling <hi>Caesar</hi> Thief,
and saying that he would proclaim him an open Enemy to <hi>Rome</hi> if he did not
disperse his Army. Yet <hi>Curio, Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Piso</hi> procured that the Senate
should decide the matter, saying, <hi>All they that would have</hi> Caesar <hi>disband his
Army, and</hi> Pomey <hi>to keep his, let them go to the one side of the House, and such
as would have them both to disband, let them stand on the other:</hi> by this
means it was carried against <hi>Pompey. Curio</hi> much rejoyced at the Victory,
and going into the Market place, he was there received by his faction with
shouts of joy, and clapping of hands, and Nosegays of Flowers thrown
upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> was not present to see the good will of the Senators to him: but
<hi>Marcellus</hi> stood up and said, that he would not stand trifling, and hearing O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
when he knew that ten Legions were already passed over the <hi>Alps,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to come in Arms against them, and that he would send a man that
should defend their Country well enough. And so going through the Market
place unto <hi>Pompey,</hi> being followed by all the Senators, he said openly:
<hi>Pompey, I command thee to help thy Country with that Army thou hast already,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> made General a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </note> and
<hi>also to leavy more to aid thee. Lentulus</hi> also used the same Speech to him, who
was chosen for the year following.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pompey</hi> went to leavy Souldiers in <hi>Rome,</hi> some would not obey him,
and others went very unwillingly, the most part of them crying out Peace,
Peace.<note place="margin">The fruits of division.</note> 
               <hi>Anthony</hi> also, against the Senators minds, read a Letter to the People
sent from <hi>Caesar,</hi> vvherein he seemed to make reasonable requests to draw
the affections of the common People to him. For he moved that both <hi>Pompey</hi>
and he should resign their Governments, and dismiss their Armies, referring
themselves wholly to the Judgments of the People, and to deliver up unto
them an account of their doings. <hi>Cicero,</hi> vvho was lately returned from
<hi>Cilicia,</hi> endeavoured to bring them to an agreement, propounding that <hi>Caesar</hi>
that should leave the Goverment of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and his Army, reserving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two Legions, and the Government of <hi>Illyria,</hi> attending his second Consulship.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:103996:97"/>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> liked not this motion, and so all treaty of Peace was cut off.
In the mean time news came to <hi>Rome</hi> that <hi>Caesar</hi> had won <hi>Ariminum,</hi>
a large and strong City in <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wars between <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               </note> and that he came directly to <hi>Rome</hi> with
a great power: But the truth was he came but with three thousand Horse,
and five thousand Foot, and would not stay for the rest of his Army that
was not yet come over the <hi>Alps,</hi> but hasted rather to suprise his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
on the sudden, who were all in a hurly-burly, not expecting him
so soon, than to stay till they were fully ready to fight with him. When he
came to the River of <hi>Rubicon</hi> (which was the utmost bound of the Province
which he had the charge of in <hi>Italy</hi>) he made an Alt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> passes <hi>Rubicon.</hi>
               </note> pondring with himself
the great enterprise he took in hand: At last he cryed out to them that were by,
<hi>Jacta est alea,</hi> let the Die be cast: Or let us put all to the hazard, and so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on with his Army.</p>
            <p>News hereof coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> never was there such a consternation and
fear seen amongst them. For all the Senate ran immediately to <hi>Pompey,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all the rest of the City Magistrates, and <hi>Tullus</hi> asked him, what
power he had in readiness to resist <hi>Caesar?</hi> He answered (but something faulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly)
that he had his two Legions that came from <hi>Caesar,</hi> and with those
that he had levied in hast, he thought he should make up thirty thousand
fighting men.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached.</note> Then <hi>Tullus</hi> cryed out, <hi>Ah! thou hast mocked us</hi> Pompey;
and thereupon ordered Ambassadours to be sent to <hi>Caesar. Phaonius</hi> also, a
bold man, said, <hi>Stamp now with thy Foot upon the Ground,</hi> Pompey, <hi>and make
those Armies come which thou hast promised. Pompey</hi> patiently bore this mock.
Then <hi>Cato</hi> thought good that they should make <hi>Pompey</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of <hi>Rome,</hi> with full and absolute Power to command all, saying, <hi>They
that knew how to do the greatest mischief, know best how to remedy the
same.</hi> And so immediately he departed to his Government in <hi>Sicily.</hi>
Also all the other Senators went to the Provinces whereunto they were
appointed.</p>
            <p>Thus all <hi>Italy</hi> being in Arms, no man knew what was best to be done:
For such as were out of <hi>Rome</hi> came flying thither out of all parts,<note place="margin">The confusion in Italy.</note> and such
as were in <hi>Rome,</hi> fled out as fast, where all things were in disorder. They
which were willing to obey were very few, and they who by disobedience did
hurt, were too many, neither would they suffer <hi>Pompey</hi> to order things as he
would, because every one followed his own fancy, yea, in one day they were
in divers minds. All this while <hi>Pompey</hi> could here no certainty of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the reports being so various; and when he saw the tumult, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
so great at <hi>Rome</hi> that there was no possibility of pacifying it, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandéd
all the Senators to follow him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> leaves <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> declaring all such as staid behind to be
<hi>Caesars</hi> Friends. The two Consuls fled also without Sacrificing to the Gods,
as their manner was when they went to make War: And <hi>Pompey</hi> in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
danger and trouble had great cause to think himself happy, because he had
every mans good will.</p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Pompey</hi> was gone out of the City,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> enters <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Caesar</hi> came into it, who
spake very friendly to all whom he found there, labouring to quiet their fears:
Only he threatened <hi>Metellus,</hi> one of the Tribunes, because he would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to take any of the Treasure of the Commonwealth, saying, <hi>That it
was not so hard a thing for him to kill him as to speak it.</hi> Thus having put by
<hi>Metellus,</hi> and taken what he pleased out of the Treasury, he prepared to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Pompey,</hi> intending to drive him out of <hi>Italy</hi> before his Army should come
to him, out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> in the mean time took <hi>Brundusium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> at <hi>Brundusium.</hi>
               </note> and having gotten some Ships
together, he caused the two Consuls presently to embark, with thirty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pays
of Footmen, which he sent before to <hi>Dyrrachium.</hi> He sent also his
Father in Law <hi>Scipio,</hi> and his Son <hi>Cneius Pompeyius</hi> into <hi>Syria</hi> to provide him
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103996:97"/>
Ships. Then did he fortifie <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and guarded the Walls with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
commanding the Citizens not to stir out of their Houses. He cast up
Trenches also within the City at the end of all the streets, saving those two
which led to the Haven, and filled those Trenches with sharp pointed stakes,
and when at leasure he had imbarked all the rest of his Souldiers, he by a sign,
called off those vvhich guarded the Walls, and having received them into his
Ships,<note place="margin">He leaves <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> he hoisted Sails and departed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> finding the Walls of <hi>Brundusium</hi> unguarded, presently suspected that
<hi>Pompey</hi> was fled,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> pursues him.</note> and rushing into the City, he had certainly faln into the
Pits, but that the <hi>Brundusians</hi> gave him warning of them, whereupon he fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
a compass about to go to the Haven, and coming thither, he found all
the Ships under sail save two, vvherein were a few Souldiers. Some judged
this departure of <hi>Pompeys</hi> the best Stratagem of War that ever he used: But
<hi>Caesar</hi> marvelled that being in so strong a City, and expecting his Army out of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and being Master of the Seas besides, he vvould so easily forsake <hi>Italy.</hi>
Thus <hi>Caesar</hi> vvithin threescore days became Lord of all <hi>Italy</hi> vvithout blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
He was very desirous speedily to have followed <hi>Pompey,</hi> but having
no Ships ready, he was forced to stay. Then did he hasten into <hi>Spain</hi> to joyn
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army with his own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> in the mean space had gotten a marvellous great power together
both by Sea,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Power by Sea.</note> and Land. By Sea he had five hundred good Ships of War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
multitudes of Galliots, Foists, and Pinnaces, By Land he had all the
flower of the Horsemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of all <hi>Italy</hi> to the number of seven
thousand Valiant men, and of great Houses: But his Footmen were raw and
untrained Souldiers, whom <hi>Pompey</hi> continually exercised at the City of <hi>Beraea,</hi>
taking as much pains therein as if he had been in his youth. It was great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to others to see <hi>Pompey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His industry and activity.</note> being fifty eight years old, fighting on
foot compleatly Armed, and then speedily to mount on Horseback, and
in his full Career to draw, and put up his Sword, to cast his Dart, with as much
agility and strength, and point blank, that few young men could do the
like.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Pompey</hi> there came divers Kings,<note place="margin">Many came to him.</note> Princes, and Lords of great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
and of <hi>Roman</hi> Captains, who had born Office, to the number of a
vvhole Senate. Amongst these, there came also <hi>Labienus,</hi> who formerly
had been <hi>Caesars</hi> great Friend, and an assistant to him in his Wars in <hi>Gaul.</hi>
There came also to him <hi>Brutus,</hi> a very Valiant man, vvho had never before
spoken unto <hi>Pompey,</hi> because he thought him guilty of his Fathers Murther,
but novv he vvillingly joyned with him as a defender of the <hi>Roman</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
<hi>Cicero</hi> himself also, vvho had Written, and given counsel for Peace,
thought it a shame not to be amongst the number of those vvho would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
their lives in the defence of their Country. There came also <hi>Didius Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
though he was an old man, and lame of one of his Legs, vvhom when
<hi>Pompey</hi> savv coming (though others laughed him to scorn, yet) he rose
up and vvent to meet him, judging it a sign of much love vvhen such old
men chose rather to accompany him in danger, than to remain at home in
safety.</p>
            <p>The chief of <hi>Pompey's</hi> Army, sitting in Counsel, decreed that no Citizen of
<hi>Rome</hi> should be put to death, but such as fell in Battel: That no City subject
to the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> should be sackt, vvhich made <hi>Pompey's</hi> part liked the
better: And most judged those, Enemies both to the Gods, and Men, that
did not vvish him the Victory.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</note> 
               <hi>Caesar</hi> also shevved himself very courteous,
and merciful; for having taken all <hi>Pompey's</hi> Army in <hi>Spain,</hi> he set all the
Captains at liberty, and only reserved the Souldiers to himself: Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the <hi>Alps</hi> again, he passed through all <hi>Italy,</hi> and came to <hi>Brundu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium</hi>
in the Winter time, and from thence, passing over the Sea he came to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103996:98"/>
the City of <hi>Oricum:</hi> and having <hi>Vibius,</hi> one of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s familiar Friends with
him, whom he had taken Prisoner, he sent him to <hi>Pompey</hi> again to desire that
they might meet, and both of them disband their Armies within three days,
and being reconciled, and having given their Faith each to other, to return
into <hi>Italy</hi> like good Friends together. But <hi>Pompey</hi> durst not trust to these fair
words, judging them but snares to entrap him. He therefore suddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
to the Sea coast, and took all the places of strength neer to the Sea
side, safely to lodg his Camp in, and all the Ports, Harbours, and Creeks, fit
for Ships to lie in, so that whatsoever Wind blew, it served his turn to bring
him either men, victuals, or mony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar,</hi> on the other hand was so distressed both by Sea and Land, that he
was driven to hasten to a Battel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> wants <hi>Victuals.</hi>
               </note> and to assail <hi>Pompey</hi> even in his own strength,
to force him to fight with him, and for the most part he always had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in most skirmishes, saving one, wherein he was in danger to have lost all
his Army. For <hi>Pompey</hi> had valiantly repulsed all his men, and made them
flie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> beaten,</note> and had slain two thosand of them in the Field, but he durst not enter
pell mell with them into their Camp when they fled: which made <hi>Caesar</hi> say
to his Friends, <hi>That his Enemy had won the Victory that day if he had known how
to overcome.</hi> This Victory did so encourage <hi>Pompeys</hi> men, that they would
needs hazard a Battel. But <hi>Pompey,</hi> though he wrote to many of his Friends
and Confederates as if he had already beaten <hi>Caesar,</hi> yet was he not willing to
adventure all upon a Battel, thinking it better, by protracting time and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Enemy short of Victuals, to overcome him.</p>
            <p>For this end <hi>Pompey</hi> perswaded his men to be quiet, and not to stir: But
when <hi>Caesar,</hi> after this last bickering, being scanted of Victuals, raised
his Camp, and departed to go into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> through the Country of the
<hi>Athamaneans,</hi> then he could no longer bridle their courage, who cryed
out, <hi>Caesar</hi> is fled, let us follow him: And others said let us return home
into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Imprudence.</note> And some sent their Friends, and Servants to <hi>Rome</hi> to hire
them Houses near the Market place, intending at their return, to sue for
Offices. Some in a jollity would needs sail to <hi>Lesbos,</hi> where <hi>Pompey</hi> had
left his Wife <hi>Cornelia,</hi> to carry her the good news that the War was
endeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> calling a Counsel, <hi>Affricanus</hi> thought it best to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> and
to win that, as being the chiefest mark they shot at in this War: For
whosoever had that, was sure of all <hi>Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Gaul:</hi>
He said also, that it was a dishonour to <hi>Pompey</hi> (who should be very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his credit) to suffer their Country to be in such bondage, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to Slaves, and base flatterers of a Tyrant, when as it offered it self as
it were, into their hands. But <hi>Pompey</hi> thought it dishonourable for him
to flie from <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to make him follow him, since he now had him
in chase, nor lawful before the Gods now to forsake his Father in Law
<hi>Scipio,</hi> and many others, who had been Consuls, and who were dispersed
up and down <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Thessaly,</hi> who by this means would certainly fall
into <hi>Caesars</hi> hands, together with their Riches, and Armies. He said also,
that they had care enough for the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by drawing their Armies far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
from it, so as they remaing safe and quiet at home, not feeling the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of War, might joyfully welcome him home that remained Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour.</p>
            <p>With this determination he followed <hi>Caesar,</hi> not intending to give him
Battel, but to besiege him and so to cut him short of Victuals: But whilst he
pursued him fair and softly, his men cryed out of him, that he intended
not to War against <hi>Caesar,</hi> but against his own Country, that he might still
keep the authority in his hand. <hi>Phaonius</hi> also mocked him, and went cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up and down, <hi>My Masters, I give you notice that you are like to eat no</hi> Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culan
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103996:98"/>
               <hi>Figs this year.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Folly.</note> With these and many other such lewd Speeches, they
compelled <hi>Pompey</hi> to submit to their rash and giddy desires, contrary to his
more prudent purpose, and determination, which yet a General over so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Nations, and Armies, should not have done. These little considered that
he with whom he was to sight,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> great Victories.</note> was <hi>Caesar,</hi> who had taken a thousand Towns,
and Cities by assault, had subdued above three hundred several Nations, had
won infinite Battels of the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> and was never overcome: Had
also taken a Million of men Prisoners, and had slain as many in divers Battels.
Yet <hi>Pompeys</hi> men still vexing him with their importunity, when they were
come into the Fields of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> caused him to call a Counsel. There <hi>Labie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
the General of the Horsemen, swore before them all, that he would not
return from the Battel till he had driven his Enemies out of the Field: and the
like Oath did all the rest of the Commanders take.</p>
            <p>The Night before the fatal Battel there were heard sudden and fearful Noises
in <hi>Pompeys</hi> Camp,<note place="margin">Prodigie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> which awaked all the Souldiers. At the changing of the
fourth Watch, there was seen a great light over <hi>Caesar</hi> Camp, like unto a
burning Torch which came and fell in <hi>Pompeys</hi> Camp. In the morning <hi>Caesar</hi>
intending to raise his Camp, and to remove to the City of <hi>Scotusa,</hi> whilst his
Souldiers were busy in sending away their Bag, and Baggage, some brought
<hi>Caesar</hi> word that they saw much Armour, and many Weapons carryed too
and fro in thier Enemies Camp, and heard a great noise and bustling, as of
men that were preparing to fight. His Scouts also brought him word that
<hi>Pompeys</hi> Van was already set in Battel array. <hi>Caesar</hi> much rejoyced when he
heard this, saying, <hi>Now the day is come that we shall no longer sight with hunger,
and want, but with men,</hi> and thereupon gave order that they should presently
put out the red coat of Arms upon his Tent, which was the sign used
amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> when they were to fight. The Souldiers when they saw
that, left their Tents, Carriages and all, and with great shouts of Joy, ran to
arm themselves, and so without noise or tumult they were by their Captains
put into Battel array.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> himself led the right Wing of his Battel against <hi>Anthony.</hi> The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Battle he gave to <hi>Scipio</hi> his Father in Law which was right against <hi>Domitius
Calvinus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi>
               </note> His left Wing was led by <hi>Lucius Domitius Aenobarlius,</hi> which was
guarded by the men at Arms; for all the Horsemen were placed there, to
distress <hi>Caesar</hi> if possibly they could, and to overthrow the tenth Legion,
which contained the valiantest Souldiers that <hi>Caesar</hi> had; and amongst whom
himself always used to fight in Person. <hi>Caesar</hi> seeing the lest Wing of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
so strong with the guard of Horsemen, brought six Company's of Foot
for a reserve, and placed them behind the tenth Legion, commanding them
to stand close, that they might not be discovered by the Enemy: and
commanded them when the Horsemen should charge upon them, that they
should not throw their Darts strait forward but upwards at their Faces: For (said
he) <hi>These brave Fellows and fine Dancers, will not endure to have their Faces
marred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> being on Horse-back rode up and dovvn to observe hovv both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
vvere marshelled, and perceiving that his Enemies stood still in their
ranks, expecting the signal of Battel, and that his ovvn Battel vvaved up
and dovvn disorderly, as men unskilful in the Wars, he feared that they
would flie before they were charged. Therefore he commanded his Van
to stand steadily in their ranks, and to defend themselves in a close fight when
the Enemy should assault them. But <hi>Caesar</hi> disliked this devise: for thereby
(said he) the force of their blows was lessened, and by with-holding them
from giving the charge, that courage was taken away which the assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
carrieth with him when he comes on with fury, it made them also more
fainthearted in receiving the Enemies charge. In <hi>Caesars</hi> Army there were
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103996:99"/>
about twenty two thousand fighting men, and in <hi>Pompeys</hi> above twice so
many.</p>
            <p>When the signal of Battel was given on either side, and the Trumpets
sounded an Alarm, every man began to look to himself. But a few of the
chiefest of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and some <hi>Grecians</hi> that were amongst them, that yet
were not entred into the Battel, perceiving the eminent danger, began to
bethink themselves to what a sad pass the ambition, and contention between
these two great Persons had brought the State of <hi>Rome</hi> unto, where were
Kinsmen against Kinsmen, and Brethren against Brethren imbrewing their
hands each in others blood. Whereas, if they could have been contented
quietly to Govern what they had conquered, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was big
enough for them both. Or if that could not have quenched their insatiable
desires and thirst after Glory, they had occasion enough offered them against
the <hi>Germans,</hi> and <hi>Parthians:</hi> Or else they might have proceeded to conquer
<hi>Scythia,</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> For what <hi>Scythian</hi> Horsemen, or <hi>Parthian</hi> Arrows, or
<hi>Indian</hi> Riches, could have withstood the power of seventy thousand <hi>Roman</hi>
Souldiers, especially being led by two such Captains as were <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
whose Names were famous through the World.</p>
            <p>Now when the Fields of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> were covered over with Horse and Men
in Arms, after the Signal was given, the first man of <hi>Caesars</hi> Army that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
forward to give the charge, was <hi>Caius Crassinius,</hi> a Captain of one
hundred twenty and five men: and this he did to make good his promise to
<hi>Ceasar,</hi> who having asked him that morning what he thought of the event
of the Battel? he said, <hi>Oh</hi> Caesar! <hi>Thine is the Victory, and this day thou shalt
commend me either alive or dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Valour.</note> Thereupon he brake out of his rank (many
others also followed him) and ran into the midst of his Enemies, making a
great slaughter; but as he still pressed forward, one ran him through the
neck and slew him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> did not make his left Wing to advance over suddenly, but staid to
see what his Horsemen would do, who had already divided themselves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to compass in <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to force his Horsemen (who were fewer in
number) to give back upon his squadron of Footmen, and thereby to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
them. But on the other side, <hi>Caesars</hi> Horsemen gave back a little, and
the six Companies of Footmen that he had placed secretly behind them (being
three thousand in number) ran suddenly to charge the Enemy in the Flank,
and coming neer to <hi>Pompeys</hi> Horsemen, they threw their Darts (as <hi>Caesar</hi> had
appointed them) full in their Faces. The young Gentlemen, being raw
Souldiers, and little expecting such a manner of fight, had not the hearts to
defend themselves, nor could abide to be hurt in their Faces, but turning
their Heads, and clapping their hands on their Faces, they fled shamefully.
They being thus routed, <hi>Caesars</hi> men made no account to follow them, but
went presently and charged his Infantry, and especially where they had no
guard of Horsemen, by which means they might be the easiler compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.
Thus they being charged by these in the Flank and in the Van also by
the tenth Legion, finding themselves (contrary to their expectation)
compassed about by their Enemies, whereas they thought to have envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned
them, they could no longer make resistance, but were put to the
rout also.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pompey</hi> saw the dust flying up in the air,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> and thereby conjectured the
flight of his Horsemen, he was like a man amazed, and at his wits end, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
that he was <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and so retiring into his Camp, he fat
silent for a good while, till such time as his Enemies entered pell mell into
it, together with his men that fled: and then he said no more, but, <hi>What!
Into our Camp?</hi> And so rising up, he put on a Gown fit for his sad condition,
and secretly stole out of the Camp: His other Legions also fled, and <hi>Caesars</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:103996:99"/>
men made a huge slaughter of the Tent keepers, and of their Servants that
guarded the Camp: there were slain about six thousand. But at the taking
of the Camp <hi>Caesars</hi> Souldiers plainly saw the madness and folly of <hi>Pompeys</hi>
men: For their Pavillions and Tents were full of Nosegays, and Garlands of
Mirtle, and their Couches covered with Flowers, their Tables full of Bowls
of Wine, as men prepared to sacrifice for joy, rather than to arm themselves
to fight.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pompey</hi> was gone a little way from his Camp,<note place="margin">He flies.</note> he forsook his Horse,
having very few with him, and perceiving that none pursued him, he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
fair and softly on Foot, having his head full of thoughts. For he, for
thirty four years together used always to be Victorious, and therefore now
it was strange to him to flie:<note place="margin">Vanity of all earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> He now law how in one hours space, he had lost
all that Glory and Riches which he had purchased by so many great Victories.
He, that not long before was followed and obeyed by so many thousand men
of War, by so many Nations, and Horsemen; by such a great Fleet upon the
Sea, was now faln into a low and poor estate, with so small a train, that his
very Enemies who sought him, knew him not.</p>
            <p>When he had thus passed the City of <hi>Larissa,</hi> he came into the Valley of
<hi>Tempe,</hi> where being a thirst he fell down on his belly, and drank of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
then rising up, he went, and came to the Sea side, and lay all Night in
a Fishers Cottage. The next Morning by break a day he went into a little
Boat upon the River, having some Freemen with him, and as for his Slaves
he dismissed them, and bad them go boldly unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and not to be afraid.
Thus rowing up and down the shore side in this little Boat, he espied a great
Ship in the Sea lying at Anchor, which was ready to sail away: The Master
of the Ship was one <hi>Peticius,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> who, though he was not acquainted
with <hi>Pompey,</hi> yet he knew him well by sight. Some of the Marriners told
<hi>Peticius</hi> that they saw a little Boat coming towards them, wherein were some
men that held up their hands, and made signs to them: <hi>Peticius</hi> looking,
knew <hi>Pompey,</hi> and commanded his Marriners to let down the Boat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
giving <hi>Pompey</hi> his hand, he received him into the Ship, and those that
were with him, and then hoised Sail. With <hi>Pompey</hi> their were both the <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuli,</hi>
and <hi>Faonius.</hi> Presently after they espied King <hi>Dejotarus</hi> coming in a
Boat towards them, and making signs to be taken in, which accordingly they
did. At Supper time the Master made ready such meat as he had aboard.
And <hi>Faonius</hi> seeing <hi>Pompey</hi> for want of attendants,<note place="margin">Humillity.</note> washing himself, he ran
to him, and anointed him, and ever after waited upon him, doing such
Offices as Servants do to their Masters, washing his Feet, and preparing his
food for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> then passing by the City of <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> sailed to the Isle of <hi>Lesbos</hi> to
fetch his Wife <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> goes to his Wife.</note> and his Son, who were at <hi>Mitilene,</hi> and having
there cast Anchor in the Rode, he sent a Servant into the City to his Wife,
whose Message did not answer her expectation. For she had still been put in
hope by Letters of her Husbands good success, and that the War was well
ended: The Messenger finding her thus confident, thought not fit to salute
her, but rather by his Tears discovered the great misfortune of <hi>Pompey;</hi> and
at last told her, that she must dispatch quickly if she would see her Husband,
with one Ship only, and that not his own, but borrowed: The young Lady
hearing this, fell down in a swound before him, but after she was come to her
self, remembring that it was now no time to weep and lament, she went
speedily through the City to the Sea side. There <hi>Pompey</hi> meeting her, took
her in his Arms and embraced her: But she finking under him, fell down,
and at last said:<note place="margin">Their Speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 
               <hi>Out alas? Wo worth my hard Fortune, not thine, good Husband,
who now see thee with one poor Ship, who before thou marriedst me the Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
Cornelia, <hi>was wont to sail in these Seas attended with five hundred.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103996:100"/>
Alas! Why art thou come to see me, and didst not rather leave me to my accursed
destiny, seeing my self am the cause of this thy evil? Alas! How happy had I been
if I had died before I heard of the death of my first Husband</hi> Publius Crassus, <hi>slain
in the</hi> Parthian <hi>War? And how wise had I been if (according to my determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
I then had slain my self, whereas I yet live to bring this misfortune upon</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey
<hi>the</hi> Great? To this <hi>Pompey</hi> answered: <hi>Peradventure (my</hi> Cornelia) <hi>thou
hast known a better fortune which hath also deceived thee, because she hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
longer with me than her manner is. But since we are born men, we must pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
bear these troubles, and once more try what she will do. For it is not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for us again to change this adversity for prosperity, no more than it was to fall
from our late prosperity into this Calamity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Cornelia</hi> heard him say so, she sent into the City for her houshould
stuff, and Family: The <hi>Metilenians</hi> also came to salute <hi>Pompey,</hi> praying him
to come and refresh himself in their City: But <hi>Pompey</hi> refused, and advised
them to obey the Conquerour; for (said he) <hi>Caesar is of a just, and curteous
Nature.</hi> Then <hi>Pompey</hi> turning to <hi>Cratippus</hi> the Philosopher, who came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Citizens to visit him,<note place="margin">He reasons about Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> made his complaint to him, and reasoned a
little with him about Divine Providence. Then taking his Wife and Friends
he hoised sail and departed, staying no where but to take in fresh provision and
water.</p>
            <p>The first City that he touched at, was <hi>Atalia</hi> in the Country of <hi>Pamphilia.</hi>
Thither came to him some Gallies out of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and many of his Friends
and Souldiers, insomuch as he had now sixty Senators in his Company. Then
understanding that his Army by Sea was yet whole, and that <hi>Cato</hi> had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together a great number of his Souldiers after the overthrow, whem he
had transported with him into <hi>Africk,</hi> he complained to his Friends for that
they had compelled him to fight by Land, and not suffered him to make use
of his Fleet, wherein he was the stronger, and that he kept not his Army neer
to the Sea, that in case he miscarried at Land, he might presently have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to his Fleet at Sea, and thereby have resisted his Enemy.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> being driven to attempt somewhat according to his small abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to some Cities he sent Ambassadours, to others he went himself to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mony, wherewith he armed and manned some Ships. But fearing the
sudden approach of his Enemy, before he could be in readiness to resist him,
he bethought himself to what place he might retire for his better safety, and
resolved that there was never a Province of the <hi>Romans</hi> that was able to secure
him, and for other strange Nations, he thought none safer for him to retire
into than <hi>Parthia,</hi> which was able to aid and help him. Some advised him to
go into <hi>Africk</hi> unto King <hi>Juba.</hi> But <hi>Theophanes</hi> the <hi>Lesbian</hi> said, that it was
great folly to decline <hi>Egypt</hi> that was but three days sail from thence, and where
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> was, who was lately come to mans estate, and was infinitely bound
to <hi>Pompey</hi> for the late favours which he shewed to his Father, and not put
himself into the hands of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> the most unfaithful Nation in the
World. He thought it also an ill part for him to carry his young Wife of
the Noble Family of <hi>Scipio,</hi> amongst such barbarous People, who care not
how basely they abuse any strangers. The Speech altered <hi>Pompeys</hi> mind, and
made him resolve to flie into <hi>Egypt:</hi> and so with his Wife <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> flies into <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               </note> vvarring against his Sister, he steered that way, and sent a Messenger
before to the King, to certifie him of his arrival; and to entreat him to give
him entertainment: King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was at this time but a young man, and
under him, the whole Realm was governed by one <hi>Photinus.</hi> He therefore
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103996:100"/>
assembled a Councel of the chiefest,<note place="margin">A Councel about <hi>Pompey,</hi>
               </note> and wisest of his Court, and when they
were met, <hi>Photinus</hi> in the Kings name commanded every man to declare his
Judgment about the reception of <hi>Pompey</hi> whether they should intertain him or
not; and truly it was a sad thing that <hi>Photinus</hi> an Eunuch, and <hi>Theodotus</hi> of
<hi>Chio,</hi> vvho was the Kings Schoolmaster for <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and <hi>Achillas</hi> an <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
should consult amongst themselves what they should do vvith <hi>Pompey</hi> the
<hi>Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this vvhile <hi>Pompey</hi> rode at Anchor near to the shore, expecting the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of this Councel, amongst vvhom their opinions vvere various, some
were for, others against his reception; But <hi>Theodotus</hi> the <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> to shevv
his eloquence, perswaded them that neither the one, nor the other was to be
done. For (said he) <hi>if we receive him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Base treachery and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> 
               <hi>we shall make</hi> Caesar <hi>our Enemy, and</hi>
Pompey <hi>our Lord: If we receive him not,</hi> Pompey <hi>will blame us, and Caesar also for
not keeping him. Our safest way therefore is to kill him: for thereby we shall win
the good will of the one, and not sear the displeasure of the other:</hi> Adding that
<hi>Mortui non Mordent,</hi> A dead man bites not. This they all resolved upon, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
gave <hi>Achillas</hi> Commission to do it.</p>
            <p>This being concluded, <hi>Achill as</hi> took vvith him <hi>Septimius</hi> (vvho had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

this time the chiefest of his Train to see vvhat vvould be the issue of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But vvhen they favv vvhat intertainment he was like to have, and that
they came not in that Princely manner, answerable to the hopes that <hi>Theopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
had put them in, seeing so few men coming tovvards him in a Fisherboat,
they began to mistrust the sequel, and advised <hi>Pompey</hi> to turn back, and to
launch again into the Sea, vvhilst he was yet out of the reach of their Darts.
In the mean time the Fisherboat drevv near, and <hi>Septimius</hi> rose up and saluted
<hi>Pompey</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue by the name of <hi>Imperator,</hi> or Emperor. <hi>Achillas</hi> also
spake to him in <hi>Greek,</hi> vvishing him to come into his Boat, the shore being full
of mud, and sand banks, so that his Galley could not carry him to the
shore.</p>
            <p>At this time they saw afar off divers of the Kings Gallies which were arming
vvith all speed possible, and all the shore vvas full of Souldiers, so that though
<hi>Pompey</hi> and his Friends vvould have altered their minds, yet they could not
tell hovv to escape, and if they had diseovered their mistrust of them, they
had given the Murtherers a cloak for their cruelty.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> takes his leave of his Wife and Son.</note> 
               <hi>Pompey</hi> therefore taking
his leave of his Wife <hi>Cornelia,</hi> vvho lamented his Death before his end, he
commanded tvvo of his Centurions to go dovvn before him into the Boat, and
took vvith him only <hi>Philip,</hi> one of his Slaves enfranchised, vvith another
Slave called <hi>Scynes.</hi> When <hi>Achilles</hi> reaching out his hand to receive <hi>Pompey</hi>
into his Boat, he turned him to his Wife, and Son, and repeated these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Sophocles:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>The Man that into Court comes free,</l>
                  <l>Must there in state of bondage be.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>These were the last Words which he spake to them. The Land being far
off, when he saw never a man in the Boat speak friendly to him, he said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Septimius,</hi> Methinks, my Friend, I should know thee, for thou hast served
under me heretofore: the other nodded with his head, but gave him no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
<hi>Pompey</hi> observing these things, took a little Book into his hand,
wherein he had written an Oration that he ment to make to King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi>
and began to read it. As they approached to the shore, <hi>Cornelia,</hi> with her
Friends about her, stood up in great fear, to see what would become of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
and she hoped well when she saw many of the Kings People on the shore,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103996:101"/>
coming towards <hi>Pompey,</hi> as it were to receive, and honour him at his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But even as <hi>Pompey</hi> took <hi>Philip</hi> by the hand to rise more easily, <hi>Septimius</hi>
came behind him, and thrust him through with his Sword: <hi>Salvius,</hi> and
<hi>Achillas</hi> also made at him with their Swords. <hi>Pompey</hi> did no more but took
up his Gown, with which he covered his face, and took the wounds in a
manly manner,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> is slain.</note> only sighing a little. Thus ended he is Life the very next day
after his Birth, being fifty nine years old.</p>
            <p>They which rode at Anchor in their Ships, when they saw him thus Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,
gave such a fearful cry that it was heard to the shore: And weighing
their Anchors with speed, they hoised Sail and departed, having a lusty gale
of Wind to help them. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had thought to pursue them, but
when they saw they were past their reach, they let them go. Then striking
off <hi>Pompeys</hi> Head they threw his Body overboard, where it was a miserable
spectacle to all that desired to behold it. <hi>Philip,</hi> his infranchised Bondman,
stirred not from it till the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had glutted themselves with looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. Then having vvashed it with Salt water, and wrapped it up in an old
Shirt of his own, he sought about the Sands, and at last found a piece of an
old Fisher-boat, scarce enough to burn all the Body: and as he was gathering
the pieces of this Boat together, there came to him an old <hi>Roman,</hi> who in his
Youth had served under <hi>Pompey,</hi> saying, O <hi>Friend, what art thou that preparest
the Funerals of</hi> Pompey <hi>the</hi> Great? <hi>Philip</hi> answered, that he was a Bondman
of his infranchised. <hi>Well</hi> (said he) <hi>thou shalt not have all this honour alone,
Pray thee let me accompany thee in this devout deed, that I may not altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
me that I have dwelt so long in a strange Country, where I have endured much
misery; but to recompence me, let me have this good hap to touch</hi> Pompeys <hi>Body,
and to help to bury this most famous Captain of the</hi> Romans.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Lucius Lentulus,</hi> not knowing what had happened, coming
out of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> sailed by the shore side, and perceiving a Funeral fire, and
<hi>Philip</hi> standing by it, he asked him whose Funeral it was? But straight fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a great sigh, alas (said he) perhaps it is <hi>Pompeys</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi> Then he
landed a little, and was presently slain. This was the deplorable end of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> not long after came into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> where there were great Wars, at
which time <hi>Pompeys</hi> Head was presented to him, but he turned aside and
would not see it, abhorring him that brought it as a detestable Murtherer.
Then looking on his Signet Ring whereon was engraven a Lion holding a
Sword,<note place="margin">The Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers justly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</note> he burst out a weeeping. <hi>Achillas</hi> and <hi>Photinus</hi> he put to death.
King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> being overthrown in Battel by the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> vanished away
and was never after heard of. <hi>Theodotus</hi> escaped <hi>Caesars</hi> hands, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
up and down <hi>Aegypt</hi> in great misery, dispised of every man. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<hi>Marchus-Brutus</hi> (who slew <hi>Caesar</hi>) when he conquered <hi>Asia,</hi> met
with this <hi>Theodotus</hi> by chance, and putting him to all the torments he could
possibly devise, he at last slew him. The Ashes of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Body were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

told him, that it was to no purpose to put so young a man to Death,
he answered, <hi>That they did not consider that there were many</hi> Marius<hi>'s in

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being informed of his danger,<note place="margin">His flight.</note> secretly fled from <hi>Rome,</hi> and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:103996:102"/>
a long time amongst the <hi>Sabines,</hi> wandering from one place to another,
yet at length he fell into the hands of a party of <hi>Syllas</hi> Souldiers who sought
for him, but he bribed their Captain with two Talents, and so escaped.
Then went he unto the Sea side, and taking Ship, he passed into <hi>Bythinia</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
King <hi>Nicomedes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is taken by Pirates.</note> And after a while, he took Sea again, and fell into the
hands of some Pirates, who at that time kept all the Sea-coast, with a great
Fleet. They asked him twenty Talents for his Ransom, <hi>Caesar</hi> laughed them
to scorn, as not knowing what a man they had taken, and of himself promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them fifty Talents, and sent some of his men to get him this mony, so that
he was almost left alone amongst these Thieves, which were the cruellest
Butchers in the World, having only one of his Friends and two Slaves with
him.</p>
            <p>Thus he continued thirty eight days amongst them, not as a Prisoner, but
rather waited upon as a Prince by them:<note place="margin">His boldness.</note> For he boldly exercised himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them in their sports: He would make Orations and call them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hear them, and if they seemed not to understand or regard them,
he would call them Blockheads and Beasts, and laughing would threaten to
hang them, and they took all in good part, thinking that it proceeded from
his Boyish simplicity.</p>
            <p>When his Ransome was come, he paid it them and so was dismissed;<note place="margin">He is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and
presently arming and manning some Ships out of the Haven of <hi>Miletum,</hi> he
followed these Thieves, and finding them yet at Anchor, he took most of
them, and got a great Booty, and carryed their Persons to the City of <hi>Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and there imprisoned them, whilst himself went to <hi>Jumus,</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Asia,</hi> to whom the execution of these Pirats did belong. But he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to get the mony, because there was good store of it, said, that he would
consider of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Prisoners at better leasure. <hi>Caesar</hi> hereupon returned back
to <hi>Pergamus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He crucifies the Pirates.</note> and there hung up all the Thieves openly upon the Cross, as he
often had threatened that he would do, when they thought that he was
but in jest.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Syllas</hi> power began to decay, <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends wrote to him to return
to <hi>Rome:</hi> But he first went to <hi>Rhodes</hi> to study there for a time, under the Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> an honest man and excellent <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> whose Schollar
also <hi>Cicero</hi> had been. <hi>Caesar</hi> had an excellent gift to speak well natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which was much holpen by his Studies, so that he was very Eloquent,
and might have been second to none, but that he applied himself rather
to follow the Wars, and to mannage great matters than to pleading of
causes.</p>
            <p>When he was returned again to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His return to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> he immediately wan the good will
of the People by his Eloquence, and courteous speaking to every man, being
more ceremonious in his deportment than could be expected from one of his
years.<note place="margin">He grows po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular.</note> Besides, he ever kept a good Table, and fared well, and was very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,
which much encreased his estimation with the People. And his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
presuming that when he could not hold out that charge and expence,
the favour of the People would quickly decay,<note place="margin">And is feared.</note> they suffered him to go on, till
by degree he was grown very great, and powerful. So that though some of
them foresaw that his power would at last turn to the destruction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet now they knew not how to prevent it. Indeed <hi>Cicero</hi>
was the first man, who mistrusting his dealings, found out his subtilty and
malice, which he cunningly cloaked under a shew of courtesie, and familiarity:
Yet (said he) <hi>When I consider how finely he combeth his fair bush of hair, and how
smooth it lyeth, and that I see him scratch his Head with one finger, my mind gives
me then, that such a man should not be so wicked as to design the ruin of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first time that he made proof of the good will of the People was, when
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103996:102"/>
he stood in competition with <hi>Pompey</hi> to be chosen a Collonel of a thousand Foot
Souldiers, and carryed it against him; but a more manifest proof of it was at
the Death of his Aunt <hi>Julia,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Marius</hi> the elder. For then he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
made an Oration in her commendations in the Market place, and at
her Burial, did boldly shew forth the Images of <hi>Marius,</hi> which was the first
time that they were seen after <hi>Syllas</hi> Victory over him, at which time <hi>Marius</hi>
and all his partakers had been proclaimed Traytors and Enemies to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
And whereas some cryed out upon <hi>Caesar</hi> for doing it, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
on the other side applauded and thanked him for it. And whereas there
was an ancient custom that the <hi>Romans</hi> used to make Funeral Orations in
commendation of old Ladys, but not of young Women. <hi>Caesar</hi> was the first
that praised his own Wife in an Oration at her Funeral, which much
engaged the People to him, seeing him of so kind, and loving a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Shortly after he was made Treasurer under <hi>Antistius Vetus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the <hi>Praetor,</hi> for
which he ever after honoured him, so that when he himself came to be <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
he made his Son Treasurer under him, and when he came out of that
Office, he married his third Wife, whom was <hi>Pompeia</hi> and married his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Cornelia</hi> which he had by his first Wife, to <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great. He further
ingratiated himself with the People by disbursing a great sum of his own
mony in mending the <hi>Appian</hi> way, vvhen he was made Overseer thereof: as
also for that, vvhen he was chosen an <hi>Aedile,</hi> he shewed the People the pastime
of three hundred and twenty couple of Sword Players, and exceeded all others
in the sumptuousness of his Feasts and sports vvhich he made for the delight of
the People, vvhich made them daily to give him new Offices by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital.</p>
            <p>Not long after the High Priest <hi>Metellus</hi> died, and <hi>Isauricus</hi> and <hi>Catulus,</hi>
two of the chiefest men, and of the greatest authority in <hi>Rome,</hi> contended
for the place: <hi>Caesar</hi> also presented himself to the People and sued for it, and
<hi>Catulus</hi> fearing the event, sent a great sum of money to <hi>Caesar,</hi> to procure him
to leave off his suit: <hi>Caesar</hi> sent him word, that he vvould disburse a greater
sum than that to maintain the suit against him: and vvhen the Day of Election
came, his Mother bringing him to the Door, <hi>Caesar</hi> vveeping kissed her, and
said,<note place="margin">His ambition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>Mother, This day thou shalt see thy Son chief Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or banished
from</hi> Rome;<note place="margin">He is made High Priest.</note> and accordingly he carried it by the suffrages of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
insomuch as the Senate and Noble men vvere all affraid of him,
judging that from henceforth he vvould make the People do vvhat he
pleased.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Caesar</hi> going into the Senate to cleer himself of some accusations
that vvere brought against him, the Senate keeping him somewhat longer
than ordinary, the People come to the door and called for him, bidding them
let him out. Whereupon <hi>Cato</hi> fearing an insurrection of the poor and needy
Persons, who put all their hopes in <hi>Caesar,</hi> moved, that a frank distribution of
Corn for a month should be made amongst them, vvhich indeed put the
Commonvvealth to the charge of fifty five hundred Myriads, but it quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the present danger, and did haply scatter the best part of <hi>Caesars</hi> strength,
and that at such a time vvhen he was made <hi>Praetor,</hi> and had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
opportunity of doing much mischief. Yet all the the time of
that Office,<note place="margin">His Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</note> he never attempted to make alteration in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvealth.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Clodius</hi> vvas suspected of too much familiarity vvith <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia,</hi>
vvherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> put her avvay.<note place="margin">He puts away his Wife.</note> The Government of <hi>Spain</hi> being faln
unto <hi>Caesar</hi> as he vvas <hi>Praetor,</hi> his Creditors came with great importunity cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for their debts: But he being unable to satisfie them; went to <hi>Crassus,</hi>
the richest man in <hi>Rome;</hi> who stood in need of <hi>Caesars</hi> bloldness and courage to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103996:103"/>
withstand <hi>Pompeys</hi> greatness, who became his surety to his greadiest Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
for eight hundred and Thirty Talents, whereupon he was suffered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
to his Province.</p>
            <p>As he passed over the <hi>Alps</hi> he came to a little poor Village, where his
Friends that did accompany him, asked him merrily if there were any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
for Offices in that Town, and whether there were any strife amongst
the Noble-men for honour?<note place="margin">His ambition.</note> 
               <hi>Caesar</hi> answered, <hi>I cannot tell: but for my part, I
had rather be the chiefest man here, than the second person in Rome.</hi> Another
time in <hi>Spain</hi> reading the History of <hi>Alexander</hi> he was sorrowful a good while
after, and at last burst out into weeping. His Friends marvelling at it, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him what was the cause of his sorrow? He answered, <hi>Do you not think that
I have good cause to be sorry, when</hi> Alexander (<hi>being no older than my self) had
conquered so many Nations and Countries, whereas hitherto I have done nothing
worthy of my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he first came into <hi>Spain</hi> he followed his business close, and in a short
time had joyned ten new Ensigns of Foot Souldiers, unto the other twenty
which he had before. Then marching against the <hi>Gallicians,</hi> and <hi>Lusitanians,</hi>
he conquered all before him as far as to the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean,<note place="margin">His Victories in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> subduing those
People which before knew not the <hi>Romans</hi> for their Lords; and then did as
wisely take order for the establishing of Peace. For he reconciled the Cities
together, made them Friends: But especially he pacified all suits of Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Debtors and Creditors which arose by usury:<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> Ordaining that the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
should take yearly two parts of the revenew of their Debtors, till such
time as they had paid themselves, and that the Debtors should have the other
third part to live upon. By this he won great estimation to himself, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from his Government very wealthy, his Souldiers also were full of rich
spoils.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had a custom, that such as desired the honour of Triumph,
should stay without the City, whereas they that sued for the Consulship must
of necessity be there in Person. <hi>Caesar</hi> coming home just at that time when
Consuls were to be chosen, he sent to request the Senate that he might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to sue for the Consulship by his Friends: Against this <hi>Cato</hi> at first did
vehemently invey, alleadging that it was contrary to an express Law. But
when he perceived that many of the Senators (being <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends) favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his request, he cunningly sought all he could to prevent them: whereupon
<hi>Caesar</hi> resolved rather to give over his suit, for the Triumph, than to lose
the Consulship: So he came into the City, and outwitted all but <hi>Cato.</hi> His
device was this. <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> were the two greatest Persons in <hi>Rome,</hi>
and at jar between themselves:<note place="margin">His Subtilty.</note> 
               <hi>Caesar</hi> affecting to make himself greater than
either of them, sought to make them Friends, and thereby to get the power
of them both: For indeed, they both affected his Friendship, that by his help
they might supplant one another. And in the end, by his endeavours, a
peace was concluded betwixt them: yet being still jealous one of another, and
fearing to lose <hi>Caesar,</hi> they both sought to gratifie him, and by this means
he made himself equal to either of them: and that power which they two had
formerly usurped, was now divided between three, and in the end <hi>Caesar</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
got the sole command.</p>
            <p>This league being made betwixt them, <hi>Caesar</hi> demanded the Consulship,
being brought into the Assembly for the Election betwixt these two Noble
Persons and was there chosen Consul,<note place="margin">He is chosen Consul.</note> together with <hi>Calphurnius Bibulus,</hi>
without the contradiction of any: And when he was entered into his Office,
he began to put forth Laws meeter for a sedicious Tribune than for a
Consul, because by them he preferred the division of Lands, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing
Corn to every Citizen <hi>Gratis,</hi> and all to please the People:
And vvhen the Senators opposed it, he took the advantage, Protesting
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103996:103"/>
that the Senate by their austerity drave him against his will to cleave to the
People, and thereupon he asked <hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> in the open Assembly, if
they gave their consents to his Laws? They answered, yea. Then he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to stand by him against those that threatned to oppose him with the
Sword: <hi>Crassus</hi> said he would, and <hi>Pompey</hi> did the like, adding, that he
would come with his Sword and Target both against such; which gave great
offence to the Senate, but the common People much rejoyced.</p>

stead <hi>Pompeys</hi> Daughter, who also was made sure unto <hi>Faustus,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Sylla.</hi> And shortly after <hi>Caesar</hi> himself Married <hi>Calphurnia,</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Piso,</hi> whom he caused to succeed him in the Consulship. <hi>Cato</hi> then cryed
out, and called the Gods to witness, that it was a shameful thing that they
should make such havock in the Commonwealth by such horribly Bawdy
matches, hereby dividing amongst themselves the Government of Provinces,
and great Armies. And <hi>Bibulus</hi> perceiving that he did but contend in vain,
<hi>Caesar</hi> being too potent for him, and that his Life was in danger for opposing
these Laws, he kept his House all the rest of his Consulship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> having married <hi>Julia,</hi> he filled the Market-place with Souldiers, and
by open force authorised the Laws which <hi>Caesar</hi> had made in favour of the
People:<note place="margin">He is sent into <hi>Gaul.</hi>
               </note> He procured also that <hi>Caesar</hi> had both the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and all <hi>Illyria,</hi> with
four Legions, granted him for five years: and when <hi>Cato</hi> stood up to speak
against it, <hi>Caesar</hi> bad his Officers to lay hold on him, and carry him to Prison,
thinking that he would have appealed to the Tribunes, but <hi>Cato</hi> said no more,
but went his way. And <hi>Caesar</hi> seeing that not only the Nobility, but the
Commons also were offended at it, out of respect to <hi>Cato</hi>'s virtues, he secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prayed one of the Tribunes that he would take <hi>Cato</hi> from his Officers,
which was done accordingy. Many of the Senators refused to be present in
the Senate under him, but left the City, because they could not endure his
doings; whereupon one <hi>Considius,</hi> an old man told him, that the Senators
durst not meet because of his Souldiers. Why then (said <hi>Caesar</hi>) dost not
thou also keep home out of the same fear? Because (said he) <hi>My age takes
away my fear from me, for having so short a time to live, I care not to prolong it
further.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> preferred <hi>Clodius,</hi> a base fellow, to be Tribune, who sought the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for no other end but to destroy <hi>Cicero,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He betrays <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero.</hi>
               </note> who had discovered his Villanies,
and <hi>Caesar</hi> would not go to his Province till he had set them two together by
the ears, and driven <hi>Cicero</hi> out of <hi>Italy.</hi> Yet did he deserve the name of as
brave a General as any that went before him, if we consider the hard Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
which he adjoyned to the Empire of <hi>Rome:</hi> The multitude and power of
the Enemies whom he overcame: The rudeness and Valour of the men with
whom he had to do, whose manners yet he molli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ied, and civilized: His
courtesie, and clemency to those whom he overcame: His great bounty and
liberallity to those that served under him: As also if we consider the number
of Battels that he fought, and the multitude of Enemies that were slain by
him.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>His Valour and great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.</hi>
               </note> For in less then ten years, he took by assault above eight hundred
Towns: He conquered three hundred Nations: and having at several times
above thirty hundred thousand Souldiers against him, he slew a Million of
them, and took as many more Prisoners. He was so intirely loved of his
Souldiers,<note place="margin">His Souldiers Valour.</note> that to do him service, and to advance his honour, they were
invincible: As appears by the example of <hi>Acilius,</hi> who in a Sea-fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the City of <hi>Marseiles,</hi> boarding one of the Enemies Ships, had
his right hand cut off, and yet he ran upon his Enemies, thrusting them
in their faces with his Target on his left hand, and so prevailed that he took
their Ship.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:103996:104"/>
One <hi>Cassius Scaeva</hi> also in a fight before the City of <hi>Dyrrhacium,</hi> having an
eye put out with an Arrow, his shoulder stricken through with a Dart, and
his thigh with another, having received thirty Arrows upon his Shield, called
to his Enemies as if he would yield to them: but when two of them came
running to him, he cut off one of their armes by the shoulder, and wounded
the other in the face, and made them give back till he was fetched off by
some of his fellows. In <hi>Brittain</hi> also when some of his Captains were driven
into a bog full of mire and dirt, the Enemies fiercely assaulting them there,
<hi>Caesar</hi> viewing the Battel, he saw a private Souldier thrust in amongst the
Captains, where he fought so valiantly that at length he forced the Barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
People to fly, and thereby saved the Captains, who otherwise had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished
there: And then this Souldier being the hindmost of all the Captains,
marched through the bog, sometimes swimming, and sometimes on foot,
till he gat to the farther side, only he lost his Target. <hi>Caesar</hi> wondring at his
valour, ran and imbraced him: But the poor Souldier, hanging down his
head, with tears in his eyes, fell at <hi>Caesars</hi> feet, begging pardon for leaving
his Target behind him. In <hi>Africk</hi> also, <hi>Scipio</hi> having taken one of <hi>Caesars</hi>
Ships, slew all that were in it, save <hi>Petronius,</hi> a Treasurer, to whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
life: But <hi>Petronius</hi> answered him, that <hi>Caesars</hi> Souldiers used to give
others their lives, and not to have their lives given them, and thereupon slew
himself with his own Sword.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Caesar</hi> bred this courage in them by rewarding them bountifully, and
honouring them. He also gave them a good example by adventuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon manifest dangers, and putting his body to extream pains when there
was occasion, which filled them with admiration. As for his constitution
he was lean, white, and soft skin'd, and often troubled with the Head-ach,
and sometimes with the falling sickness,<note place="margin">His Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> yet yielded he not to his sickness, but
rather took pains as a Medicine to cure it, travelling continually, living so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
and commonly lying abroad in the Fields. Most nights he slept in his
Coach, and in the days travelled up and down to see Cities, Castles, and
strong-holds. He had always a Secretary with him in his Coach, who writ
as they went by the way, and a Souldier behind him that carryed his Sword.
He made such speed when he had gotten his Office at <hi>Rome,</hi> that in eight
days he came to the River of <hi>Rhone.</hi> He was an excellent Rider from his
youth:<note place="margin">His activity.</note> for holding his hands behind him, he would run his Horse upon
the Spur.</p>
            <p>In his Wars in <hi>Gaul,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> he used to exercise himself in inditing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
by the way, wherein he was so nimble that he imployed two Secretaries,
or more at one time. He made very little account of his Diet, Supping one
night in <hi>Millane</hi> with his Friend <hi>Valerius Leo,</hi> there was served at Table some
<hi>Sperage</hi> with some perfumed oyl instead of Sallet oyl, he eat it, and found no
fault, blaming his Friends who were offended at the mistake, saying, that if
they liked it not they should have let it alone, and that it was not good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
hereby to shame their Friend. At another time in his Journey he was
forced by foul weather to shelter himself in a poor Cottage that had but one
Cabbin, and that so narrow that one could scarce lye in it, whereupon he said
to his Friends, the greatest rooms, are fittest for the greatest men, and Beds
for sick persons, and so caused <hi>Oppius</hi> that was sick to lye there, and himself with
the rest of his Friends, lay without doors.</p>
            <p>The first War that <hi>Caesar</hi> made in <hi>Gaul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He overcomes the <hi>Swissers.</hi>
               </note> was against the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> or <hi>Swis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,</hi>
and the <hi>Tigurines,</hi> who having set fire of their own Cities and Houses,
came to invade that part of <hi>Gaul</hi> which was subject to the <hi>Romans.</hi> These
were a very War-like and Valiant People, and in all they were three hundred
thousand souls, whereof there were one hundred and ninety thousand fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men: yet were they overthrown by <hi>Labienus, Caesars</hi> Lieutenant at the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103996:104"/>
River <hi>Arax.</hi> And when the <hi>Heluetians</hi> afterwards came suddenly to set upon
<hi>Caesar,</hi> he made hast to get into some place of strength, and there ordered his
Battel against them, and when one brought him his charging Horse, he said,
<hi>when I have overcome mine enemies, then I will get upon him, to pursue them,</hi> and
so marching against th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m on foot, he fiercely charged them: The Battel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
long before he could make them fly: yet had he more ado to take their
Camp, and to break the strength that they had made with their Carts. For
not only those that were fled into it, made head again, but their Wives and
Children also fought stoutly for their lives, till they were all slain, and the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
was scarce ended by midnight.</p>
            <p>Presently after, above one hundred thousand of those that had escaped
from this Batt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l, were forced by <hi>Caesar</hi> to return into their own Country
again, and to the Towns which they had burnt; and this he did lest the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
should come over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and settle themselves in that Country being
void.</p>
            <p>The next War that <hi>Caesar</hi> made was in defence of the <hi>Gauls</hi> against the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
               </note>
though himself had before admitted <hi>Ariovistus</hi> their King to be received
as a confederate of the <hi>Romans:</hi> Notwithstanding which, they were grown
very unquiet Neighbours, watching but an opportunity to possess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of the rest of <hi>Gaul. Caesar</hi> perceiving that some of his Captains much
feared them, especially the young Gentlemen of Noble Families, who went
along with him as to some Pastimes, he commanded all that were afraid to
return home, and not endanger themselves against their wills. But for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
he said, he would set upon those Barbarous People, though he had left him
but the tenth Legion only. Upon this the tenth Legion sent their Officers to
thank him for the good opinion he had of them: and all the other Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
blamed their Captains for their backwardness, and followed him
cheerfully till they came within two hundred Furlongs of the Enemies
Camp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariovistus</hi> his courage was well cooled when he saw <hi>Caesar</hi> so near,<note place="margin">And the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
               </note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they thought that the <hi>Romans</hi> were afraid of them: His Army also
was in a great amaze. But that which discouraged them most, was the
Prophesies of some foolish women, who observing the terrible noise which
the Water in the River made, advised the <hi>Germans</hi> by no means to fight,
and they being possessed with a superstitious fear, sought to avoid the fight:
Yet <hi>Caesar</hi> skirmished with them every day and sometime followed them to
their Forts, and little Hills where they lay, whereby he so provoked
them that at last they came down with great fury to fight. In this Battel
he overcame them, and pursued them very eagerly, making a great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them even to the River of <hi>Rhine,</hi> filling all the Fields with dead Bodies,
and spoiles. <hi>Ariovistus</hi> himself flying speedily got over the River, and escaped
with some few of his men: At this Battel there were slain about eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Battel <hi>Caesar</hi> left his Army to winter amongst the <hi>Sequanes,</hi> and
himself thinking of the affairs of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Policy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> returned over the <hi>Alps</hi> to a place about
the River <hi>Po:</hi> whilst he lay there he laboured to make Friends at <hi>Rome:</hi> and
when many came to visit him there, he granted all their suits, and sent them
back, some with liberal rewards, and others with large promises, whereby he
engaged them to him.</p>
            <p>During all the time of <hi>Caesars</hi> great conquests in <hi>Gaul, Pompey</hi> did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how <hi>Caesar</hi> conquered the <hi>Gauls</hi> with the <hi>Roman</hi> weapons, and wan the
<hi>Romans</hi> with the Riches of the <hi>Gauls.</hi> At this time <hi>Caesar</hi> being informed that
the <hi>Belgae</hi> who were the most War-like Nation of all the <hi>Gauls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He overcomes the <hi>Belgae.</hi>
               </note> were all
up in Arms and had raised a very great Power, he presently made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them with all possible speed; and found them overrunning and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103996:105"/>
plundering the neighbour Countries and confederates of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he gave them Battel, and overthrew their chiefest Army, and slew so
many of them that the Lakes and Rivers were died with their blood, and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their dead Bodies, that the <hi>Romans</hi> passed over on foot upon them:
After this overthrow, such of them as dwelt near the Sea yielded themselves:
and from thence he conducted his Army against the <hi>Nervians,</hi> the stoutest
Souldiers of all the <hi>Belgae.</hi> These dwelling in a Woody Country, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
their Wives, Children and Goods into a very great Forrest, remote
from their Enemies, and being above eighty thousand fighting men, they
watching their opportunity, set upon <hi>Caesar</hi> when his Army was out of
order, and little expecting them. At the first charge they brake the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Horsemen, and encompassing the seventh and twelfth Legions, they
slew all the Captains, and had not <hi>Caesar</hi> himself with his Shield on his
Arme, run amongst them, making a lane as he went, and the tenth Legion,
seeing him in that danger, followed him with all speed, there had not a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
escaped alive that day. But looking upon <hi>Caesars</hi> Valour, his men fought
desperately, even beyond their abilities, and yet could they not make the
<hi>Nervi</hi> fly,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> but they fought it out bravely till most of them were slain in the
Field, five hundred only of them escaping. Yet was it a bloody Battel to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> for that of four hundred Gentlemen, and Counsellers of <hi>Rome,</hi> there
were but three saved.</p>
            <p>The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> made great signs of joy for these Victories, by sacrificing
to the Gods, Plays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as <hi>Caesars</hi> fame was encreased hereby, so he wan
upon the Peoples love: And always, when his affairs would permit, he used
to Winter by the River <hi>Po,</hi> to give direction about his affairs at <hi>Rome.</hi> And truly
not only such as sued for Offices at <hi>Rome,</hi> obtained them by <hi>Caesars</hi> money,
and therefore imployed all their power to promote his Interest, but the
chiefest also of the Nobility,<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> went to <hi>Luke</hi> unto him, insomuch as at one
time there have been seen before his Gates, one hundred and twenty Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
carrying Rods and Axes before the Magistrates that have waited upon
him, and two hundred Senators besides. Here they held a Councel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was agreed, that <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> should again be chosen Consuls for
the year following: and that <hi>Caesar</hi> should have more money delivered him to
pay his Army, and that his Government should be prorogued for five years
longer.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Caesar</hi> returning into <hi>Gaul</hi> to his Army, found there a great War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
For two Potent Nations of the <hi>Germans,</hi> having passed over the River
of <hi>Rhine</hi> to conquer new Lands, <hi>Caesar</hi> fought with them, which himself
thus discribeth: These Barbarous People (saith he) after they had sent
Ambassadours to me to desire peace, contrary to the Law of Armes, came
and set upon me as I travelled by the way, insomuch as eight hundred of
their men overthrew five thousand of my Horse-men, who nothing at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
their comming, and going on to describe their farther proceedings,
he saith, that they again sent Ambassadours to him to mock him, whom he
kept Prisoners, and then setting upon the Enemies, who were about four
hundred thousand Persons, he slew most of them, saying a few that flying
gat back over the River of <hi>Rhine</hi> and so escaped.<note place="margin">He overcomes the <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Caesar,</hi> taking this occasion,
and being ambitious to have the honour of being the first <hi>Roman</hi> that ever
passed this River with an Army, he built a Bridg over it, though the River
were very broad, and ran with a violent stream, and especially there where
he built the Bridg: and the Barbarians casting great Trees into the River, they
were carried down with such violence that by their great blows they did sore
shake the Posts of the Bridg, to prevent which, and to abate the fury of the
stream, <hi>Caesar</hi> caused a Pile to be made a good way above the Bridg, which
was forcibly rammed into the bottom of the River, so that in ten days space
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103996:105"/>
he had finished his Bridg of goodly Carpenters work: A very rare invention as
could be possibly devised.</p>
            <p>Then passing his Army over this Bridg,<note place="margin">He passes over the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
               </note> he found none that durst fight with
him: For the <hi>Suevians</hi> who were the most War-like People of the <hi>Germans,</hi>
had retired themselves and Goods into great Valleys, Bogs, Woods, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests.
<hi>Caesar</hi> therefore having burnt up the Enemies Country, and confirmed
the League with the confederates of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he returned back into <hi>Gaul.</hi>
About this time also he made a Journey into <hi>England,</hi> being the first that sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Western Ocean with an Army,<note place="margin">And went into <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> and that passed through the <hi>Atlantick</hi>
Sea to make War in this great and Famous Island, and was the first that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire beyond the habitable Earth. For he twice passed
the Seas out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> where he fought many Battels with the
<hi>Brittans,</hi> in which he did more hurt to the Enemies, than enrich his own men:
therefore this War had not such success as he expected, which made him only
to take pledges of the King and to impose a yearly Tribute upon him, and so
returned back into <hi>Gaul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was no sooner landed there,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Julias</hi> death.</note> but he met with Letters which advertised
from <hi>Rome</hi> of the death of his Daughter, the Wife of <hi>Pompey,</hi> for which
they both of them were very sorrowful: and by this means the league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> was broken, to the great prejudice of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
<hi>Caesars</hi> Army being very great, he sent it into several Garrisons
for their Winter Quarters, and returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> as he used to do. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which time all <hi>Gaul</hi> rebelled again, and had raised great Armies, who
were led by one <hi>Ambiorix.</hi> These did first set upon the Garrisons of <hi>Catta,</hi>
and <hi>Titurius,</hi> whom they slew together with all their men. Then they went
with sixty thousand men, and besieged the Garrison which <hi>Quintus Cicero</hi> had
in charge, and had almost taken it by storm, <hi>Ciceroes</hi> Souldiers being all wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet they shewed such valour that they did more than men in their own
defence.
This news comming to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was far off, he returned with
all possible speed, and levying seven thousand Souldiers, he hasted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Cicero</hi> that was in great distress. The <hi>Gauls</hi> that besieged him, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Caesars</hi> comming, arose, and went to meet him, making little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his small number: <hi>Caesar</hi> to entrap them, still drew back, making
as though he fled from them, but still lodging in places of safety, and
commanded his men that they should not stir out to skirmish with them,
but rather to raise the ramparts of his Camp, and to fortifie the Gates, as men
affraid, that their Enemies might the less esteem them: But at length, he took
the opportunity when the Enemies came in a disordered manner to assault his
Camp,<note place="margin">He beats the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> and then sallying out, he routed, and slew a great number of them.</p>
            <p>This Act suppressed all the rebellions of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in those parts: Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
also went in the midst of Winter in those places where they did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:
for now he had a new supply out of <hi>Italy</hi> of three whole Legions to
fill up the rooms of those that were slain, of which <hi>Pompey</hi> lent him two,
and the other Legion was raised about the River <hi>Po.</hi> Shortly after there
brake out the greatest and most dangerous War that ever he had in <hi>Gaul,</hi>
which had been long designed by the chiefest and most War-like People
in all that Country, who had a very great Army, leavying multitudes
of men, and much Treasure to fortifie their strong holds: The Country
where they were was very hard to come into, especially then in the Winter
when the Rivers were high, and the Woods and Forrests covered with Snow,
the Meddows drowned with Floods, and the Snow so deep that no ways could
be discerned, all which might have discouraged <hi>Caesar</hi> from setting upon them;
the rather, because many Nations joyned in this conspiracy, of whom the chief
were the <hi>Vernians,</hi> and the <hi>Carnutes,</hi> who had chosed <hi>Vercingentorix</hi> for their
Captain. He divided his Army into divers places, under divers Captains,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103996:106"/>
and drawn into his assistance all the Nations as far as to the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea: So
that if he had tarried a little longer till <hi>Caesar</hi> had been ingaged in his Wars
with <hi>Pompey,</hi> he had put all <hi>Italy</hi> into great fear and danger.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Caesar,</hi> who knew his advantages, and how to take the best opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
as soon as he heard of this Rebellion,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> rebel.</note> he hasted towards them, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to let them know, that they had to do with an Army that was invincible,
and which they could not possibly withstand, seeing they had marched with
such speed in so hard a Winter. This made them wonder when they saw him
burning and destroying their Country, when they thought him far off. Such
Towns and strong Forts as yielded to him, he received to mercy. But the
<hi>Hedui,</hi> who used to be stiled the Brethren of the <hi>Romans,</hi> taking Arms against
him, much discouraged his men: wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> went through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the <hi>Lingones</hi> to enter into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who were consederates with the
<hi>Romans.</hi> Thither the Enemies followed him, endeavouring to compass him
in on every side. <hi>Caesar</hi> tarried their coming, and then fighting with them a
long time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them.</note> he at last overcame them. Of those which fled, most of them
together with their King got into the City of <hi>Alexia,</hi> which <hi>Caesar</hi> presently
besieged, though it seemed inexpugnable, both in regard of the hight of the
Walls, and the many hands to defend them. During this Siege <hi>Caesar</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a very great danger: For three hundred thousand of the best Souldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Gauls</hi> came against him, besides those within the City, who
were seventy thousand fighting men, so that finding himself to be shut in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two such mighty Armies, he was faign to fortifie himself with two
Walls: One against those within <hi>Alexia,</hi> and the other against those without.
And truly the Battel which he wan at this place, gat him more honour than
any other that ever he fought before. For in this extream danger he shewed
more Valour and Wisdom, and courage than in any other. And this was
wonderful, that they within the City never heard of their Friends that came
to assist them, till <hi>Caesar</hi> had overcome them: Yea, <hi>Caesars</hi> own men that
guarded the Wall against the City, knew nothing of the Battel till they heard
the cries and lamentations of those in the City, when they saw the <hi>Romans</hi>
bring into their Camp such a number of Shields glistering with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
such store of bloody Corslets, and Armour, such a deal of Plate, and
movables, and such a number of Tents, and Pavilions of the <hi>Gauls</hi> which
the <hi>Romans</hi> had gotten of their spoils. Thus the greatest part of this huge Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
were slain: and as for those within the City, when they had done and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
much hurt, they at last yielded, and <hi>Vercingentorix,</hi> went out of the
City richly Armed, and his Horse furnished with brave, and glittering Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,
and rode about <hi>Caesar</hi> who sat in his Chair of State. Then allighting,
he took off the Caparisons, and stript himself of his Armour, and prostrated
himself on the Ground, and then went and sat down at <hi>Caesars</hi> feet, speaking
never a word. <hi>Caesar</hi> after a while committed him to Prison to be led in his
Triumph at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Caesar</hi> had long since projected the distruction of <hi>Pompey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Non vult</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarve <hi>priorem,</hi> Pompeiusve <hi>parem.</hi>
               </note> as <hi>Pompey</hi>
had done the like for him. Nothing kept <hi>Caesar</hi> from being the Greatest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
but <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and nothing kept <hi>Pompey</hi> from being supream but
<hi>Caesar.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Pompey</hi> had set light by <hi>Caesar,</hi> thinking that he could crush
him when he pleased: But <hi>Caesar</hi> went more cunningly to work: for to attain
his end, he procured to be sent into <hi>Gaul,</hi> where he exercised and and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Army, and by his valiant deeds purchased fame and honour: so that
now he lacked nothing but an occasion to put his design in practice, which
<hi>Pompey</hi> partly gave him, and the iniquity of the times much furthered it.
For such as sued for honours and Offices, bought the voices of the People
shamefully, who therefore came to the Market-place, not to give their voices,
but with Bows, and Slings, and Swords: and the Assembly seldom brake up,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103996:106"/>
but the Pulpit for Orations was besprinkled with the blood of the slain,<note place="margin">Disorders at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> so that
many Wise men believed, that there was no other cure of these evils but by
putting the supream authority into one mans hand; and many wished that
<hi>Pompey</hi> were the man: But he seemed to decline it, though cunningly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
he laboured to be chosen <hi>Dictator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> smelling his drift, perswaded the Senate rather to make him sole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
thereby to satisfy his ambition:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> sole Consul.</note> This was done accordingly, and the
time also for the Government of his Provinces was prorogued: they allowed
him also a thousand Talents yearly out of the publick Treasury where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to pay his Souldiers. Hereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> took occasion to send his
men to <hi>Rome,</hi> to sue in his name for the Consulship, and for the prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Government. This was too indiscreetly opposed by <hi>Marcellus</hi> and
<hi>Lentulus,</hi> and many things were spoken in his disgrace. They took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
also the freedom from the Collonies which <hi>Caesar</hi> had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them. And when <hi>Marcellus</hi> was Consul, he caused one of those Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators
to be whipt, saying, that he gave him those marks, that he
might be known to be no Citizen of <hi>Rome;</hi> and bad him go and tell <hi>Caesar</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Caesar</hi> opened his Treasures which he had got in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and
gave it freely among the Magistrates of <hi>Rome.</hi> He set <hi>Curio</hi> the Tribune,
cleer out of debt: He gave to the Consul <hi>Paul</hi> fifteen hundred Talents,
wherewith he built a stately Theater. <hi>Pompey</hi> now beginning to fear, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have a successour sent to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and withal sent for his two Legions,
which <hi>Caesar</hi> returned to him, bountifully rewarding every Souldier: and
they which brought these Legions back, disgraced <hi>Caesar</hi> all they could, and
told <hi>Pompey</hi> that if <hi>Caesars</hi> Souldiers did but once see him, they would all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<hi>Caesar</hi> and cleave to him.<note place="margin">Pompey delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> This made <hi>Pompey</hi> more secure, that neglected
to prepare for War. One of <hi>Caesars</hi> Captains coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and moving
the Senate to have his government prorogued, they delaying their answer, he
laid his hand upon his Sword, and said, <hi>Sith you will not grant it him, this shall
give it him. Caesar</hi> seemed to be very reasonable in what he requested, For
he said, that whilst they required him to lay down Arms for fear of a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and yet permitted <hi>Pompey</hi> to keep his, they went about to establish a
Tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curio</hi> in the name of <hi>Caesar</hi> moved before all the People, that both should be
commanded to lay down Arms, which motion was entertained with great
joy and clapping of hands by the People, who threw Nose-gays, and flowers
upon him for it.<note place="margin">Factions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> Then <hi>Anthony</hi> one of the Tribunes, brought a Letter from
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and read it before the People in spite of the Consuls, wherein he desired
that they would grant him <hi>Gaul</hi> on this side the <hi>Alps,</hi> and <hi>Illyria</hi> with two
Legions only, and then he would desire no more: But <hi>Scipio</hi> the Father in
Law of <hi>Pompey,</hi> moved in the Senate, that if <hi>Caesar</hi> did not dismiss <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

by a day appointed, that then he should be proclaimed an Enemy to <hi>Rome,
Marcellus</hi> also added, that they must use force of Arms and not Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Thief; whereupon the Senate rose without determining any thing,
and every one put on his mourning apparel as in the time of a common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
<hi>Cicero</hi> being newly come from his Government in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> took much
pains to reconcile them together, and perswaded <hi>Pompey</hi> all he could, who
told him that he would yield to whatsoever he desired, so he would let him
alone with his Army: But <hi>Lentulus</hi> the Consul shamefully drave <hi>Curio</hi> and
<hi>Anthony</hi> out of the Senate, who were in such danger that they were faign to
flie out of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Caesar,</hi> disguised in a Carriers coat. This gave <hi>Caesar</hi> great
advantage, and much incensed his men, when they saw and heard how his
Friends were abused.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> at this time had about him but five thousand Foot, and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

               </note> having left the rest of his Army on the other side of the <hi>Alps,</hi> to
be brought after him by his Lieutenants: Judging it better suddenly to steal
upon them at <hi>Rome,</hi> then to assail them with his whole Army, which would
require time, and give his Enemies opportunity to strengthen themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. He therefore commanded his Captains to go before, and to take
in the City of <hi>Ariminum</hi> (a great City on this side the <hi>Alps</hi>) with as little
bloodshed as might be. Then committing the rest of those Souldiers which he
had with him, to <hi>Hortensius,</hi> he spent a whole day in seeing the Sword Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
exercise before him. At Night he went unto his lodging, where having
bathed himself a little, he came into the Hall, and made merry with those
whom he had bidden to Supper. Then rising from the Table, he prayed his
Guests to be merry, and he would come again to them presently: howbeit
he had secretly before directed his most trusty Friends to follow him: not all
together, but some on way, and some another. Himself in the mean time
took a Coach that he had hired, and pretending at first to go another way, he
suddenly turned towards <hi>Ariminum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when he came to the River of <hi>Rubicorn,</hi> which divides the hither <hi>Gaul</hi>
from <hi>Italy,</hi> he suddenly made a stop (for if he once passed that, there could
be no hope of peace) considering with himself of what importance this
passage was, and what miseries would ensue upon it. Some say that he
spake thus to his Friends: <hi>Doubtless if I forbear to pass over this River, it will
be the beginning of my ruin; if I pass it, the ruin will be general:</hi> Then turning
towards the River. he said, <hi>it is yet in our power to turn back, but if we pass the
River we must make our way with our Weapons.</hi> Some say, that <hi>Caesar</hi> standing
thus doubtful, he was encouraged by the apparition of a man of very great
stature, piping upon a Reed, whereupon many of the Souldiers and some
Trumpeters went neer to hear him, and that he catching one of their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
leaped into the River, sounding to the Battel with a mighty blast, and so
passed on to the farther side of the River: Whereupon <hi>Caesar,</hi> with a furious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
cryed out, <hi>Let us go whether the Gods, and the injurious dealing of our
Enemies do call us. The Dice are cast. I have set up my Rest, Come what will
of it:</hi>
               <note place="margin">He passes <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicon.</hi>
               </note> After which he set spurs to his Horse, and passed the River his Army
following him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having passed the River and drawn his Army together, he made
an Oration to them, shedding some tears, and tearing his Garment down
the Breast, laying before them the equity of his cause, and craving their
assistance. To whom, having with a general applause and consent made
answer; that they were ready to obey his will, he presently marched on
and came the next day to <hi>Ariminum,</hi> upon which he seized. The like
he did to all the Towns and Castles as he passed on, till he came to
<hi>Corfinium</hi> which was held by <hi>Domitius,</hi> who in a factious tumult had
been nominated for his successour in the Government of <hi>Gaul.</hi> This being
taken, he pardoned the Souldiers, and Inhabitants, and used <hi>Domitius</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
giving him leave to depart (who went straight to <hi>Pompey</hi>) by which cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
he purchased to himself much honour. These thirty Cohorts he kept
with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesars</hi> resolution being known at <hi>Rome,</hi> it troubled <hi>Pompey,</hi> amazed the
Senate, and terrified the common People. <hi>Pompey</hi> now found himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
who before could not believe that <hi>Caesar</hi> would thrust himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so great danger, or that he could be able to raise sufficient forces to
resist him: but the success proved otherwise. For though <hi>Pompey</hi> had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from the Consuls and Senate to leavy Souldiers, to call home his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
and to send Captains for the defence of those Cities in <hi>Italy</hi> by which
<hi>Caesar</hi> should pass, yet all this was not sufficient to resist his fury; and the power
that he brought with him. The fame of <hi>Caesars</hi> coming increasing daily, <hi>Pompey,</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:103996:107"/>
with the whole Senate left <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> flies and the Senate.</note> going to <hi>Capua,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Brundusium,</hi>
a Sea Town seated at the mouth of the Gulph of <hi>Venice,</hi> where he ordered the
Consuls to pass to <hi>Dyrrhachium,</hi> (now <hi>Durazzo</hi>) a Sea Town of <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
there to unite all their Forces, being out of hope to resist <hi>Caesar</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> who
had already taken <hi>Corfinium,</hi> where, having drawn <hi>Domitius</hi>'s thirty Cohorts
to serve him, he marched on, and hearing that <hi>Pompey</hi> and the Consuls were
at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> he hasted towards them with his Legions with all possible speed.
But <hi>Pompey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> pursues him.</note> though he had fortified the Town sufficiently for his defence,
yet when <hi>Caesar</hi> began to invest the Town, he imbarked himself and his men
in the night time, and so passed over to <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> to the Consuls. Thus
<hi>Caesar</hi> injoyed <hi>Italy</hi> without opposition, yet was he doubtful what to resolve
on: He would gladly have followed <hi>Pompey</hi> but wanted Shipping, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Winter, he knew that Ships could not be procured so soon as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site:
and considering with all, that it was not safe to leave an Enemy behind
him, which might cause an alteration in <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Italy;</hi> he resolved first to
go into <hi>Spain,</hi> which held for <hi>Pompey,</hi> and where he had his best Legions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the command of <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Afranius,</hi> saying to his Friends, <hi>Let us go
against an Army which wants a Captain, and afterwards we will go against a Captain
that wants an Army.</hi> For <hi>Pompeys</hi> Souldiers in <hi>Spain</hi> were very valiant, and
had been long exercised in Armes, but their Commanders were neither Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
nor expert in War. But on the contrary, <hi>Pompey</hi> was a most Wise and
Valiant Captain, but his Souldiers were newly levyed, and of small expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> returning from <hi>Brundusium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is Lord of all <hi>Italy,</hi> And went to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> in sixty days space became Lord of all
<hi>Italy,</hi> and when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> the People were in great fear, remembring
the miseries they had suffered under <hi>Sylla:</hi> But <hi>Caesar</hi> using his accustomed cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
hurt no man, high nor low: He called the Senators together which
remained there, comforting them with mild and good words; and laying
the whole fault upon <hi>Pompey,</hi> he sought to justifie his own cause, declaring
how much he desired Peace, with all, requesting that Ambassadours might
be sent to <hi>Pompey</hi> to procure the same: And causing himself present to
be chosen Consul, he opened the Treasury, though <hi>Metellus,</hi> one of
the Tribunes of the People, opposed him, and the Treasure which he
took from thence, which was very great, he distributed amongst his
Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Then was he desirous to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> first taking order for the civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
and making choice of the Legions which should go with him,
he left the rest in <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and <hi>Otranto,</hi> and other strong places upon the
Sea Coast, to keep <hi>Pompey</hi> from landing if he should attempt to retùrn into
<hi>Italy.</hi> He also made <hi>Hortensius,</hi> and <hi>Dolabella</hi> his Captains to provide Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to be brought into the Port of <hi>Brundusium,</hi> there to be in a readiness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his return from <hi>Spain: Quintus Valerius</hi> he sent with a Legion into <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia</hi>
against <hi>Marcus Cotta</hi> which held the same for <hi>Pompey.</hi> To <hi>Sicily</hi> he sent
<hi>Curius,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Cato,</hi> with direction that having taken the same, he should
pass over into <hi>Africk. Lepidus</hi> he sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> as Prefect thereof, and <hi>Mark
Anthony</hi> he made Governour of all <hi>Italy:</hi> And resolving to leave <hi>Lucinius Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
in <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He went into <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> with his accustomed celerity he went on his Journey, finding
no resistance, neither in <hi>Italy</hi> nor <hi>France,</hi> till he came to <hi>Marcelleis,</hi> which
held for <hi>Pompey,</hi> This City he besieged, and to avoid loss of time, left <hi>Decius
Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Caius Trebonius</hi> with sufficient Forces, who indured much in the
siege: himself hasted into <hi>Spain,</hi> where, being expected, <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Petre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius</hi>
attended him with four <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, and the aid of their Friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whom, and <hi>Caesar</hi> the War continued for some while, chiefly about
the City of <hi>Lerida.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At first <hi>Caesar</hi> was in great danger and much distressed chiefly for want of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103996:108"/>
Victuals, as also for that the Winter was come on, which troubled him with
the swelling of Rivers, before and after which, there passed many great skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
between the two Armies.<note place="margin">And conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pompeys</hi> men.</note> And <hi>Caesar,</hi> watching his opportunities,
at last brought his adversaries to such distress that they perished with hunger,
and were forced to come to a composition, which was, that the Legions
should have liberty to go whither they pleased: and so part of them
took pay of <hi>Caesar,</hi> the rest departed, and <hi>Petreius,</hi> and <hi>Afranius</hi> went
to <hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This War being ended, and the Spring come, <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he might leave
no Enemy behind him, marched into the Province of <hi>Betica</hi> (now <hi>Andaluzia</hi>)
with part of his forces, commanding the rest to march whither he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and there to stay for him, because <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> held that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
for <hi>Pompey</hi> against <hi>Caesar</hi> with one good Legion: But he, not daring to
oppose <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And other places.</note> delivered up the Legion to him, together with that Country,
and all was pacified there. From thence <hi>Caesar</hi> went to <hi>Cordova,</hi> where he
called a Parliament of all the States of that Province, in which he highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
them, and those of <hi>Sivil</hi> for taking his part, and so marching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he came to the Isle of <hi>Cadez,</hi> where having gotten Ships in readiness,
he left <hi>Quintus Cassius</hi> with four Legions in that Province, and so embarking,
he went to <hi>Taragona,</hi> commanding his Legions to march by Land thither,
where having settled his affairs, he advanced with his Army towards <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He takes <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleis.</hi>
               </note> and from thence to <hi>Marcelleis,</hi> which now yielded to him, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
many calamities during the Siege: <hi>Caesar</hi> respecting the antiquity and
fame of this City, would not destroy it, nor the Inhabitants, but leaving a
strong Garrison in it, he ordered his Legions to march for <hi>Italy,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with a sufficient guard, and some of his Friends took passage by Sea to
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though all things succeeded thus well with <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Captains had ill success.</note> yet some of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
had ill success. For <hi>Caius Antonius,</hi> whom he left with <hi>Dolabella</hi> for
to command his Navy, was overthrown and taken Prisoner in the Gulph of
<hi>Venice</hi> by <hi>Octavius,</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Pompey.</hi> In which overthrow this was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
remarkable: <hi>Anthony</hi> was faign to put his men into long Boats for want
of Ships, which were taken by a Strategem as in a toil, by the <hi>Pompeians,</hi>
with Ropes under the Water. One of them which had in it a thousand vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
young men, being thus ensnared, was assaulted by the Enemies whole
Army, against which they defended themselves bravely from morning till
night, and in the end being oppressed with the multitude, by the perswasion
of <hi>Valteius,</hi> their Collonel, they all slew one another, rather than they would
fall into the Enemies hand. <hi>Dolabella</hi> was likewise overthrown near to the Island
of <hi>Corcyra</hi> (now <hi>Corfu:</hi>) and <hi>Curius,</hi> who went with his two Legions into
<hi>Africk,</hi> though at first he had good success, yet afterwards he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
and most of his men slain by <hi>Juba,</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania, Pompeys</hi>
Friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being come to <hi>Rome</hi> and made Dictator, new Consuls were chosen,
whereof he being one, layed aside his Dictatorship, and provided <hi>Praetors</hi> for
the Provinces as himself pleased. He sent <hi>Marcus Lepidus</hi> into <hi>Spain: Aulus
Albinus</hi> into <hi>Sicily: Sextus Peduceius</hi> into <hi>Sardinia;</hi> and <hi>Decius Brutus</hi> into
<hi>France;</hi> and taking such further order as he thought good, he departed from
<hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>December</hi> towards <hi>Brundusium,</hi> whither he commanded all his Forces
to march, there to take passage for <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where he knew that <hi>Pompey</hi>
staid with his Army: who all that whole year that <hi>Caesar</hi> spent in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for War.</note> busied himself to provide a Navy wherein to return into <hi>Italy,</hi>
and in gathering Treasure, and levying Souldiers, having made an exceeding
great provision of all things. For there came unto him, Ships, money, and
men from sundry Kingdoms and Provinces both of <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Greece:</hi> as from
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103996:108"/>
               <hi>Syria, Pontus, Bithynia, Cilicia, Phoenicia, Cappadocia, Pomphilia, Armenia
Minor, Aegypt, Greece, Thessaly, Baeotia, Achaia, Epirus, Athens, Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia,</hi>
the Isles of <hi>Creet,</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and from many other Countries. There
came also to his aid King <hi>Deiotarus,</hi> and <hi>Aribarzanes,</hi> of all which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with those which he brought with him from <hi>Italy,</hi> he compounded
a very great Army by Land, and a very great Fleet of Ships and Gallies
by Sea.</p>
            <p>It being now the depth of Winter, <hi>Pompey</hi> presuming it improbable, if
not impossible for <hi>Caesar</hi> to pass the Seas to him; having also intelligence that
<hi>Caesar</hi> was in <hi>Rome,</hi> he disposed of his Army to their Winter Quarters in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi>
and <hi>Thessaly;</hi> and himself retired farther from the Sea, commanding
his Sea-Captains (of whom <hi>Marcus Bibulus</hi> was chief) to guard the Sea-coast.
But <hi>Caesar</hi> knowing that in the speedy execution consisted his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
hopes of Victory, and that occasion once lost could hardly be recovered,
he departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> and came to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> though all his Legions
were not as yet come to him. There he embarked seven of his best Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
in such ships as were ready, sending a Command to the rest which
were coming, to hasten to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> whither he would send for them with
all possible speed.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. Now <hi>Brindez.</hi>
               </note> And so departing, he crossed the Seas with a prosperous
gale of Wind, and the third day after arrived upon the coast of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
before <hi>Pompey</hi> had any intelligence of his embarking. There he
safely landing his men in dispite of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Captains, and commanded his
Ships and Gallies presently to return to <hi>Brundisium</hi> to fetch the rest of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Presently after his first landing, he seized upon the Cities of <hi>Appallonia,</hi>
and <hi>Erico,</hi> driving from thence <hi>Lucius Torquatus,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Straberius,</hi> who
held them for <hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> hearing of <hi>Caesars</hi> arrival, sent for his Troops which were neerest
hand with all speed possible, with whom he marched towards <hi>Dirrachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
where his Victuals, ammunition, and other provisions for the War lay,
lest <hi>Caesar</hi> should go and surprise them, which indeed he attempted but in vain,
the situation of the place making it inexpugnable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> being come, their Camps were lodged within a few furlongs each
of other,<note place="margin">Skirmishes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</note> where he passed many adventurous skirmished, and also some Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Peace, offered by <hi>Caesar,</hi> but rejected by <hi>Pompey,</hi> so consident he was
of his own power. In the interim <hi>Caesar</hi> daily expected the coming of the
other Legions, who staying longer than he expected, he resolved in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
with three confident Servants, secretly to embark himself in a Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,
and to pass that streight of the Sea and to fetch them, hoping to
perform the same without the knowledg of any. And accordingly, passing
down the River to the Sea, he found it so troublesome and tempestuous that
the Master of his Brigandine (not knowing whom he carried) durst not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
forth, but would have returned. Then <hi>Caesar</hi> discovering his face,
said, <hi>Perge avdactèr:</hi> Caesarum <hi>enim fers, &amp; fortunam</hi> Caesaris:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> Bear up
bravely, and boldly against the Winds and Waves: for thou carriest <hi>Caesar,</hi>
and all his Fortunes. The Master herewith encouraged, strove all that
possibly he could to proceed in his Voyage: but the force of the Tempest was
so great, and the Wind so contrary, that do what possibly they could, they
were driven back again.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Caesars</hi> Army heard of these passages, they much wondred, grieved
and were troubled at it: Commending him more for his Valour, than for his
Wisdom: But within few days after <hi>M. Anthony</hi> arrived with four of those
Legions which were left behind in <hi>Italy,</hi> presently returning the Ships back for
the rest. <hi>Anthony</hi> after some adventures, joyned with <hi>Caesars</hi> Army near to <hi>Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachium</hi>
where we lately left him. Frequent skirmishes still continued between
the two Armies, and many were slain on both sides, and one day the skirmish
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103996:109"/>
was so hot, supplies being sent from both sides, that it almost came to a
just Battel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> is bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> wherein <hi>Caesars</hi> men were so beaten, that they fled before the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and could not be made to stand by any intreaties, or menaces, till they
were come into their Camp, which they had strongly fortified: yet many
durst not trust to that, but fled out of it: But <hi>Pompey</hi> either because he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
their flight to be faigned to draw him into an Ambush, or because he
thought there needed no more to be done, and that <hi>Caesar</hi> could no more resist
him, he neglected to prosecute his Victory, causing a retreat to be sounded
without assaulting <hi>Caesars</hi> Camp, which, probably, he might have taken,
and made an end of the War that day. Whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> said to his Friends:
<hi>Truly this day had ended the War, if our Enemies had had a Captain that had known
how to overcome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Caesar</hi> lost a great number of his men, amongst whom were
four hundred <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, ten Tribunes (or Collonels) and thirty two
Centurions (or Captains) and his Enemies took from him thirty two
Ensigns. Upon this Victory <hi>Pompey</hi> sent news thereof to divers parts of the
World, holding himself for an absolute Conquerour. <hi>Caesar</hi> much blamed
some of his Captains and Ensign beàrers for their cowardize, and his Army
were so grieved and ashamed, that they much importuned him to lead them
forth again to Battel: But he thought it not fit so soon to lead them forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Victorious Army.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> policy.</note> He therefore sent his sick and wounded men to
the City of <hi>Apolonia,</hi> and departed by night with as great silence as could be
from the place where he was, and marched towards <hi>Thessaly,</hi> intending there
to refresh and encourage his Army, and to draw his Enemies farther from the
Sea coast, where their chief strength lay, and where their Camp was well
fortified, and victualled, or at least he intended to attempt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who (as he heard) was coming to joyn with
<hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> finding <hi>Caesar</hi> was departed, followed him for some few days; and
then taking Councel what to do,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompeys</hi> good resolution.</note> he resolved to leave a lufficient Navy to
guard the Seas, and with the rest to return into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to seize upon it,
together with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and afterwads to go against <hi>Caesar:</hi> But the
<hi>Roman</hi> Lords that were with him, and the importunity of his unskilful Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Souldiers, forced him to alter his determination, and presently to
pursue <hi>Caesar,</hi> who made an <hi>Alt</hi> in the Fields of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> which are in <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saly,</hi>
making his retreat with so much prudence, and in so good order, that
upon all occasions that were offered he ever had the better; till at length see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his men full of resolution and courage, he resolved no longer to
defer the Fight. Concerning which Battel: the ordering, and event of
it:<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> having obtained this great and glorious Victory, used therein
his accustomed Clemency,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.</note> not suffering any <hi>Roman</hi> either to be slain or hurt
after the Battel was ended, but pardoned all those that were either taken in the
Fight, or found in the Camp, amongst whom was <hi>Marcus Tullius Cicero.</hi>
After which,<note place="margin">He pursues <hi>Pompey.</hi>
               </note> being informed which way <hi>Pompey</hi> was fled, he pursued him
with the lightest, and swiftest of his Army, and in the way subduing
all the Cities, he at last came to the Sea side, where he gathered together
all the Ships and Gallies that possibly he could, together with those whom
<hi>Cassius</hi> had brought, he therein shipped as many of his men as they could
contain, and passed into the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> where, being advertised that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
had been in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he presumed that he was gone into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he steered the same course, taking with him two Legions of old
Souldiers only.<note place="margin">He comes into <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
               </note> When he arrived at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he understood that
<hi>Pompey</hi> presuming upon the many benefits, and good entertainment
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103996:109"/>
which the Father of this King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had received in his House, had sent to
this <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to harbour and assist him: which accordingly the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
and <hi>Pompey</hi> coming upon his safe conduct, in a small Boat, was by
the false Kings commandment basely murthered, thinking thereby to win the
favour of <hi>Caesar.</hi> He understood likewise that <hi>Cornelia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Pompey,</hi>
and his Son <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> were fled from thence in the same ship wherein
they came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being landed, and received into the City, they brought him for a
present the Head of the <hi>Great Pompey;</hi> but he turned away and would not
see it, and when they brought him <hi>Pompeys</hi> Ring with his Seal of Arms, he
wept,<note place="margin">Vanity of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</note> considering the end and success of the great adventures and properties
of <hi>Pompey,</hi> who with such honour and fame had Triumphed three times, and
been so many times Consul in <hi>Rome:</hi> and had obtained so many Victories
abroad.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Caesar</hi> was landed in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> he found the Country imbroiled in
Civil Wars: there being great discord between young King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and
his Sister <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> about the division and Inheritance of that Kingdom,
wherein <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> (as being a <hi>Roman</hi> Consul) took upon him to be an
Arbitrator. For which cause, or because their guilty consciences accused
them for the treacherous murther of <hi>Pompey, Fotinus</hi> the Eunuch, who had
contrived the said murther, and <hi>Achillas,</hi> who had been the actor of it, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Caesar</hi> inclined to favour <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> sent for the Kings Army that lay
near the City, consisting of twenty thousand good Souldiers, purposing to
do by <hi>Caesar</hi> as they had done by <hi>Pompey,</hi> so that within a few days, there
began between <hi>Caesar</hi> and his small Army, both in the City, and in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
where the Ships and Gallies lay, the most cruel, and dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
that ever <hi>Caesar</hi> met with:<note place="margin">His Wars i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
               </note> for he was often forced to fight in his
own Person, both within the City (whereof the Enemies held the greater
part) and also in the Harbour with his Ships, and was sometimes in so great
peril and danger, that he was forced to leap out of the Boat into the Water,
and by swimming to get one of the Gallies;<note place="margin">His danger.</note> at which time he held his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
in one hand above Water, and carry his Robe in his teeth, and to
swim with the other hand. But when his other Forces were come to him
from <hi>Asia,</hi> and other parts, he at the end of nine months (for so long
these Wars lasted) became Victorious,<note place="margin">His Victory.</note> as in all other his enterprises he
had been, and the young King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was slain in fight. In this War
<hi>Caesar</hi> did such exploits, and behaved himself so gallantly, that for
the same only he well deserved the fame and name of a brave Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>The Pride of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> being thus tamed, <hi>Caesar</hi> put to death the
murtherers of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and established the fair <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the Queen and
Governess of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whom, during his stay there, he intertained for his
Friend, and had a Son by her called <hi>Caesarion.</hi> And when he had quitted and
settled all things in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He passes into <hi>Asia.</hi>
               </note> he departed thence into <hi>Asia,</hi> and travelled
through <hi>Syria</hi> (now <hi>Soria</hi>) being informed, that during his troubles in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
King <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> the Son of that mighty King <hi>Methridates,</hi> thought it
a fit time, whilst the <hi>Romans</hi> were embroiled in Civil Wars, to recover what
his Father had lost: For which end having overthrown <hi>Domitius,</hi> whom
<hi>Caesar</hi> had sent to govern those parts, and having taken by force of Arms
the Provinces of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> expelling thence King <hi>Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes</hi>
(a Friend and Subject of <hi>Rome</hi>) and beginning to do the like in
<hi>Armenia the less,</hi> which King <hi>Deiotarus</hi> had subjected to the <hi>Romans: Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
(I say) being informed hereof, went with his Army sooner than
<hi>Pharnaces</hi> imagined, though he expected him, and had intelligence
of his appproach; so that in few days they came to a Battel, in which the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103996:110"/>
King was soon overthrown,<note place="margin">Overcomes <hi>Pharnaces.</hi>
               </note> and put to slight, with great slaughter of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
yet himself escaped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> was very joyful for this Victory, because of his earnest desire to return
to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he knew that many scandals were raised, and many insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
were committed for want of his presence: He knew also that <hi>Pompeys</hi>
eldest Son had seized upon a great part of <hi>Spain,</hi> and had raised great Forces
of those which <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> had left there, and of his Fathers Troops. He
also understood, that in <hi>Africa</hi> many Principal <hi>Romans,</hi> who had escaped
from the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> were gathered together, whereof <hi>M. Cato</hi> (sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Uticensis</hi>) was the chief, and <hi>Scipio, Pompeys</hi> Father in Law, and that
these went thither with the greatest part of the Ships and Galleys which
belonged to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and with the greatest power that they were able to
leavy; and that joyning with <hi>Juba</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> they had subdued
all that Country, and had a great Army in a readiness to oppose him, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chosen <hi>Scipio</hi> for their General, because that <hi>Cato</hi> would not take that
office upon him, and for that the Name of <hi>Scipio</hi> had been so fortunate in
<hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having intelligence of all these things, within the space of a few
days, with great celerity and diligence recovered all that <hi>Pharnaces</hi> had usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and chasing him out of <hi>Portus</hi> he regained all those Countries: and so
leaving <hi>Celius Minucius</hi> for General, with two Legions to guard that Province,
pacifying the controversies and contentions in the rest, and rewarding the
Kings, and <hi>Tetrachs</hi> which continued firm in their Leagues and amity with
the <hi>Romans,</hi> without any longer aboad, he departed out of <hi>Asia,</hi> and in a
short space arrived in <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He comes to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and so passed to <hi>Rome,</hi> within little more than a
year after he went thence, which was a very short time for the performance of
so great matters, and so long a Journey.</p>
            <p>Presently after his comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he caused himself to be chosen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
the third time, and reforming (so much as the time and his leasure would
permit) all disorders in <hi>Rome,</hi> being troubled and not able to endure that his
Enemies should possess <hi>Africk,</hi> with great expedition he prepared all things
necessary, and from <hi>Rome</hi> took his way towards <hi>Africk,</hi> commanding his
Army to follow him.<note place="margin">He passes into <hi>Africk.</hi>
               </note> First he went into <hi>Italy,</hi> from whence taking Ship,
he passed over into <hi>Africk,</hi> and though neither his Navy, nor his Army ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
with him, trusting to the valour of those that he had with him, and
his own good Fortune, he landed with small Forces, near to the City of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drumentum,</hi>
and from thence marched to another City called <hi>Leptis,</hi> into
which he was received, and after some conflicts that passed, his Legions being
come to him, and certain other Troops of Horse, and Companies of Foot,
he began the War which continued four months. He first began with
<hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Lubienus;</hi> and then with <hi>Scipio</hi> and King <hi>Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

brought to those Wars eight thousand men, the one half whereof were
Horse.</p>
            <p>In this War were many encounters and Battels, in which <hi>Caesar</hi> was in
great danger: but at last (his good Fortune, still attending him) he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them in a great Battel, wherein there were slain of the Enemies ten
thousand,<note place="margin">He overcomes <hi>Scipio.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Caesar</hi> remained Master of the Field, and in a short time after,
subjected all the Country to him. <hi>Scipio,</hi> and all the chief Captains, with
him died sundry deaths, and <hi>Juba</hi> escaping by flight from the Battel, finding
no place of security, <hi>Afranius</hi> and he resolved to dye fighting one against the

and then commanded one of his Salves to kill him, and so he died despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.</p>

               <hi>Marcus Cato,</hi>

thitherward, though he knew that he would not put him to death, but
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103996:110"/>
but rather had a desire to pardon him and to do him honour; yet, resolving
neither to receive life nor honour from his Enemy, he slew himself: In whose
death there passed many remarkable accidents recorded by Historians: <hi>Florus</hi>
saith thus of it. <hi>Cato</hi> (saith he) hearing of the death of his Partners, he
dallyed not at all, but joyfully hastened his end: For after he had embraced
his Son, and his Friends and bad them good night, and then rested a while
upon his bed, having first perused <hi>Plato's</hi> Book of the immortality of the Soul:
then about the relieving of the first watch he got up, drew his Sword, and
therewith thrust himself through: after which the Phisicians applied plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to his wounds, which he indured whilst they were in the room, but
then he pulled them away, and the blood following abundantly, he left his
dying hand even in the wound. <hi>Scipio,</hi> who had been General in this War,
escaped also from the Battel by flight, entered into some Gallies, which being
met with by <hi>Caesar</hi> Navy, that he might not fall into his Enemies hand, after
he had given himself some wounds, he threw himself into the Sea, and so vvas
drowned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having obtained so great and absolute a Victory, spent some few days
in settling and ordering the Provinces of <hi>Africa,</hi> making the Kingdom of <hi>Juba</hi>
a Province,<note place="margin">He returns to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and then marched to <hi>Utica,</hi> vvhere he imbarked <hi>June</hi> the third,

<hi>Rome</hi> the tvventy fifth day of <hi>July.</hi> At his comming thither there vvere grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

vvherein he conquered <hi>Pompey,</hi> he vvould not Triumph, because it vvas
against a Citizen of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Triumphs being ended, he gave great revvards to his Souldiers, and
entertained the People vvith Feasts, and bountiful gifts, and then caused
himself to be chosen the fourth time, Consul. And so, to the end that there
should be left no place wherein he would not be obeyed, he resolved to go for
<hi>Spain,</hi> hearing that <hi>Gneius Pompeius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Pompey,</hi> was retired with the
rest of the Army which had escaped out of <hi>Africk,</hi> to go to his Brother <hi>Sextus
Pompeius,</hi> who was in possession of a great part of <hi>Spain,</hi> as we heard before,
together with the famous Cities of <hi>Sivil,</hi> and <hi>Cordova,</hi> and many others of those
parts: many <hi>Spaniards</hi> also comming to their aid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> in this Journey carryed with him his most valiant,<note place="margin">He goes into <hi>Spain.</hi>

in which Journey his Nephew <hi>Octavius</hi> followed him. Entering into <hi>Spain</hi> he

with his Brother <hi>Gneius,</hi> and such Legions and Souldiers as they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

held it out with great resolution; and on the other side, the bravery and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of young <hi>Pompey</hi> and his men was such, and they fought in such manner,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103996:111"/>
as <hi>Caesars</hi> Squadrons began to give ground, and were ready to forsake the Field,
and at the very point to have been wholly overthrown: and the matter came
to this issue, that <hi>Caesar</hi> was about to have slain himself because he would not
see himself overcome. Yet taking a Target from one of his Souldiers, he
rushed into the midst of his Enemres, saying with a loud voice, <hi>If ye be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed,
leave me and deliver me into the hands of these Boyes; For this shall be the
last day of my Life and of your Honour:</hi> with which words, and his example,
his Souldiers took heart in such manner, that recovering the ground which
they had lost, the Battel became equal, which lasted almost a whole day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any sign of Victory to either party, sometimes seeming to incline to the
one, sometimes to the other side; until at the length <hi>Caesar</hi> and his men did
so great exploits, as that the evening being come, his Enemies began to faint,
and fly,<note place="margin">His Victory.</note> and the Victory was apparently <hi>Caesars.</hi> There died of the Enemies
above thirty thousand in this Battel, and <hi>Caesar</hi> lost above a thousand men of
account besides common Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> esteemed so much of this Victory, and so gloried in the danger which
he had escaped, that ever after he used to say, <hi>That in all other Battels he had
fought for honour and Victory, and only that day he fought for his life.</hi> Young
<hi>Pompey,</hi> after he had performed all the offices of a Prudent General and Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Souldier, was foreed to fly, and wandering through many places, was at
last taken and slain by some of <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends, who carried his head to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
His other Brother <hi>Sextus Pompeius,</hi> fled from <hi>Cordova,</hi> and afterwards forsook
<hi>Spain: Caesar</hi> recovered <hi>Sivil,</hi> and <hi>Cordova,</hi> and all the rest of the Country;
after which,<note place="margin">He returns to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> ordering his affaires in <hi>Spain</hi> after his pleasure, he returned to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and Triumphed for these Victories, which was his fifth and last Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> now came to be the most mighty, the most redoubted, and the most
highly esteemed man in the World,<note place="margin">His power.</note> having conquered and subdued the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part thereof, in as little time, as it might seem that another man might be
able to travel through those Countries by reasonable Journeys. He then
made himself perpetual Dictator, and so without opposition, he finished the
making of himself the Soveraign Lord, and Monarch of the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi>
within less than five years after he first attempted the same. And this was
the Original and beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours. For <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> would
not be called King (that Name being odious to the <hi>Romans</hi> above all things,
ever since Kings were first driven from <hi>Rome</hi>) but contented himself to be
called Perpetual Dictator, and Emperour, which Title was usually given to
the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals upon their obtaining any signal Victory. But after <hi>Julius
Caesar,</hi> all his successors took that Title, glorying to be called Emperour,
which hath ever since been held for the highest Title, and Dignity in the
World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having now attained to that absolute power which he had so ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
sought after,<note place="margin">His clemency, and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</note> he shewed in all his Deportment much clemency, and
Magnanimity, honouring and rewarding his Friends, and easily forgiving,
and very cheerfully pardoning all those that had been his Adversaries: Thus
he pardoned <hi>Brutus, Cassius, Cicero, Marcellus,</hi> and many others: Yea, some
of them he admitted to his company, and private familiarity, and to Offices
and Dignities; and amongst the many virtues wherewith he was endued, his
clemency and liberality were most glorious. But all this prevailed not with the
<hi>Romans</hi> to quench their desires after the recovery of their lost liberty, neither to
asswage the hatred and malice conceived against him by his adversaries, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rwards
appeared.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding many were discontented, yet some for love, others
for fear,<note place="margin">Discontents a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise.</note> and out of dissimulation, both Senate and People, yea all in general
gave him Names, preheminences and Titles of Honour, such as never had
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103996:111"/>
been given to any other man before him, neither ought to have been accepted
by him; and many were the more offended, because they knew that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
and desired them. They gave him the name of Emperour, Father,
Restorer, and Preserver of his Country. They made him perpetual Dictator,
and Consul for ten years: and perpetual Censor of their manners. His Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
was erected and set up amongst the Kings of <hi>Rome:</hi> and a Chair, and
Throne of Ivory was set up for him in the Temple, and in the Senate House,
and an high Throne in the Theater,<note place="margin">Base flattery.</note> and in the place where the Senators did
use to sit. His Pictures and Statues were set up in the Temples, and in all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
places. Some Titles they gave him, and he accepted of, which were
peculiar to the Gods. The month formerly called <hi>Quintile,</hi> they called <hi>Julius</hi>
after his name. They also built, and consecrated Temples to him, as they
did to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the other Gods, and gave him certain Honours which they
held proper for their Gods, and did him many other honours exceeding all
measure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> enjoying such honour and power, so that he had no equal,
no second in the World with whom he might contend, it seemed that he
would contend with himself, and attempt something wherein he might excel
himself: For he was not contented with all the Victories which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
neither to have fought fifty several Battels, in all which he was
Victorious, save in that one at <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> against <hi>Pompey:</hi> neither to have
slain in the Wars and Battels which he fought a Million, ninety, and odd
thousands of men, besides those that were slain in the civil Wars. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a most haughty mind,<note place="margin">His great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> he sought to do greater matters, if greater
could be.</p>
            <p>For first he resolved to pass into the East, there to conquer and subdue the
fierce Nations of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and to revenge the death of <hi>Marcus Crassus;</hi>
and from thence to pass through <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> and other Countries till he should
come to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and so through all the parts of <hi>Scithia, Asiatica;</hi>
and passing the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> to return through <hi>Scithia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> and in
his retreat to come into <hi>Germany,</hi> and other Conntries bordering thereupon,
conquering and subjecting all to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For which end he
presently caused to be levied in several places ten thousand Horsemen, and
sixteen Legions of chosen Footmen, and appointing the time wherein he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to begin his Journey, he commanded them to repair to their Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz.
He sought also not only to subdue all Nations, but to correct and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
even nature it self: For he purposed to have made an Island of <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
(now called <hi>Morea</hi>) by cutting the neck of land between the <hi>Egaean,</hi>
and the <hi>Jonian</hi> Seas. He purposed also to have altered the courses of the
River <hi>Tiber,</hi> and <hi>Anian,</hi> and to have made their new Channels, capable of
bearing great Ships. He ordered the digging down and levelling many high
Hills and Mountains, in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to dry up and drain great Lakes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
therein. He corrected the computation of the year, reforming it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the course of the Sun, and brought it into that order wherein it
now is. He did the like about the course of the Moon, and her conjunctions
and oppositions to the Sun: and this was attributed to him for Tyranny by
those that hated him.</p>
            <p>Many others things <hi>Caesar</hi> did, which were very remarkable, in reforming
the Laws, customs, and Offices. He re-edified the ruined City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in
<hi>Africk,</hi> and sent thither Colonies, and <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens to Inhabit it: the like
he did by <hi>Corinth.</hi> But all these works with his high conceits and undertakings,
were prevented, by his unexpected, and immature Death, which within a few
Days after ensued. A few men, and those unarmed bereft him of his Life, whom
no former forces could resist. For five months only he lived as Soveraign Lord in
Peace; when those in whom he reposed greatest trust conspired his Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:103996:112"/>
Some say that <hi>Caesar</hi> was counselled to have a Guard about him alwayes; to
which he answered, that he would have none: for that he had rather
die once, than live continually in fear. They which conspired his death,
were stirred up thereto, either out of hatred to his Person, or desire of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
accounting him for a Tyrant: or out of suspition that he would
have made himself a King, a thing in the highest degree hateful to the
<hi>Romans:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Pride.</note> and lastly, because he began to contemn others: For he used to
say, that the Commonwealth was but a Voice and Name without a Body,
or Substance; and that <hi>Sylla</hi> was a Fool for resigning his perpetual Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
All the whole Senate coming one Day to the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> where
he was, he sat still, and rose not up as formerly he used to do. His Friends
also and Favourites began to report, that in the Books of the <hi>Sybils</hi> (which
in <hi>Rome</hi> were had in great Veneration) it was written, that the <hi>Parthians</hi>
could never be overcome but by a man that should have the Title of a King,
and therefore he laboured that <hi>Caesar</hi> should take upon him that Title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his <hi>Parthian</hi> War; and though he seemed to be displeased at it, yet
they suspected the contrary; and their suspition was encreased, for that,
whereas the Tribunes of the People had caused a man to be imprisoned,
who had set a Crown upon the Head of one of <hi>Caesars</hi> Statues, he was
so incensed against the Tribunes that did it, that he deposed them from
their Office:<note place="margin">His dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> And not long after, when <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> (who was his great
favourite, and that year his fellow Consul) being at some publick Games,
came to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and put a Crown upon his Head; though he threw it down,
yet they all imagined, that <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> would not have presumed to have
done it without his good liking; and that he did it but to prove the People
how they would like it; these, and such like passages, gave them occasion to
desire and design his Death.</p>
            <p>They were also father encouraged hereunto, for that in sundry publick
places, certain writings were set up, which did intice and animate them to
conspire against him: as upon the Statue of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who in ancient times did
chase the Kings out of <hi>Rome,</hi> were written these words, <hi>Would to God thou wert
now living,</hi> Brutus. And upon the Image of <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> who then was
<hi>Praetor,</hi> and descended from the former <hi>Brutus,</hi> were these words: <hi>Thou
sleepest long,</hi> Brutus. <hi>Truly, thou art not</hi> Brutus. And again, <hi>Thou art dead,</hi>
Brutus: <hi>Would to God thou wert living, Thou art unworthy of the succession from the</hi>
Brute. <hi>Surely thou art not descended from the good</hi> Brutus: and such like other
writings were set upon these Statues.</p>
            <p>So as for these,<note place="margin">A Conspiracy against him.</note> and such like reasons, there were seventy of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
men in <hi>Rome</hi> that conspired to murther <hi>Caesar:</hi> of which the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
were <hi>Decius, Marcus Brutus, Caius Cassius, Gaius Casca, Attilius Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Servius Galba, Quintus Ligarius, Marcus Spurius,</hi> &amp;c. who, after divers
consultations, concluded to kill him upon the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> which was the
fifteenth day of that moneth, in the Temple where the Senators were
to sit that day: Yet <hi>Brutus</hi> was held to be <hi>Caesars</hi> Son, and had received great
honours, and many favours from him. This conspiracy was kept so secret,
notwithstanding the great number of them, that there was not any one
found that discovered the same.<note place="margin">His Death foretold.</note> But there were so many signes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies,
and to himself there happened so many fore-warnings, that (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing any cause) all men were of opinion that <hi>Caesars</hi> Death
was near at hand. <hi>Spurina</hi> also, who was his Southsayer, forewarned
him, to look to himself till the <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>March</hi> were past: for that his
Life was in great danger. And <hi>Caesars</hi> own Wife intreated him upon her
knees, that he would not that day go to the Senate; For she had dreamed
that he lay dead in her lap. These and such like warnings prevailed so far
with him, that he was about to send to <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> to make his excuse,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103996:112"/>
and to put off the Senate to another day. But what God hath determined
must come to pass; and therefore <hi>Brutus</hi> being present, advised him by no
means to discover any such fear, and so he resolved to go.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> made small account of Death, and said, <hi>That as for himself he had
won power and fame, and glory enough, and that at no time he could die with
greater honour.</hi> And some discoursing the night before he was slain, what
Death was best, <hi>Even that</hi> (quoth he) <hi>which is sudden, and least prepensed.</hi>
The fifteenth of <hi>March</hi> being come, he went from his house in a Litter, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Senate; and as he passed along the street, there was a Petition
delivered to him, wherein was set down in Writing all that was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this conspiracy; and he which gave it, prayed him to read it present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which he began to do: but there came so many to speak to him, that he
could make no farther progress, and this Paper was found in his hand when
he was dead. As he passed on, he met with <hi>Spurina</hi> the Southsayer, and
pleasantly jesting, he said to him, <hi>Dost thou not know</hi> Spurina, <hi>that the</hi> Ides <hi>of</hi>
March <hi>are come?</hi> Yea (answered <hi>Spurina</hi>) and I know that they are not yet past.</p>
            <p>When he came to the Temple where the Senators met, he alighted from
his Litter and went in, and having first done Sacrifice (according to the
custome) which all that saw presaged to be fatal and infortunate, He
sat him down in his Chair, and <hi>Brutus Albinus</hi> entertaining <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
at the door with discourse, one of the Conspirators, whose name
was <hi>Celer,</hi> came to <hi>Caesar,</hi> under a pretence to intrcat him to release a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his from Banishment, and presently all the rest of the Conspirators
drew near to his Chair; which when <hi>Caesar</hi> saw, thinking that they had
all come for the same purpose, he said unto them, <hi>What force is this?</hi> And
at that instant one of them whose name was <hi>Casca,</hi> beginning, they all drew
their poyniards, and Swords which they had privately under their Gowns,
and began to wound him. The first blow he received, <hi>Casca</hi> gave him in
the throat; at which <hi>Caesar</hi> said aloud, <hi>What dost thou Traitor</hi> Casca? and
wresting the Poyniard out of his hand, he arose and stabbed <hi>Casca</hi> through
the Arm, and being about to strike him again, he was prevented by
the many wounds which the others gave him, whilst with great force
and courage he leaped from one side to the other to defend himself:
But when he saw <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> with his drawn Sword in his hand,
wherewith he had already wounded him in the Thigh, he was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
and said in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, <hi>Why how now Son</hi> Brutus? <hi>And
thou also?</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is slain.</note> And having so said, seeing so many weapons bent against him,
and that no body came to his rescue, he remembred to keep the honour
of his Person, with his right hand he covered his Head with part of
his Robe, and with his left hand girt himself, and settled his clothes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him, and being so covered, he fell down to the ground, having
received three and twenty Wounds; and it happened that his fall was
at the foot of the seat on which <hi>Pompeys</hi> Statue stood.<note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> So in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
died one of the most Mighty, Worthy, Valiant, Wise, and most suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
Princes and Captains that ever was in the World. For, his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
Abilities, Invincible Mind, Incomparable Courage, the Battels
which he fought, and Victories which he obtained; the Provinces, Kings,
and Nations which he subdued; His Counsels, Policies, and Stratagems,
and bold attempts: His Magnanimity, Clemency, and Bounty, both to
the Conquered and Conquerors; the great Designs which he proposed to
himself a little before he was slain, being all weighed and considered, it
will plainly appear, that in none of those things aforesaid, nor in any
other that may be said of him, there hath been any Heathen King or Captain
that ever excelled him. And setting apart his Ambition and desire of Rule,
he was onely noted, and blamed for being too much given to Women.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:103996:113"/>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> was thus slain in the fifty sixth year of his Age, a little more than
four years after the Death of <hi>Pompey,</hi> in the seven hundred and tenth year
after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and about forty and two years before the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of our Blessed Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> left behind him neither Son nor Daughter legitimate at that time of
his Death: For though he had been four several times married, yet he had
but one only Daughter, named <hi>Julia,</hi> that was married to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and died
before him.<note place="margin">His Will.</note> Wherefore by his last Will, he adopted for his Son, and made
his Heir in the <hi>Dodrant,</hi> that is, in nine parts of twelve of his goods, his
Nephew <hi>Octavius Caesar,</hi> afterwards called <hi>Octavianus Augustus,</hi> who was the
Son of <hi>Acia,</hi> his Neece, and of <hi>Octavius Praetor</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
at this time, was, by the commandment of his Uncle, in the City of
<hi>Apollonia,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Epirus,</hi> where he applied himself to his studies,
staying for him there, thence to go with him to the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, being now
about seventeen years of age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being thus slain, the news of it ran presently all over the City, and
the tumult therein was so great, that no man knew what to do or say. All
Offices ceased, the Temples were all shut up, and every man was amazed.
<hi>Caesars</hi> Friends were afraid of those that slew him, and they as much feared
his Friends, <hi>Brutus, Cassius,</hi> and the other Conspirators, and others that
joyned with them, seeing the great tumult, durst not go to their Houses,
nor prosecute their other designs, for fear of <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the one was Consul, and the other General of the Horsemen, but present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from thence they went to seize upon the Capitol, crying by the way as
they went, <hi>Liberty, Liberty,</hi> and imploring the favour, and assistance of the
People. The rest of that day, and all next night, <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> (who
took <hi>Caesars</hi> part) were in Arms, and there passed sundry messages, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
between them and the Conspirators: At last it was agreed that the Senate
should sit, whither <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> came, <hi>M. Anthonies</hi> Sons (by the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>Cicero,</hi> a great lover of Liberty) remaining as Hostages for them.</p>
            <p>In the Senate they Treated of Peace and concord,<note place="margin">Peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> and that all that was past
should be buried in perpetual oblivion; whereunto, <hi>Anthony</hi> who was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
and the whole Senate agreed: and the Provinces being divided, there
was a great likelihood of Peace. For the Senate approved, and commended
the murther, and the People dissembled their thoughts: For on the one
side the authority of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and the name of <hi>Liberty,</hi> seemed
to give them some content: and on the other side, the hainousness
of the fact, and the love they bare to <hi>Caesar,</hi> did move, and excite them
to hate the murtherers, and so all was quiet for the present. But <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
(who affected the Tyranny) took every opportunity to incense the
People against them: and <hi>Caesars</hi> Testament being opened, wherein (besides
the adopting of his Nephew <hi>Octavius,</hi> and making him his Heir) besides
other bequests, he bequeathed to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> certain Gardens, and
Lands near to the River of <hi>Tiber,</hi> and to every Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> certain Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and Lands neer to the sum of mony to be divided amongst them, which
being known, much encreased their love to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and made his death more
grievous to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesars</hi> Funeral being agreed upon, his Body was burnt with great solemnity
in the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> made the Funeral Oration in his
Praise, and took the Robe wherein <hi>Caesar</hi> was slain, being all bloody, and
shewed it to the People, using such Speeches as provoked them both to wrath,
and commiseration, so as before the Funeral solemnity was fully finished, they
all depart in great fury,<note place="margin">A tumult.</note> taking Brands in their hands from the fire where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Caesar</hi> was burned, and went to burn the Houses of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and
if they could have found them, and the rest of the Conspirators, they would
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103996:113"/>
certainly have slain them; and in their fury they unadvisedly slew <hi>Elius Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
by mistaking him for <hi>Cornelius Cinna,</hi> who was one of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators.</p>
            <p>This tumult put <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and their confederates, into such
fear, that they all sled from <hi>Rome</hi> into several parts: and though the Senate
(having appeased the tumult) inflisted punishment upon some of the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and had already committed some of them to Prison, yet <hi>Brutus,</hi> and
<hi>Cassius</hi> durst not return to <hi>Rome,</hi> but after a while went into <hi>Greece,</hi> to Govern
those Provinces which <hi>Caesar</hi> in his Life time had allotted unto them, which
were, <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Cassius.</hi> And truly this was very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that within the space of three years all the Conspirators died, and
not one of them a natural death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> in his fifth and last Consulship made an Edict, that thanks should be
returned to <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He favoured the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </note> the High-Priest and Prince of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for their affection to himself and the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> And
decreed also, that the said <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> should have the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
repair the Walls of it which <hi>Pompey</hi> had beaten down, and should Govern it
as he pleased himself. He also granted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that every second year
there should an abatement be made out of their rents, and that they should be
free from Impositions, and Tributes.</p>
            <p>His Name of <hi>Caesar</hi> was so honourable, that all his successors to this present
day, have assumed it into their Title, and esteemed it an honour to be called
<hi>Caesars.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ctavius Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Parentage.</note> who was afterwards called <hi>Octavianus Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi>
was by the Fathers side descended of the Antient
Family of the <hi>Octavij,</hi> which was of great account in
<hi>Rome</hi> even from the time of <hi>Tarquin</hi> their King: By the
Mothers side he was descended from the Regal Line: His
Mother was <hi>Accia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Accius Balbus,</hi> and
<hi>Julia,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> which <hi>Accia</hi> was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Father of <hi>Octavius.</hi> He was born in the year
of the Consulshp of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Caius Antonius.</hi> He was but four years old
when his Father dyed: and at twelve years old he made an Oration at the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of his Grand-mother <hi>Julia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When his Uncle <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> was Warring in <hi>Spain</hi> against the Sons of
<hi>Pompey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</note> 
               <hi>Octavius</hi> (though he was but young) followed him thither through
many and great dangers: and when that War was ended, <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to take him with him to the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, sent him before to the
City of <hi>Apollonia,</hi> where he plyed his Book very diligently; and on a time
having a mind to see <hi>Theogenes,</hi> a learned Astronomer, he calculated his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
and promised him great matters, which made <hi>Octavius</hi> conceive great
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103996:114"/>
hopes of himself, and in memory thereof he caused certain Medals to be coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and would often boast of what <hi>Theogenes</hi> had told him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavius</hi> in the sixth month after he went to <hi>Apollonia,</hi> having intelligence
from his Mother of the Death of his Uncle <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> he hasted out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirus</hi>
to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> where he was received by the Army that went to
meet him as the adopted Son of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and without any further delay he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
the name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and took upon him to be his Heir, and that so much
the rather, because he had brought with him good store of mony, and great
forces that were sent him by his Uncle: and so at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> adopting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the <hi>Julian</hi> Family, he called himself <hi>Caius Julius Caesar Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this very Name, as though he had been his true Son, there came
great store of,<note place="margin">Many resor: to him.</note> partly of his Friends, partly of freed-men, slaves, and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
by whom being more strengthened and imboldned by the multitude
of them that flocked to him, and by the authority of the <hi>Caesarian</hi> name,
which with the common People was in great reputation, he took his
journey towards <hi>Rome</hi> with a great train, which daily increased like a
Floud.</p>
            <p>On the fourteenth Kalends of <hi>May</hi> he entered into <hi>Naples,</hi> where he gave
<hi>Cicero</hi> a visit.<note place="margin">He comes to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> From thence as he was going to <hi>Rome</hi> there met him a vast
company of his Friends, and as he entered the City, the Globe of the Sun
seemed to compass his Head round like unto a Bow, as it were, putting a
Crown upon his Head, who afterward was to be so great a man: and at
night, calling together his Friends, he commanded them to be ready the
next morning, with good store of followers, to meet him in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
which was done accordingly; and he going to <hi>Caius,</hi> the City
<hi>Praetor,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Anthony,</hi> he told him that he did accept of the
Adoption. For it was the <hi>Roman</hi> custom in Adoptions to interpose the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>Praetor:</hi> which acceptance being Registred by the Scribes,
from thence he presently went to <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> the Consul,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M. Anthony's</hi> Pride,</note> who beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himself proudly towards him, and scarcely admitting him into <hi>Pompeys</hi>
Gardens, gave him time to speak with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavianus</hi> had a great mind to revege the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar;</hi> but
by his Mother, and <hi>Philip</hi> his Father in Law he was advised to conceal
his purpose for a time, both because the Senate had approved his Death,
and because <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who was principally to assist him therein,
did not shew himself very friendly to him. <hi>Octavianus</hi> understanding that
<hi>Mark Anthony</hi> had in his custody all the Treasure that was left by <hi>Julius
Caesar,</hi> he desired him to command it to be delivered to him, therewith
to pay his debts, and to distribute it as <hi>Caesar</hi> had appointed in his Will:
But <hi>Anthony</hi> with greater Pride than <hi>Octavianus</hi> could well bear, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refused what he demanded, but reproved him for desiring it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
discords presently arose betwixt them: and <hi>Octavianus</hi> strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself with the Counsel of <hi>Cicero,</hi> a great Enemy to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and
one whose authority at that time, by reason of his Wisdom and <hi>Eloquence,</hi>
was very great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> being Overseer of those things which <hi>Caesar</hi> had commanded
to be done,<note place="margin">And falshood.</note> what by corrupting the Notes, and changing them at his
pleasure, did what himself listed, as if it had been the appointment of
<hi>Caesar;</hi> by this means, gratifying Cities and Governours, and heaping
vast sums of money to himself, selling not only Fields and Tributes,
but freedoms and immunities even of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that not
only to particular Persons, but to whole Provinces, and of these things
there were Tables hung up all over the Capitol.</p>

and sought the favour of the People, and prepared Forces against
<hi>Anthony</hi> for his own and the Commonwealths safety. He allo stirred up the
old Souldiers, who by <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> had been planted in Colonies: so that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
being afraid of him, by the mediation of Friends, had a conference
with him in the Capitol, and they were for the present reconciled, but
within a few days, through the whisperings of some, their enmity brake out
again, and <hi>Anthony,</hi> not thinking himself strong enough, and knowing that
the Legions of <hi>Macedonia</hi> were the best Souldiers, and six in number,
with whom also were many Archers, light harnessed men, and Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
these he sought to draw to himself, who, because of their neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
might presently be brought into <hi>Italy:</hi> and thereupon he caused
a rumour to be spread, that the <hi>Getae</hi> wasted <hi>Macedonia</hi> by their inrodes;
and upon that occasion he demanded an Army of the Senate, saying,
that the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Army was raised by <hi>Caesar</hi> against the <hi>Getae,</hi> before
he intended the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, whereupon he was chosen General of those
Forces, and he obtained a Law for the change of Provinces, whereby his
Brother <hi>Caius Anthony</hi> challenged <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which before by lot fell to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Brutus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the seventh of the Ides of <hi>October Anthony</hi> went to <hi>Brundusium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> leaves <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> there to
meet four of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Legions, whom he thought to draw to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by money. Thither also <hi>Octavianus</hi> sent his Friends with money to
hire these Souldiers for himself, and himself posted into <hi>Campania,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
those Souldiers which were in Colonies to take his part; and first
he drew to him the old Souldiers of <hi>Galatia,</hi> then those of <hi>Casilinum</hi> on both
sides of <hi>Capua,</hi> giving to each man five hundred pence, by which means he gat
together about ten thousand men, who marched with him under one Ensign
as a guard.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the four Legions of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> accusing <hi>Anthony</hi> for his
delays in revenging <hi>Caesars</hi> Death, without any acclamations conducted him
to the Tribunal, as it were, to hear an account of this matter, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
silent. <hi>Anthony</hi> taking this ill, upbraded them with their Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and complained that they had not brought to him some disturbers of
the Peace, who were sent from that malapert young man (for so he called
<hi>Octavian</hi>) and to ingratiate himself with them, he promised an hundred pence
to each of them, which niggardly promise was intertained with laughter,
which he took so ill,<note place="margin">His Parsimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> that being returned to his Quarters, in the presence of
his most covetous, and most cruel Wife <hi>Fulvia,</hi> he put to death some Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of the <hi>Martian</hi> Legion.</p>
            <p>When those of <hi>Caesars</hi> party, that were sent to corrupt the Souldiers, saw
that they were more exasperated by this deed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> Policy.</note> they scattered Libels about
the Army, wherein they disgraced <hi>Anthony,</hi> and extolled the liberality of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.</hi>
And when some sided with <hi>Octavian,</hi> and others with <hi>Anthony,</hi>
the Army, as if it had been set to sale at an outcry, addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to him that would give most. And because that <hi>Decius Brutus,</hi>
who commanded <hi>Gallia Cisalpirea</hi> (now <hi>Lombardy</hi>) opposed <hi>Anthony,</hi> he
went to besiege him in the City of <hi>Mutina</hi> (now <hi>Modena</hi>) which being
known in <hi>Rome, Cicero</hi> his authority and credit in the Senate was such, that
<hi>Mark Anthony</hi> was declared an Enemy to the State,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> declared an Enemy.</note> and the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,
<hi>Hircius</hi> and <hi>Pansa</hi> were sent against him, and with them was
<hi>Octavian</hi> sent with Ensigns of a Consul, and Title of a <hi>Pro-praetor,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been first admitted into the Senate though so young, which was
done by the procurement of <hi>Cicero,</hi> though he afterwards requited him ill
for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> with the Consuls, drew neer to <hi>Mark Anthony, Cicero</hi> remaining
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103996:115"/>
to command in chief in all matters at <hi>Rome:</hi> and between the two Armies
there passed many skirmishes and encounters, and at last they came to Battel,
wherein the Consuls and <hi>Caesar</hi> had the Victory,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him.</note> but <hi>Hircius</hi> was slain in the
Battel, and <hi>Pansa</hi> was so wounded, that he died within few days after, and
both the Armies of the slain Consuls obeyed <hi>Caesar.</hi> By this means D. <hi>Brutus</hi>
was freed from his siege, and <hi>Anthony</hi> was forced to forsake <hi>Italy</hi> by a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
flight, leaving his baggage behind him. In this service <hi>Octavian</hi>
made marvellous proof of himself, being but twenty years old, performing
the Office, not only of a good Captain, but also of a stout Souldier: For
seeing the Standard-bearer sore wounded and ready to fall, <hi>Octavian</hi> took
from him the Eagle, and bare it a great while till he had lodged it in
safety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> after the Battel,<note place="margin">He flies into <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> gathering the remainders of his Army,
passed tho <hi>Alps</hi> and went into <hi>France,</hi> solliciting the Friendship of <hi>Lepidus,</hi>
who was there with an Army ever since the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> whom
after some treaties he made his Friend: and <hi>Octavian</hi> after the Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
presently sent to the Senate to require a Triumph for his Victory, as
also the Consulship for the remainder of the year in the roome of the dead
Consuls, with their succession in their charge, and command of the Army.
But the answer of the Senate was not according to his desire: For the Friends
and Kinsmen of those that had murthered <hi>Caesar</hi> began to fear him, and to
suspect his power, wherefore they prevailed to delay that which he required,
and in the end they resolved to assign the Army to <hi>Decius Brutus,</hi> and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing
with <hi>Octavian,</hi> they granted him a Triumph, but denied him the
Consulship, whereat he was much discontented, and therefore secretly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of friendship with <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and having drawn to himself the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Army, he therewith marched towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and approaching
near to the City, in dispite of the Senate, he caused himself to be chosen
Consul being not fully twenty years old.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> makes himself Consul.</note> Then did he cause accusations to
be exhibited against <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and the rest of the Conspirators; and
in their absence, having none that durst defend their cause, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
After this was done he left the City, and with his Army marched
toward <hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who were already entred into <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Decius Brutus</hi> hearing of the Treaties and League that was made between
<hi>Octavian, Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> not daring to stay in that Country, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
with his Army, which soon forsook him, some going to <hi>Caesar,</hi> others
to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> whereupon he fled, but being at last taken, he was brought
to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who caused his Head to be cut off. The Armies of these
Captains drawing near together, to whom <hi>Affinius Pollio,</hi> and <hi>Planeus,</hi> with
their Legions were joyned, these three <hi>Octavian Caesar, Mark Anthony,</hi> and
<hi>Lepidus,</hi> meeting, after three days debate, they concluded their accursed
Peace;<note place="margin">A Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate efected.</note> and these fire-brands of sedition entered into a <hi>Tiumvirate,</hi> with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
intents and designs. <hi>Lepidus</hi> was covetous, and sought riches by
troubling the State. <hi>Anthony</hi> was by nature an enemy to Peace, and to the
Commonwealth, desiring an opportunity to be revenged of those who had
declared him an Enemy to the State. And <hi>Octavian</hi> sought revenge upon
<hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and those who had slain his adopted Father. And to
bring these things to pass, <hi>Octavian</hi> put away his Wife who was Daughter to
<hi>Servilius,</hi> and contracted himself to <hi>Claudia,</hi> Daughter in Law to <hi>Anthony</hi> by
his Wife <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who was now a child, and from whom he was afterward
divorced by reason of the discord that arose between <hi>Anthony</hi> and him.</p>
            <p>In this League which they made, besides dividing the Provinces amongst
themselves,<note place="margin">Many proscribed.</note> they agreed to Proscribe and kill each of them his Enemies, and
the one delivered them into the others hands, having more respect to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
upon an Enemy than to save a Friend; and so there was made the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103996:116"/>
most cruel and inhumane Proscription, and Butchery that ever was before
heard of, giving and exchanging Friends, and Kinsmen for Enemies. For
<hi>Mark Anthony</hi> gave up his Fathers Brother: and <hi>Lepidus</hi> his own Brother,
<hi>Lucius Paulus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ingratitude.</note> and <hi>Octavian, M. T. Cicero,</hi> whom he called Father, and who
had intreated and honoured him as a Son. And besides these, they Proscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
and condemned to die three hundred other Principal men of <hi>Rome,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
whom were about one hundred and fourty Senators, besides two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Romans</hi> of the order of Knighthood.</p>
            <p>This agreement being made, they all three went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they took
upon them the Government of the Commonwealth by the name of <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virat,</hi>
the time being limited to five years, though they never meant to leave
the same. And presently after, those who were condemned and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
were by their commandment put to death, being sought out in
all parts and places; their Houses were ransacked, and their goods confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> understanding that his name was in the Catalogue amongst the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> flies.</note>
only because he had been a lover of <hi>Roman</hi> Liberty, he fled to the Sea,
where he embarked himself, but so hard was his hap, that by contrary
winds he was driven back to the shore, whereupon, returning to some pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
of his near <hi>Capua,</hi> not far from the Sea, as he lay sleeping there, he
was awakened by some Crowes which with their bills pluckt his cloaths
from his back. His servants being moved with this ill presage, put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Litter, and again carried him towards the Sea: but being overtaken
by the murtherers,<note place="margin">And is slain.</note> he put his neck but of his Litter, and they cut off his
Head, and his right hand, wherewith he had written his Orations against
<hi>Mark Anthony</hi> called <hi>Philippicks:</hi> And thus was he slain by one whom he had
defended, and delivered from death. <hi>Anthony</hi> joyfully received his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any longer to endure that they should torment so vertuous a Son, came and
presented himself to the Murtherers: whereupon the Son entreated them to
kill him first, but they killed them both together. The <hi>Egnaces;</hi> the Father
and Son, embracing one the other were both run through and slain. <hi>C. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidius
Geta,</hi> was put into a grave by his Son as dead, who sustained and kept

that she preserved his life: He was in the <hi>interim</hi> hidden by <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> his

himself to the murtherers, and was slain by them instead of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
Another slave of <hi>Menius</hi> did the like: for he went into his Masters
Litter, and offered his neck to the murtherers, who cut off his Head, and
so his Master escaped into <hi>Sicily.</hi> The slave of <hi>Urbinus Panopio,</hi> hearing that
the murtherers were coming to his Masters house, took off his Gown and his
Ring, and gave him his own apparel, and put him out at a back door: then
he went up and lay upon his Masters Bed, where he boldly attended them
that killed him for <hi>Panopio.</hi> The slave of <hi>Antius Restio,</hi> though his Master had
soundly beaten him a few dayes before for some knavish tricks, yet to save
his Master, meeting an old man by the way, he struck off his Head,
and shewing that, with his whippings to the murtherers, he made them
believe that thus he had revenged himself of his Master, with whom
he shortly after fled into <hi>Sicily.</hi> The slaves of <hi>Martius Censorinus</hi> kept
their Master secretly, till he had opportunity to escape into <hi>Sicily,</hi> to <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus

               <note place="margin">A good Son.</note> an honourable old man, being very near taking, was rescued
by his Son, who conveying him out of <hi>Rome,</hi> carried him upon his shoulders,
and sent him into <hi>Sicily,</hi> vvhere all the poor distressed <hi>Romans</hi> were courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
entertained by <hi>S. Pompeius,</hi> who sent forth Ships and Galleys to lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coast of <hi>Italy,</hi> ready to receive all them that fled to him; doubly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
those that saved any that was proscribed: He gave also honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Offices to all that had been Consuls, and comforting the rest with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
courtesie. Many others fled into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius:</hi>
others into <hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>Cornisicius. Statius Samnis,</hi> an honourable Senator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

about eighty years old, that those Thieves might have no part of his

his House on fire, he burnt himself in it. <hi>Aponius</hi> having been long
concealed by his slave, grew weary of that confinement, came out into the
Market-place, and yielded his neck to the murtherers. <hi>Cestius</hi> being in the
like condition, caused his slaves to make a great fire, threw himself into it,
and died: <hi>Sulpitus Rufus,</hi> who had been Consul, was murthered, because
he would not sell an Isle of his to <hi>Fulvia:</hi>
               <note place="margin">A <hi>Jezabel.</hi>

who killed many Souldiers,<note place="margin">Valour.</note> who came rudely running upon him, but being
at last oppressed with multitudes, he was slain. <hi>Vetulinus,</hi> assisted by his Son,
valiantly repulsed the murtherers, but at last was slain. <hi>Sicilias Coranas</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to escape, put himself amongst the Mourners that followed a dead Corps,
but being discovered, was slain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Triumviri</hi> caused the Goods of the Proscripts to be sold by the Drum,
at such prizes as the Souldiers pleased, yet most part of them was spoiled,
and given away. They promised also to Widows their Joyntures, and
to Sons, the tenth part of their Fathers Patrimony, and to Daughters
the twentieth part; but few or none had any benefit by this promise:
yea, on the contrary, they sacked many of them that demanded these rights.
They exacted great sums of money in <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oppression.</note> and all over <hi>Italy;</hi> and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Souldiers, they gave them unmeasurable gifts, and granted
them daily new pillage. The Legions they Wintered in the richest Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
upon free Quarter. To be short, men by fear and custome were so inured
to slavery, that they became more slaves than the Tyrants would have had
them.</p>
            <p>These three men having done what they would in <hi>Rome,</hi> and knowing that
<hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> had a very great Army in <hi>Greece,</hi> who called themselves
the <hi>Deliverers of their Countrey</hi> saying, that they would go and set <hi>Rome</hi>
at liberty from Oppression: <hi>Cassius</hi> having overthrown and slain <hi>Dolabella</hi> in
<hi>Syria:</hi> and being informed, that by the assistance of their Friends, they had
gotten together eighteen Legions; hereupon <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> and <hi>Octavian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to go against them wich the greatest Army that they could possibly
make, of old Souldiers, and that <hi>Lepidus</hi> should stay to guard <hi>Rome:</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they departed,<note place="margin">They go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius.</hi>
               </note> and arrived in <hi>Greece,</hi> and marching on, they drew
near to the place where <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> were encamped, which was in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi>
in the <hi>Philippick</hi> Fields.</p>
            <p>Before they came to joyn Battel,<note place="margin">Prodigies.</note> there were sundry Prodigies: for Fowls
of prey hovered about the Camp of <hi>Brutus,</hi> as if it had been their own al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:
and as they marched out to Battel, a Blackmoor met them, which
they accounted an ill <hi>Omen. Brutus</hi> being alone in his Tent at night, a man
sad and gastly appeared to him,<note place="margin">A Spectrum.</note> and being asked what he was, he answered,
<hi>I am thy evil Genius,</hi> and so vanished: But on the contrary, Birds and Beasts
promised good success to <hi>Caesar.</hi> These Armies lying so near together, had
frequent skirmishes, and at last came to a Battel, where the Victory was
strangely divided: For <hi>Brutus</hi> on the one side of the Field, did beat <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian,</hi>
and put his Battalion to rout,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> beats <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </note> pursuing them into the Camp, where
many of them were slain;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M. Anthony.</hi> beats <hi>Cassius.</hi>
               </note> and while <hi>Brutus</hi> was following his Victory, his
partner <hi>Cassius</hi> was overthrown by <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> though he did all that
was possible to encourage his men, and by reason of the clouds of Dust,
knew nothing of <hi>Brutus</hi> his Victory, whereupon, retiring to an high ground,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103996:117"/>
he there pitched his Tent: and so standing and looking about, he saw
<hi>Brutus</hi> his Troops coming to his aid, and to relieve him; but he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that they came flying before their enemies, commanded a slave of
his, whom he had made free, to kill him, who did it accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavians</hi> men that escaped by flight, retired to <hi>Mark Anthonies</hi> Camp,
and had not <hi>Brutus</hi> his men busied themselves in ransacking <hi>Octavians</hi> Camp,
they had that day obtained an entire Victory: for they might in due time
have rescued, and relieved <hi>Cassius,</hi> and both of them being joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
might easily have overthrown <hi>Mark Anthony:</hi> but God had otherwise
determined. The Victory being thus divided, the Generals of either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
gathered their Forces together, and of <hi>Brutus</hi> side were slain eight
thousand men, and of the Enemies side a far greater number. <hi>Brutus</hi> did
his best to encourage and comfort his Souldiers, and the Gentlemen which
followed <hi>Cassius:</hi> and the next day, though both Armies were put in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
Array, yet they fought not; but a few dayes after, <hi>Brutus,</hi> by his
Souldiers, was forced to come to another Battel, who was of himself wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
rather to delay and prolong the War, knowing that his Enemies
wanted Victuals, and many other necessaries, and because he reposed no
great trust in the Forces of <hi>Cassius:</hi> for he found that they were fearful,
and hard to be commanded, because of their late overthrow. When they
came to the second encounter, <hi>Brutus</hi> did all the Offices of an able Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and of a Valiant Knight,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> beaten.</note> yet in the end his men were broken,
and overthrown by the Enemy. <hi>Brutus</hi> having gathered his scattered
Troops together, found himself unable to make any farther resistance, and
being advised by some of his Friends to fly, he told them, <hi>That so he would,
yet not with his feet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kills himself.</note> 
               <hi>but with his hands;</hi> and thereupon, taking a Sword from
a Servant of his called <hi>Stratus,</hi> he slew himself. Thus <hi>Octavian</hi> and <hi>Mark
Anthony</hi> remained Victors, and Masters of the Field, and all things suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
according to <hi>Caesars</hi> desire, for whom, God in his secret Counsel had
reserved the Monarchy of the whole World, which for the present was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
between three.</p>
            <p>These Wars being ended, and the Legions of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> reduced to
the obedience of the Conquerours, <hi>Octavian</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> agreed, and
resolved, that <hi>Anthony</hi> should remain to govern <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> that <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi>
should go into <hi>Africk,</hi> and that <hi>Octavian</hi> should return to <hi>Rome:</hi> and
accordingly <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> went into <hi>Asia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> with <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
               </note> where he gave himself up to
sensuality and delights, with the fair, but wanton <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> Queen of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
and <hi>Octavian,</hi> though with some hindrances, by reason of his health, at
last came to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after,<note place="margin">Troubles in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> there arose new Wars and troubles, for though <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
was at peace with <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who was now in <hi>Africk, Octavian</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
under his command, <hi>Spain, France,</hi> part of <hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum,</hi>
yet <hi>Lucius Antonius,</hi> who at this time was Consul, being provoked
thereto by his Sister in Law <hi>Fulvia,</hi> Wife to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> began to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himself against <hi>Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Octavian,</hi> seeking to overthrow the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirat;</hi>
which contention brake out about the division of Fields which
<hi>Caesar</hi> had made to the Souldiers which had served him in his Wars. Some
say that <hi>Fulvia</hi> made this stir, that she might procure the return of <hi>Mark
Anthony</hi> to her, of whom she was jealous, hearing of his familiarity with
<hi>Cleopatra.</hi> The discord in <hi>Rome</hi> grew to that height, that they came to
Arms; and <hi>Lucius Antonius</hi> went from the City, and levied an Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Octavian,</hi> who also marched towards him with his Forces. But <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
not daring to joyn Battel, shut himself up in <hi>Perugia,</hi> where <hi>Caesar</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
besieged him, and Divorced himself from <hi>Claudia</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Fulvia,</hi> and was married to his third Wife <hi>Scribonia,</hi> by whom he had
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103996:118"/>
one onely Daughter. <hi>Octavian</hi> being about twenty three years old, so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
besieged <hi>Perugia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> that <hi>Lucius</hi> and his men were brought to such straits
for want of Victuals, that he was forced to yield up himself to <hi>Octavian,</hi>
who pardoned him, and used him kindly; and thus this War was ended
without bloudshed. And so <hi>Octavian</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> of which he was
now sole Lord: and from hence some reckon the beginning of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
which was about four years after the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> and about
thirty eight years before the Incarnation of our blessed Lord and Saviour
<hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being now in quiet, <hi>Fulvia,</hi> by Letters, and false Informations,
sought to stir up her Husband <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> against <hi>Octavian,</hi> with which
resolution she left <hi>Italy,</hi> and went towards him; and at the same time
<hi>Mark Anthony</hi> departed from <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and came to the Isle of
<hi>Rhodes,</hi> where he was informed of all that had happened to his Brother <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius.</hi>
From thence he went into <hi>Greece,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> comes into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> and at <hi>Athens</hi> he found his Wife
<hi>Fulvia</hi> sick, yet vehemently inveighing against <hi>Octavian:</hi> wherefore leaving
her there, he went with two hundred Gallies into <hi>Italy,</hi> and landed at <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium,</hi>
where the Wars began between him and the Forces of <hi>Octavian,</hi>
who was yet at <hi>Rome.</hi> But news coming of <hi>Fulvia's</hi> death, some Friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed
to reconcile them, and at last it was agreed, that Arbitrators should
be chosen to compose their differences. <hi>Octavian</hi> chose <hi>Mecoenas,</hi> and for
<hi>Mark Anthony</hi> was <hi>Asinius Pollio,</hi> and these brought it to this issue, that
<hi>Mark Anthony</hi> should have all the East from <hi>Italy,</hi> beginning from the <hi>Jonian</hi>
Sea, which is the entry into the <hi>Venetian Gulph,</hi> unto the River of <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
wherein were included all the Provinces of <hi>Graecia</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> with all the
Islands within these limits.<note place="margin">Peace made betwixt them.</note> To <hi>Octavian</hi> was allotted from the said <hi>Jonian</hi>
Sea to the Western or <hi>Spanish</hi> Sea, wherein were contained <hi>Spain, France, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Germany,</hi> and <hi>Britain.</hi> To <hi>Lepidus</hi> was confirmed <hi>Africa,</hi> where he then
was, with all the Provinces thereof. And for the strengthening of this League,
<hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> now a Widower, was to marry with <hi>Octavia,</hi> the Sister of
<hi>Octavian</hi> by the Fathers side, formerly married to <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> by whom
she had one Son, called also <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom <hi>Octavian</hi> adopted. And this
marriage was dispensed with by the Senate, because in <hi>Rome</hi> Widows were
not permitted to marry, till they had lived ten months in Widowhood, which
she had not done.</p>
            <p>This being concluded,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>Octavia.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Octavian</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where
the Wedding was solemnized, and they were seemingly good Friends; but
their Peace was disquieted by the Neighbourhood of <hi>Sextus Pompeius,</hi> who
commanded the Seas from <hi>Sicily</hi> where he lived, and with his Ships and Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
he disquieted <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends, who thereupon resolved to ruine him:
But at the request of the Senate, and of <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> he hearkened to Peace,
and by the mediation of Friends,<note place="margin">They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with <hi>Sextus Pompey.</hi>
               </note> it was agreed, that all matters past should be
forgotten, and that they should live like good Neighbours and Friends, and
that <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> should enjoy <hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Corsica,</hi> which he had in
possession, and that he should clear the Seas from Pyrates, that Merchants and
Passengers might pass safely, and that he should furnish <hi>Rome</hi> yearly with a
certain quantity of Corn. This being concluded, they agreed upon a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all three upon the Sea side in the Straight of <hi>Messina,</hi> in a Fortress built
for that purpose, which reached into the Water, whither <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> might
come with his Galleys and be in safety: which accordingly was performed
with great joy and solemnity; and <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> feasted them in his Galleys,
and they likewise him by Land.</p>
            <p>From hence <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> returned into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Octavian</hi> and <hi>Mark
Anthony</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where for a while they remained in great Familiarity: and
then <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> preparing for his journey into the East, sent <hi>Venditius</hi> before
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103996:118"/>
him with a great Army against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> wherein he had so good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
that he overcame and defeated <hi>Pacorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Parthians</hi> beaten.</note> the <hi>Parthian</hi> Kings Son, and
slew twenty thousand of his men, and thereby sufficiently revenged
the Death of <hi>Marcus Crassus,</hi> for which he afterwards Triumphed at
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> departed from <hi>Rome</hi> with his new Wife, and wintered with
her in <hi>Athens. Octavian</hi> in the mean time in <hi>Rome</hi> growing mighty, and
in high esteem, was yet very pensive, being troubled at the Neighbourhood
of <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> attending an occasion to War against him: for
which purpose he prepared a great Fleet,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> envies <hi>Sextus Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</hi>
               </note> pretending that <hi>Sextus</hi> with his
Ships, and Gallies hindred the coming of Corn into <hi>Italy.</hi> These <hi>Sicilian</hi>
Wars continued for some years: in the beginning whereof <hi>Octavian</hi> had ill
success, yet more from storms and tempests than from the force of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
and if <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> had been as prudent and able to offend his Enemy
as he was to defend himself: and as he was Valiant, if he had been as Wise
and Politick, he might have greatly distressed <hi>Octavian</hi> in all matters concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Italy:</hi> yet the matter was so handled, that at <hi>Octavians</hi> request <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
came twice out of the East into <hi>Italy</hi> to assist him in these Wars. The
first time he came to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> where, not finding <hi>Octavian</hi> according to
appointment, he returned without seeing him, upon some jealousies which
grew betwixt them. But <hi>Octavian</hi> having lost most of his Fleet in a storm,
he sent his intire Friend <hi>Mecenas</hi> to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> at whose intreaty he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into <hi>Italy</hi> with three hundred Ships and Gallies, giving it out that he
came to <hi>Caesars</hi> aid. And though there were some difference between them,
yet <hi>Octavia</hi> so laboured between her Husband and Brother, that she reconciled
them, and so they met in the mouth of the River near <hi>Tarentum,</hi> where <hi>Mark
Anthony</hi> gave to <hi>Octavian</hi> one hundred and twenty of his Gallies for his Wars,
and <hi>Octavian</hi> gave to him some of the <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers, and they renewed
their <hi>Triumvirat</hi> for other five years. Which done, <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> returned
to the East to prosecute his Wars against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> his Wife <hi>Octavia</hi> and
her Children remaining in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> being gone,<note place="margin">Wars against him.</note> 
               <hi>Octavian</hi> resolving to prosecute the Wars against <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Pompey</hi> with all his Forces, armed two Navies, whereof <hi>Agrippa</hi> was the
Admiral of the one, and himself of the other: He sent also to <hi>Lepidus</hi> intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his aid, who accordingly came and brought with him a thousand Ships,
little and great, and eighty Gallies, wherein he transported five thousand
Horse, and twelve Legions of Foot Souldiers. <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> hearing what
great preparations were made against him, did strongly fortifie all the Sea-coasts
of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and on the frontiers of <hi>Africk,</hi> near to <hi>Lilibaeum,</hi> he placed
<hi>Plinius,</hi> a good Captain with good Companies of Souldiers, and his whole
Fleet by Sea he drew into the Port of <hi>Messina,</hi> purposing to mannage his Wars
by Sea, having neither experience, nor power to do it by Land, and so
he attended the coming of his Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lepidus</hi> loosing with his whole Fleet from <hi>Africk,</hi> was encountered with a
tempest, wherein with the loss of a great part of his Navy, he, with the rest
landed at <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> and took in certain places thereabout, but having small
judgment, and experience in the Wars, he made a greater noise then did hurt
to <hi>Pompey. Octavius</hi> also being at Sea in a tempest, lost thirty of his Gallies,
besides small Ships, and with much difficulty returned to <hi>Italy:</hi> and <hi>Taurus,</hi>
who commanded the Gallies which <hi>Anthony</hi> left, landed at <hi>Tarentum,</hi> though
with great loss and danger. <hi>Octavian</hi> was so grieved at these losses, that he
had thoughts of giving over the War for that year: but changing his mind,
he repaired his Fleets, and ordered <hi>Agrippa,</hi> with one of them to pass into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
and there to make War both by Sea and land: and himself following with
the other Fleet did the like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:103996:119"/>
About this time <hi>Octavian</hi> divorced himself from <hi>Scribonia,</hi> though he had
a Daughter by her called <hi>Livia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> marries <hi>Livia.</hi>
               </note> and then he married <hi>Livia Drusilla,</hi> Wife to
<hi>Tiberius Nero,</hi> by whom she had a Son called also <hi>Tiberius;</hi> hereupon <hi>Tiberius</hi>
was forced to leave her to please <hi>Octavian,</hi> though at this time she was with
Child of a Son. This <hi>Livia</hi> he loved dearly, and continued with her till
his Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> assaulted and took in some places in <hi>Sicily,</hi> which <hi>Pompey</hi> hearing
of, departed from <hi>Messina</hi> with one hundred and seventy five Gallies, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> being advertised of his coming, prepared to meet
him, his Gallies being almost equal in number, and so they joyned Battel,
which for a time seemed to be equal,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> but at last <hi>Agrippa</hi> prevailed, and <hi>Pompey</hi>
retreated in time, his Gallies and Foists withdrawing themselves into some
Rivers near at hand, whither <hi>Agrippa</hi> with his bigger Vessels could not follow
them. In this fight <hi>Pompey</hi> lost thirty of his Gallies. <hi>Agrippa</hi> the next day
went to a City called <hi>Tindaria,</hi> thinking to surprise it by reason of intelligence
which he had with the Citizens: and <hi>Pompey</hi> in the Night gave secret order
to his whole Fleet to retire to <hi>Messina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> in the mean time imbarked a great part of his Army, which he
landed in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and set them on shore under the command of <hi>Cornificius,</hi> little
thinking that <hi>Pompey</hi> had been so near, who if he had taken this opportunity,
might have defeated <hi>Octavian.</hi> But loosing it, <hi>Octavian</hi> imbarking again, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to determine the quarrel by a Battel at Sea, leaving <hi>Cornificius</hi> with his
men fortified on the Land. Then did <hi>Pompey</hi> sail out of <hi>Messina</hi> with his whole
Fleet,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> beaten.</note> and neither Parties refusing it, they came to a Battel, in which <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi>
was overcome, and all his great Fleet scattered and lost, and himself dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to flie into <hi>Italy</hi> in a Brigandine, where through many dangers, he at
last came to the Army, whereof <hi>Mesalla</hi> was General, and being nothing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
with this loss, he presently took order for all that was needful. To
<hi>Rome</hi> he sent his intire Friend <hi>Mecenas,</hi> to take order that this news should
breed no alteration there, and then presently sent to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> the Admiral of
his other Fleet, that he should with all speed succour <hi>Cornificius</hi> and his Army
in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and to <hi>Lepidus</hi> he sent to desire him to make his present repair to the
Isle of <hi>Lippari,</hi> which is between <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Calabria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His diligence and good order about these affairs was such, that in a short
time, by the help of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> in dispite of <hi>Pompey,</hi> he landed all
his Forces in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and joyning with <hi>Lepidus,</hi> he encamped near to <hi>Messina,</hi>
where began a most cruel War both by Sea, and Land, wherein the power
and sufficiency of <hi>Pompey</hi> did wonderfully appear, in that he was able to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with so potent adversaries. Yet seeing himself oppressed, he sent a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to <hi>Octavian,</hi> that to avoid the further effusion of blood, he would try it
out with him in a Naval fight, so many Ships and Gallies against so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<hi>Octavian</hi> delayed him at the first, but afterwards they agreed that
with three hundred Ships and Galleys on either side, they would meet in
such a place, and there fight it out, and accordingly they prepared for
the Battel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> leaving <hi>Lepidus</hi> with his Land Army, embarked himself in his
Fleet, and <hi>Pompey</hi> did the like, and so they joyned Battel, which was one of
the cruellest that ever was, considering the Commanders and the strength on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, where <hi>Pompey,</hi> after he had performed all the Offices of a good and
Valiant Captain,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> and after the slaughter of multitudes on both sides, was
overcome by <hi>Octavian,</hi> and all his Fleet was burnt and sunk, or taken, saving
sixteen sail which escaped by flight, and he in one of them, and these entered
into the Haven of <hi>Messina.</hi> And though the City was sufficiently fortified,
and <hi>Pompey</hi> knew that <hi>Plinius,</hi> his General was coming to his rescue, yet in a
dark night he imbarked,<note place="margin">And flies.</note> and with those sixteen Ships which had escaped, he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103996:119"/>
fled into the East to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> hoping to find relief from him: But after
much toil,<note place="margin">And is slain.</note> and many accidents which happened to him, he was slain by one
<hi>Titius</hi> at the command of <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and in him failed the House and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of his Father <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this War <hi>Octavian</hi> escaped many dangers. For having transported part
of his Army into <hi>Sicily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> and sailing back to fetch the rest, he was suddenly
surprised by <hi>Demochares,</hi> and <hi>Apolaphanes,</hi> two of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Captains, from
whom he escaped with much difficulty with one only Ship. Then travelling
by Land to <hi>Rhegium,</hi> he saw some of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Gallies near to the Shore, and
supposing them to be his own, he went down to the Sea side, where he had
like to have been taken by them; and then seeking to escape by unknown
passages, he met with a slave of <hi>Aemilius Paulus,</hi> who remembring that he
had proscribed his Master <hi>Paulus,</hi> Father to this <hi>Aemilius,</hi> he attempted to
kill him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> having obtained this great Victory aforesaid, though with very
great loss, he went to Land with the remainder of his Ships and Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<hi>Agrippa</hi> to joyn with <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and to go to <hi>Messina,</hi> whither <hi>Pliny,
Pompeys</hi> General had retired himself. But not thinking good to stand upon
his defence, now that his Master was fled, he yielded himself to <hi>Lepidus</hi> with
all his Legions:<note place="margin">He falls out with <hi>Lepidus.</hi>
               </note> This made <hi>Lepidus</hi> so proud, that affecting to have <hi>Sicily</hi> to
himself, he contended with <hi>Octavian</hi> about it: and entering into the City of
<hi>Messina,</hi> he placed a Garrison in it, to hold it for his own use: The like he
did in many other places of the Island: and when <hi>Octavian</hi> came, he desired
to speak with him, greatly complaining of his proceedings.</p>
            <p>But in Rule, and Dominion equallity is intollerable, whilst either of them
coveted this Isle for himself they fell at variance, and <hi>Octavian</hi> made his Navy
to draw neer to the shore: So that both Armies began to stand upon their
guard, the one against the other, and many messages passed between them,
yet could they not agree. But <hi>Octavian</hi> was far better beloved and esteemed
by the men of War, for his many vertues, and Nobility, and for his Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
[<hi>Julius Caesar,</hi>] then the other, and the Souldiers began to lay all the
fault upon <hi>Lepidus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> understanding this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> Policy.</note> laboured secretly to corrupt <hi>Lepidus</hi> his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
to draw them to himself: and one day, with a great Troop of Horse,
he rode neer to <hi>Lepidus</hi> his Camp, and parlying with his Souldiers, justified
himself and laid all the fault upon <hi>Lepidus,</hi> insomuch that many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to come over to his side. <hi>Lepidus,</hi> being informed hereof, caused an
Alarm to be given, and commanded his men to sally out against <hi>Octavian,</hi> but
when they came forth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lepidus</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</note> most of them joyned with him: so that <hi>Lepidus</hi> seeing
himself in danger of being forsaken of his whole Army, yielded himself unto
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and putting off his Generals Robe, he went to his Tent, and submitted
to him. <hi>Octavian</hi> received him as if he had never offended, very courteously,
and honourably, but restored him neither to his State nor power, and sent
him with a good company to <hi>Rome,</hi> without any Office but the High Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which he had held ever since the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar:</hi> and so this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
was ended without bloodshed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> now retaining <hi>Sicily</hi> to himself, and having devested <hi>Lepidus</hi> of the
<hi>Triumvirat,</hi> he appropriated to himself the Province of <hi>Africk,</hi> and remained
General of the three Armies, to wit, of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and of his own;
wherein were forty five Legions of Footmen, and twenty five thousand Horse,
all well armed, besides many other <hi>Numidians.</hi> He had also upon the Sea,
six hundred Gallies and many Ships, and Brigandines. And now waited only
for an opportunity to fall out with <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> that he might make himself
Lord of all. Yet for the present he paid his Souldiers as well as he could, and
gave Coronets, Honours, and Arms to those who had deserved well in these
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103996:120"/>
Wars. He then dispersed his Armies, sending them to their own homes,
loaden with many fair promises. He also left, and sent <hi>Praetors</hi> and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
into <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> returns to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and so hasted towards <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with Ovation (which was little less than a Triumph) with incredible joy
and honour: and was so exceedingly beloved, that in many places they erected
Temples and Altars to him, as to their Gods: and he reformed such things as
by reason of the Wars were grown out of order.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who was in the East, though he had no great
success in his <hi>Parthian</hi> War, yet was he still of great power, very Rich, and
well obeyed in the Provinces of <hi>Greece, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in the rest of
his Governments.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sotted with <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
               </note> But he was so besotted with the love, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that he thought of nothing but
how to saitsfie her humour, in the mean time neglecting, and forgetting
his Wife <hi>Octavia,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Octavian,</hi> who in beauty and Wisdom
was nothing inferiour to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and in virtue and goodness did far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel her.</p>
            <p>The Monarchy of the World being thus divided between these two, the
one in the East, the other in the West, yet, as though each of them had not
enough, they studied each of them to supplant, and destroy the other Chiefly
<hi>Octavian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> seeks a quarrel with him.</note> who seeing that <hi>Anthony</hi> neglected his Sister, and did not send for her,
he continually advised, and urged her to go to her Husband, that he might
have a fair occasion to fall out with him if she were not well intertained: But
she, not well understanding his design, that she might prevent all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
between her Brother and her Husband, departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> carrying with
her many Jewels, and Presents which she had gotten together therewith to
present <hi>Mark Anthony.</hi> But he, having fixed his heart upon <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> wrote
to her by the way that she should go into <hi>Greece,</hi> and stay at <hi>Athens,</hi> till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, yet did he never go against them, <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
hindering him. Notwithstanding <hi>Octavia</hi> sent all those things which she had
brought, to her Husband, and all this not prevailing to procure her accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
she went full of grief to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Octavian</hi> begin openly to complain of <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
himself his Enemy, and <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> entered into a League with the
King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> the better to strengthen himself, causing <hi>Cleopatra</hi> (besides
the Title of <hi>Aegypt</hi>) to be called Queen of <hi>Syria, Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and
joyntly with her, a Son of hers called <hi>Caesarion,</hi> of whom <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> left her
with Child when he was in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and to two Sons which himself had by
her, called <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> he gave the Title of Kings, to <hi>Alexander,</hi>
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Parthia:</hi> and to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia;</hi> hereupon
the enmity between <hi>Octavian</hi> and him greatly encreased: yet was the War
deferred because of other Wars which <hi>Octavian</hi> had in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>
The People of these Countries,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> new troubles.</note> seeing the <hi>Romans</hi> engaged in Civil Wars,
rebelled, together with those of <hi>Austria, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who joyned
with them. This War <hi>Octavian</hi> undertook in his own Person, which was
very cruel and dangerous: wherein he was twice wounded, and gave great
proof both of his Wisdom and Valour: yet in the end, he not only subdued
and tamed <hi>Illyricum,</hi> but both the <hi>Panonnia</hi>'s, and all the neighbouring Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with had joyned with them.</p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Octavian</hi> return Victorious to <hi>Rome,</hi> and though a Triumph
was granted him, yet would he not Triumph as then, so great was his
desire to make War against <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who was no better affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. For he levied Souldiers, procured Friends, and Armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and promised <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to bring her Triumphing into <hi>Rome.</hi>
Yea, she requested of him, the Rule and Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he promised
it her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:103996:120"/>
Matters standing upon these tearms, <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> sent his Wife <hi>Octavia</hi>
a Bill of Divorce, according to the custom of those times, commanding
her to go out of his House,<note place="margin">Quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</note> wherein she dwelt in <hi>Rome.</hi> This, and other
indignities <hi>Octavian</hi> imparted to the Senate, complaining against <hi>Anthony,</hi>
and in his Orations to the People, he accused him for that (the second five years
of his <hi>Triumvirat</hi> and League being expired) yet came he not to <hi>Rome,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respecting the authority of the Senate, nor of the People, but held his
place, and kept possession of the East and of <hi>Greece:</hi> and by such suggestions
he incensed the People against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> on the other side by Letters and Messengers, complained
that <hi>Octavian</hi> had often broken the Peace, and had cast <hi>Sextus Pmpey</hi> out of
<hi>Sicily,</hi> retaining that, and other places which he held to himself: and that
therein he had no respect of him, nor had given him any part thereof:
and that he detained the Gallies which he had lent him for that War. As also
that he had deprived <hi>Lepidus</hi> of his Government, and kept all those Provinces,
and all the Legions which were his, without imparting any share thereof to
him: and that he had divided all the Lands in <hi>Italy</hi> to his own Souldiers, not
assigning any part thereof to his. Thus the one accused the othet, either
pretending that they were forced to undertake the War; whereas the
truth is, it was their Ambition, and insatiable desire to Rule that pricked
them forward to it. Hereupon they called divers Nations to their aid, so as
the whole World in a manner,<note place="margin">Preparations for War.</note> either of one side or other, was in Arms. Those
in the West for <hi>Octavian,</hi> and those in the East for <hi>Anthony:</hi> at least, the best and
choisest men of them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> was first in the Field, and came with a great Army to the famous
City of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in <hi>Jonia,</hi> a Province of <hi>Asia</hi> the less, whither he had sent for
his Navy to transport him into <hi>Europe.</hi> And he had in readiness eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Gallies and Ships of burthen: two hundred whereof <hi>Cleopatra</hi> gave him,
together with all the Ammunition, and Victuals necessary for the Fleet: He
also took her along with him, contrary to the advise of all those which were
of his Counsel. Then sailed he to the Isle of <hi>Samos,</hi> to which he had
appointed all the Kings, Tetrarchs, and People which served under him in
this War, to come by a day prefixed. The Kings that met him there,
were <hi>Tarcondemus,</hi> King of the upper <hi>Cilicia: Archalaus,</hi> of <hi>Cappadocia: Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodelphus,</hi>
of <hi>Paphlagonia; Methridates,</hi> of <hi>Comagena,</hi> and others: Besides those
which sent there Forces, as <hi>Herod,</hi> King of <hi>Judaea: Amyntas,</hi> of <hi>Lycaonia:</hi>
and the Kings of <hi>Arabia:</hi> Of the <hi>Medes:</hi> and <hi>Palemon,</hi> King of <hi>Pontus</hi> with
some others. So that he had one hundred thousand well trained Footmen,
and twenty two thousand Horse, besides his Navy by Sea, which consisted of
five hundred Gallies, besides Ships of burden which carried his Ammunition,
and Victuals.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Anthony,</hi> thus furnished, had presently passed into <hi>Italy,</hi> he had put
<hi>Octavian</hi> into great hazard: For then he had not sufficient Forces to have
withstood him, nor other necessary Provision for the Wars. But <hi>Mark
Anthony,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony:</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence.</note> delaying the time at <hi>Athens,</hi> let slip the opportunity, and gave
<hi>Octavian</hi> leasure to provide all things necessary from <hi>Italy, France, Spain,</hi>
and all other his Provinces, from whence he levied eighty thousand choise
Souldiers, and above twenty thousand good Horse: and seeing that <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
stayed so long,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</note> he sent him word, that seeing he had Ships, and other fit
provision, he should come for <hi>Italy,</hi> where he staid in the Field to give him
Battel, promising to afford him good Ports and Havens, where he might safely
land without interruption.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthonys</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> To this <hi>Anthony</hi> answered, that it would be more
honourable if he would determine this quarrel in Person against him, body to
body, which he would willingly accept, though he was now old and crazed,
and the other young and lusty: and if he liked not of this challenge, he would
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103996:121"/>
stay for him with his Army in the Fields of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> in the same place where
<hi>Julius Caesar</hi> fought with <hi>Cneius Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Messages passing between them without effect, <hi>Anthony</hi> drew his
Army by Land, and his Navy by Sea towards <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Octavian,</hi> imbarked
his Legions at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and crossed the Sea to a place called <hi>Torma,</hi> in the
Province of <hi>Epire</hi> (now called <hi>Romania</hi>) and after some notable exploits per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
the two Armies drew neer together,<note place="margin">They meet.</note> as also did the Navies. <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi>
Navy consisted of two hundred and fifty Gallies, but better armed, and
swifter than were <hi>Mark Anthonies,</hi> though his were more in number. And <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> being perswaded by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> (who in this also was the cause
of his ruin, thereby to have the better means to fly if the Battel should be lost)
would needs try his Fortune in a Sea fight, though his Army by Land had a
great advantage over the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> chose twenty thousand out of his Army and put them aboard his
Fleet,<note place="margin">They prepare to fight.</note> and <hi>Octavian,</hi> who refused not the Sea-fight, made his provision also,
and so shipping himfelf in his Gallies, he committed the charge of his Land
Army to <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> left his Land Forces with <hi>Canidius:</hi> and in the
sight of both the Armies, these two brave Captains, with the best Navies in
the World, took the Seas where they fought, for no less than the Empire of
the World. Yet was the Fight deferred for three days in dispite of both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the Seas rising so high that they could not Govern their Vessels. The fourth
day they came to an encounter at a Cape called <hi>Accius,</hi> in <hi>Epire,</hi> not far from
the place where their Land Armies stood.</p>
            <p>The Battel was one of the most cruellest that ever was heard of, and lasted
ten hours before <hi>Octavian</hi> obtained the Victory,<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> though <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> staid
not so long in the fight. For <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in the greatest fury of the Battel,
fled away in her Galley, whom seventy of her other Galleys followed: and
unfortunate <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who all his life time hitherto had been a valiant
and brave Captain, seeing <hi>Cleopatra</hi> fly, on whom he had fixed his eyes and
heart,<note place="margin">Anthony <hi>flies.</hi>
               </note> shifting out of his own Galley into a lighter, followed her, without
regard of his Armies either by Sea or Land, and overtaking her, went aboard
her Galley, wherein he sailed three days without either seeing or speaking with
her, being confounded with shame for shewing so much weekness, and at last
they arrived in the Port of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Navy which he left fighting,<note place="margin">His mens fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</note> though now Headless and without a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
yet continued to make gallant resistance till five thousand of them were
slain: and at last they were overcome, rather for want of a Commander then
through any force of an Enemy, though <hi>Octavians</hi> light and swift Galleys were
a great help to him: and so he remained Conquerour, and granted life, and
pardon to the conquered, getting into his hands three hundred of their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys.
In <hi>Anthonys</hi> Army by Land there wanted neither courage nor constancy
to theit General, though he had so unworthily deserted them: and therefore
they continued seven days in their Camp, ready to give Battel, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
any composition from the Enemy, and they would have staid longer,
had not <hi>Canidius</hi> their Captain abused his trust, flying secretly from the Camp
to seek <hi>Anthony,</hi> whereupon, the Army being destitute of a General, yielded
to the Enemy;<note place="margin">His Army yields to <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </note> who admitted them into his own Army, being nineteen Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of Foot, and twelve thousand Horse. The Senators, Knights, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men, that had served <hi>Anthony,</hi> many of them he fined in great sums of
Money, many he put to death, and some he pardoned.</p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Caesar</hi> sail to <hi>Athens,</hi> and being pacified with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
the Corn that was left in the War, to the Cities that were afflicted
with Famine, and that were dispoiled of their Money, Servants, and Horses.
And <hi>Anthony</hi> being arrived in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> chose out one good Ship of good bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and fraught with store of Treasure, and rich Plate of Gold and Silver,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103996:121"/>
and gave it to his Friends, intreating them to divide it amongst them and to
shift for themselves, and he wrote to <hi>Theophilus,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
that he would provide them an hiding place till they might make their Peace
with <hi>Caesar.</hi> And <hi>Caesar,</hi> of the spoils of the Enemy dedicated ten Ships to
<hi>Apollo Actius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> being come into <hi>Africk</hi> went into a desart place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> lives privately.</note> wandering up
and down, only accompanied with two Friends; and after a while he sent to
the General of the Army which he had formerly raised for the defence of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
but he slew his Messengers, and said that he would not obey <hi>Anthony,</hi>
whereupon he had thought to have killed himself, but being hindered by his
Friends, he went to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and after a while he built him an House in
the Sea by the Isle of <hi>Pharos,</hi> and there lived from the Company of all men,
saying, <hi>That he would live the life of</hi> Timon <hi>the</hi> Man-hater, <hi>because he was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by his Friends, and had experience of their ingratitude,</hi> and he called this
House <hi>Timonion.</hi> Yet at length he left this place, and went to the Pallace,
where he spent his time in Feasting and jollity. And <hi>Cleopatra</hi> got together
divers sorts of deadly poysons of poysonsome Creatures, whereof she made try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
upon many condemned persons, and amongst all, she liked the biting of the
Aspe best: for it brought a sleepiness without any contraction of the members,
or groaning, only causing a gentle sweating of the face, and a languishing stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
of the senses.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> many things were decreed in honour of <hi>Caesar</hi> for this Victory at
Sea:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Casar</hi> highly honoured.</note> First a Triumph was granted him for <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> and a Triumphal Arch
was erected at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and another at <hi>Rome.</hi> The base of the <hi>Julian</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was adorned with the Beaks of the Ships he had taken: There were Plays
decreed to be kept every fifth year in honour of him: Processions were always
to be made on his Birth day, and on the day wherein the news of his Victory
was first brought. That the vestal Virgins, the Senate, with their Wives and
Children should go and meet him at his return: that all the Ornaments of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
should be demolished &amp; cast down: that his Birth day should be accounted
unlucky: and that none of his Family should ever have the forename of <hi>Marcus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> sent Ambassadours to <hi>Caesar</hi> into
<hi>Asia. Cleopatra</hi> demanded the Kingdom of <hi>Aegypt</hi> for her Children, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Anthonies</hi> knowledg, sent him a Scepter, Crown, and Chair, all of Gold,
as it were, delivering her Kingdom over to him: and <hi>Anthony</hi> demanded that
he might live a private life at <hi>Athens</hi> if he might not continue in <hi>Aegypt. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
accepted of <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s gifts, accounting them as good <hi>Omens:</hi> but he would
afford no answer to <hi>Anthony;</hi> and privately he promised impunity and her
Kingdom to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> if she would kill <hi>Anthony.</hi> They sent also a second Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassage
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> promised him a huge mass of Money; and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
minded him of the former friendship and alliance that was between
them, and what acts they had done together: he delivered also to him <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rullius,</hi>
a Senator, and one of <hi>Caesars</hi> murtherers, whom he put to death: he
proffered also to kill himself to obtain security for <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> yet <hi>Caesar</hi> would
give him no answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> hereupon prepare for War,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for War.</note> and <hi>Caesar</hi> at last marched
against them, and sent <hi>Cornelius Gallus</hi> before with four Legions, who suddenly
seized upon <hi>Paraetonium,</hi> the prime City of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> toward <hi>Lybia. Anthony</hi> being
informed hereof, marched towards <hi>Paraetonium,</hi> hoping to draw <hi>Gallus</hi> his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to own him, but when on the contrary he had received great loss both by
Sea and Land, he returned to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Presently after <hi>Caesar</hi> took <hi>Pelusium,</hi> by
the Treachery of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who caused <hi>Selucus</hi> the Governour to deliver it up to
him, hoping to draw his love to her, yet did she disown it to <hi>Anthony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had Store-houses, and Monuments, admirable both for sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and highth, which she had built by the Temple of <hi>Isis,</hi> and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:103996:122"/>
thither she had brought the most precious things of all her Royal Treasure,
as Gold, Silver, Emeralds, Pearls, Ebony, Ivory, and Cinnamon, as also store
of Lamps, and Flax: whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> fearing that she would set fire of them,
whereby he should lose such Treasures, he, to prevent despair, gave her hopes
of favour, whilst he marched towards the City, and she privately forbad the
Citizens of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to sally out against him; whereas openly she seemed to
encourage them to oppose him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being come before the City,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> pursues him into <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Anthony</hi> sallied out, and fought valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with him, and routed his Horse, and drave them to the very Camp, of
which, at his return, he boasted to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and she to reward him, gave him
an Headpiece, and Armour all of Gold. The next day <hi>Anthony</hi> dispersed tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
amongst <hi>Caesars</hi> Souldiers, promising them fifteen hundred Drachmaes a
piece, if they would come over to him: These <hi>Caesar</hi> read to his Souldiers, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<hi>Anthony</hi> more hateful to them thereby, and they being exceeding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
that their fidelity was tempted, fought so valiantly at the next encounter,
that <hi>Anthony</hi> was driven back out of the Field. After this, <hi>Anthony</hi> challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Caesar</hi> to a single Duel, who answered, <hi>That</hi> Anthony <hi>had more wayes to die.</hi>
He therefore considering that he could not die any way more honourably than
in Battel, resolved to set upon <hi>Caesar</hi> both by Sea and Land.</p>
            <p>Many Prodigies fore-ran the bondage of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prodigies.</note> In some places it rained
bloud. Armies appeared in the Air. A huge Dragon was seen amongst the
<hi>Aegyptians,</hi> which hissed horribly. A Comet appeared, and the Images of the
Dead. The Statues seemed to mourn: and <hi>Apis</hi> lowing heavily, shed some
tears.</p>
            <p>On the Kalends of <hi>August,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cleopatras</hi> treachery.</note> 
               <hi>Anthony,</hi> early in the morning, went down to
the Haven, to order his Fleet. But <hi>Cleopatra</hi> caused them to revolt from him,
and to joyn with <hi>Caesars</hi> Fleet: Whilst <hi>Anthony</hi> beheld this, he was also forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by all his Horsemen, who revolted to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and his Foot were beaten back
into the City: whereupon he cryed out, that he was betrayed by <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
She fearing his anger, fled to her Monument, with one Eunuch, and two
Maids, and sent <hi>Anthony</hi> word that she was dead: This he believing, desired
his faithful servant <hi>Erotes,</hi> according to his former promise, to kill him: <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
drew out his Sword, as if he vvould do it, but <hi>Anthonies</hi> back being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, he slew himself; who falling at his feet, <hi>Anthony</hi> said, <hi>Noble</hi> Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
<hi>thou hast taught me what to do, but couldst not endure to do it thy self;</hi> So ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Sword,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> kills himself.</note> he thrust it into his Belly: yet after a while, the bloud stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
he desired those about him to dispatch him, but they all fled, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a great tumult.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleopatra</hi> from the top of the Monument perceiving it, (for the Gate was
so made, that being shut it could not be again opened) she sent her Secretary
to bring him into the Monument to her: <hi>Anthony</hi> was carried to the foot of
the Monument, and being tyed in a Pulley, vvas vvith great pains drawn up
by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and her two Maids. It was a sad sight to see him thus drawn up,
besmeared with bloud, and ready to give up the Ghost. When he came to the
top, he stretched forth his hands to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who receiving him in, laid him
on a bed, tearing her head tire, breast and face with her own hands, so that
she was all gore bloud: He laboured to comfort her, and advised her to look
to her affairs, and to save her life, if she could do it without dishonour, and
that amongst all <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends, she should most trust <hi>Proculeius,</hi> and so gave
up the Ghost.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Dercetaeus,</hi> one of <hi>Anthonies</hi> Guard, stole his bloudy Sword,
and ran away with it to <hi>Caesar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> bewails his Death.</note> telling him what had happened: <hi>Caesar</hi> then
going into the inmost room of his Tent, much bewailed <hi>Anthony,</hi> his Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and Colleague, and who had been his companion in many Battels,
and in the Government of the Empire. Then sending for <hi>Proculeius,</hi> he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103996:122"/>
commanded him, by all means, if it were possible, to save <hi>Cleopatra</hi> alive,
fearing to lose her Treasures, and that she might adorn his Triumph. <hi>Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius,</hi>
and one <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> coming to the Monument, laboured to perswade
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> to come forth: and at last by a wile, <hi>Proculeius</hi> seized upon her, yet
granted her some dayes to embalm <hi>Anthonies</hi> Body, after which they brought
her into the Palace, diminishing nothing either of her wonted train, or honour,
that so she might do no mischief to her self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having conquered <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> pardons the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </note> ascended into a Tribunal, and calling
the Citizens before him, who for fear fell upon their knees, he told them
that he freely pardoned them for their great God <hi>Serapis</hi> his sake. He also
pardoned the rest of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> being unwilling to put so many men to
death, which formerly had done so good service for the <hi>Romans.</hi> Of those that
favoured <hi>Anthony,</hi> some he put to death, and others he pardoned, either of
his own good will, or at the intercession of Friends. And whereas <hi>Anthony</hi>
had with him many children of Kings, some as Hostages, others upon false
accusations, some of them <hi>Caesar</hi> sent home, others he joyned together in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and some he kept by him. Coming to view the Tomb of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the <hi>Great</hi> (which as <hi>Strabo</hi> reporteth, was of Glass) <hi>Caesar</hi> put a Crown upon
it, and strewed flowers over it, and worshipped it: and being asked whether
he would see the Bodies of the <hi>Ptolomies?</hi> He answered, <hi>That he would see a
King, not the dead.</hi> Neither would he go to see their God <hi>Apis,</hi> saying, <hi>that he
used to worship Gods, not Oxen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many great Kings and Captains desired to bury the Body of <hi>Anthony,</hi> but
<hi>Caesar</hi> would not take it from <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who buried it splendidly and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently,
and <hi>Caesar</hi> suffered her to take what Treasures she would for his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> through her much sorrow, fell into a Fever, and her Breast
was troubled with inflammations and Ulcers, through the blowes which she
had given her self, yet by the care of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the skill of her Physician, she
was recovered: after which she delivered to <hi>Caesar</hi> an Inventory of all her
Treasures: and when <hi>Scleucus,</hi> one of her Treasurers, accused her for conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some things, she leaped up, and taking him by the hair, she buffetted
him soundly; at which <hi>Caesar</hi> smiling, reproved her; to whom she answered,
<hi>Is it not a great matter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cleopatras</hi> Passion.</note> 
               <hi>O</hi> Caesar, <hi>seeing thou pleasest to come and visit me in this
condition that I am in, that I should be accused by my own Servant? If I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
some Jewels, not for my self, poor wretch, but that I might present</hi> Octavia,
<hi>and thy</hi> Lyria, <hi>that by their intercessions I might find the more favour with thee, I
hope it's no fault. Caesar</hi> was glad at this, hoping that now she had a mind to
live, but she deceived him.</p>
            <p>Shortly after she wrote a Letter, and sealing it up, she sent it by <hi>Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> wherein she desired to be buried with <hi>Anthony:</hi> then adorning
her self in her best apparel,<note place="margin">She kills her self.</note> she set an Asp to her left Arm, by the biting of
which, she presently died, as in a slumber. As soon as <hi>Caesar</hi> had read her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he sent some in all haste to her to see what was done, who when they
came, found <hi>Cleopatra</hi> dead upon a bed of Gold, in all her Royal Robes, and her
two waiting Maids dead at her feet. <hi>Caesar</hi> being informed hereof, admired,
and pitied her, and grieved that he was deprived of the chief honour of his
Triumph; and buried her in the same Sepulchre with <hi>Anthony,</hi> finishing the
Tomb which she had begun: and her waiting Women by his command were
buried honourably: She lived thirty nine years, and reigned twenty two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having setled his affairs in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpas.</hi>
               </note> passed through <hi>Syria</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi>
and from thence into <hi>Greece,</hi> and so to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he Triumphed three
dayes, first for his <hi>Dalmatian,</hi> secondly, for his <hi>Accian,</hi> and thirdly, for his
<hi>Aegyptian</hi> Victory, which was the most sumptuous, and set forth with the
greatest preparations, wherein was carried in a Bed the Image of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and
an Asp biting her Arm. After which, <hi>Caesar</hi> enriched the Temple of his Father
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103996:123"/>
               <hi>Julius</hi> with the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> spoyls: He also consecrated many things to <hi>Jupiter
Capitolinus, Juno,</hi> and <hi>Minerva:</hi> He brought into the Cell of <hi>Jupiter Capitoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
sixteen thousand pound weight of Gold, beside Pearls and precious Stones,
valued at fifty Millions of Sesterces, and <hi>Rome</hi> was so enriched with the Riches
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that the prizes of every thing were doubled, and Interest fell
from ten to four <hi>per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Caesar,</hi> in the space of about sixteen years, erected the Monarchy,
which his Uncle <hi>Julius</hi> had begun, and though the means whereby he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it are not justifiable, yet afterwards he Governed it justly, and wisely, and
was one of the best Princes in the World:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.</note> Gentle, Just, Merciful, Liberal,
Valiant, and endued with many other Virtues; happy and successful in his
affairs, and much beloved of all: and the People and Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> gave
him a new Name, which before that time was never heard of, calling him
<hi>Caesar Augustus,</hi> a Name which they held for holy, venerable, and of Great
Majesty, and which appertained to the Gods and their Temples, concerning
which <hi>Ovid</hi> thus writes,

Laws, and that he should have as absolute power as the Laws, and that he
might do all things, or not do them, according to his pleasure. And now,
because the Books of the <hi>Sybils</hi> through age were worn out, <hi>Augustus</hi> gave
charge to the Priests, with their own hands to write them out, and that no
other should read them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi> (for so now we must call him) seeing himself in quiet, and
without War,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Janus</hi> Temple shut up.</note> caused the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> to be shut, whereas they religiously
observed, that during the time of War it should stand open: It had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been shut since the foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> but twice: Once in the time of
<hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the second King thereof, and the other after the second <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
War, when <hi>Titus Manlius</hi> was Consul. <hi>Augustus</hi> shut this Temple three
times, whereof this was the first: And now living in Peace and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
he omitted no part of his care in the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and the Provinces thereof: Sending thither <hi>Praetors,</hi> Pro-consuls,
and other Governours, which were excellent men, and fit for those dignities:
and himself gave direction, and was very diligent in all things touching Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
Customes, Religion, and publick buildings, so as in all things his Reign
was happy, peaceable, and quiet, during all his Life.</p>
            <p>Yet in this so happy a time, some People and Nations still affecting Liberty,
laboured to shake off the Roman yoke,<note place="margin">New troubles.</note> and thereby molested, and disquieted
the Empire, as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and the <hi>Pannonians.</hi>
In <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Cantabrians,</hi> the <hi>Asturians,</hi> and part of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> passing their
bounds, began a War against the Empire. <hi>Augustus</hi> being informed hereof,
judging it to be a doubtful War, and of importance, commanded the Temple
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103996:123"/>
of <hi>Janus</hi> to be opened: and determined to go against them in Person, and to
send other Captains to follow his other Wars. And accordingly <hi>Augustus</hi>
went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and with three Armies made War against the People afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
which proved very doubtful and desperate, and lasted five years:
and though he suppressed the <hi>Cantabrians,</hi> and <hi>Asturians,</hi> and drave them to
their Rocks and Mountains, yet before he could wholly subdue them, he was
fain to bring a great Navy upon the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> to invade the Sea coasts of
<hi>Cantabria</hi> and <hi>Galizia,</hi> by which means he drave them to such extremities by
Land, that they were at last forced to submit to his obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> his great favourite <hi>Agrippa</hi> served him faithfully in this War,
whom therefore he married to his Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> who was the Widow of
his Nephew <hi>Marcellus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Spain</hi> subdued.</note> the Son of his Sister <hi>Octavia.</hi> And thus he brought
all <hi>Spain</hi> into subjection to him, above two hundred years after the <hi>Comans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to make their first Wars there. So as no Province cost <hi>Rome</hi> more Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
more bloud, nor more time than <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This long and doubtful War being so happily finished, <hi>Augustus</hi> was so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with it; that he gave commandment that the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
be shut, and came to <hi>Rome</hi> in great Triumph. But this Temple conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
not long shut, for some Nations of the <hi>Germans</hi> rebelled, so that it was
again opened. These were the Inhabitants of <hi>Noricum</hi> (now <hi>Bavaria</hi>) and
the <hi>Pannonia's,</hi> (now <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi>) and the two <hi>Missia's,</hi> (now <hi>Bulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and <hi>Servia</hi>) as also <hi>Illyricum,</hi> (now <hi>Sclavonia</hi>) and the Province of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
(now <hi>Transylvania</hi> and <hi>Walachia</hi>) and some others, though at several
times.</p>
            <p>Against these, <hi>Augustus</hi> sent his Generals and Armies, amongst which were
his Sons in Law, the Sons of <hi>Livia, Tiberius Nero,</hi> who succeeded him in the
Empire, and his Brother <hi>Drusus Nero,</hi> of whom <hi>Livia</hi> was with child when
<hi>Octavian</hi> married her: and these two Brothers (though the War lasted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
long) vanquished those Nations, and obtained great Victories in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and the confines thereof: especially <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who in three years space
subdued the <hi>Pannonia's, Illyricum,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> for which Victories he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
entred into <hi>Rome</hi> in an Ovation Triumph with great Pomp and Honour.
<hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> also overcame and put to flight the <hi>Missians,</hi> a People who had
never seen the <hi>Romans</hi> before. And when they were ready to give Battel,
they said, <hi>Tell us who you are that seek to molest and disquiet us?</hi> We are (said
they) <hi>Romans,</hi> the Lords of Nations; whereupon they replied; <hi>It shall be so if
you overcome us;</hi> which fell out accordingly.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Augustus</hi> obtained not these Victories without some crosses.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Augustus</hi> his crosses.</note> For in these
Wars died his Son in Law <hi>Drusus,</hi> who was highly esteemed for his Noble
acts, and great Victories; for the loss of whom, both <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Livia</hi> were
much afflicted: But yet his grief was greater for the mishap which befell
<hi>Quintilius Varro,</hi> who was General of three Legions in <hi>Germany,</hi> and being
careless, was surprized by the <hi>Almans,</hi> and himself, his Legions, and all his
Auxiliaries were slain, and two Standards with the Imperial Eagles taken; for
which he was so immoderately grieved, that he knocked his Head against the
Wall, and cryed out unadvisedly, <hi>Quintilius Varro, Give me my Legions again:</hi>
For certain months also, he suffered the hair of his Head and Beard to grow
carelesly. And the very day of this unhappy accident, he did every year ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
mournfully, with sorrow and lamentation.</p>
            <p>Of his Son in Law <hi>Drusus</hi> there remained two Sons, <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
which he had by <hi>Antonia, Augustus</hi> his Neece, and Daughter of his Sister
<hi>Octavia</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony;</hi> of which <hi>Claudius</hi> was Emperour: And <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
married <hi>Agrippina</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Julia, Augustus</hi> his Daughter, by
whom he had <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> who also was afterwards Emperour. <hi>Augustus</hi>
after many notable Victories, compelled his Enemies at length to sue for
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103996:124"/>
Peace, whereupon again he commanded the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> to be shut up,
and from thenceforth all things succeeded prosperously with him.</p>
            <p>The Subjects of the Empire were now very obedient to him,<note place="margin">Many Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours come to him.</note> and all other
sent their Ambassadours seeking his Favour and Friendship. The <hi>Indians</hi> in
the remotest parts of the East, and the <hi>Scythians</hi> that inhabited the North:
and the <hi>Parthians,</hi> an untamed People, sent their Ambassadours to him, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
security to keep the Peace, and restoring to him the Standards and Eagles
which were taken when <hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> was slain. There came also Kings,
who were Friends and Subjects to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, to do him Homage, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aside their Ensignes, and Royal Robes: and many of them bult Cities to
his Name, and for his Honour, calling them <hi>Caesaria.</hi> So did <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Great</hi>
in <hi>Palestine,</hi> King <hi>Juba</hi> in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The World being thus at Peace and quietness, forty and two years being
expired since that <hi>Augustus,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> came to <hi>Rome;</hi> In
the time of this general Peace, was the Prince of Peace, our blessed Lord and
Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> born in <hi>Bethlem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> born.</note> of the Virgin <hi>Mary, Herod</hi> being King
of <hi>Judea,</hi> placed there by the <hi>Romans,</hi> of whose blessed Life and bitter Death,
as also of the order of his Ministry, and Miracles, see his Life, published by
me, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1664. At which time there came forth a command from
<hi>Caesar Angustus,</hi> that all the <hi>Roman</hi> World should be taxed, which taxing was
first made, when <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Governour of <hi>Syria, Luk.</hi> 2. 1. Out of which,
a little Book was made by <hi>Augustus,</hi> in which all the publick riches were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:
as also how many Citizens, and Allies in Arms: what Navies: How
many Kingdomes and Provinces: what Tribute and Customes there were:
what necessary charges and Pensions went out. Shortly after, <hi>Augustus</hi> was
called Lord by the People, but he did not only refuse that Title, but forbad it
by a publick Edict.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> enjoying so great prosperity,<note place="margin">His Prudence and Justice.</note> was yet nothing altered in his quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and behaviour, as often it happens in other Princes; but rather became
more mild, just, and affable, more courteous, liberal, and temperate. He esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
very good Laws and Orders for the reformation and abuses, and evil
customes. He erected both within and without <hi>Rome</hi> many stately and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous
Edifices, which made him to boast concerning <hi>Rome, Latericiam inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,
Marmoream reliqui:</hi> I found it built with Brick, and left it built with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
He bestowed great gifts and favours upon all sorts of People. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
the People with Feasts, and Playes of sundry kinds, going himself
in person to honour them: He sent Colonies into sundry parts and Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
He made excellent good Orders for the Governours and Government of
the whole Empire: The like he did also for the Wars, and Martial Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
He shewed himself loving and sociable to his Friends and Familiars,
whom he honoured and loved much, Some conspiracies against him which
were discovered, he punished without rigour, being more prone to pardon
than to punish. Of murmurings and defamatory Libels, he never desired to
know the Authors; but answered them with gravity, giving satisfaction, and
purging himself from those things which were charged upon him. He was
much addicted to, and affected with Learning, and himself was very Learned
and Eloquent, and compiled some notable Books. He much honoured and
rewarded Wise and Learned men: yet he escaped not the tainture of some
Vices,<note place="margin">His Vices.</note> growing through humane frailty, and his great liberty: especially he
was much given to Women, though in his diet, apparel, and ornaments, he
was very sparing and modest. He gave himself also excessively to play at
Dice, and other Games then in use.</p>
            <p>Thus,<note place="margin">His Crosses.</note> though in many things he was very happy, yet, besides his troubles
and dangers, he was very unhappy in his Children and Successours. For by his
four Wives to whom he was married, he had only one Daughter called <hi>Julia,</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:103996:124"/>
by his third Wife <hi>Scribonia,</hi> and she proved exceeding wanton, and unchaste,
yea, she left nothing undone in Luxury and Lust, that was possible for a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to do or suffer, accounting every thing lawful that pleased her. Yea,
she came to that height of lasciviousness, that she kept her Feasting even in
the Courts of Justice, abusing those very places with lascivious acts, in which
her Father had made Laws against Adulterers. Hereupon her Father was so
enraged, that he could not contain his anger within his own House, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
these things, yea, and communicated them to the Lords of the Senate.
He kept himself also a long time from company, for very shame: He had
thoughts of putting his Daughter to death; but at last he banished her into
<hi>Pandataria,</hi> an Island of <hi>Campania,</hi> her Mother <hi>Scribonia,</hi> of her own accord, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
her in her banishment. <hi>Julia</hi> being at this time thirty eight years
old.</p>
            <p>For want of Sons to succeed him, <hi>Augustus</hi> first adopted his Nephew <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
the Son of his Sister <hi>Octavia,</hi> to whom he first married his Daughter <hi>Julia:</hi>
and <hi>Marcellus</hi> dying without Issue, he then married her to his Favourite <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa:</hi>
who also left her a Widow, but yet he had by her three Sons, and two
Daughters: Two of these Sons having been adopted by <hi>Augustus,</hi> died before
him: whereupon he adopted the third, who bore his Fathers Name, <hi>Agrippa,</hi>
the which adoption he afterwards revoked, for some displeasure conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: and lastly, he adopted his Son in Law <hi>Tiberius Nero,</hi> and made him
his Heir, whom also he married to his Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> the Widow of <hi>Agrippa:</hi>
yet this he did more through the importunity of his mother, than for any
good liking that he had of him, being sorry that such an one should succeed
him.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the first Letter of his Name, that was upon the Inscription
of his Statue that was set up in the Capitol,<note place="margin">A Prodigy.</note> fell down, being struck with a
flash of Lightning; whereupon the Southsayers foretold that he should live
only one hundred dayes after, which was denoted by the Letter <hi>C.</hi> and that
he should be Canonized for a God, because <hi>Aesar,</hi> which remained of his
Name, in the <hi>Hetruscan</hi> Tongue, signified a God. Hereupon he wrote a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue
of his doings, which he appointed to be engraven in Tables of Brass,
and to be set over his Tomb.</p>
            <p>Things being thus done, <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi> being now seventy six years old, and
odd dayes, having Reigned above fifty six, and being the best beloved, and the
best obeyed Prince in the World, Death overtook him, which was occasioned
by a Flux, which held him for some dayes: and so <hi>Augustus</hi> died at <hi>Nolla</hi> in
<hi>Campania,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Death.</note> in the same House and Chamber wherein his Father <hi>Octavius</hi> died,
being the nineteenth day of <hi>August,</hi> upon which day he was first made Consul:
and in the fifteenth year after the birth of our Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was generally lamented, and there was a universal sorrow and heaviness
over the whole Empire for him. For he did wisely and uprightly Govern
that Monarchy which he had gotten by force and fraud.<note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> He was of a mean
stature, of a very good shape and proportion of Body, of an exceeding fair face,
mixed with modesty and gravity: His eyes were very clear and bright: He
was very advised in his speeches, and loved to speak quick, and briefly. His
last Will and Testament was written a year and four moneths before he died,
and left in the custody of the <hi>Vestal Virgins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his life time he vvas very desirous to reform abuses in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the
first place he corrected some disorders in the Senate, vvhom he reduced to the
number of six hundred. He reformed vvhat vvas amiss in their Playes and
Games, in the Knights, and in their manner of suing for publick Offices. He
set Fines upon their Heads that vvould not marry, and bestovved much upon
those that had Wives and Children.<note place="margin">He was a Friend to marriage.</note> He gave unto <hi>Hortensius</hi> tvventy five
thousand Crovvns, to procure him to marry, that he might raise up issue to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103996:125"/>
that Noble Family of the <hi>Hortenses.</hi> He ordained that Maids should be at least
twelve years old before they married: and suffered them to kill Adulterers,
that were taken in the fact, and condemned the <hi>Sodomites</hi> without pardon.
He gave order that none should be put in nomination for Offices, but such as
were vertuous,<note place="margin">His tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> and of good repute. He tied not himself to any certain hours
for his meals, but used to eat when he was hungry, and that which he fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was neither dainty nor delicate, and he drank little Wine: Instead of a
Looking-glass, he used to read or write whilst his Barber was trimming him.
He never spake to the Senate or people, or to his Souldiers, but what he had
first written and premeditated, though he had words at command.</p>
            <p>He delighted to read good Authors,<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> but gathered nothing more than senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
teaching good manners, and having written them out word for word, he
gave Copies thereof to his familiar Friends, and sent them about to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of Provinces, and to the Magistrates of <hi>Rome.</hi> He was too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to Divinations, and was marvellously afraid of Thunder and Lightning.
Our Saviour <hi>christ</hi> being born, all the Devils Oracles ceased, and the Oracle of
<hi>Delphos</hi> was fain to confess it,<note place="margin">The Devils Oracles dumb.</note> and ever after remained Dumb: whereupon
<hi>Augustus</hi> being astonished, caused a great Altar to be set up in the Capitol, with
an Inscription, signifying, that <hi>it was the altar of the God first born.</hi> To prevent
the great abuse of Usury, which undid many Families, he put into the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
twenty five hundred thousand Crowns,<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> and suffered private men to take
of it for three years, without Interest, putting in good security for the paying
back of the principal: and condemned such Usurers as had taken more than
the Law allowed, to pay four times as much to those who had been oppressed
by them.</p>

OF
TAMERLANE
THE

WHO
FLORISHED
ANNO CHRISTI 1400.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>TAMERLANE</hi> was born at <hi>Samercand,</hi> the chief City
of the <hi>Zagatajan Tartars;</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</note> His Father was called <hi>Zain-Cham,</hi>
or, as others will, <hi>Og,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Zagatajans,</hi>
of the Country <hi>Sachithays</hi> (sometimes part of the famous
Kingdom of <hi>Parthia</hi>) third in descent from <hi>Zingis,</hi> the
great and successful Captain of the <hi>Tartars;</hi> which <hi>Og</hi>
being a Prince of a peaceable nature (accounting it no
less honour quietly to keep the Countries left him by his Father,<note place="margin">His Fathers peaceable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note> than with
much trouble and no less hazard to seek how to enlarge the same) long lived
in most happy peace with his Subjects, no less happy therein than himself;
not so much seeking after the hoording up of Gold and Silver (things of that
Nation not regarded nor valued) as contenting himself with the encrease and
profit of his Sheep and herds of Cattel, then, and yet also the principal reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the <hi>Tartar</hi> Kings and Princes; which happily gave occasion to some,
ignorant of the manner and customs of those Northern Nations and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:103996:126"/>
to account them all for Shepherds and Herdsmen, and so also to have
reported of this mighty Prince, as if he had been a Shepherds Son, or Herds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
himself, vainly measuring his Nobility by the homely course of life of
his People and Subjects, and not by the honour of his House, and Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Vertues, hardly to be paralelled by any Prince of that, or the former
Ages.</p>
            <p>His peaceable Father now well stricken in years, and weary of the World,
delivered up his Kingdom to this his Son (not yet past fifteen years old) joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
unto him two of his most faithful Councellours,<note place="margin">He resigns his Kingdom to his Son.</note> 
               <hi>Odmar</hi> and <hi>Ally,</hi> to assist
him in the government of his State, whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> dearly loved whilst
they lived, and much honoured the remembrance of them being dead.</p>
            <p>The first proof of <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Fortune and Valour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> war against the <hi>Muscovites.</hi>
               </note> was against the great
Duke of <hi>Mosco,</hi> or Emperour of <hi>Russia,</hi> for spoiling of a City which had put
it self under his protection, and for entring his Country, and proclaiming War
against him:<note place="margin">His Victory.</note> whom he in a great Battel overthrew, having slain twenty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thousand of the <hi>Muscovites</hi> Footmen, and between fifteen and sixteen
thousand Horsemen, with the loss of scarce eight thousand Horsemen, and
four thousand Footmen of his own. After which Battel <hi>Tamerlane</hi> behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so many thousands of men lying dead upon the ground, was so far from
rejoycing thereat, that turning himself to one of his familiar Friends, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the condition of such as command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Fathers quiet course of life, accounting him happy in seeking for rest,
and such most unhappy, which by the destruction of their own kind, sought
to procure their own glory, protesting himself even from his heart to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to see such sad tokens of his Victory. <hi>Alhacen</hi> in his <hi>Arabick</hi> History of
<hi>Tamerlane,</hi> makes this Narrative of the Battel. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> (saith he) had
a great Army,<note place="margin">His Battel with the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites.</hi>
               </note> which he had gathered together out of sundry Nations: and
<hi>Tamerlane</hi> intending not to put up such wrongs and indignities, assembled all
his Forces, and those of his Allies. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> forces were such as had
been well trained up in the Wars: For having lately concluded a Peace with
the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> he had from thence ten thousand very good Horsemen:
There were also with him many <hi>Hungarian</hi> Gentlemen, under the conduct of
one <hi>Uladislaus,</hi> who brought with him more than eight thousand Horse; so that
he had in his Army about eighty thousand Horse, and one hundred thousand
Footmen. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had in his Army about one hundred and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse, and one hundred and fifty thousand Foot, but not so good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
as the <hi>Muscovites;</hi> for his Subjects had been long trained up in peace
under his peaceable Father; and though they had been sometimes exercised,
yet they wanted the practical part of War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> order in his march was this, He caused all his Army to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into Squadrons, each consisting of six thousand Horse, save his own,
which consisted of ten thousand; so that he made eighteen Squadrons besides
his own. The Avantguard was conducted by <hi>Odmar,</hi> who led eight Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
which were flanked by forty thousand Footmen, divided on the right
and left sides, who shot an infinite number of Arrows. The Battel was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who, with his own, led ten Squadrons, and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Footmen, the best and choicest Souldiers of his whole Army. The Prince
of <hi>Thanais,</hi> his Kinsman, led the Arereward with six Squadrons of Horse, and
forty thousand Foot; his forlorn Hope consisted of some three thousand Horse,
adventurers. The <hi>Muscovites</hi> fought by double Ranks with Lances, and
they seemed to be a greater number than <hi>Tamerlanes,</hi> making a great noise:
but <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> skill and multitude at length overcame the force and valour
of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Victory.</note> the Victory bending to the <hi>Parthians</hi> side, which they

seven and eight thousand Horsemen, and between three and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Footmen.
The <hi>Muscovites</hi> lost about twenty seven thousand Foot, and
fifteen or sixteen thousand Horse.</p>
            <p>The Prince slacked no time after so great a Victory, but marching on,
came into the borders of the <hi>Muscovites,</hi> whom he enforced this agreement.
That they should become his Tributaries,<note place="margin">The Article<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Duckats: That the great Duke should defray all the charges of the Wars,
amounting to three hundred thousand Duckats: That he should withdraw his
Army, and send back all the Prisoners: and that for the performance
hereof, he should give pledges; which should be changed every year:
All which being agreed to, he returned with great content and glory to
his Father.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, the great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> (his Fathers Brother) being
grown old, and out of hope of having any more Children; moved with the
Fame of his Nephew after this Victory, sent him divers presents; and withal,
offering him his only Daughter in Marriage, sent him word that he would
proclaim him Heir apparent to his Empire, as indeed in right he was, being
his Brothers Son, and the Daughters not using to succeed in those Empires:
Which so great an offer <hi>Tamerlane</hi> gladly accepted,<note place="margin">His marriage to the great <hi>Chams</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and so the marriage was
afterwards with great Triumph at the old Emperours Court solemnized,
and consummated, and our <hi>Tamerlane</hi> according to his Uncles promise, and
his own right was proclaimed Heir apparent of that great Empire.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Tamerlane</hi> made Great, being ever after this marriage, by the
old Emperour his Uncle and now his Father in Law, so long as he lived, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
supported, and after his death he succeeded him in that so vast, and
mighty an Empire. Before his marriage <hi>Tamerlane</hi> would needs be crowned,
to the intent that none should think that the Crown came to him by the right
of his Wife,<note place="margin">His Prudence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> but by his own right; and during his abode in the City of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicai,</hi>
where the old Emperour was, he was entertained with all kind of
Triumphs,<note place="margin">His agility and strength.</note> wherein he always carried away the Bell, whether in shooting
in the Bow, in changing of Horses in the middest of their courses, in Tiltings,
and in all other exercises which required agility or strength; and so after two
Months he returned with his Wife to <hi>Samercand;</hi> in which City he delighted
exceedingly to remain, because the situation thereof was fair, and being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with a great River, was a place of great Traffick, whereby it was made
richer than any other in that Country: And whensoever be received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
from the Emperour his Uncle, he still imparted the same to <hi>Odmar,</hi>
whom he used at his right hand in all his great affairs: There was also in
his Court a Christian whom he loved much, and every one greatly respected,
called <hi>Axalla,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Piety.</note> a <hi>Genovois</hi> by Birth, brought up from his youth about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for he countenanced all that worshipped one only God that was the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of all things. And about this time the old Emperour sent to him to stir
him up to War against the great King of <hi>China,</hi> who stiled himself, <hi>Lord of the
World, and Son of the Sun,</hi> who had exceeded his bounds, and incroached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Empire: This was no small enterprise, and therefore before
he would begin the same,<note place="margin">His Justice.</note> he sent Ambassadours to the King of <hi>China</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
restitution of his Lands, and the passages of a River called <hi>Tachii,</hi> which
were within the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Border, and on this side that stupendious Wall
builded on purpose by the Kings of <hi>China</hi> for the defence of their Country
against the incursions of the <hi>Tartars:</hi> and whilst he attended for the return of
his Ambassadours,<note place="margin">His preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the King of <hi>China.</hi>
               </note> expecting a Negative answer, he caused his forces to be
assembled together from all parts, appointing their rendezvous to be in the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103996:127"/>
               <hi>Horda</hi> of <hi>Baschir:</hi> The old Emperour also assembled for his aid, two hundred
thousand fighting men, wherein were all the brave men of his Court that
were accustomed to the Wars: For this Emperour had greatly encreased his
limits, and conquered a great Country, so as all these men were well train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in the Wars, and had been accustomed to travel and pains; These were
to joyn with <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Army in the Desarts of <hi>Ergimul</hi> at a certain day. In
the mean time Ambassadours which were sent, return and inform the
Prince that this proud King of <hi>China</hi> wondering how any durst denounce
War against him,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>China</hi>'s Pride.</note> making this lofty answer: <hi>That</hi> Tamerlane <hi>should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himself with that which he had left him, which also he might have taken
from him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This answer being heard, our Prince marched directly to his Army, gave
orders for conveiance of Victuals from all parts, sent to hasten forwards his
Confederates, imparted the answer to the old Emperour, caused the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the King of <hi>China</hi> to be published, that all the world might know the
justness of his cause;<note place="margin">His Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> yet before his departure, he went to take leave of his
own Father, who endued with a singular and Fatherly affection, kissed him
a thousand times, made solemn Prayers for his prosperity, drew off his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Ring, and gave it him, telling him that he should never see him again,
for that he was hasting to his last rest; and calling <hi>Odmar,</hi> bad him farewel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
his faithfulness to his Son.</p>
            <p>The Prince having performed this duty, returned to <hi>Samercand,</hi> where the
Empress his Wife remained, whom he took along with him in this journey,
as the manner of that Country is, and so presently departed, committing the
charge and care of his Kingdom in his absence to one <hi>Samay,</hi> a man well pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
in State affairs, who also had had the charge of our Prince in his youth.
These things being dispatched, he marched forwards in the middest of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which consisted of fifty thousand Horse, and a hundred thousand Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
relying principally on the Forces of the great <hi>Cham</hi> his Uncle: yet he
left order that the rest of his Forces should be ready to advance upon the first
command,<note place="margin">His sickness.</note> as soon as he should be joyned with his Uncles Army. In his
march he was stayed by the way in regard some distemper of his body,
contracted by reason of his change of the air, yet the Forces which <hi>Catiles,</hi>
Captain of the Army of the great <hi>Cham</hi> conducted, went daily forwards.
Now the news of his distemperature was bruted abroad in all places,<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> yet did
he not neglect ot send to the great <hi>Cham,</hi> and often to advertise him of the
state of his health, to the end that the same should not cause any alteration
which might arise in that great Empire whereunto he was lately advanced:
For he was very suspicious of a great Lord, named <hi>Calix,</hi> who was discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his advancement, and had not yet acknowledged him, as all other his
Subjects had:<note place="margin">The Rebellion of <hi>Calix.</hi>
               </note> and indeed it was not without cause that he suspected him, for
<hi>Calix</hi> being informed that the Forces of the great <hi>Cham</hi> were advanced beyond
the Mountains, having passed the River of <hi>Meau,</hi> and were encamped at <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prou,</hi>
and that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was sick, he thought it a fit time for his enterprize,
and thereupon assembling the greatest part of his most faithful followers, he
told them that now was the time for them to shake off the yoak of the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who otherwise would enslave them; and seeing that now their Prince
was so badly minded as to translate the Empire to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> of his own mind,
without calling them to Council which had interest in the election, that this
was the only means to assure their liberty, which otherwise was like to be lost:
He caused also a remour to be spread, that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was very sick, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
old and crazy,<note place="margin">The Rebels subtilty.</note> and that his Forces were far separated from him; yet
like cunning Traytors, they dispatched away a Messenger to the great
<hi>Cham,</hi> to assure him that they bended not their Forces against him, but
were his faithful and obedient Subjects; and they only armed themselves
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103996:127"/>
because they would not be governed by the <hi>Parthians,</hi> their ancient
Enemies.</p>
            <p>As soon as our Prince was advertised of the pretences of <hi>Calix,</hi> he marched
one days journey forward, to the end that he might approach unto <hi>Calibes,</hi>
who, what face soever he set on the matter, yet hearkened what would
become of <hi>Calix,</hi> that he might likewise make some commotion. This <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libes</hi>
was by <hi>Tamerlane</hi> made Commander of his Avantguard,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Prudence.</note> which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>Parthians,</hi> yet he had joyned with him the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> without
whom he could not do any thing. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> also gave special command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the passages (which were not many) should be diligently guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to the end that the King of <hi>China</hi> should not be advertised of these tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults:
and so giving to <hi>Odmar</hi> the leading of his Avantguard, he hasted
forwards;<note place="margin">His march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Calix.</hi>
               </note> And surely it was high time for him so to do, or else all had been
revolted: for <hi>Calix</hi> having assembled a hundred thousand fighting men,
presented himself before the great City of <hi>Cambalu,</hi> chief of the Province of
<hi>Cathai,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof came out to meet him, receiving him with
all the joy that might be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> in his March went to <hi>Caindu,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Calatia,</hi> where
he expected to meet with the forces of his native Country of <hi>Sachetai,</hi> yet did
he not neglect to send forward his Army towards <hi>Cambalu,</hi> which caused
the Inhabitants, to their great terrour, to think that all his forces were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
on their neck. <hi>Calix</hi> perceiving that the Citizens began already to repent
his entertainment,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calix</hi> leaves <hi>Cambalu.</hi>
               </note> thought it not safe to remain amongst them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
withdrawing himself, he sent for his forces from all parts, resolving to
meet <hi>Tamerlane</hi> in the Field, and to put all upon the event and hazard of a
Battel. He drew out of <hi>Cambalu</hi> fifty thousand men, whereof twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
were Citizens, the other thirty thousand were the Garrison-Souldiers,
placed there by the old Emperour, <hi>Calix</hi> having corrupted their Leaders, and
so procured them to joyn with him in this revolt. In short, having assembled
all his forces,<note place="margin">The number of <hi>Calix</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> his Army consisted of fourscore thousand Horse, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Footmen, which he gathered from all parts.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Army marching forward, his Scouts,
which were two thousand Horse, had news of the Army of <hi>Calix,</hi> which
came forward directly towards them, of which they speedily advertised the
Emperour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Prudence.</note> who thereupon presently sent two thousand Horse more, to the
end that they should keep the passages of a certain River called <hi>Brore,</hi> by which
River Victuals were conveyed to his Army: as also to win time, the Prince
well knowing that the motions of a Civil War are furious at the beginning,
and that therefore it's best to resist slowly, always drawing them out at length,
if it be possible. For when means, money, and victuals fail, the people use
to be sensible of their faults, and to return home.</p>
            <p>The old Emperour sent to him to adventure all upon a Battel, delivering
up into his hands the safety of his life and estate, that thereby he might end
his days in peace: By this means forces came to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> on all hands,
whose Army daily encreased; whereas on the contrary the Enemies Army
was then in its chiefest force, and began to feel the want of Victuals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calix</hi> was about forty years old, a Captain renowned with the great
<hi>Cham,</hi> and one of the chiefest in dignity and place about him, so that
many of the <hi>Tartars</hi> had always respected him as a Person most worthy
of the Empire, if the glory of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> and his reputation had not so far
exceeded.</p>
            <p>The Armies began to be in view one of another about eight a clock in the
morning,<note place="margin">The Battel between <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi> and <hi>Calix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> and many skirmishes began betwixt them before they came to the
main Battel, The place wherein they met at that time, was a great Plain,
with like advantage on either part. <hi>Odmar</hi> led the Avantguard, wherein
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103996:128"/>
were forty thousand Horse, and eighty thousand Foot, which he divided into
three Squadrons; the first whereof he sent before him to begin the Battel.
<hi>Tamerlane</hi> marched in the same order, but his Squadrons were much stronger.
The Footmen of both made the right and left Wings. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had drawn
out six thousand <hi>Parthian</hi> Horsemen, and two thousand <hi>Tartarians</hi> for his
Arearguard, which he committed to his faithful Servant <hi>Axalla;</hi> a man of
great judgment, quick of conceit, and in great esteem amongst the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
although, he being a Christian, worshipped God in another manner
than they did; and he had many other Christians with him, whom he
had drawn from the <hi>Georgians,</hi> and the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, who fought with great
agility.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calix</hi> on the other side, who was a well spoken man, was exhorting and
encouraging his Souldiers to fight for his Fortune, and the Liberty of their
Nation; He divided his Army into three main Battels, himself remaining
in the midst,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calix</hi> beaten and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</note> encompassed with his Footmen, and so the Battels joyned,
where, after a terrible fight, <hi>Calix</hi> fell into <hi>Axalla's</hi> hands, being taken fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
valiantly, which <hi>Axalla</hi> caused to be presently proclaimed through the
Army, to the overthrow of the courage of all the Adversaries, who hereupon
immediately fled.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calix</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</note> 
               <hi>Calix</hi> was kept till the next day, and then by a Council of
War was adjudged to death; whereupon <hi>Tamerlane</hi> caused his head to be
stricken off, the which he sent as a present to the Inhabitants of <hi>Cambalu:</hi> The
like he caused to be done to all the chief Leaders, not out of a cruel dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but enforced thereto by necessity, knowing very well that the way to cut
off the foot of Civil War, is to punish the Heads of the same, which, as <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi>'s,
grow up too fast.</p>
            <p>After this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> march into <hi>Cathay.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with his Army marched into the Kingdom of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thay,</hi>
a Country rich in grass, and all kind of pastures, abounding with great
quantity of beasts and people, which knew not what War meant, and the
Prince gave command that they should not be used as Enemies, but as his good
Subjects; and whereas divers Cities had adhered to <hi>Calix,</hi> they came now
and humbled themselves before him, craving pardon, which he gave them,
enjoyning them only to provide victuals for his Army, which also they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
did. This example of Lenity of was no small importance for the appeasing
of others, which had put all their hope in extremity, resolving to sell their lives
dear, and especially the Inhabitants of <hi>Cambalu</hi> had taken this resolution, but
being informed of the Emperours clemency,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cambalu</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him.</note> they changed their purpose: Yet
as the Army daily approached nearer, their fears encreased, but <hi>Tamerlane</hi>
was daily informed by his Friends in the City, that the Inhabitants resolved
to obey the Conquerour, and therefore leaving his Army at <hi>Gonsa,</hi> he only
sent thirty thousand to the City, which was the ordinary Garrison, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
two hours after, entred the City himself, where he was received with
great magnificence: yet would he not pronounce their pardon, but referred
all to the old Emperour, and to the ordinary course of Justice: For which end
he sent one of his Favourites to the old Emperour, to certifie him of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
of the death of <hi>Calix,</hi> and that the chief of his Faction remained Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with him; as also to know what Justice he would appoint to be inflicted
upon those Citizens which were the authors of the revolt of this City,<note place="margin">His departure from <hi>Camba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu.</hi>
               </note> and so
after eight days he departed, and not many days after, he had intelligence that
the great <hi>Cham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Policy.</note> his Uncle, had caused justice to be done on the chief movers
of sedition in <hi>Cambalu,</hi> so that the People complained of the old Emperours
cruelty, but commended the mercy of <hi>Tamerlane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he came back to his Army, he was received of all his Souldiers with
loud acclamations, calling him, <hi>Most Great Emperour, and most Victorious.</hi>
Amongst his Captains he discoursed of the beauty and greatne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the
City of <hi>Cambalu,</hi> and afterwards asked <hi>Odmars</hi> advise whether it were not
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:103996:128"/>
best for him to visit the old Emperour, and with his Emperess to spend the
Winter with him at <hi>Quinsay? Odmar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Odmars</hi> good Counsel.</note> remembring the honour which he had
received there, easily perceived his inclination to that journy, yet by all means
disswaded him from it: To which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> answered, that he had always
found his fidelity and love to him, which he was sorry that he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
to the full; But (saith he) whereas I had thought to give my self
some ease: I perceive that instead of the delicacies, and pleasures of <hi>Quinsay,</hi>
I must make the desarts of <hi>Cipribit</hi> my resting place after my travels in this new
Victory: yet a rumour being spread that the Prince intended to visit the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
every man began to desire to return into his own Country, hoping to
enjoy the sweetness of his native soil: which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> being informed of,
calling his Army to a Rendevouz,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Speech to his Army.</note> he thus spake unto them, <hi>We have (my
faithful Souldiers) begun an enterprise against the King of</hi> China, <hi>who hath of late
repulsed even beyond the Mountains, the</hi> Tartarian <hi>name, but were hindred to
our great grief by the foolish rashness of</hi> Calix, <hi>and were driven to turn the bridle
to punish him, wherein you have all assisted me. It grieves me that I cannot as
well boast of the fresh spoils of a stranger, as I may (by the means of your wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons)
of those of our unfaithful Subjects, and as in times past of the fierce</hi> Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
<hi>against whom, with your assistance, I made trial of my first Arms: but for
this last Victory being against our own Subjects, I cannot speak of it without shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
tears; desiring to bury such Victories in oblivion, together with all the glory
and honour gotten thereby. Neither do I recount these things to you, but to shew
that I forget not your faithfulness, and the great travel you have endured for my
sake: We must not therefore be weary, but must turn our weapons against those
which imagine us to be full of troubles, whereas we are indeed Victorious: Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
and all our amunition is advanced near to our Enemy already, we must
in that place (my Souldiers, and friendly Followers) pass over the rest of Winter;
Our Companions look for us; our Enemies are secure, and look not for us at this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the year, and know that our Army that is already there, is not sufficient for
offence, but only for defence. You shall receive double pay, the better to furnish you
against the injury of cold; and as we shall be apparelled with double garments, so I
hope we shall be cloathed with double glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus spoken, his Souldiers all cryed, <hi>One God in Heaven, and one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
on Earth,</hi> shewing their willingness to obey his commands.</p>
            <p>The Prince after this, remained there eight days longer, sending back <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mai</hi>
with twenty five thousand Horse, and fifty thousand Foot to <hi>Sachethay,</hi>
for the safety of his estate in those parts:<note place="margin">His Piety.</note> and so after solemn and publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the Army began to march forwards: He forgat not likewise to dispatch
away a Messenger to the Great <hi>Cham,</hi> to acquaint him with all his purposes,
which he approved very well of: By the same Messenger he also beseeched
him in the Spring to send him fifty thousand men to recruit his Army, and
some moneys for the payment of his Souldiers, which also he granted; send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also good store of warlike munition, and plenty of Victuals, knowing how
much the success of the War would advance the <hi>Tartarian</hi> greatness and profit.</p>
            <p>The Army being upon their March, in thirty eight days came to <hi>Cipribit,</hi>
yet met with many inconveniences by the way.<note place="margin">His march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>China.</hi>
               </note> There they had news of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libes,</hi>
who was glad to hear how businesses had passed, and came to visit the
Prince, who entertained him very courteously, acquainting him with his
purpose, and also understood by him how all things passed in the Kingdom of
<hi>China.</hi> The next day the Prince came to <hi>Pazanfou,</hi> where <hi>Calibes</hi> Forces
were, who had often fought with, and tried the valour of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> but
found it much inferiour to their own: There the Prince took a general Muster
of all his Army, caused them to be paid, took notice of their countenances,
whilst they all cryed out, <hi>God save the victorious and invincible Emperour,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their custom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:103996:129"/>
The Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> who commanded the Army with <hi>Calibes,</hi> had dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
viewed the Wall, and the ways by which he might forcibly enter into
<hi>China,</hi> and had sent many Spies by certain ways through the Mountains into
that Country, by whom he was advertised of all their proceedings: He had
also gained by his courtesie, a Lord of those Mountains, called the Lord of
<hi>Vauchefu,</hi> that commanded over a great Countrey, who being desirous of a
new Master, and to submit to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> had told the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> that
he was able to do Emperour good service, and to help him much in his
Wars against the <hi>Chinois:</hi>
               <note place="margin">A <hi>Chinois</hi> Lord comes to <hi>Tamerlane.</hi>
               </note> This the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> discovered to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi>
who was very desirous to speak with this Lord; whereupon a day was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and <hi>Tamerlane</hi> without moving of his Army, went to the Tents of
the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> where this aforesaid Lord met him; and the Emperour
having heaped upon him many gifts of fair Horses, and rich Furs, and other
rare things; this Lord spake thus unto him, <hi>Know, my Lord, that it is but lost
labour for you to think that with your Armies you shall be able to force this Wall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Speech to <hi>Tamerlane.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>made by the</hi> Chinois <hi>to hinder the incursion of your Subjects: the Defendants
have too much advantage therein; I doubt not of your Souldiers valour and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
I know you have conquered many Nations with them, and that whatsoever
you command them, they will effect it, or die in the enterprise: I know that you
have great and wise Captains with you, and that you, of all Persons in the World,
are most worthy to command them: But all this will be but in vain against the
Wall of the</hi> Chinois, <hi>where, I assure you, are fifty thousand men to keep it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can you stay there so short a time, but there will come fifty thousand more to
assist them, led by one</hi> Xianxi, <hi>who had already received such a commandment:
The King of</hi> China <hi>will himself follow, who will give you Battel with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Horsemen, and as many Foot; and though happily your Fortune,
and valour may carry away the Victory, yet I believe it will cost you dear: But to
shew you how much the reputation and courtesies of your Servants have prevailed
with me, I will direct you in a way whereby fifty thousand of your men may go
into</hi> China, <hi>whom I my self will conduct, and they shall come upon those which
guard the Wall, in a manner before they are discovered. In the mean time you
shall lead your Army to a place which I will direct you to, where you may win
easily a Mountain which will give you great advantage against the</hi> Chinois.
<hi>For I assure my self, that when they shall perceive your men to be passed; they
will lose their courage, so that you may easily win the passage to assist your Army,
which shall be led by me amongst them; and to assure you of my fidelity, I will
deliver into your hands my Wife, my only Son, and two little Daughters. I
have also one Brother, who, I assure my self, will follow me to do you
service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour having heard this, much rejoyced at it, hoping that his
affairs would succeed happily, and kept this very secret, no revealing it
to the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> himself, none being present at the discourse
but the Lord and his Interpreter, and so heaping new favours upon him,
he was conducted back by the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> with all the honour that
might be.</p>
            <p>Then the Emperour returned to his Quarters, and the next day imparted
the whole matter unto <hi>Odmar;</hi> and then calling <hi>Calibes,</hi> he asked what he

<hi>Calibes,</hi> he appointed his Army to remove to a certain place, where
he meant to chuse out fifty thousand men, whom he would deliver to the
Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> and <hi>Axalla;</hi> which accordingly he did, and directed them
to follow this <hi>Chinois</hi> Lord, who was now again come to him, and to do as
they should be directed by him: In the mean time himself, with all the rest of
the Army approached the Wall directly over against <hi>Quaguifou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Army,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Forces sent into Chini,</hi>
               </note> led by the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> having marched ten Leagues by
the conduct of the <hi>Chinois Lord,</hi> entred without resistance, and after a short
repast, they marched directly towards those that guarded the Wall, who sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
no such matter, but only had an eye to those which came to force the
Wall.<note place="margin">The wall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note> But it fell our far otherwise, for just as <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with his Army came
to the Wall, they saw <hi>Axalla</hi> with twenty thousand, being followed by the
Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His first victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in China.</note> with thirty thousand choice Souldiers more, who, without
any words, fell upon the <hi>Chinois;</hi> and <hi>Odmar,</hi> who gave the first assault upon
the Wall, easily in that distraction brake through, and so the <hi>Chinois</hi> were cut
off between the two Armies: and <hi>Axalla,</hi> before the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> came
up to him, had routed them; Great riches were gotten that day, and the King
of <hi>China's</hi> Cozen was taken Prisoner; much Gold was found, as well on their
Arms, as on their Horses Furniture, but they shewed no great valour.</p>
            <p>The news of this overthrow being carried to the King of <hi>China,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King of <hi>China's</hi> fear.</note> who was
now at <hi>Quantifou;</hi> it brought great astonishment to him, for that he judged
it impossible to have been effected, so that every one was filled with tears,
fears,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>China's</hi> super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</note> and lamentations for their friends. Yet the King gathers forces from
all parts, calling also the Priests, and such as had the charge of his unholy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
to come unto him, commanding them to offer sacrifices to their gods,
whereof the Sun is principal, requiring the same to be observed through all
the Cities; and then that every one that was able to bear Arms, should mount
on horseback, and speedily repair to the King at <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> whither he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> would march, for that it was one of the Cities nearest
to the borders.<note place="margin">The wall beaten down.</note> In the mean time <hi>Tamerlane</hi> beat down the Wall, the better
to assure his return, as also the Forlresses upon all the passages, all which,
upon his Victory, were easily surrendred to him. He shewed himself very
courteous to the people upon the Mountains, and gave to the Lord that had
conducted his Army, a Country which bordered upon his,<note place="margin">Tamerlanes courtesie.</note> wherein were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or eight good Towns, who came and delivered the Keyes to him: He
gave him also the Government of the Frontier-Province of <hi>Xianxi,</hi> shewing
himself to be a Prince of his word,<note place="margin">His gratitude.</note> and reserved the rewarding of his Brother
till he had farther opportunity.</p>
            <p>Whilst he was thus employed, news was brought him, that the King of
<hi>China</hi> had assembled his Forces, and was marching forward, himself being
there in person; as also that he had strengthened the Garrisons in all his Cities,
which of themselves were well fortified. Upon his intelligence, <hi>Tamerlane</hi>
called a Council of War,<note place="margin">His Policy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and having heard the opinions of all his Captains,
he resolved to take in some famous City, that thereby his Army might be
better provided for, and then to give the King of <hi>China</hi> battel in the field.
For the effecting of the first, he resolved to assault <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> which was a great
City, strongly fortified, and well replenished with people; and for this end,
he sent <hi>Odmar</hi> with forty thousand Horse to summon it, and to prevent the
farther victualling of it, and to hinder the driving away of the cattel out of
the Champion-countrey about it,<note place="margin">He besieges <hi>Paguinfou.</hi>
               </note> which might nourish his Army: He also
caused the Lord <hi>Axalla</hi> (whom now he had made Lieutenant General of all
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:103996:130"/>
his Foot) to follow <hi>Odmar</hi> vvith all his Foot, which vvere near a hundred
and fifty thousand men, well trained, and expert in War, himself marching
immediately after vvith all his Horsemen, Artillery, Engines, and other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitions
belonging to the War, directly to <hi>Paguinfou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Odmar</hi> made such haste that he arrived unexpected by the Citizens, vvho
rather looked for their King than for an Enemy: and having taken much cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
vvherevvith that Countrey abounded, he pitched his tents on the farther
side of the City: There he continued two or three dayes, giving the City
many Alarms, till the Infantry, led by that brave Christian <hi>Genuois,</hi> shewed
themselves in the Plain of <hi>Paguinfou:</hi> Then was the City summoned, but they
returnd ansvver, <hi>That they were resolved to live and die in the service of their
Prince.</hi> By the way you must understand, that about forty years before, the
Father of this present King of <hi>China</hi> had conquered this City and Countrey
from the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
               </note> and had so planted the same with new Colonies, that but
few of the <hi>Tartarians</hi> remained, except only in the flat Countrey, and some
small walled Towns, who all came with their Keys, and willingly submitted to
<hi>Tamerlane,</hi> whereby he had great plenty of victuals in his Army, which made
him hope for good success; there being nothing that doth sooner overthrow
great Armies, than the want thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Paguinfou</hi> besieged round, the footmen lying within a flight-shoot
the Walls, the Citizens and Souldiers using their best endeavour for
their defence, and <hi>Tamerlane</hi> doing the like for their offence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Axalla</hi> having viewed a great Suburb, which was in length almost half a
League, supposed that the Citizens kept no watch there, and therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
the Emperour with his purpose, in the first watch of the night, his
men being all ready with scaling Ladders,<note place="margin">A Suburb ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by storm.</note> he assaulted the same in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and after a great fight entred, and cut in pieces at least eight thousand
men, which were within the same; yet on one side, where they expected to
be assaulted, he lost many of his men. The taking of this Suburb did greatly
astonish the Citizens, who observing the valour of the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to suspect their own safety: By this Suburb there ran a River, which
being now under the command of <hi>Axalla,</hi> he stopt all provision from going to
the City.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Army approached, which was very
great; whereupon the Emperour determined to go in person, and meet him,
with the greatest part of his Horsemen, but to leave most of his Foot to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the siege, being very desirous to take the City; for the accelerating
whereof, he caused his Engines for battery to approach, as Rams, and such
like; so that the City was assaulted on two sides very couragiously, and in
the end, through the valour of <hi>Axalla,</hi> who gave an assault with twenty
thousand of his best Souldiers,<note place="margin">The wall won.</note> he won the Wall, and at the command of the
Emperour lodged there, who desired rather to have the City by Treaty than
storm, the City being great and rich, and the Enemy but thirty Leagues
from thence,<note place="margin">Tamerlanes Prudence.</note> and therefore he feared lest his Army should be found in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and knowing also that rich Souldiers never fight well. Besides, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to draw out of that wealthy City such things as he stood in need of,
and to make it his Magazine for the time to come. Yet though the Wall
was won, the Enemies wanted not heart to defend themselves valiantly,
hearing that their King was coming for their relief: but it so happened, that
an Engine shooting a bullet, slew the Governour; whereupon the Citizens
were so discouraged,<note place="margin">The City sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> that they resolved to yield, saving their lives, and the
Souldiers to march away with Horse and Arms. The conditions were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
and there came out of the City eighteen thousand Souldiers, almost
all the Inhabitants remaining behind: This siege had lasted two months,
and the City had in it at first, thirty thousand Souldiers. <hi>Axalla</hi> had the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103996:130"/>
honour of winning this City, and therefore was made Governour of it, and
all the Country belonging to it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Axallas</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.</note> but he beseeched the Emperour to bestow
it upon some other Person, reserving for himself the hope of his Master, in
whose fortune he would take part: This gave great content to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi>
who much desired the service of <hi>Axalla;</hi> and upon his refusal, the charge was
conferred upon the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Vice-Roy:</hi> Then did <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi>
give notice of his affairs to the old Emperour, and having paid
his Souldiers, and setled all things in the best manner he could, he marched
forward; and taking a general Muster of his whole Army, Horse and Foot,
he found them to be diminished ten thousand men only. And so with his Army
he spent one whole day in Prayer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Piety.</note> calling upon the immortal, invisible,
invincible, and incomprehensible God, and then went directly to meet the
Enemy, who was at <hi>Sintehu</hi> with all his own and the forces of his Allies, and
as soon as he received news that <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Army was advanced over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Chulifu,</hi> the King of <hi>China</hi> marched directly towards them with great
magnificence:<note place="margin">The riches of the <hi>Chinois.</hi>
               </note> There was nothing to be seen in his Army, but Gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Stones: He himself usually rode in a Chariot whereof every part shone
with Gold, Pearls, Rubies, and Diamonds. He was of the age of about
three and thirty, and had been brought up in pleasures, and not under the
bloody Ensigns of <hi>Mars:</hi> So that he was very insolent in threatnings, brava<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
does, and defying to the Battel: He often accused <hi>Tamerlane</hi> for surprizing
him before he was ready, not giving him warning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rumours of his riches so fired the spirits of the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> that they
longed to be at the Battel: and so both sides hasted forwards, and in the
way, there was a City, called <hi>Tunichevoy,</hi> surrendred to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> which
afforded him much refreshing for his Army: And thus the two Armies draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near together, <hi>Tamerlane</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> prepares for the Battel.</note> made choice of a place in his judgment most
advantageous for the Battel; and having set down to <hi>Odmar</hi> the Order which
he would have to be observed, he longed to see his Enemy; Then did he send
before him five or six thousand Horse, as Scouts, under <hi>Calibes,</hi> and himself
went with them, and having viewed the great confused Army of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which came continually forward, he commanded <hi>Calibes</hi> to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so soon as they drew near to him. <hi>And bring</hi> (saith he) <hi>this great cloud
to me, which I hope soon to disperse:</hi> and so retiring to his Army, he encouraged
them, assuring them of the Victory. He placed all his Foot-men, which
were about a hundred and twenty thousand, along a Mountain, planting great
store of Artillery for their guard; Many of his Foot-Souldiers were armed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Christian manner, who were all commanded by <hi>Axalla:</hi> His Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were in a Battalia in a great plain, who upon any disadvantage could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to the assistance of the Footmen: the Horsemen were eighty thousand; <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libes</hi>
with the <hi>Scythians</hi> were in the Avantguard, being thirty thousand Horse,
who were to receive <hi>Odmar</hi> when he should retreat from the Enemy, as he
was commanded; thirty thousand more were appointed for <hi>Odmar,</hi> and <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi>
himself remained in the Arrear at one of the Wings of his Footmen: His
purpose was to let that sixty five thousand Horse under two such Gallant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
to break the force of the Enemy, hoping after them to have a good mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
causing his Foot to march forward, and reserving with himself twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of his best Horse, who of themselves were able to make a new Battel if any
mischance should befal the former: For he understood that it was the custom of
the Kings of <hi>China</hi> to enclose themselves in the midst of their Chariots with
their Footmen, and not to hazard their Persons, but upon extremity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chinois</hi> failed not to march directly unto <hi>Calibes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Battel begins.</note> the whole Army fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
and setting upon him: <hi>Calibes</hi> with his six thousand <hi>Scythian</hi> Horse,
after their usual manner, in retreating gave many charges, giving and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
hurt. The King of <hi>China</hi> marched with much gallantry with his Army,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103996:131"/>
which seemed to be twice so big as that of <hi>Tamerlanes:</hi> He had very many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Chariots, wherein he put his principal trust; they had much Gold and
Silver, as well in the trappings of their Horses, as on their Armour, which
gistred exceedingly against the Sun, to the Admiration of the <hi>Tartars. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane,</hi>
who with a Troop of Horse beheld the <hi>Chinois</hi> marching after <hi>Calibes,</hi>
commended greatly the drawing forth of their men to compel <hi>Calibes</hi> to fight,
endeavouring to discover and note with his eye the place whereabouts the
Kings person was, having by him the <hi>Chinois</hi> Lord to instruct him, who knew
well the manner of their fight. They had no Avantguard, but were all in a
gross, commanded by the King, inclosed within his Chariots, which being
shewed to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> by this Lord, he turned to those Captains that were near
him; and said, <hi>Yet must we disperse this guilded cloud, and the King of</hi> China <hi>and my
self must make a partition thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having sufficiently viewed the Enemy, and observed their manner of
marching, he thought it not convenient to suffer them to take breath, nor to
rally, being something disordered in their march, whereupon he sent to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libes</hi>
to will him to begin the fight; and when those that were with him
should be weary, to retreat to him: But assoon as his <hi>Scythians</hi> heard this
word <hi>Fight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Scythians</hi> charge the <hi>Chinois</hi>
               </note> they required the first charge, with a young Lord that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over them called <hi>Ziochabanes,</hi> making it to appear to the <hi>Chinois,</hi> to what
end their former flight was, charging very furiously upon the formost of the
Enemies, which occasioned the first beginning of the Battel: And indeed there
could not be seen a more Gallant onset, wherein the <hi>Scythians</hi> desired to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the valour of their Nation, and to procure honour to their Prince. This
fight endured a long hour before they had overthrown <hi>Calibes: Tamerlane</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
all patiently,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Constancy.</note> saying, that the great multitude (how disorderly soever they
were) would at length carry it away from the order and valour of his Souldiers;
yet could there not be discerned any alteration of his countenance, adversity and
prosperity being both alike so indifferent to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calibes</hi> being wounded,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calibes</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded retreats.</note> retired himself near to the Emperour, having with
him two thousand Horse that were rallied again, many more flocking to him:
The Emperour viewed his wound, causing him to be conducted behind his
Footmen, and care to be taken for the dressing of his wound, and of such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as were wounded with him. <hi>Calibes</hi> with his thirty thousand <hi>Scythians</hi>
was not able to charge through the <hi>Chinois,</hi> but when they retreated, <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
with his <hi>Parthian</hi> Horsemen advanced forward, and used them more
roughly,<note place="margin">The <hi>Parthians</hi> chargethorow.</note> for he ran clean through them, and returned by the right wing of
the Army, where he fought most valiantly, and having beaten them within
the Kings Chariots, he thought he should not do wisely to attempt the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such Forces.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>China</hi> coming forwards, and the Horsemen that had been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by <hi>Odmar,</hi> joyning themselves to him, <hi>Odmar</hi> sent to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> desiring
him that the Footmen and Artillery might advance forward, sending him
word that he might assure himself of the Victory.<note place="margin">The Foot charge.</note> Hereupon <hi>Tamerlane</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Axalla</hi> to advance with fifty thousand Foot, and part of the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
requiring him to set upon the Chariots, and to make an entrance. The
Artillery marching in the first place did greatly astonish the enemy; for the
Governours of the Horses belonging to the Kings Chariots could not rule
them; it made also a great spoil. <hi>Axalla</hi> perceiving the disorder, hasted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
till they came to hand-blows. The King of <hi>China</hi> had yet about his
Person a hundred and fifty thousand men: Yet <hi>Axalla,</hi> full of courage, fought
so valiantly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> that they never beheld any man to do more bravely. During
this fight, <hi>Odmar</hi> again charged the Horsemen that were retired to the Kings
aid, and put them to flight. Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> himself march forward
with the rest of the Footmen for the aid of <hi>Axalla,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> chargeth.</note> and brake through,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:103996:131"/>
even to the Person of the King of <hi>China,</hi> who as yet was enclosed within a
second rank of Chariots, with about thirty or forty thousand men, and after
he had fought two or three hours,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>China</hi> beaten.</note> the Horse assisting the Foot, and they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
whom the Prince had kept as a reserve, the King at length remained
wounded, in the power of <hi>Tamerlane:</hi> The battel being won, and the enemies
Camp forced: The fight endured eight hours, and the night coming on, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the lives of many of the <hi>Chinois.</hi> There were slain two Kings, Allies to
the King of <hi>China.</hi> Inestimable riches were gotten in golden Vessels, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stones, and as fair and rich Chariots as could possibly be seen.</p>
            <p>The Emperour would not see the captive King till the next day: but being
mounted on horseback, he rode about the field to stay the slaughter, and to
rally his men, that the accustomed watch might be kept, whereof he gave
the charge unto <hi>Axalla,</hi> commanding him also to keep the King of <hi>China</hi> in
the midst of his Souldiers, who was dressed of the wound which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in his right arm. It was a strange sight to see the diversity of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Weapons, and the variety of their Streamers and Ensigns, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
afar off as beautiful, as the diversity of colours plentiful. The King of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s
Army was very great, consisting of a hundred and fifty thousand Horse,
and two hundred thousand Footmen: but the greatest part of them were rude
and barbarous people, far inferiour to <hi>Tamerlan</hi>'s in Valour, who suffered
themselves to be slain one upon another, not marking their advantages, and
having little skill in warlike affairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> continued on horseback till about two a clock in the morning,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> temperance.</note>
when as they brought him a Tart, and his Water, for he never drank Wine,
and then lying down upon a Carpet, he passed the rest of the night until
morning.<note place="margin">His humility and modesty.</note> After this so great a Victory, there was never the least boasting or
vaunting heard to proceed out of his mouth.<note place="margin">His Piety.</note> The next day, after the burial
of the dead, he publickly gave thanks to God for his Victory. Then caused
he the wounded to be cured, and amongst others, <hi>Calibes,</hi> who, more through
the distemperature of the air, than from the danger of the wound, found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
very ill, yet would he not omit his duty in commanding the Van, which
was very grateful to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> for that he being a <hi>Scythian,</hi> was greatly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of his Nation.</p>
            <p>These things being dispatched, he sent unto <hi>Axalla</hi> to bring forth his priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the King of <hi>China;</hi> and when he approached, the Emperour issued out
of his Tent,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>China</hi> brought before him.</note> and went to receive him. This King came with a very proud
and haughty countenance, and approaching near to the Emperour, he, by his
Interpreter, asked of <hi>Axalla,</hi> which was he? and being shewed him, he spake
in an haughty language after this manner;<note place="margin">The King of <hi>China</hi>'s proud speech.</note> 
               <hi>The gods whom I worship, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
against my Nation and People, have conspired against my good fortune, and
made me this day thy prisoner: But forasmuch as it is reported over all the world,
that</hi> Tamerlane <hi>maketh war for the honour of his Nation, thou shouldst be content
with this thy glory, that the Lord of the world and child of the Sun, is in thy power,
to receive such Laws as thou pleasest to subscribe unto him.</hi> This he spake in a
brave manner,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane's</hi> Courtesie.</note> without any other humbling of himself: The Emperour on the
other side saluting him very courteously, led him into his Tent.</p>
            <p>This King of <hi>China</hi> was a great Prince, having two hundred famous Cities
within his Kingdom;<note place="margin">The riches of <hi>China.</hi>
               </note> which also is a fruitful and plentiful Countrey, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are Mines of Gold and Silver, much Musk and Rliubarb: It abounds in
Fish and Fowl, and hath much Silk and Porclane, with Cotton and Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> assemble his Captains to consult about the disposal of
the King, and how the Victory should be best improved. At the same time
he received news by <hi>Odmar,</hi> that the Kings Brother, who escaped out of the
battel, was at <hi>Quantou,</hi> which he had strongly fortified, and that great store
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103996:132"/>
of forces began to adjoyn themselves to him: Hereupon he commanded two
thousand <hi>Parthian</hi> horse to convey the King to <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Burda,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quantou</hi> besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> where he was to be kept carefully. Then did he resolve upon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieging
of <hi>Quantou,</hi> and if it were possible to shut up the Kings Brother therein,
it being one of the principal seats that belonged to the King of <hi>China.</hi> It was
forty Leagues from the place where the battel was fought. Thither therefore
he sent a good party of his Army under <hi>Odmar,</hi> who pitched his Tents about
the City: But the Kings Brother was gone. The Emperour in the mean time
summoned, and took in many lesser Cities, which yielded wholly to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
making great lamentation for their captive King, yet the gentleness of the
Conquerour made them to take all their losses with patience, and the rather,
because they heard that he used their King courteously. The Kings brother
also sent Ambassadours to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> craving leave to see the King, and to
know of his health, which the Emperour willingly assented to.</p>
            <p>Now the Kings brother hearing of the estate of the besieged in <hi>Quantou,</hi> he
resolved either to relieve it, or to fight a battel, for which end, he advanced
strait unto <hi>Porchio,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Odmars</hi> poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> making a bridge of Boats to pass over the River: But <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
being informed that about fifty thousand of his men were come over, he
suddenly set upon them, being out of order, and not informed of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
approach; also to prevent the coming over of the rest to their assistance,
he sent a fire-boat down the stream, against their bridge of Boats, which brake
it in sunder, and where it was resisted, set all on fire; and so in a great battel
overthrew them;<note place="margin">The King of <hi>China's</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</note> The King of <hi>Cauchin-China,</hi> who was amongst them, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
valiantly, was slain. The Kings Brother, who was on the other side of
the River (not yet come over) saw his men slain and drowned, and could
not relieve them. This second overthrow was of no small importance,
though it was but the third part of the Kings brothers Army. For the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of <hi>Quantou</hi> hearing of it, and despairing of relief, sent out some Proposals
for their surrender.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Axalla</hi> which received them, presently dispatched away a faithful messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Emperour to know his pleasure therein: This was more welcome
news to him, than the overthrow of his Enemies; wherefore he referred all
to the sufficiency and fidelity of <hi>Axalla:</hi> So that upon Treaty, the City was
surrendred to <hi>Axalla,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quantou</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred.</note> who caused the Garrison to come out, and received the
inhabitants into the Emperours protection, and all that would might continue
in it unarmed: afterwards he entred into it, and was received with great
signs of joy by the Inhabitants, who resolved to entertain the Emperour with
all the solemnity that might be. <hi>Axalla</hi> put thirty thousand men into it for
a Garrison, injoyning the Citizens to pay the Emperours Army four hundred
and fifty thousand Crowns: Presently after he received a command from
the Emperour to stay in the City himself, and to send all the rest of his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
unto him, which he commanded the rather, because he understood that
Ambassadours were coming to him from the Kings Brother to treat of Peace,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Policy.</note>
and he presumed the sight of all his Army together ready to march, would
strike such a terrour into them, as would cause them the readilier to assent to
good terms.</p>
            <p>The Ambassadours sent by the Kings Brother, were of their chiefest men,
whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> entertained with all humanity, causing his greatness to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to them, as also the activity of his Horsemen, whereby they might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
that it would tend to the destruction of their Country if they agreed not
with him: Then did the Ambassadours deliver their message, which consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of two branches: One was for the delivery of their King, the other, for
the preservation of their Countrey: The Emperour answered, that they should
deliver their message in writing,<note place="margin">The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals.</note> and he would give a speedy answer: Their
Propositions were, that they would leave <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> and all the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103996:132"/>
it, with all the Fortresses of the mountains in <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> possession:
That they would pay all the charges of his Army from that day forward: And
that they would give two millions of gold for the ransome of their King. To
this the Emperour answered,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s proposals.</note> that he would keep that which he had conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within the Countrey, being his own, as taken by his arms: That he would
have the River by which his Army was now encamped, and so along to the
Sea, to be his Frontiers: That the King of <hi>China</hi> should pay him yearly two
hundred thousand Crowns, which should be delivered at <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of his submission to his Empire: That he should pay five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Crowns in ready money for the charge of his Army: That the
King of <hi>China</hi> should be delivered, and that all the other <hi>Chinois</hi> prisoners
should pay ransomes to particular men that took them, except those which
carried the names of Kings, who should pay ten thousand Crowns for their
liberty and peace: And that no <hi>Chinois</hi> should be kept for a slave, nor sold for
such hereafter, being under the Emperours obedience: That Traffick and
intercourse of Merchants should be free between both the Nations: That the
King of <hi>China</hi> should deliver his Brother, and two other called Kings, with
twelve principal men of the Countrey, for Hostages to secure the Peace:
These conditions,<note place="margin">Peace conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> after they had consulted together, were accepted of, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that time would restore again their ancient liberty, and in the mean
time they must bear the yoke of the Conquerour.<note place="margin">The King of <hi>China</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> send
two thousand Horse to fetch the King of <hi>China,</hi> that being at liberty, he
might solemnly sweat to the Peace; which accordingly he did, delivered
the Hostages, and so went into his Kingdom to perform the other Articles,
where he was almost worshipped as a God, and received with all the joy that
might be.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Tamerlane,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Odmar</hi> made Governour.</note> having setled his affairs, and provided for the assurance
of his new Conquest, left <hi>Odmar</hi> to govern the same, leaving with him thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand Horse, and fifty thousand Foot, to furnish all the Fortresses and
strong places, giving him in charge to make his chief residence at <hi>Quantifou,</hi>
to fortifie well the passages, and to build a new Fort at <hi>Dermio,</hi> the better to
strengthen his borders:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s gratitude.</note> He also left him all necessaries, and commended to
him the Lord of the mountains, who had been so serviceable to him; His
Brother he took with him, giving him large preferment in <hi>Zachethay:</hi> He
also carried along with him many of the new conquered people, to plant them
in his own Country,<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> sending other Colonies in their stead, which he did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he found them a light people, and such as affected novelty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> sent to acquaint the old Emperour with all these things,<note place="margin">His possessions in <hi>China.</hi>
               </note> having
two of the greatest and fairest Cities in all <hi>China</hi> in his possession, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Leagues of Land, extending his borders to a River, by which he might
go to the Enemy, but they could not come to him without passing over the
same: He desired also above all things, that all the Idols which were within
his Conquest should be beaten down, and commanded the worshipping of
<hi>one God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did his Army,<note place="margin">His return into <hi>Tartary.</hi>
               </note> wherein was much sickness, begin to march, and
<hi>Tamerlane</hi> hearing of more Forces that were coming towards him out
of <hi>Tartary,</hi> he sent to stop them, commanding them to march to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balu,</hi>
whither himself also was going, hearing that the old Emperour
intended to meet him, and to entertain him with great magnificence in
that City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Odmar</hi> being thus severed from <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s side, all his favour was turned
to <hi>Axalla,</hi> of whose Prudence, Valour, and Fidelity, he had such large experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in these Wars, so as the report of his Valour did fly through all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
In the retreat <hi>Calibes</hi> led the Avantguard, and <hi>Axalla</hi> was in the Battel
near to the Emperour,<note place="margin">His liberality.</note> who bestowed upon him two hundred thousand
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103996:133"/>
Crowns yearly, to maintain his ordinary expences. And thus, after certain
dayes journey, news was brought of the old Emperours arrival at <hi>Cambalu:</hi>
wherefore <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> leaving his Army to Winter in a fair and fertile Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and dismissing many of his Souldiers, he hasted thitherwards, and when
he was arrived within four Leagues of <hi>Cambalu,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balu.</hi>
               </note> all the Princes of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
Court came to receive him there, together with all the chiefest Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
to congratulate his admirable success: The Prince received every one
according to his wonted courtesie, yet retaining convenient Majesty, and was
beheld by all with great contentment: He had with him the Empress his
Wife, who had not left him in all his journey: And the next day the old
Emperour honoured him so much as to come to meet him, with all the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
that might be.<note place="margin">His presents to the old Emperour.</note> 
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> presented him with all the richest Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots,
and fairest Horses that he had won: and the old Emperour being very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to see his Daughter, her Chariot was uncovered, and he caused her to
enter into his own: But the Prince remained on horseback, whom the eyes of
all the people could not be satisfied with admiring. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> also presented
<hi>Calibes</hi> to the Emperour, making a recital of all his faithfulness; whereupon
the Emperour gave him an hundred thousand Crowns for the increase of his
pension: He also presented <hi>Axalla</hi> to the Emperour, who being informed of his
Valour, gave unto him a hundred thousand <hi>Tartarines</hi> of Gold in a Principality,
that he might declare how much he esteemed his fidelity.</p>
            <p>During <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s abode at <hi>Cambalu</hi> this Winter,<note place="margin">He is stirred up against <hi>Bajazet.</hi>
               </note> complaints came to him
that <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Great Turk had attempted to joyn the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi> to
his own, resolving also upon the siege of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whereupon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Greece</hi> sent to him to crave his aid. <hi>Axalla,</hi> who was of kin to this
Emperour, <hi>Paleologus,</hi> being desirous to maintain the Christian Religion in
<hi>Greece,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He sends Ambassadors.</note> stirred him up much to this War: Whereupon he sent Ambassadours
to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> to warn him in his name, not to molest the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, who
was his Confederate:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazets</hi> proud answer.</note> But <hi>Bajazet</hi> answered them very proudly, asking them
what their Master had to do therewith? and that he should content himself
with injoyning Laws to his own Subjects, and not to meddle with him who
was none of them.</p>
            <p>This answer being returned, by <hi>Axalla's</hi> means, was very ill taken, so that
<hi>Tamerlane</hi> resolved to hinder this enterprize of the <hi>Ottomans:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> preparations against him.</note> for which end,
he obtained of the Emperour his Uncle, an hundred thousand Footmen, and
eighty thousand Horsemen, hoping to have as many from his own Countrey
of <hi>Sachetai,</hi> besides the Lords who would accompany him to win glory, from
whom he made account of fifty thousand men more that they would bring
along with them. Thus he departed from <hi>Cambalu,</hi> taking his leave of the old
Emperour, his Father in Law, and of the Princess his Wife, (then left behind
him for the comfort of her aged Father) and departed towards <hi>Samercand,</hi> the
place of his Birth, and seat of his Empire, leaving the Forces granted him by
the Emperour, to come after him to <hi>Ozara,</hi> where he had appointed the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
rendezvouz of his Army. This his departure was very grievous to the old
Emperour, but more grievous on the Princes part towards his Wife, who had
never left him since they were first married: But nothing could withhold this
brave Prince, where honour was to be purchased, or where he might be profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to his oppressed Friends,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> speech.</note> For he would often say, That <hi>he was born to this
end, and that all his other employments were but by the By, God having appointed
and called him to punish the pride of Tyrants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was accompanied with <hi>Calibes,</hi> and made the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
of all his Footmen, which place <hi>Axalla</hi> had left, whom now he made
Lieutenant General of all his Army, with command to lead his Avantguard,
and <hi>Calibes</hi> the Arearward. Forces came to him from all parts; and the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi>
Lord, being licensed by <hi>Odmar,</hi> marched towards him with twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103996:133"/>
men of his Subjects newly conquered, being desirous to shew his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Emperour, as also to learn the manners and fashions of strange
Countries.<note place="margin">His entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercand.</hi>
               </note> When <hi>Tamerlane</hi> came near <hi>Samercand, Zamay</hi> went to meet him,
and near a million of people, blessing and praising him with all manner of
Songs: There he remained about a month; In which space <hi>Axalla</hi> had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouzed
his Army at <hi>Ozara,</hi> from whence also he advertised <hi>Tamerlane</hi>
of the proceedings of <hi>Bajazet.</hi> Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> send for him to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercand,</hi>
to confer with him about the setting forward of his Army. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was still accompanied with renowned Princes, and famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
yet were they no body in comparison of <hi>Axalla,</hi> whose sound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Counsel had won him such credit with his Lord and Master, as by
his advice he did all things, and without him nothing, which his so great
Authority and Favour with his Prince wanted not the envy of the Court;<note place="margin">Envy attend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vertue.</note> but
that his great Vertues, and rare-found Courtesie (in so great fortune) together
with so many great services as he had done, supported him against the malice
of the same. He upon this command from <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> leaving the charge of
the Army at <hi>Ozara</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> came to <hi>Samercand,</hi> and there
discoursed with him at large concerning the estate and order of his Army;
and so, shortly after, they all departed to <hi>Ozara,</hi> where a new consultation
was held, by which way he should conduct his Army: as whether it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to lead them by the coast of the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> directly towards <hi>Capha,</hi> or on
the other side of the <hi>Calpian</hi> Sea, by the skirts of <hi>Persia;</hi> and after much
discourse and sundry opinions, with their reasons delivered, it was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
(although the way were the longer) to pass by the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> so to come
to the <hi>Georgians,</hi> and to <hi>Trepizond,</hi> and from thence to enter into the <hi>Otta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>This being resolved on,<note place="margin">His march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Bajazet.</hi>
               </note> they marched forward, till at length they came to
<hi>Maranis,</hi> where he stayed three dayes, looking for the <hi>China</hi> Forces, whereof
they received news; There also <hi>Tamerlane</hi> mustered, and paid his Army; He
had also news of fifteen thousand Horsemen sent him by the <hi>Muscovite,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> with a
sum of money, with leave for him to pass through so much of his Territories as
should be necessary, being glad that he set upon others; rather than on himself;
and that such great preparations should fall upon them, whose greatness was as
dreadful and dangerous to him as any other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> caused a great quantity of Victuals,<note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> and most part of the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Army to be sent along the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, which was a great case and
commodity to his men, which, marching by Land, was of necessity to pass
some twenty Leagues through places destitute both of Victuals and Water;
Himself all the way coasting along the Sea-shore, passed his time in Hunting
and Hawking, to make the journey less tedious, his Army not coming near
him by ten Leagues, which was so great, that it extended it self full twenty
Leagues.</p>
            <p>Coming to the River <hi>Edel,</hi> he stayed at <hi>Zarazich,</hi> whilst his Army passed the
River at <hi>Mechet,</hi> and over two other Bridges that he had caused to be made of
boats for that purpose. Now the <hi>Circassians</hi> and <hi>Georgians</hi> hearing of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with his huge Army, by their Ambassadors offered him all
the help and assistance they could afford him in his Journey, as he passed that
way.<note place="margin">The <hi>Georgians</hi> assist him.</note> These <hi>Georgians</hi> were, and yet are Christians, a great and Warlike
people, of long time tributaries to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours; and afterwards some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
tributaries, and sometimes confederates to the <hi>Persians;</hi> but alvvayes ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and therefore glad they were of <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> coming against
them. Of these Warlike people <hi>Axalla</hi> drew great numbers to the service
of his Prince, who not a little esteemed of them, being all tall men, very
beautiful, of great strength and courage, and withall, most expert souldiers,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103996:134"/>
as having many times resisted the power of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Kings, by reason of the
advantage of their Country, which was rough, mountainous, and hard to
come to.<note place="margin">His strict Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</note> These people every where kindly entertained <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
relieved his Army with all necessaries. In passing through which, and
other Countries, he took such order with his Souldiers, that none of the people
by whom they passed were any whit injured by them, insomuch that if a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
had taken but an Apple or any other trifle, he died for it. And one of his
souldiers having taken a little milk from a Countrey-woman, and she thereof
complaining, he caused him presently to be hanged, and his stomack to be
ript, where the milk that he had lately drank being found, he payed the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
for it, who had otherwise without mercy died for her false accusation:
Which his great severity was indeed the preservation of his Army, being so
great, as that it was thought impossible to provide it with Victuals, whereof
yet there was no want, nor of any other thing necessary for the relief of man:
his Camp being still as a most populous and well-governed City, stored with all
manner of things, whereunto both Artificers and Merchants resorted from far
Countries with their Commodities, as to some famous Mart: and the Country
people from every place, without fear, brought in their Country-commodities,
for which they received present money, and so departed in peace.</p>
            <p>So marching on, he at length came to <hi>Bachichich,</hi> where he stayed to refresh
his Army eight dayes, and there again took a general muster of them,
finding,<note place="margin">His huge Army.</note> as some write, four hundred thousand Horse, and six hundred thousand
Foot; but others that were present with him, say, three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse, and five hundred thousand Footmen of all Nations: There al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
he generally payed them, and as his manner was, made an oration to
them, informing them of such Orders as he would have observed, with
much other Military Discipline, whereof he was very curious with his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
            <p>In the mean time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazets</hi> Pride.</note> 
               <hi>Bajazet</hi> would not believe that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> durst once
look towards him, yea, so exceeding barbarous was he, that he would not so
much as suffer any man to speak of him, or his Army to him, by reason of his
pride: He also strictly forbad all the bordering people to make any Vows or
Prayers for <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> prosperity: But he was soon after awakened out of
this Lethargy, as we shall presently hear. Indeed <hi>Tamerlane</hi> could hardly
be perswaded, that <hi>Bajazet,</hi> having subdued the greatest part of <hi>Grecia,</hi> and
much distressed the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, and having so great means to recover
whatsoever he should lose in <hi>Asia,</hi> would be so adventurous as to come over
the streights out of <hi>Europe,</hi> to try the fortune of a battel with him: but rather
warily to protract the time, to weary him with wants, that in a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
drew such a world of people after him: wherein yet he found himself
much deceived; for when he had passed the <hi>Georgian</hi> Country, and was come
to <hi>Buisabuich, Axalla</hi> (whom he had not seen in eight dayes before, because
he commanded the Avantguard of the Army) came to him with such news
as he knew would be most grateful to him:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.</note> Which was, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> had
raised his siege before <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to come and defend his new Conquests in
<hi>Asia,</hi> and that he was certainly resolved to come to a pitched Battel with
him, not so much trusting to the multitude of his men, as to the experience
and valour of his souldiers, being long trained up in the Wars. At which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
news <hi>Tamerlane</hi> greatly rejoyced, yet without insolency and vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but rather with the countenance of such an one as judged the event of
Battels to be alwayes doubtful;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> moderation.</note> saying sometimes, That a <hi>small number well
conducted, did carry away the victory from the confused multitude.</hi> Three dayes
after he stayed at <hi>Buisabuich,</hi> causing his souldiers continually to march forward,
who,<note place="margin">He passeth the River <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>
               </note> at two places, passed over the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which he did the rather to
maintain his Army upon the spoil of the Enemies countrey, chusing rather
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:103996:134"/>
there to attend <hi>Bajazets</hi> coming, then amongst his friends and allies. All the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that yielded to him in the way as he marched, he favourably received;
the other that refused to submit themselves to his obedience, he used with all
extremity, especially the great and strong City of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> where certain of
the forerunners of his Army,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Turkish</hi> Pride.</note> were by the <hi>Turks</hi> that kept Garrison in it, cut
off and slain, and to despite him the more, the City gates were set open in
contempt of him: Whereupon being justly offended, he sent out certain <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi>
Horsemen, charging them upon pain of his displeasure so to behave
themselves against their Enemies, that at his coming up to them he might
find either the City taken, or at least the Gates shut up against him: And he
had his men at so great command; that no danger was unto them more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than his displeasure, neither did he punish any thing so severely as cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.
Now the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Sebastia</hi> seeing these <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horsemen marching
towards the City, making little account of them, because their number was
not great, issued out to meet them, where they were so furiously charged by
these few Horsemen, that they were glad to retire, and for hast to shut the
Gates against some of their own men, lest the Enemy should have entered pell
mell with them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Turks</hi> beaten</note> which <hi>Turks</hi> were there slain at the Gates of the City. Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after came <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with all the rest of his Army, and sat down before the
City, where he lay still seven days not making any shew of violence at all.
The defendants, because the City was of great strength, thought that his
purpose was by a long Siege to distress the same: But about the eighth day,
the Towers, and Walls being undermined in sundry places, suddenly fell
down, leaving large breaches for the Enemy to enter; wherewith the <hi>Turks</hi>
being dismayed surrendred the City to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> in hope so to have saved
their lives,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sebastia</hi> taken.</note> but he caused them all to be buried quick, and the City utterly to
be razed: and then calling the Governour, whose life he had spared for that
end, he bade him go and tell his Master what had happened to his strong City
of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> and what himself had seen there; of which Tragical action, when
the Governour had made report to <hi>Bajazet,</hi> he demanded of him whether of
the two Armies he thought bigger or stronger; for he had now assembled a
mighty Army of three hundred thousand Horse, and two hundred thousand
Footmen; whereunto the Governour, having first craved pardon, answered:
That it could not be in reason, but that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had the greater Army, for
that he commanded over far greater Countries: wherewith proud <hi>Bajazet</hi>
being offended, replied in great Choller;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazets</hi> arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</note> 
               <hi>Out of doubt the sight of the</hi> Tartarian
<hi>hath so affrighted this coward, that he thinks every Enemy to be two.</hi> As <hi>Bajazet</hi>
marched forward he heard a Country Shepherd merrily pleasing himself with
his homely Pipe as he sate on the side of a Mountain feeding his small flock,
whereupon he stood still, and listned to him to the admiration of many, and
at last brake forth into these words,<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>O happy Shepherd, which hadst no</hi> Sebastia
<hi>to lose!</hi> bewraying therein his own discontentment, and yet withal, shewing
that worldly bliss consisted not so much in possessing of much, subject unto dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as in enjoying content in a little, devoid of fears.</p>
            <p>The rest of the Cities as <hi>Tamerlane</hi> marched forwards, warned by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> yielded to him, the Citizens whereof he used courteously,
especially the Christians,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> favour to the Christians.</note> whom he set at liberty for the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours sake,
whom he sought therein to gratifie.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had not gone far into the <hi>Turks</hi> dominions before he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
informed that <hi>Bajazet</hi> was coming against him with a mighty Army,<note place="margin">Bajazets ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</note>
and was now within thirty Leagues of him, which caused him from thence
forward to march with his Army more close together. <hi>Axalla</hi> leading the
Van, sent forth <hi>Chianson,</hi> Prince of <hi>Ciarchan,</hi> with four thousand <hi>Parthian</hi>
Horsemen, to get knowledg of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army, and where <hi>Bajazet</hi> lay, as
also what manner of Countrey it was beyond <hi>Sennas,</hi> and if he could learn
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:103996:135"/>
any thing thereof, to make relation of it to him. This Prince of <hi>Ciarchan</hi>
was <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> near Kinsman, a man of great reputation, and next to <hi>Axalla,</hi>
in whose absence he had the command of the Avantguard, who also sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him another <hi>Parthian</hi> Captain with five hundred Horsemen: who having
advanced about ten Leagues and surprized <hi>Sennas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sennas</hi> surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane.</hi>
               </note> was certainly informed
there of the state of <hi>Bajazets</hi> Army, which was now at <hi>Tataeia,</hi> and so marching
forward; which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> being informed of, commanded him not to retire
from that place till he saw the arrival of the enemy, and thereof to give him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
every hour, resolving himself to pass on no further, being encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a fair large plain,<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> which was very advantageous for him, his Army being
bigger then <hi>Bajazets,</hi> which made him make choise of those large plains. His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
also being compounded of sundry Nations, he considered that he was not to
fight against the <hi>Chinois,</hi> a soft effeminate people, as of late; but against the <hi>Turks,</hi>
a most warlike Nation and well acquainted with all manner of fights and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
stratagems, and therefore he judged it necessary to proceed warily against
them. Upon this consideration he presently sent for <hi>Axalla,</hi> with him to view
the said place, and to have his opinion whether it would be advantageous for
him to stay there or no? <hi>Axalla</hi> not misliking his choice of the place, yet withal
advised him to keep <hi>Sennas</hi> as long as possible he could: and accordingly he sent
word to them at <hi>Sennas,</hi> that when they could keep the place no longer, they
should set fire on it, and so retreat, and this he did, that the Enemy should have
no desire to encamp there, but to march forward to those plains where <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi>
desired to fight, the rather because he was stronger in Horse than <hi>Bajazet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly the Prince of <hi>Ciarchan</hi> sent out a hundred Horse toward the
<hi>Turks;</hi> then divided he the rest of his Forces into two parts, commanding
the former, that as soon as they perceived the Enemy to pursue the hundred
Horse, whom he had commanded to fly disorderly before them, that they
should receive them into their Squadrons, and so retire altogether: He in the
mean time with the other part stood close in a Valley near unto a Wood-side,<note place="margin">An Ambush.</note>
wholly unseen; where having suffered two thousand of the Enemies Horse
(the Vant-curriers of the <hi>Turks</hi> Army) to pass by him, he following them
in the tail, charged them home, the other also which before retired, now tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
again upon them; so that the <hi>Turks</hi> seeing themselves thus beset and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid to both before and behind,<note place="margin">Two thousand <hi>Turks</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</note> as men discouraged, fled: but in their
flight were most of them slain, the rest of them were taken Prisoners. This
was the first encounter between the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Parthians.</hi> All the Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
taken were by the Prince sent as a Present to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> and amongst the
rest,<note place="margin">The Bassa of <hi>Natolia</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> the Bassa of <hi>Natolia,</hi> who led those Troops; of whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
demanded what caused his Master <hi>Bajazet</hi> so little to esteem him, as to
shew so great a contempt of his Army: <hi>Which</hi> (saith he) <hi>he shall find strong
enough to abate his Pride?</hi> To this the Bassa answered: That his Lord was the
Sun upon Earth,<note place="margin">His Speech to <hi>Tamerlane</hi>
               </note> which could not endure any corrival: And that he rather
was astonished to see how he, from so far a Country, had undertaken so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a journey to hinder the fortune of his Lord, in whose favour the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
(as he said) did bend themselves to further his greatness, and unto
whom all the world subjected it self; and that he commited great folly in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about to resist the same. Unto this proud Speech <hi>Tamerlane</hi> replied,
<hi>That he was sent from heaven to punish his insolency,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> reply.</note> 
               <hi>and to teach him that the
proud are hated of God, whose promise is to pull down the mighty, and to advance the
lowly.</hi> As for thy self (said he) thou hast already felt (though I pity thy
mishap) what the valour of my <hi>Parthian</hi> Horse is against thy <hi>Turkish:</hi> and I
have already caused thy Master to raise his Siege before <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to
look to his affairs here in <hi>Asia.</hi> He also asked him whether his Master did
come resolved to give him Battel? Assure your self (said he) that there is
nothing that he more desireth, and would to God that I might acknowledg
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103996:135"/>
your greatness in giving me leave to assist my Lord in that Battel? Good leave
have thou (said <hi>Tamerlane</hi>) go thy ways,<note place="margin">His release.</note> and tell thy Lord that thou hast seen
me, and that in the Battel he shall find me on Horse-back, there where he
shall see a green Ensign displayed. The Bassa thanked him, and swore that
next unto his Lord, he vowed unto him his service. And so returning, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
unto <hi>Bajazet</hi> how he had seen <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> and reported to him truly all
that he had willed him to say,<note place="margin">He commend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Tamerlane.</hi>
               </note> not forgetting above all, to praise his courtesie
and bounty: who besides that he had frankly set him at liberty, had also gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him a very fair Horse, well furnished, although he well knew that he
was to serve against himself: To this <hi>Bajazet</hi> answered no more, but that he
would shortly make trial of him, and that he doubted not but before he had
done with him, he should make him acknowledg his folly.</p>
            <p>The next day the two Armies drew neer together, and encamped within a
league the one of the other;<note place="margin">Preparations for the Battel.</note> where all the night long you might have heard
a noise of Horses which filled the heavens with their neighings, and the air
with sounds; and every man thought the night long that they might come
to the trial of their valours, and the gaining of their desires. The <hi>Scythians</hi>
(a people no less greedy, than needy) talked of nothing but the spoil; the
proud <hi>Parthians</hi> of attaining honour; the poor Christians of their deliverance
from an insulting adversary; all which was to be gained by the next days
Victory. Every man, during the night-time, speaking according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
All which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> (walking privately up and down in the Camp)
heard, and much rejoyced to see the hope which his Souldiers had already
conceived of the Victory: and so after the second watch, returning into his
Pavilion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> prudent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</note> and there casting himself upon a Carpet, he purposed to sleep a
while; but his cares not suffering him so to do, he then (as his manner was)
called for a Book, wherein was contained the Lives of his Fathers and Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
and of other valiant Worthies, which he used ordinarily to read in, as
then also he did: not vainly to deceive the time, but to make use of it, by
imitating that which by them was worthily done, and declinining such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
as they by their rashness, or oversight fell into. After which, having
slumbred a little, he commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to be sent for to him, who presently
came, accompanied with divers other Great Lords and Captains of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
with whom after he had consulted a while about the order of the Battel,
himself presently mounted on Horseback, and sent each of them to their
charge to see their orders put in execution: At which very instant he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
intelligence that the Enemy was marching forwards, and come to chuse
his Ground for the Battel, whose order of marching <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to see, that so he might marshal his own Army accordingly. <hi>For</hi> (said
he) <hi>I do not so much trust to the Lions skin wherein I wrap mine arm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His prudent Speech.</note> 
               <hi>but that
withall I will make use of the Foxes, therein to wrap my head, which my Grandfather
neglected to his overthrow in a Battel against the</hi> Persians: <hi>For being in a place of
advantage, he went out of it to seek his Enemy that was lodged strongly, contrary to
the advise of all his Captains, which proved his ruin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did he cause three thousand Horsemen to advance forward, with
charge to begin the skirmish, himself following after to lodg every
part of his Forces in such places as he had foreseen to be fittest for his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
And seeing the <hi>Turkish</hi> Janizaries marching in a square Battel in the
midst of the Army, and upon the two Frons, two great squadrons of Horsemen,
which seemed to be about thirty thousand, and another which advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and covered the Battalion of the Janizaries, he thought this their order
to be very good, and hard to be broken, and therefore turning himself to
<hi>Axalla,</hi> he said, <hi>I had thought this day to have fought on foot, but I see that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
me now to fight on Horseback,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His direction for the Battel.</note> 
               <hi>to encourage my Souldiers to open that great
Battalion of the Enemies. And my will is that my men come forwards to me
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103996:136"/>
so soon as may be; for I will advance forward with a hundred thousand Footmen,
fifty thousand upon each of my two wings, and in the midst of them, forty thousand
of my best Horsemen: and my pleasure is, that, after I have tried the force of these
men, they come back into my Avantguard, of whom I will dispose, and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horsemen more in three bodies, whom thou shalt command, which I will assist
with eighty thousand Horse, wherein shall be mine own person, having an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Footmen behind me, who shall march in two Squadrons: and
for my Arearward I appoint forty thousand Horse, and fifty thousand Footmen, who
shall not march but to my aid: And I will make choise of ten thousand of my best
Horse, whom I will send into every place where I shall think needful within my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
for to impart my commands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Over the first forty thousand Horse, the Prince of <hi>Ciarchan</hi> commanded,
over the formost Footmen was the Lord <hi>Synopes,</hi> a <hi>Genovois,</hi> Kinsman to <hi>Axal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
and his Lieutenant over the Footmen, a Captain of great estimation: The
Prince <hi>Axalla's</hi> charge consisted of five Squadrons of Horsemen: <hi>Bajazet's</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
also being fair and great,<note place="margin">The Battel begins.</note> came bravely still on forwards towards their
Enemies, who stirred not a whit from the place which they had chosen for
the Battel, except certain light-Horsemen, <hi>Scythians, Parthians,</hi> and <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
who being sent out as loose men, hotly skirmished between the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
<hi>Tamerlane</hi> was informed by a spie, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> was on foot in the
midst of thirty thousand Janizaries, his principal men of War, and greatest
strength, amongst whom he ment that day to fight, and in whom he had
repoled his greatest hope. His Battel of Horse was very fair, amounting to
the number of one hundred and forty thousand, all old Souldiers: the Sultan of
<hi>Egypt</hi> also had sent to his aid thirty thousand Mamelukes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazets</hi> great Army.</note> all excellent good
Horsemen, with thirty thousand Footmen; so that his Army marching all in
a front, in the form of a half Moon, seemed almost as great as <hi>Tamerlanes:</hi>
These <hi>Turks,</hi> with infinite number of horrible cries, still advanced forwards,
<hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Souldiers all the while standing still with great silence. Never
was there a more furious charge than the <hi>Turks</hi> gave upon the Prince of <hi>Ciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi>
who was commanded not to fight till the Enemy came unto him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could there have been chosen a fairer Plain, and where the skilful choice
of the place, gave less advantage either to the one or to other only <hi>Tamerlane</hi>
had a River on the left side of his Army, serving him to some small advantage.
Now this young Prince of <hi>Ciarchan,</hi> with his forty thousand Horse, was in
the first encounter almost wholly overthrown; yet having fought right va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly,
and entred even in the midst of the Janizaries (where the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Bajazet</hi> was) putting them into disorder,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Ciarchan</hi> slain.</note> he was himself there slain.
About which time <hi>Axalla</hi> set upon them with his squadrons, but not with
the like danger: for having overthrown one of the Enemies Wings, and cut
it all to pieces, and his Footmen coming to joyn with him, as was appointed,
he faced the Battalion of the Janizaries, who right valiantly behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the safety of their Prince.<note place="margin">A furious Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</note> This furious fight continued an hour, and
yet you could not have seen any scattered, but the one still resolutely fighting
against the other. You might there have seen the Horsemen like mountains
rushing together, and infinite numbers of men dying, crying, lamenting, and
threatning all at the same instant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> had patience all this while to see the event of this so mortal a
fight: but perceiving his men at last to be begin to give ground, he sent ten
thousand of his Horse to joyn with the ten thousand appointed for the Rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
commanding them to assist him when they saw that he had need,
and so himself gave a furious Charge,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> himself charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> and made them to give him room, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Footmen also to charge, over whom the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who gave a gallant charge upon the Battalion of Janizaries, wherein was yet
the Person of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who before had sustained a great burden. Now <hi>Bajazet</hi> had
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:103996:136"/>
in his Army a great number of Mercinary <hi>Tartars,</hi> called <hi>Destenses,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands of other Souldiers taken up in the Countries of the poor exiled
<hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes, in whose just quarrel, and the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours, <hi>Tamerlane</hi>
had chiefly undertaken that War. These <hi>Tartarians</hi> and other Souldiers, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
some their friends,<note place="margin">Many revolt to <hi>Tamerlane.</hi>
               </note> and other some their natural and loving Princes in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlanes</hi>
Army, stricken with the terrour of disloyalty, and abhorring the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
of the proud Tyrant, in the heat of the Battel, revolted from <hi>Bajazet</hi> to
their own Princes, which much weakned <hi>Bajazets</hi> Forces: who nevertheless
with his own men of War, especially the Janizaries, and the help of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Souldiers brought to his aid from <hi>Servia,</hi> and other places of <hi>Europe,</hi> with
great courage maintained the fight: But the multitude rather than true valour
prevailed; for as much as might be done by valiant and couragious men, was
by the Janizaries, the Mamelukes, and the rest performed, both for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of their Prince, and for gaining the Victory: But in the end the Horsemen
with whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> himself was,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> overthrow.</note> giving a fresh charge, and his Avant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
being rallied and joyning with him, he with much ado obtained
the Victory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bajazet</hi> himself being wounded,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> when he saw all desperate, mounted on
Horseback, thinking to have escaped: but falling into <hi>Axalla</hi>'s hands, he
yielded himself to him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> taken.</note> supposing him to have been <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> neither did <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi>
for a while know him, but took him for some great Commander in the
<hi>Turks</hi> Army. <hi>Musa,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Zelabi,</hi> or the Noble, one of <hi>Bajazets</hi> Sons, with
divers other of his great Captains were there taken also; and amongst the rest,
<hi>George,</hi> Despot of <hi>Servia,</hi> who, notwithstanding his misfortune had that day
by his valour gained the reputation of a great and valiant Captain, insomuch
as <hi>Tamerlane</hi> in the very heat of the Battel marvelled to see him and his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians,</hi>
and the other Christians that he had brought to the aid of <hi>Bajazet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The valour of the Christians.</note> to
fight so valianty; whereupon turning to some of his Captains that were near
him, he said, <hi>See how valiantly these Religious fight,</hi> supposing them by their
strange attire to have been some of the <hi>Turks</hi> superstitious Votaries. But the
Despot being now taken, and afterwards brought to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> he was by
him courteously entertained; yet withal reproved, for that he had assisted
<hi>Bajazet</hi> against him, who was come in favour to the Christian Emperour, and
the other poor oppressed Princes, such as the Despot himself was: who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
boldly answered,<note place="margin">The Despot of <hi>Service</hi> Speech.</note> 
               <hi>That indeed it was not according to his profession, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the prosperity of</hi> Bajazet, <hi>unto whom it seemed that all the world should bend,
and that he did it for his own safety:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Tamerlane</hi> excused him, and
without any more ado,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaseth him.</note> gave him liberty at his own pleasure to depart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bajazet</hi> himself Being afterwards brought to <hi>Tamerlane</hi> as a Prisoner, was
by him courteously entertained, who never shewed any token of submission at
all, but according to his proud nature, without respect of his present state,
answered him presumptuously to whatever he demanded of him:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazets</hi> proud behaviour.</note> Wherewith
<hi>Tamerlane</hi> being somewhat moved, told him that it was in his power to take
his life from him; whereto he answered no more, but <hi>Do it, for that loss will
be my greatest happiness:</hi> Then <hi>Tamerlane</hi> demanded of him, what made him
so proud as to enterprize to bring so noble a Prince as the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour into
his subjection? He answered, <hi>Even the same cause which moved thee to invade
me, namely the desire of glory and sovereignity.</hi> But wherefore then (said <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi>)
dost thou use such cruelty towards them whom thou overcomest,
without respect of Age or Sex? <hi>That did I</hi> (said he) <hi>to strike the greater terrour
into mine Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> ask him if he had ever given thanks to God for making
him so great an Emperour?<note place="margin">Leoncla, in edit. Annal. <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>No</hi> (said he) <hi>I never so much as thought upon any
such thing.</hi> Then said <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> Its no wonder that so ungrateful a man
should be made a spectacle of misery.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For you (saith he) being blind of an
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:103996:137"/>
Eye, and I lame of a Leg, was there any worth in us, that God should set us
over two such great Empires, to command so many men far more worthy
than our selves? But, said <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> what would thou have done with me
if it had been my lot to have fallen into thy hands, as thou art now in mine?
<hi>I would</hi> (said <hi>Bajazet) have enclosed thee in a Cage of Iron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lex Talionis.</note> 
               <hi>and so have carried
thee up and down in Triumph through my Kingdom.</hi> Even so (said <hi>Tamerlane</hi>)
shalt thou be served: And so causing him to be taken out of his presence, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his followers, he said, Behold a proud and cruel man, who deserves to
be chastised accordingly, and to be made an example to all the proud and cruel
of the World, of the just wrath of God against them. I acknowledg that God
this day hath delivered into my hands a great Enemy, to whom therefore we
must return thanks,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Piety.</note> which he also caused publickly to be performed the
same day; for the Battel was ended about four a clock, and there were
divers hours yet of day-light. The next day he caused the dead to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
where amongst the rest was found the body of the Prince of <hi>Ciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi>
dead in the midst of the Janizaries, where he lay enclosed with their
dead bodies, shwing that he died not unrevenged, whose untimely death
<hi>Tamerlane</hi> much lamented, causing his dead body to be Embalmed, and with
two thousand Horse, and divers <hi>Turkish</hi> Prisoners chained together, to be
conveyed to <hi>Samercand</hi> until his coming thither.<note place="margin">The dead bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</note> All other dead bodies were,
with all honour that might be, buried at <hi>Sennas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great bloody Battel was fought in the year of our Lord, 1397. not
far from Mount <hi>Stella</hi> (where formerly the great King <hi>Methridates</hi> was by
<hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, in a great Battel overthrown.) It continued from seven a
clock in the morning till four in the afternoon; victory as it were all the while
hovering with doubtful Wings over both Armies, as uncertain where to light,
until at length the fortune of <hi>Tamerlane</hi> prevailed:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Policy.</note> whose wisdom, next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, gave him the days Victory; for that the politick tiring of the strong
Forces of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> was the safeguard of his own: whereas if he had gone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Battel in one front, assuredly the multitude finding such strong oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
had put it self into confusion; but this successive manner of aiding his
men, made them all unto him profitable. The number of the slain is
variously reported. The <hi>Turks</hi> themselves say, that <hi>Bajazet</hi> lost there his
noble Son <hi>Mustapha,</hi> with two hundred thousand of his men, and <hi>Tamerlane</hi>
not many fewer:<note place="margin">The number of the slain.</note> Others say, that the <hi>Turks</hi> lost about sixty thousand, and
<hi>Tamerlane</hi> not past twenty thousand. But likely it is, that the carnage was
very great in so long a fight between two such Armies as probably never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
met in a field together.</p>
            <p>By this days event is plainly seen the uncertainty of worldly things,<note place="margin">The uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of worldly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> and
what small assurance even the greatest have in them. Behold, <hi>Bajazet</hi> the
terrour of the World, and (as he thought) superiour to fortune, in an instant
by the event of one Battel thrown into the bottom of misery and despair, and
that at such a time as he thought least of it, even in the midst of his greatest
strength. It was three days before he could be pacified, but as a desperate
man still sought after death, and called for it. Neither did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> after
he had once spoken with him, at all afterwards use him courteously, but as
of a proud and insolent man, made small account of him. And to manifest
that he knew how to curb the haughty, he made him to be shackled in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and chains of Gold,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi> kept in a Cage.</note> and so to be shut up in an Iron Cage, made like a
grate, that he might be seen on every side, and so carried him up and down
as he passed thorow <hi>Asia,</hi> to be made a scorn and derision to his own people,
over whom he had before Tyrannized. And to his further disgrace, upon
Festival days he used him for a footstool to tread upon when he mounted
on Horseback, and at other times scornfully fed him, like a Dog with
fragments that fell from his Table. A rare example of the uncertainty of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103996:137"/>
worldly honours and greatness, that he, unto whose ambitious mind <hi>Asia</hi>
and <hi>Europe,</hi> two great parts of the World, were too little, should now be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
up and down, cooped up in a little Iron cage, like a dangerous wild beast:
How might he have taken up that speech of <hi>Hecuba</hi> in <hi>Seneca? Quicunque Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
fidit, &amp; magna potens dominatur in aula, me videat.—Non unquam tulit
Documenta Fors majora quàm fragili loco starent superbi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> used this severity,<note place="margin">Pride goeth before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</note> not so much out of hatred to the man, as to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
the just Judgment of God against the arrogant folly of the proud. And
when on a time he was requested by one of his Nobles to remit some part of
this rigour to so great a man, he answered, <hi>I do not use this rigour against him as
a King, but rather to punish him as a proud amibitious Tyrant, polluted with the bloud
of his own brother, and many other innocents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This so great an overthrow brought such a fear upon all the Countries pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed

Ambassadours thither before to <hi>Axalla,</hi> by whom they were entertained
till the coming of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who received them with all the honour that
might be, shewing them all his magnificence, and the order of his Camp, to
their great admiration: For it resembled a most populous and well governed
City, by reason of the order that was therein, which brought it plenty of
victuals, and of all manner of merchandise, as well for delight as necessity.
By these Ambassadours the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour yielded his Empire, together with
his Person,<note place="margin">The <hi>Greek</hi> Empire yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane.</hi>
               </note> unto <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> as his most faithful Subject and Vassal: Which
(as he said) he was bound to do, for that he was by him delivered from the
most cruel Tyrant of the World; as also for the long journey he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
for his sake, and the discommodities he had endured, with the hazard
of his Person, and loss of his Subjects, which could not be otherwise compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sated,
but with the offer of his own, and his Subjects lives to him, which for
ever he therefore dedicated to his service, with all the fidelity and loyalty that
so great a benefit might deserve: besides, that his so many virtues, and rare
endowments, which made him famous through the world, did oblige him
the more hereunto, and that therefore he would attend him in his chief Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to deliver it into his hands, as his own, together with all the Empire
of <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these Ambassadours expected no less than to fall into the bondage of
<hi>Tamerlane,</hi> judging that which they offered to be so great and delicate a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
as that it would not be refused, especially of such a Victorious Prince as
was <hi>Tamerlane;</hi> and that the acceptance thereof in kindness and Friendship was
the best bargain they could make therein. But they received at answer from
this Worthy Prince far beyond their expectation: For he with a mild counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
beholding them,<note place="margin">It's refused by him.</note> answered thus; That he was not come from so far a
countrey, nor undertook such pains for the enlargement of his Dominions,
big enough already (too base a thing for him to put himself into so great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and hazard for) but rather to win honour, and to make his name famous
to future Posterities: And that he would make it appear to the World, that he
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:103996:138"/>
came to assist their Master as his Friend and Ally at his request: and that his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
intentions therein were the greatest cause that God from above had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
him, and made him instrumental to bruise the head of the greatest and
fiercest enemy of mankind that was under heaven; and therefore to get him
an immortal name, his purpose was to make free so great and flourishing a
City as was <hi>Constantinople,</hi> governed by so noble and ancient a House as the
Emperours.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> fidelity.</note> That he had alwayes joyned Faith to his Courage, which should
never suffer him to make so great a breach into his reputation, as that it should
be reported of him, that in the colour of a Friend, he should come to invade
the Dominions of his Ally. That he desired no more, but that the service he
had done for the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, might remain for ever engraven in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of his posterity, to the end they might for ever wish well to him and his
Successors, by the remembring the good he had done for them: That he wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that long might the noble Emperour live, happily to govern his estate,
and that before his return, he would so well consider of the establishing of the
same, as that he should not lightly fall into the same jeopardy.</p>
            <p>Easie it is to judge what joy the Ambassadours did conceive upon hearing
this so gracious an answer from the mouth of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who, rather than
he would break his Faith, refused an Empire offered him, together with one
of the stateliest and magnificentest Cities in the World. After the testifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their joy and thankfulness, these Ambassadours were by the command
of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> royally feasted by <hi>Axalla,</hi> having all the honour done to them
that might be.<note place="margin">The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> And one of them being sent back to carry this unexpected
news to the Emperour, filled both him and all the City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> with
exceeding joy and gladness, which both he, and all his subjects testified, by
making of Bonefires,<note place="margin">The <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour comes to him.</note> and other signs of joy and pleasure. And the Emperour,
the more to shew his gratitude, by the advice of his Counsellours, passed over
the streight into <hi>Asia,</hi> to see <hi>Tamerlane</hi> in <hi>Prusa,</hi> and in person himself to give
him thanks; who hearing of his coming, and being glad thereof, presently sent
Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> to meet him, and to certifie him of the joy he conceived to have
the good hap to see him, as also to conduct him to <hi>Prusa,</hi> where those two great
Princes with the greatest magnificence that might be, met, and so spent one
whole day in conversing together; and the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor the next daytaking
his leave, was by <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with much honour conducted out of the City.</p>
            <p>Now had <hi>Tamerlane</hi> himself conceived a great desire to see the famous City
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> goes to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>

as a Conquerour, but as a private person: which by the means of <hi>Axalla</hi>
was accomplished, and he thereinto by the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour privately recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and with all familiarity possible entertained: the Emperour shewing
unto him all the rare and excellent things that were contained therein; and
the other <hi>Greek</hi> Princes devising all the means they could to do him pleasure,
and them that were with him, who were all in a manner cloathed after the
<hi>Greek</hi> fashion. The <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour was curious to shew him all the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Gardens along the Sea-coast, and so privately conducting him about, spent
five or six dayes with all the mirth that might be;<note place="margin">He highly commended it.</note> 
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> by the way of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
saying, that he had never seen a fairer City; and that of all others, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the scituation of it, it was right worthy to command all the World.
He wondred at the costly buildings of the Temples, the fair engraven Pillars,
the high Piramides, and the excellent Gardens; afterwards saying often, that
it nothing repented him to have undertaken so long and dangerous a journey,
if it had been only to preserve so notable a City from fire and sword. In the
<hi>Greek</hi> Emperour he greatly commended his mild nature and courtesie, who
knowing that above all things he took pleasure in fair serviceable Horses, gave
unto him thirty of the fairest, strongest, and readiest that were possibly to be
gotten, all most richly furnished: He sent likewise great Presents to all the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:103996:138"/>
Princes, and great Commanders of the Army, and bountifully caused to be
delivered to them all things which he thought necessary for the Army: So
after these great kindnesses, and a strict bond of Friendship made, and by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Oath confirmed by these two great Princes, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
took leave of the Emperour, and returned to his Army at <hi>Prusa,</hi>
wherewith now at pleasure he spoiled and wasted all the dominions of <hi>Bajazet</hi>
in <hi>Asia,</hi> no man daring to make head against him.</p>

               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> dispersed his Army into divers
Provinces of the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> expecting daily when some of <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s sons
or great Friends, should make suit to him for his deliverance; but none
came, most fearing the fierce nature of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> who, if he had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
was like enough to have taken severe revenge upon all that forsook
him in the battel, and therefore they never interceeded for him. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Tamerlane</hi> one day passing by him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazets</hi> Pride.</note> said, <hi>I marvel that none of thy sons nor
friends either come to see thee, or to intreat for thee; it must needs be that
thou hast evil deserved of them, as thou hast of others. But what thinkest thou,
if I should set thee at liberty, would they receive thee again as their Lord and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
or not?</hi> To whom <hi>Bajazet</hi> stoutly answered, Were I at liberty,
thou shouldest quickly see that I want neither courage nor means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
all my wrongs, and to make the disobedient to know their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
better. This proud answer made <hi>Tamerlane</hi> to keep a stricter hand over
him.</p>
            <p>In this great War, the Sultan of <hi>Egypt</hi> (as we said before) had aided <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet,</hi>
which <hi>Tamerlane</hi> took in so evil part, that he resolved revenge: For

and dreadful.<note place="margin">

with something more out of bounty; as also he did divers Cities

               </note> And thus having enriched his Army with the spoils
of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, he turned his Forces against the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sultan,
and so passing through <hi>Caramania,</hi> he entred into <hi>Syria,</hi> then part of the
Sultans Kingdom; where near unto <hi>Aleppo</hi> (before yielded to him) there
was fought between them a great and mortal battel, the Sultan having
in his Army a hundred thousand Foot, and seventy four thousand Horse;
whereof there were thirty thousand <hi>Mamelukes,</hi> accounted the best Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the World. In which Battel <hi>Axalla,</hi> with the Avantguard of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi>'s

rescued by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who, had he not by his coming on with fresh
Forces speedily restored the battel, that day was like enough to have put
a period to his Fortunes: But Victory, after a long and cruel fight (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were eighty thousand of both sides slain) inclining to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> the
Sultan fled,<note place="margin">The Sultan beaten, flyeth.</note> 
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> pursuing him for the space of three Leagues. After
this Victory, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> dividing his Army, sent <hi>Axalla</hi> with forty thousand
Horse and fifty thousand Foot to pursue the Sultan along the Sea-coast of
<hi>Arabia;</hi> The Sultan made divers Alts with four thousand Horse to have
stopped <hi>Axalla,</hi> who having the smallest Forces, followed him the nearest,
whilst <hi>Tamerlane</hi> with sixty thousand Horse, and two hundred thousand
Foot, marched along those Coasts, having all the Cities as he went sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
to him: only the strong City of <hi>Damasco</hi> refused to receive him,
whereinto the Sultan had put the Prince <hi>Zamudzen,</hi> with a strong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who did what might be done to defend the same, but all in vain:

the City by storm, only the Castle yet remained, which was accounted
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:103996:139"/>
impregnable: but at the taking of the City, such a multitude pressed into it,
as that it was not possible for them long to subsist; therefore within a short
time, being pinched with hunger, and many already dead, the rest, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of their lives, offered to yield; But <hi>Tamerlane</hi> would not receive them to
mercy, to make them sensible what it was to hold out against him: So that
most of them dying of famine, the rest yielded at pleasure, and were most of
them put to the Sword for their obstinacy; which severity of his, caused all
the Cities within the space of thirty Leagues to bring their Keyes to him in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of their submission, whom he no way molested, otherwise than in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
to the charge of his Army.</p>
            <p>From thence he turned directly towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>

                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> goes to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
               </note> at which time they of
the City had turned out the Sultans Garrison, as had almost all they of <hi>Judea,</hi>
submitting themselves unto <hi>Tamerlane:</hi> at <hi>Chorazin</hi> was a Garrison of six
thousand, who at first pretended to defend the place: but when they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was resolved to have it, they submitted, and found mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
There <hi>Tamerlane</hi> left a Garrison of his own to repress the <hi>Mamelukes,</hi> who
with frequent incursions troubled his Army. Himself with some of his Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
rode to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Piety.</note> to visit the Sepulchre so much reverenced of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
By the Inhabitants he was joyfully received, and having sought out all
the antiquities of that ancient City, he would be conducted to all the places
where Christ had preached; and coming to the Sepulchre, he gave there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rich gifts, to the great content of all, only the <hi>Jews</hi> much blamed him
for so doing, but he regarded them not, calling them the accursed of God:
There had he news, that the Sultan, having gathered together all his Forces,
was fortifying his Cities in <hi>Egypt,</hi> especially <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Caier;</hi>
whereupon <hi>Tamerlane</hi> commanded his Army to march towards <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mietta,</hi>
which strong City he thought not good to leave behind him, though
by some he was perswaded so to do, for that it was thought impregnable, both
by reason of the strong Castle, and great Garrison placed therein by the Sultan:
But he,<note place="margin">He marcheth into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </note> whose Fortune nothing could hinder, would needs go thither: And
having commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to attempt it, followed himself after with the rest
of his Army.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Axalla,</hi> having summoned the City, declared to the Inhabitants (who
were most of them Christians) the mildness, and courtesie of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> as
also who himself, and of what Religion he was; causing many of his <hi>Greek</hi>
Captains to speak to them, and to tell them, what misery they endured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Mameluks,</hi> which so far prevailed with them, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to adventure their lives to put the <hi>Mameluks</hi> out of the City; and the
night after,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Damietia</hi> taken.</note> taking Arms, made themselves Masters of one quarter of the City,
opening one of the Gates to <hi>Axalla,</hi> whereby he entring, put all the <hi>Mameluks</hi>
to the Sword, or took them prisoners; and so became Master of that strong
City: Whereof <hi>Tamerlane</hi> hearing, hoped by so prosperous a beginning, to
find an happy end of his Wars in <hi>Egypt.</hi> For he knew that the Haven of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mietta</hi>
might furnish him with Victuals out of all parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Emmanuel</hi> had promised him, and wherein he nothing failed him.
Then did <hi>Tamerlane</hi> enter the City, leaving therein a Garrison of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of the Emperour of <hi>Greece</hi> his Souldiers, with a Governour, of whom he
took an Oath for their obedience.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> marched to <hi>Cair.</hi>
               </note> And having staid a while at <hi>Damietta,</hi> he
caused his Avantguard to march towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and having passed over
the River, he suddenly turned directly towards <hi>Grand Caire,</hi> to the great asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of the Sultan, who provided for the defence of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to the Enemy: But understanding this news, used such diligence, that he
entred into <hi>Caire,</hi> with forty thousand Horse and sixty thousand Foot, even
as <hi>Tamerlane's</hi> Army approached to it. By this unexpected coming of the
Sultan, the great City, that before was ready to have revolted, was again
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:103996:139"/>
confirmed in his obedience, to the great prejudice of <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> affairs: For
to remain long before it was impossible, through want of Victuals for so great
an Army in an Enemies Countrey. Yet this discouraged not <hi>Tamerlane</hi> from
approaching to it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caire</hi> besieged.</note> and with all his Army to encamp near unto the same,
having caused a great Trench to be made for the security of his Horsemen,
and therein to lodge his Army more safely: during which time, he caused di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
attempts to be made, as well to try the enemies confidence, as to see how
the people of the City, especially the slaves (which in that populous City are
in great numbers) were affected towards him, who indeed were glad to see
the state of his Army, and the proud <hi>Mamelukes</hi> still put to the worst, but far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strirred not. During this siege, he thought good one day to draw forth
his Army before the City, to try whether the enemy had any mind to come
to a battel; as also to view his own Forces, and so indeed to seek occasion to
fight, hoping that if the Sultan should come forth with his Army, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
might happen at the same time in the City, as well by the slaves, unto
whom by secret Spies,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> policy.</note> he had promised liberty, as by the Citizens themselves,
who were much discontented with the insolency of the <hi>Mamelukes,</hi> and by
whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> by the same Spies had made it known that he came not to
hurt them, but to deliver them from the tyranny of his, and their enemies:
But standing thus in Battel array, none stirred out of the City, neither was
there any tumult raised within, according as he expected: For the Sultan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
plentifully provided with all things in that rich City, resolved to weary
out <hi>Tamerlane</hi> by lying still, and not to put all to the hazard of a battel. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi>
perceiving his Design, yet resolved not to depart till he was Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
whereupon he thought fit also to attempt him in his greatest strength,
and in the heart of his greatest City, though it could not be done without
great hazard, such confidence had he in the Valour, and Multitude of his
Army. Now his purpose was first to take one of the Cities (for <hi>Caire</hi> is
divided into three) and therein encamping himself, by little and little to
advance forwards,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caire</hi> stormed.</note> as he could find opportunity. Upon this resolution, he
commanded a strong assault to be given, and having conducted his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to the place chosen by him for the onset (for the City was not Walled,
but only fortified with Ditches and Trenches) he commanded the Prince of
<hi>Thanais,</hi> with fifty thousand men, to begin the Assault, even in the face
of the Enemy, which he most valiantly performed, which occasioned a great
and terrible fight. <hi>Axalla</hi> in the mean time deeming (as the truth was) that
the Sultan had drawn the greatest part to his Forces to that place, fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a compass about, and in another part of the City, with small resistance
passed the Trenches,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> enters.</note> where he presently left thirty thousand men to fill up
the Ditches, thereby to make way for the Horsemens entrance, himself with
the rest, advancing forwards against twenty thousand sent by the Sultan to
oppose his farther passage, the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> being at the same time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
beaten back by the <hi>Mamelukes:</hi> But the Ditches being presently level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
ten thousand Horsemen entred, who charged upon the backs of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melukes,</hi>
where the Sultan himself was; there were likewise seconded by ten
thousand more,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caire</hi> taken.</note> sent in by <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> himself following after with all his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
Hereupon the Sultan retreated into a second strength which he had made
in the next City.</p>
            <p>This fight continued full seven hours, wherein were slain of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
men, above sixteen thousand, and of <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s between seven and
eight thousand. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> being well contented that he had dislodged his
enemy, and gained one of the Cities, caused a retreat to be sounded, hoping
the next day to win all the rest, as indeed he did. For the next morning

another,<note place="margin">The Sultan <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:103996:140"/>
obstinate Enemy, and unable longer to hold out, retreated, abandoning the
City, and encamping himself along the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> resolving to retire to
the City of <hi>Alexandria</hi> his second strength, and only refuge, which <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi>
suspecting,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> pursueth.</note> followed after him with his Horsemen, (who only were
in order) and some few Foot hardly drawn from the City, which their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
were in plundering, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> promising them both to regard, and
reward their good service. Against these, the Sultan, upon a narrow cawse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
had opposed twelve or fifteen thousand men, to favour his passage,
who being of his best Souldiers, maintained their ground stoutly, the place
being much for their advantage; yet at length their enemies still increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and pressing hard upon them, they were forced to cast themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the great River,<note place="margin">A brave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the <hi>Mamelukes.</hi>
               </note> and made a most honourable retreat, every man having
his Weapon in one hand, and swimming with the other hand to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bank. The Sultan flying with about eighteen thousand Horse, (the
rest being either drowned or dispersed) is said to have comforted his fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men, by telling them, they were not men, but gods that had vanquished
them.</p>
            <p>Divers of the <hi>Mamelukes</hi> that were taken Prisoners, being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Tamerlane,</hi> were by him courteously used, and asked if they would be
content to serve him,<note place="margin">Fidelity rewarded.</note> seeing their Master was fled and gone? This they
all utterly refused, whom notwithstanding for their fidelity, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> set at
liberty to go again to their Master, being no less desirous to be admired by his
Enemies for his Goodness and Bounty, than to be feared for his Force and
Valour.</p>
            <p>The wonderful wealth of this so great and famous a City,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caire</hi> plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> became a prey to
his Souldiers, who for the space of twenty four hours, had the spoil thereof:
At the end of which time, every man was straitly charged by open Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to retire to his Quarters. <hi>Tamerlane</hi> would not suffer any of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
to be taken Prisoners and such as were, he released, and so leaving ten
thousand good Souldiers, with many others that followed his Camp, for the
Guard of the City, and taking with him all such persons as he thought might
hurt him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> goes to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi>
               </note> he caused his Army to pass over the River, and to follow the Sultan
to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that so his Victory might be compleated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Axalla</hi> hasted before with the Avantguard, to hinder the Sultan from
gathering up his Forces together: The rest of the Army was conducted
by the Prince of <hi>Thanais, Tamerlane</hi> himself, with an infinte number of
Boats, and many Souldiers to attend him, went by Water, greatly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to behold that fair River of <hi>Nilus,</hi> sometimes running with a swift course,
other sometimes very calm, and scarce moved. The Citizens of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>
hearing of his coming, and fearing the issue, besought the Sultan to
compassionate their condition, and to withdraw himself into <hi>Lybia;</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Tamerlane</hi> could not follow him, by reason of the barrenness of the
Countrey: Resolving for their parts to submit to Fortune, and to do as the
time required; yet promising in heart to remain his, and to make the same to
appear to him, so soon as occasion should be offered. Hereupon the Sultan,
seeing all things desperate,<note place="margin">The Sultan flyes.</note> determined to retire, yet hoping that time might
bring a change, for that <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> numerous Army could not long remain
there: And so departing out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> with Tears standing in his eyes,
he often said, that God was angry with him and his People, so that he must of
necessity suffer the fatal Overthrow of his Estate; yet, for his own part, he
had done as much as in him lay, according the Duty of his Place, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the expectation that the World had of him, for the upholding of the
same. Notwithstanding he hoped to return again, and to deliver his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from that bondage, which for the present they were necessitated to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitto</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:103996:140"/>
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> coming to <hi>Alexandria</hi> (before yielded to <hi>Axalla</hi>) stayed there a
great while,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Axalla</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues him.</note> sending <hi>Axalla</hi> to pursue the <hi>Sultan,</hi> being much grieved that he
could not get him into his hands, and therefore he still feared that some Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
would be raised by him after his departure, which made him to deal
the more hardly with them whom he suspected to favour him. Now the
bruit of these Victories, having with <hi>Axalla,</hi> passed into <hi>Lybia,</hi> brought such
a fear, not only upon the Countries adjoyning to these Conquests, but also
upon all <hi>Africa,</hi> supposing (that <hi>Tamerlane</hi> followed with the rest of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my)

having long followed the Sultan, who like a man forsaken of Fortune, still
fled before him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> desires to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home.</note> seeing all his labour lost, returned to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> And <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane,</hi>
after his long travel and pains taken, was now more desirous than
ever to return into his own Countrey: The rather being moved thereunto by
the earnest request of his Wife, much longing for his return: He had news
also of the sickness of the old Emperour of <hi>Tartary,</hi> his Father in Law; and
besides, Age it self began to bring unto him a desire of rest. With his did the
desires of the Souldiers well agree, who were now weary of running so many
and divers Adventures.<note place="margin">He secures his new conquests.</note> His only stay was, that he expected the coming of
<hi>Calibes,</hi> an old and faithful servant of his, whom for his good desert he made
choice of to govern all these his new Conquests in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria:</hi> A great
honour indeed it was, but not too great for him that had so well deserved.
And indeed <hi>Tamerlane</hi> was alwayes so mindful of the good deserts of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
servant, that he needed not by others to be put in remembrance of them,
were they never so far off, as now was <hi>Calibes,</hi> who at this time was, with a
third part of the Army, making way for him along the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> for
the Conquest of <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> whose coming was longed for with
great devotion by the whole Army, which was now very desirous to return;
but this expectation of theirs was not long delayed, for <hi>Calibes</hi> being sent for,
came speedily to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where the whole Army was by <hi>Tamerlane</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
now rendezvouzed.</p>
            <p>Upon the coming of <hi>Calibes,</hi>

                  <hi>Calibes</hi> made Governour.</note> 
               <hi>Tamerlane</hi> made the Prince of <hi>Zamalzan</hi>

<hi>Calibes,</hi> whom <hi>Tamerlane</hi> (as was said before) had made his Vice-Roy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> together with the Countries newly conquered in <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi>
and <hi>Barbary:</hi> He gave him also six thousand Horse, and ten thousand Foot
to assist him therein: And so leaving <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he took <hi>Calibes</hi> along with
him to the great City of <hi>Caire,</hi> there taking the best order he could for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of his new Conquests: He left with him forty thousand Horse, and
fifty thousand Foot: And having sufficiently instructed him how he would
have those Kingdoms governed, dismissed him, not like a servant, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
being very sorry to leave him destitute of his presence: So setting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with his Army,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> goes to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
               </note> conducted by the Prince of <hi>Thanais, Tamerlane</hi> with a
few of his Train, turned again aside to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where he daily visited the
Sepulchre of Christ, (whom he called the God of the Christians) viewing the
ruines of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, which he much admired, and at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the
Seat of <hi>David</hi>'s Kingdom, and that of great <hi>Solomon,</hi> grieving that he could
not see them in their former beauty; And to shew his Devotion and favour to
this City, he commanded it to be free from all Garrisons and Subsidies, and so
giving great gifts to the Monasteries, he departed from thence to <hi>Damasco;</hi>
which great City, for that it was infected with the Opinions of <hi>Jezides,</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
an Arch-Heretick among the Mussulmen) as also evil-affected to his
Proceedings, he caused it to be razed, and the bones of <hi>Jezides</hi> the False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:103996:141"/>
to be digged up, and burnt, and his Sepulchre (which before by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
was much honoured, to be filled with dung; and so marching on, and
blasting the World before him, being victorious which way soever he turned,
he at last passed over the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where he conquered <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi>
with the great City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and all the Kingdom of <hi>Persia,</hi> and so at last la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with the spoiles of the World, and eternized for ever in his Fame, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Samercand,</hi> the famous place of his Birth, and Glorious Seat of his
Empire.</p>
            <p>Now had <hi>Bajazet</hi> (a little before one of the greatest Princes on earth, and
now the Scorn of Fortune, and by-word to the World) with great impatiency
lain two years in most miserable thraldom, for the most part shut up in an iron
Cage, like a dangerous wild beast: and having no better means to end his
loathed life, violently dashed out his brains against the bars of the iron Grate
wherein he was enclosed, and so died about the year of our Lord 1399. His
dead body, at the request of his Son <hi>Mahomet,</hi> was by <hi>Tamerlane</hi> sent to <hi>Aspra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
from which it was conveyed to <hi>Prusa,</hi> and there lieth buried in a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
built for the purpose without the City Eastward: where also are interred
the bodies of his best beloved Wife <hi>Despina,</hi> and of his eldest son <hi>Erthogrul,</hi> and
in another little Chappel hard by, lieth buried his brother <hi>Jacup,</hi> whom he
had murdered in the beginning of his Reign.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bajazet</hi>'s Character.</note> This <hi>Bajazet</hi> had some Vertues,
which were much obscured by his cholerick and wayward nature, which
made him to exceed in cruelty and Pride: He was also very covetous; which
qualities made him indeed much feared, but little beloved of his Souldiers and
men of War, by whom therefore in his greatest need he was forsaken. He
used commonly to say, That <hi>his Treasures were his Childrens meat, and not his
Souldiers Pay;</hi> which, by way of reproach, was by a common Souldier cast in
his Teeth, when he raged to see himself by them forsaken in that great battel
against <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> telling him as he fled, <hi>That he run not away, but went to seek
his Pay, wherewith to provide his children bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> as we said before, having conquered <hi>Persia,</hi> used his Victory so
mildly, that as long as he lived, the people of that Countrey were alwayes
much affected to him; which served him greatly, as well for the keeping of
<hi>Syria,</hi> as the Sultan of <hi>Egypts</hi> Empire: In his own Countrey he was received
with all Triumphs, and expressions of joy that might be; the chiefest prisoners
marching before him, and wheresoever he passed, the people assembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by thousands,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Devotion.</note> praising and singing his Victories. The Emperour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
spent a month or two in Feasts and Triumphs, according to his accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Devotion, he vowed a Church and Hospital unto God, the most magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
that might be devised: and to beautifie his City of <hi>Samercand,</hi> he search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out all sorts of Handicrafts-men,<note place="margin">He enlargeth <hi>Samercand.</hi>
               </note> intending to make it as large again as it
was, and one of the stateliest Cities in the World: he peopled it also with so
many several Nations as he had brought along with him, unto whom he gave
liberty to build houses, distributing money unto them to do the same, giving
them also all kind of Priviledges and Immunities for their encouragement
therein: He caused also the streets to be plotted out, and in one corner of it
he built his Church and Hospital. His next care was to preserve the good
will and love of his famous Souldiers,<note place="margin">His love to his Souldiers.</note> whose names he caused to be Registred
in a general Muster-Roll, which he kept by him, and daily conferred honours
and rewards upon them (they not thinking of it) in recompence of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
good services; thinking that day lost wherein he did not some good.
Then did he declare the death of the old Emperour to his Council, (of which
he had received private intelligence) and forgat no Ceremony due unto his
honour, publickly expressing the grief he had conceived for his death. Then
did he,<note place="margin">He goeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Quinsay.</hi>
               </note> with his ordinary Court, consisting of forty thousand Horse, and sixty

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:103996:141"/>
when he came to <hi>Cambalu,</hi> he had intelligence of a battel fought by <hi>Odmar</hi>
against the King of <hi>China</hi>'s Captain General,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Odmar's</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory in <hi>China.</hi>
               </note> and how he had pursued his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
having taken three or four great and rich Cities, and that the <hi>Chinois</hi>
did again desire Peace. Hereupon he sent them these Articles; That the King
of <hi>China</hi> should pay all the Arrears of his Tribute; That he should come in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to do his homage, acknowledging himself a Vassal of his Empire; That
he should deliver up to him all his Cities saving three, such as the Emperour
should nominate; That he should pay all the charges of the War, because he
had broken the Peace;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tamerlane</hi> gives him his sister in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> which performed, things should be restored to the
same state they were in before the War. And to gratifie <hi>Odmar,</hi> he sent to him
with all Magnificence, one of his Sisters to be his Wife.</p>
            <p>When he first entred into <hi>Cambalu,</hi> he was received with all the expressions

he had taken from them, for their Rebellion with <hi>Calix.</hi> The Empress being
informed of his being there (leaving Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> to govern at <hi>Quinsay</hi>) came
to him: So that he remained there near two moneths, giving order for all
his affairs; the rather, because it was near to Mount <hi>Althay,</hi> where the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>

to be brought thither, himself conducted it with all Pomp, honouring
not only the Body, but all that he had loved in the World; and though it
was not the custom for Women to assist at Funerals, yet he took his Empress
along with him, who went near unto the Corps, till they came to the place
where it was interred amongst his Predecessors. After these Ceremonies
finished, he returned to <hi>Cambalu,</hi> where he spent the Winter in Tilts, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,

was near to <hi>China,</hi> whereby he had the fitter opportunity to hear how affairs
passed there, purposing to go thither in person the next Winter, if <hi>Odmar</hi> that
Summer did not make an end of the Wars; and if the King of <hi>China</hi> did not
submit himself to his Obedience. The Mark he shot at now being only to keep
that which by his Valour he had won, desiring to spend the rest of his life in
reaping the fruits of his hard Travels, and former labours.</p>
            <p>Now Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> governed at <hi>Quinsay,</hi> as well to the great contentment
of the Souldiery, as of the Inhabitants, who, out of their abundant love to

            <p>Shortly after, <hi>Tamerlane</hi> went to <hi>Quinsay,</hi> and by the way was met by
Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> and all the chief Lords and Citizens, who entertained him
with all the Magnificence that might be.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quinsay</hi> descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. It was one hundred miles in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass.</note> This City of <hi>Quinsay</hi> was the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and one of the richest in the World, and of the most wonderful sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
being divided by many channels of Water, upon which are framed
wonderful and stately buildings, having also an infinite number of Bridges:
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:103996:142"/>
It abounds with all kind of Spices, and Merchandizes in great quantity. The
Citizens presented the Emperour with many rare things, judged to be
worth two Millions in Gold, with great variety of strange and excellent
things. Then did the Emperour call for his Son that was there educated,
who was now seven years old.<note place="margin">His directions about the breeding of his Son.</note> He forbade that thenceforward they should
suffer him to wear any thing on his Head, and hung a Bow about his neck,
saying, <hi>That they which from their birth were called to Sovereignty, should be
used both to Cold and Heat, and should be exercised to Arms betimes, and not
be brought up idly and delicately: reprehending those which brought him up, for
using him so tenderly, asking them, if they meant to make a Woman of his Son?</hi>
They replying, that he was tender. <hi>If he be not born (said he) to be strong and
valiant, he will not be worthy to succeed me; for he must not be an effeminate
Prince that must preserve the</hi> Parthian <hi>Empire.</hi>
               <note place="margin">His second Son born.</note> About this time his Empress
was brought to bed of another Son at <hi>Samercand,</hi> for joy whereof, he made
Feasts, with Tiltings and Pastimes fifteen dayes together. Then did he visit
all the Sea-Towns near to <hi>Quinsay,</hi> hunting all manner of Games: yet often
saying,<note place="margin">Recreations rightly used.</note> That <hi>the Recreations which he used, were only helps to ease him in the
pains of his publick affairs which God had called him to.</hi> And when Prince
<hi>Axalla</hi> told him, that that City was a fit place for his abode; <hi>O my friend
(said he) it is not so:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Prudence.</note> 
               <hi>For it's a Maxime, that the Lord of this great City must
not come to it above once in ten years, and when he is here, he must temper his
Actions as if he were upon a stage, with Gravity, and a good grace before the people,
who are apt to receive good or evil impressions according as their Princed eporteth himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having setled his affairs in that part of his Empire,<note place="margin">His return to <hi>Samercand.</hi>
               </note> he returned to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercand,</hi>
where three times a Week he administred Justice publickly unto
the meanest of his Subjects,<note place="margin">His Justice.</note> as well as to the greatest; which made him much
beloved of all over whom he did command. On other dayes he gave se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
audience, and disposed of the affairs of his estate, which were concluded
daily in his presence. In his Council he used such severity that none durst
deal untruly, or passionately in his presence. Yet shewed he such courteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in his conversation, that he was both beloved and feared of his people.
He never changed his Servants, except they committed some great faults
against him.<note place="margin">His love to his servants.</note> All the servants of the late Emperour his Uncle, he never
changed one of them, but increased their Pensions, making them sensible
of his liberality in that change:<note place="margin">His bounty.</note> The like bounty he used to strangers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to oblige them to him. He drew great store of money yearly from the
<hi>Muscovite,</hi> by way of Tribute, which yet he distributed in the same Country
to maintain his authority there, winning those to him, who otherwise might
have hurt him.<note place="margin">His frugality.</note> He had great care of his Revenues, wherein he was so expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
that in one hours space he could see his Estate from three months to three
months, together with his ordinary and extraordinary expences; they were
presented to him so well digested.</p>
            <p>But after all his publick affairs so well managed, and his private busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses

               <note place="margin">His <hi>Character</hi>

to be in the Baths, wherein they are very curious in that Contrey, being
their chiefest delight, he was retired to the contemplation and study of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things. He had within his eyes such a Divine beauty, and radiancy full
of Majesty, that one could hardly endure the sight of them without closing of
his eyes, so that some that talked with him, and beheld him, were stricken
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:103996:142"/>
dumb for the present, which caused him with a comely modesty to abstain
from looking upon them that talked with him. All the rest of his Visage was
courteous, and well-proportioned: He wore his hair long and curled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the custome of his Countrey-men, who used to shave their Heads:
He went almost alwayes bare-headed, saying, that his Mother came of the
Race of <hi>Sampson,</hi> who therefore advised him to honour long hair. His hair
was of a dusky colour, inclining somewhat to a Violet, the most beautiful
that any eye could behold. His stature was of a middle sort, somewhat nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
in his shoulders: He had a fair and strong leg; his bodily strength and
agility, was such, as none did surpass, and often on Festival dayes, he made
trial of them with the strongest; yet did he it with such a Grace mixt with
Humanity, that he whom he overcame held himself therein most happy,
though it was a great disgrace amongst the <hi>Tartarians</hi> to be thrown to the
ground in wrestling.</p>
            <p>In the time of his Wars against the <hi>Turks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Note.</note> a Souldier of his found buried in
the ground a great Pot of Gold, which he brought to <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> who asked

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> was endowed with singular gifts both of Body and Mind,<note place="margin">His Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> which
were much improved by the sedulous care of his Prudent Father, manifested
in the virtuous education of him: For which end he procured <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Pisa,</hi>
a learned man, to instruct him in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues, and one <hi>Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
to read to him <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and the <hi>Mathematicks:</hi> Himself also trained him
up in Feates of Arms, and Warlike exercises. But above all, and as the
ground of all virtues, he was careful to have him trained up, and well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in Religion, which all his life after he loved, and honoured with
great Reverence the Church and Pastors thereof. He called the study of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Sciences his Pastimes, and the companions of his Sword, and did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
recreate himself therein. He loved Learning and learned men by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
He delighted in <hi>Poesy,</hi> as some of his Writings do shew; but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>History,</hi> wherein he was exceeding well read. Charity, Temperance,
Equity, care of Justice to relieve his Subjects, to keep his Faith and promise,
both to Friend and Foe, and to use a Victory modestly, were the notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his excellent knowledg, as remarkable in him as in any Prince that
ever lived. The Universities of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Pisa</hi> (either Founded, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
by him) witness the great love and honour that he did bear to
learning.</p>
            <p>During the Life of his Father <hi>Pepin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Valour and other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note> he shewed how much he had profited
in Arms under so good a Schoolmaster, having great Commands under him,
which he discharged with notable reputation; and the improvement of his
skill and ability after he came to his Kingdom, shew plainly, that there
was never any Souldier that carried Sword with more valour, nor great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that commanded with more obedience, or that performed Noble Actions
with greater success, or that used his Victories with more mildness, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Neither did ever King or Prince rule with more authority, nor
was more reverently obeyed by this Subjects and Souldiers than our <hi>Charles;</hi>
who therefore well deserved the name of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> or <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi>
by reason of his great virtues. He was of a lively disposition, quick, active,
and vehement: <hi>Quicquid egit, valdè egit:</hi> Yet modesty, and wisdom did so
season, and moderate his vivacity, and vehemency, as gave a great lustre to
both, and kept them within their due bounds: And this mixture of divers
humours so tempered with moderation, made him as admirable for his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as venerable in his Person and countenance.</p>
            <p>There appeared in him a grave,<note place="margin">His Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> sweet Majesty in a goodly Personage: His
Body was large and strong: He was very patient of labour: Had a quick spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
was cleer and sound, both in apprehension, memory, and judgment:
Resolution never failed him in difficulties, nor a Reply in Discourses. Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he was to some, Amiable to others, according to the Cause, Persons, and
Occurrents: which virtues purchased him such great esteem, as that he was
beloved, respected, and reverenced of all men, which effects the story of his
raign will shew: For having received a great Kingdom from his Father, he
enlarged it with wonderful success; God having raised him up to be a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
to Christians against the inundation and rage of Barbarous Nations in
the decay and ruin of the Empire. And in prosecuting the Narrative hereof,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103996:144"/>
I shall first set down his actions during the Life of his Brother <hi>Caroloman,</hi> then
what he did from the the time of his death, till he was made Emperour, and
lastly what his Deportment was from thence to his Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caroloman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carolomans</hi> Envy.</note> being Crowned King at <hi>Soissons,</hi> as <hi>Charles</hi> was at <hi>Wormes,</hi>
began to be extream jealous of his Brothers greatness, whom, with grief, he
saw to be beloved, honoured, and obeyed by all the <hi>French,</hi> and that deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
for his singular virtues and endowments both of Body and mind.
This jealousie (too ordinary a concomitant of Princes) made him seek by all
means to undermine, and overthrow the affairs of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> whose Eyes
were fixed upon <hi>Italy,</hi> as the fittest, and most glorious <hi>Theatre</hi> wherein to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
his valour, and to maintain his authority and power amongst Christians;
and <hi>Caroloman</hi> did all that possibly he could to cross his designs therein. But
before I bring him upon that stage, give me leave to shew you what at this
time was the State of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rome</hi> (sometimes the Head of the World) was of late become the <hi>Chios</hi> of<note place="margin">The State of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note>
all confusion, the Randevouz of all Barbarous Nations, as if they had vowed
the ruin thereof by turns, having already sackt it three times. For under the
Empire of <hi>Honorious, Anno Christi</hi> 414. The <hi>Goths,</hi> under their King <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus,</hi>
after two years siege, took it, and sackt it, but did not dismantle it. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
five years after, during the Empire of <hi>Martian, Anno Christi</hi> 459. the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi>
under the conduct of <hi>Genserick</hi> their King, took it again, sackt it,
spoiled and disgraced it, leading the Widow of the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi>
the third, away in Triumph. And in the time of <hi>Justinian</hi> the Emperour,
the <hi>Goths,</hi> under the command of <hi>Totila,</hi> having weakned it by a long siege,
took it, sackt, and dismantled it. Thus <hi>Rome</hi> was no more <hi>Rome,</hi> but a specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of horrid confusion; after so many devastations retaining nothing of her
antient beauty, but only the traces of her old buildings, and the punishment
of her Idolatry and Tyranny; Afterwards the <hi>Longobards,</hi> or <hi>Lombards</hi> held
<hi>Italy,</hi> for the space of two hundred years, till by our <hi>Charlemagne</hi> they were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
and expelled.</p>
            <p>Presently after the Death of <hi>Pepin,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> fell into great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions
by the pactices of <hi>Didier</hi> King of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> who having corrupted
some of the Clergy, caused <hi>Constantine,</hi> Brother to <hi>Toton,</hi> Duke of <hi>Nepezo,</hi>
to be chosen Pope,<note place="margin">Several Popes chosen.</note> which he persecuted with such violence, that he procured
<hi>Philippicus,</hi> who ws already Canonically chosen, to be deposed: But the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
party, seeing themselves contemned by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> assembled together,
and by common consent, chose <hi>Steven</hi> the third (a <hi>Sicilian</hi> by birth) Pope;
who being conscious to his own weakness, resolved to call in the King of
<hi>France,</hi> and to oppose him against his too-powerful enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> being thus sollicited by the Pope, sent twelve Prelates speedily to
<hi>Rome,</hi> that he might strengthen the Popes party against the other, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a greater need to apply a greater remedy; and the matter succeeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his desire. For a Counsel being assembled at <hi>Lateran,</hi> they confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Steven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Steven</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> lawfully chosen, and deposed <hi>Constantine,</hi> who was set up by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and violence. But <hi>Didier</hi> would not rest satisfied with this affront, and
seeing that force had succeeded no better, he rosolved to try Policy, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to undermine <hi>Steven</hi> with fair pretences; For which end he sent to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
his Election,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Didiers</hi> Policy.</note> purged himself in reference to the Anti-Pope <hi>Constantine,</hi>
now degraded: accused both him and his Brother <hi>Toton</hi> of ambition, and
protested to live with <hi>Steven</hi> in amity; and to manifest this his good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he desired him to be pleased with his repair to <hi>Rome,</hi> that there he might
confer with him in private. The Pope (who never seeks to the <hi>French</hi> but in
case of necessity) was easily perswaded by <hi>Didier,</hi> who came to <hi>Rome,</hi> confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Pope, and made great Protestations of his Obedience to him. But
these his fair shews continued not long.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:103996:144"/>
There was at this time at <hi>Rome</hi> a Governour for the Eastern Emperour,
called <hi>Paul Ephialte,</hi> him <hi>Didier</hi> corrupted, and the administration of Justice
being in his hands, he made use of him so cunningly, as that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Pope <hi>Steven,</hi> he caused him to seize upon two of his chief Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>Christopher,</hi> and <hi>Sergius</hi> (whom <hi>Didier</hi> accused of some pretended crimes)<note place="margin">The Popes Secretaries hanged.</note>
and presently to hang them in an infamous manner. Their greatest offence was,
because they favoured the <hi>French.</hi> Neither did he rest here, but caused all the
principal Citizens to be banished, whom he observed to be of the <hi>French</hi> faction,
that so, having removed all hinderances, he might be Master of <hi>Rome</hi> in despite
of the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Steven</hi> was not so dull but he discovered the <hi>Lombards</hi> practice exceedingly
to tend to his prejudice:<note place="margin">The Pope sends for King <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </note> whereupon he sent to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> beseeching him
to prepare an Army against <hi>Didiers</hi> force. This <hi>Charlemagne</hi> easily assented
to, and fully resolved upon: But <hi>Didier</hi> had provided a divertisement in
<hi>France</hi> by the means of <hi>Caroloman,</hi> to stop <hi>Charles</hi> his passage into <hi>Italy,</hi> making
work for him in <hi>Guienne,</hi> where there arose a perilous War upon this occasion.</p>
            <p>Though the Country of <hi>Guienne</hi> depended upon the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Troubles in <hi>Guienne.</hi>
               </note> yet
were there many Tumults raised by the practices of some Noblemen of the
Country, who frequently stirred up the people (mutinous enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
to Rebellion. The cause of these Troubles, was the abuse of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Kings Clemency and Bounty, who suffered such people as he conquered,
to enjoy their priviledges and liberties. <hi>Eudon</hi> (a Nobleman of <hi>Guienne</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
first under <hi>Martel, Jeffery</hi> and <hi>Hunalt</hi> his Children, and heirs of his discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
had continued it under <hi>Pepin;</hi> and <hi>Jeffery</hi> being now dead, <hi>Hunalt</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
him with the like hatred, which <hi>Caroloman</hi> fomented, that he might
imploy him against his Brother <hi>Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guienne</hi> was a part of <hi>Charles</hi> his portion: But <hi>Hunalts</hi> design was, to
withdraw that Country wholly from the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and for that end
he pretended a Title to the Dukedom thereof, labouring to procure the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to Elect him, having the promise, and assistance of <hi>Caroloman</hi> to further
him therein. Indeed the countenance of <hi>Caroloman</hi> could do much; but the
wisdom and courage of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> prevailed more: For being advertised of
<hi>Hunalts</hi> practice, and of his Brothers secret designs, he armed with such speed,
as that he surprised the Towns of <hi>Poictiers, Xante,</hi> and <hi>Angoulesm,</hi> and all the
Country adjoyning,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues <hi>Hunalt.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Hunalt</hi> (who had reckoned without <hi>Charles</hi>) finding himself
thus prevented, fled to a Noble man of that Country called <hi>Loup,</hi> whom he
held, not only to be firm to his faction, but also his trusty and affectionate friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> being informed hereof, sent presently to <hi>Loup,</hi> requiring him
to deliver <hi>Hunalt</hi> into his hands, who was guilty of high Treason; and in
the mean time he built a Fort in the midst of the Country,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> his Policy and Glemency.</note> where the Rivers
of <hi>Dordonne,</hi> and <hi>Lisle</hi> do joyn, which he called <hi>Fronsac,</hi> the better to secure
his Country against such Invaders. <hi>Loup,</hi> not daring to refuse, delivered up
<hi>Hunalt,</hi> and all his Family into the hands of <hi>Charles,</hi> who pardoned <hi>Loup,</hi> and
all that obeyed him; thus ending a dangerous War without blows: And to
<hi>Hunalt</hi> he granted life, and liberty, and the enjoyment of his goods; leaving
a memorable example to all Princes how to carry themselves in a Civil War,
preventing a mischief by prudence; and diligence, and not to thrust their van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
Subjects into despair by rigour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caroloman</hi> seeing his practices against his Brother to succeed so ill, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
a journy to <hi>Rome,</hi> with an intent to cause some alterations there, which
yet he covered with a pretence of devotion. He also took his Mother <hi>Berthe</hi>
along with him, and in their passage, they were hourably entertained by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi>
King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> where <hi>Berthe</hi> treated, and concluded a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
between her Son <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and <hi>Theodora,</hi> Sister, or Daughter to this
<hi>Didier,</hi> who was one of the greatest enemies to her Sons good fortune. Yet

               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> (to please his Mother) received his Wife,<note place="margin">

her away, as neither suiting with his affects, or affairs, and so, that which

Vassal, by whom he had <hi>Charles, Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Lewis,</hi> and three Daughters,
<hi>Rotrude, Berthe,</hi> and <hi>Gille,</hi> who were the Nursery of his Noble Family. But
<hi>Carolomans</hi> jealousie died not with him, but survived in his Wife <hi>Berthe,</hi> who
(being impatient of her present condition, and thrust headlong with a spirit
of revenge against her Brother in Law, <hi>Charles</hi>) retired with her two Sons to
<hi>Didier,</hi> King of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> as to the most bitter, and irreconcilable enemy of
her Brother <hi>Charles. Didier</hi> intertained her and her Children very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
hoping by them to promote his design: But it proved the leaven of his
own destruction. His practice (together with the Widows) was to procure
the present Pope,<note place="margin">Pope <hi>Adrian.</hi>
               </note> who (<hi>Steven</hi> being dead) was one <hi>Adrian,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to Crown, and confirm the Sons of <hi>Caroloman</hi> for Kings of <hi>France,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Lombard</hi> had two designs. First, by this means to bring the Pope in
disgrace with <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> that he might the easilier suppress him, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of the <hi>French</hi> aides, whereon he chiefly relyed; and Secondly to set
<hi>France</hi> in a flame, by setting up new Kings in it. <hi>Didier</hi> therefore earnestly
besought the Pope to grant this favour to the Sons of <hi>Caroloman</hi> for his sake:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Didiers</hi> Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note>
besought the Pope to grant this favour to the Sons of <hi>Caroloman</hi> for his sake:
But <hi>Adrian</hi> (well acquainted with the <hi>Lombards</hi> humour) was so resolute in
denying his request, as that they fell into open hatred. And <hi>Didier</hi> being
much displeased with this repulse, took Arms, and with his Forces entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Exarchy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He makes War against the Pope.</note> being a <hi>Signory</hi> under the Popes jurisdiction, and besieged
<hi>Ravenna,</hi> the chief City of the <hi>Exarchy:</hi> Whereupon the Pope sent his
Nuncio to him, to expostulate the cause of this so sudden War against his
Subjects; desiring him to restore what he had taken, and not to procced in
this Hostile manner without any reasonable cause, and that upon the pain of
<hi>Excommunication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the same time there fell out a great occasion to encrease the hatred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hunalts</hi> ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> and <hi>Didier:</hi> For that <hi>Hunalt</hi> (who had been before vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and to whom <hi>Charles</hi> had shew'd so much favour) very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully
retired himself to <hi>Didier,</hi> who did not only receive him courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
but honoured him by making him General of his Army which he had
raised against the Pope. And <hi>Didier</hi> suffered himself to be so far abused by the
insinuations, and perswasions of <hi>Hunalt,</hi> touching the means to attempt
something against the Estates of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> that holding <hi>Italy</hi> undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his own, he plotted a War, and assured himself of a certain Victory in
<hi>France.</hi> Thus Ambition and Covetousness hastens mens ruin. The Pope
having no other defence to secure his Estate but his <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which
against <hi>Didier</hi> proved but <hi>Brutum fulmen,</hi> a meer scare-crow, he was forced
to have recourse to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi>

and laboured to have them chosen Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and all to trouble or ruin

            <p>The sollicitation, and request also of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was a great incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103996:145"/>
to induce him to Arm, against him, who professed himself to be an open

               </note> whereof the former Kings of <hi>France</hi> had
shewed themselves <hi>Protectors,</hi> and <hi>Guardians.</hi> But that he might not attempt
any thing rashly, he first sent his Ambassadours to the Pope, to assure him of
his good will, and promising not to be wanting to him in his necessity: Yet
withal, to tell him, that he thought it best, first to use mildness, before he
attempted force against the <hi>Lombard.</hi> He therefore sent also his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
to <hi>Didier</hi> to summon him to restore what he had taken from the Pope,
and to suffer him to live in Peace. <hi>Didier</hi> (who relied much upon his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy)
gave good words to the Ambassadours, promising them to perform all
that <hi>Charles</hi> required, but in effect, he would have the Pope to accept of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Peace from him, and that the Children of <hi>Caroloman</hi> should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Kings of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These demands were judged so unreasonable, that the Treaty was broken,
and the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadours returned home: And <hi>Didier</hi> prosecutes his War

                  <hi>Didier</hi> pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in his Wars.</note> and having spoiled

and <hi>Romandiola,</hi> Towns of the six Governments, or <hi>Hexarchy. Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnes</hi>
Ambassadours, upon their return, inform their Master, that the War
with the <hi>Lombard</hi> could not be avoided: and they found <hi>Charles</hi> in a Posture
fit to invade <hi>Italy:</hi> For he had Levyed a goodly Army to suppress the
rebellious <hi>Saxons,</hi> who (impatient of the <hi>French</hi> yoke) revolted daily
from his Obedience, which Army was now ready to be imployed against
the <hi>Lombard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet was not <hi>Charlemagne</hi> willing to attempt any thing in a matter of such
importance without the advise of his Estates,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> calls a Parliament.</note> and therefore he presently sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
a Parliament, and (being loath to lose time) in the mean season he caused
his Army to march, and to make their <hi>Rendevouz</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> (a Town under his
Obedinece, and in the way to <hi>Italy</hi>) and having divided his Army into two
Parts, he seized upon the Passages of Mount-<hi>Cenis,</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> which are
the two entrances from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Estates at their meeting having found the Causes of War against<note place="margin">Enters <hi>Italy,</hi> and heats <hi>Didier.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Didier,</hi> King of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> to be just, <hi>Charlemagne</hi> caused his Army to
advance with all speed, and to adjoyn near to <hi>Verceil.</hi> There <hi>Didier</hi> attended
him and gave him Battel: But at the first encounter he was vanquished by
<hi>Charlemagne.</hi> After which, the <hi>Lombard</hi> rallying, and re-enforcing his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
fights him again, and was again beaten, and so shattered were his
Troops, that he was enforced to suffer his Enemy to be Master of the Field;
which proved an infallible Harbinger to his total ruin. Thus having tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
trussed up what he could in such haste, he sent his Son <hi>Aldegise</hi> to
<hi>Verona,</hi> with the Widow and Children of <hi>Caroloman:</hi> and cast himself into
<hi>Pavia,</hi> which he had diligently Fortified, as the Fortress, or Dungeon rather
of his last Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> pursues him at the heels,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <hi>Pavia,</hi> and <hi>Verona.</hi>
               </note> and with all his Forces besieged him
in <hi>Pavia,</hi> resolving to have it at what price soever. And to make his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the more manifest, he sent for his Wife and Children into <hi>Italy,</hi> to the
end that the <hi>Italians</hi> (who hitherto were doubtful to whom to adhere)
might know his mind, and without attending any new occurrents, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to obey the Victor.</p>
            <p>Having thus cooped up <hi>Didier</hi> in <hi>Pavia,</hi> and seised upon all the avenues, he
resolved to attempt <hi>Verona</hi> also, which they held to be the strongest place in all
<hi>Lombardy.</hi> So leaving his Uncle <hi>Bernard</hi> to continue the siege of <hi>Pavia,</hi> he
marched with part of his Army to <hi>Verona.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His beginnings being so successful,<note place="margin">The <hi>Italians</hi> submit to him.</note> and this Check given to <hi>Didier,</hi> (who
was now, as it were, shut up in Prison,) gave a great alteration to the affairs
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103996:146"/>
of either party amongst these people of divers humours. The <hi>Spoletines,</hi> and
<hi>Reatines,</hi> and those of <hi>Ancona,</hi> of <hi>Fermo,</hi> and of <hi>Ossino</hi> (striving as it were,
which should be first) yielded to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and detested the wretched, and
forelorn estate of <hi>Didier,</hi> as a worthy reward of his Treachery, Injustice, and
Violence. The <hi>Venetians</hi> (who were <hi>Neuters,</hi> and Spectators of this <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
and had never dealt in any sort with <hi>Didier</hi>) offered amity and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours
to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who desired them to keep the Seas quiet, lest the
Emperour of <hi>Constantinople</hi> should espouse <hi>Didiers</hi> quarrel, and cause any new
disturbance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> staid not long about <hi>Verona</hi> before the City began to think of
yielding: and <hi>Berthe,</hi> the Widow of <hi>Caroloman,</hi> was the chief Instrument
to draw them to a surrender, the <hi>French</hi> Forces being (as she said) very
formidable. <hi>Aldegise,</hi> the Son of <hi>Didier,</hi> seeing the Citizens so unanimous
in their resolutions to open their Gate to the Conquerour, and being unable
to relieve his Father, he secretly stole away, and fled to the Emperour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>

This being about <hi>Eas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er, Charlemagne</hi> took the opportunity to go to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where yet he stayed only eight days to visit the most remarkable places,
and to confer with Pope <hi>Adrian.</hi> The Pope made <hi>Charles</hi> a <hi>Patrician</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which was a step to mount him to the <hi>Empire.</hi> From thence he hasted, and
came to <hi>Pavia,</hi> which had now been besieged for the space of then months:
and being pressed by War without, and by the Famine, and Pestilence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
it at last yielded upon composition: and <hi>Didier</hi> (who had hated <hi>Charles</hi>

               </note> and attempted War rashly) fell into his enemies hands, who yet
shewed himself Prudent in undertaking the War, and mild and modest in his
use of the Victory.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Charlemagne</hi> having begun the War justly, and ended it happily, rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Kingdom of the <hi>Lombards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>

to <hi>Lions,</hi> or to <hi>Leeg;</hi> for Authors agree not of the certain place. This was
<hi>Anno Christi</hi> 776. A notable date to present the <hi>Tragical</hi> end of so great
a Kingdom, which had continued in <hi>Italy</hi> for the space of two hundred
and four years under Princes of divers dispositions. But Pride, Injustice
and Tyranny, had provoked the wrath of God against them, so as whilst they
thought to take from another, they lost their own; To usurp the liberties
of others, they fell into ignominious slavery themselves; and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
proved the occasion, and hastener of their ruin. An excellent Pattern
for Princes and great States not to attempt an unjust and unnecessary War,
nor to usurp upon any other mans right, thinking to prevail over a good cause
by Craft and Policy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> (as was said before) used his Victory with great moderation
towards the conquered Nation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> his moderation.</note> which gave great content to all the <hi>Italians,</hi>
who held it a gain to have lost their old Master, and to be rightly made free
by being subject to so wise a Lord. For he left unto them their ancient
liberties, and to particular Princes (such as were Vassals to <hi>Didier</hi>) their
<hi>Signiories.</hi> To <hi>Aragise,</hi> Son in Law to <hi>Didier,</hi> he left the Marquisat of
<hi>Beneventum.</hi> He placed <hi>French</hi> Governours in conquered <hi>Lombardy,</hi>
whom he ordered to treat these his new Subjects with the like mildness,
as he shewed to those of his antient Patrimony left unto him by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.</p>
            <p>During the siege of <hi>Pavia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Counsel at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> held a Councel at <hi>Rome,</hi> in favour

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103996:146"/>
wherein it was declared, that the right to give all Benefices throughout all
<hi>Christendom</hi> did belong to him.</p>
            <p>No sooner was <hi>Charlemagne</hi> returned into <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">New troubles in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> but <hi>Aldegise</hi> (the Son of
<hi>Didier</hi>) sought to disquiet <hi>Italy,</hi> being assisted by <hi>Constantine,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the practices of <hi>Rogand,</hi> to whom <hi>Charlemagne</hi>
had given <hi>Friul,</hi> who now revolted from his Obedience. But the vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and care of the Governours whom <hi>Charlemagne</hi> had set over his new-conquered Subjects,<note place="margin">But suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> soon put an end to these Rebellions: and <hi>Rogand</hi> being
taken, suffered according to his demerits, being beheaded by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.
Thus <hi>Italy</hi> remaining quiet to him, and his, (as conquered by
a just War) it was afterwards incorporated into the <hi>French,</hi> Monarchy in
his posterity, being given in Partage to the Children of <hi>France,</hi> whilst
the good Government of the <hi>French</hi> Kings maintained the dignity of the
Crown.</p>
            <p>But the end of this War proved the beginning of another in <hi>Germany,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> his Wars with the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
               </note>
whereof the <hi>Saxons</hi> were the chief promoters, drawing other People of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
into their assistance. This War continued the space of thirty yesrs, yet
not without some intermissions: The <hi>Saxons</hi> having still a mind to oppose and
Cross <hi>Charlemagne</hi> in his proceedings, especially when he was busied in other
affairs of great consequence.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Saxons</hi> were subject to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> especially under <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,</hi>
and <hi>Pepin</hi> his Son. The motives of this War were divers: The impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of a People desiring their antient liberty,<note place="margin">The cause of it.</note> and not able to bear subjection
to a forreigner: the hatred and jealousie of a Potent Neighbour, threatning
them with servitude: A controversie about the limits and bounds of their
Lands: But the greatest, and most important cause was, the diversity of
Religion: For the <hi>Saxons</hi> were obstinate in retaining and cleaving to their
<hi>Pagan</hi> superstition, which they had received from their Forefathers, and
<hi>Charlemagne</hi> urged them to forsake their <hi>Paganism,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and to make
open profession of the Christian Faith; being moved with Zeal to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
advancement of the Truth, and the private Duty of a Prince to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to provide for their souls Health. Upon this controversie about
Religion the <hi>Saxons</hi> fought eight times with <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> especially
taking advantage when they found him busied elsewhere, watching their
opportunities either to cross him in his designs, or to frustrate his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.
At such time as he was in <hi>Italy</hi> against <hi>Didier,</hi> they played <hi>Rex,</hi>
not only in rejecting the <hi>French</hi> command, but also in making War against
those Cities in <hi>Germany</hi> which obeyed <hi>Charlemagne.</hi> They had taken <hi>Eresbourg</hi>
from the Crown of <hi>France</hi> even upon his return, and besieged <hi>Sigisbourg,</hi> rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing,
and spoiling all the Country round about.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> (who would never undertake any weighty matter without good
advise) assembled a Parliament at <hi>Wormes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> calls a Parliament,</note> and by their Counsel and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
levied a great Army, to charge the <hi>Saxons</hi> in divers places at
once. This resolution succeeded happily: For having vanquished the
<hi>Saxons</hi> twice in one month in a pitched Field, he soon reduced them
to their ancient obedience: Using his Victories with much modesty and
discretion; desiring rather to shew them the power of his authority, then
the rigour of his Force. The chief amongst the <hi>Saxons</hi> was <hi>Widichind,</hi>
and as Religion was the chief motive of their frequent Rebellions;<note place="margin">The <hi>Saxons</hi> overcome.</note> so <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne,</hi>
seeking the establishment of the Christian Religion in <hi>Saxony</hi> with
great Zeal, after much reluctance, happily effected it. For having vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this <hi>widichind,</hi> by reason and humanity, he brought him to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the Truth; and by his grave and prudent conversation, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him without any Violence,<note place="margin">And conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> to leave and forsake his <hi>Pagan</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
which force of Armes could never have effected in him, nor in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103996:147"/>
the <hi>Saxons. For mens souls are not to be compelled with force of Arms, but with
reason.</hi> And by the means and endeavours of this <hi>widichine,</hi> the greatest part
of the <hi>Saxons</hi> were brought to the knowledg of the true God, and the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the <hi>French</hi> Monarch: And the most obstinate were forced, either to
submit, or to abandon their Country. And indeed great numbers of <hi>Saxons</hi>
retired themselves into divers strange Countrys.</p>
            <p>Thus the War with the <hi>Saxons</hi> was happily ended (which had been
long and dangerous) and the Conquered, by the Truth were the true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours,
by attaining to the knowledg of the true God. <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was
very careful to have them well instructed in the Truth: For which end he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
godly and learned men in all places, and gave them honourable main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
whereby he shewed that his Piety was not inferiour to his Valour,
and happy success; and for a president to Princes to make Religion the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
end of their Arms and Authorities.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Widichine</hi> was very eminent, both for Wisdom, Valour, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in his Country; and from him are descended many famous Families:
as the two <hi>Henries,</hi> the one called the <hi>Fowler,</hi> and the other of <hi>Bamberg;</hi> and
the two <hi>Othos,</hi> all of them Emperours: as also the Dukes of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses
of <hi>Misnia,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the famous race of <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> in
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this War of <hi>Saxony</hi> did spring up many others in the Northern parts,
of which we shall hear afterwards; but because in the <hi>Interim</hi> their fell out
great Wars in <hi>Spain</hi> against the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> which (like a Deluge) threatned
to over-run all <hi>Christendom,</hi> I shall intermit the former, till I have spoken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of this latter, that I may proceed with the more clearness in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of this History.</p>
            <p>The motive of the <hi>Spanish</hi> War,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> his Wars in Spain.</note> was more upon pleasure than necessity:
But Zeal of Religion gave a colour and shew of necessity to the Heroical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who sought to enlarge the limits of the <hi>French</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
by his Arms. But this his <hi>Spanish</hi> War, as it was undertaken upon ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
grounds, so was it more painful, more dangerous, and less successful
then that of <hi>Italy,</hi> whereunto necessity and duty had drawn <hi>Charlemagne;</hi> yet
did his wise and wary proceeding in the action, warrant him from all blame.
The occasions which moved him to bend his Forces against the <hi>Sarazins</hi> in
<hi>Spain</hi> were, the assurance of good success, the quiet and peace of his Realm,
that he might have opportunity to imploy his Souldiery, the hate of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
against the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> and the general fear of all Christians, least these
Caterpillars should creep further into <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the estate of <hi>Spain</hi> at this time. The <hi>Sarazins</hi> had conquered a
great part of it, and were divided under divers Commands which had the
Title of Kingdoms. Yet these divers Kings (being apprehensive of their
common danger) resolved to unite their forces against <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> their
common enemy; and foreseeing the Tempest, they sought to prevent it,
and to cross the designs of <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> For which end, they suborned King
<hi>Idnabala,</hi> a <hi>Sarazin,</hi> being a very subtile, and crafty man, to insinuate himself
into the acquaintance, and familiarity of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> which stratagem pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
more then all their power and forces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was much quickned to this War by <hi>Alphonso,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented.</note> surnamed

of <hi>Spain</hi>) who suggested to him that the War would be easie, profitable,
and honourable, and therefore most worthy the Valour, and Fortune of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne.</hi>
This <hi>Idnabala</hi> also (under a shew of friendship) laboured to hasten
him to the execution of this enterprise, from which he knew well he could
not divert him, that he might the better betray him by discovering his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
to the <hi>Sarazins.</hi>

               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> being well-affected of himself,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> calls a Parliament.</note> and thus excited by others,
assembled a Parliament at <hi>Noyon,</hi> and there concluded a War against the
<hi>Sarazins</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> The Army which he employed in this action was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great, both for number of men, and Valour of Commanders, and Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
being the most choice and Worthy Captains in all <hi>Christendome:</hi>
amongst whom,<note place="margin">His great preparations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> these were of the chiefest note, <hi>Milon</hi> Earl of <hi>Angers:
Rowland</hi> the Son of <hi>Milon,</hi> and <hi>Berthe,</hi> Sister to <hi>Charlemagne, Renald</hi> of
<hi>Montaubon.</hi> The four Sons of <hi>Aymon: Oger</hi> the <hi>Dane: Oliver</hi> Earl of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva:
Arnold of Belland: Brabin,</hi> and many others. The Valour of which
Persons, hath been fabulously related by the Writers of those dark times
(who for the most part were <hi>Friars,</hi> concerning whom the Proverb was,
<hi>A Friar, a Lyar</hi>) with the addition of a thousand ridiculous tales, so that
the truth is hardly picked out from the midst of so much errour: Yet,
what is most probable, and can be gathered out of the most authentick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
shall here be set down. They say that <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> to make this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
more honourable in shew, did at this time institute the <hi>Order of
the twelve Peers of</hi> France.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> being entred into <hi>Spain</hi> with his brave Army,<note place="margin">His entry into Spain.</note> found no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for them whereon to exercise their Valour: For the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to make a defensive, rather than an offensive War, had withdrawn
themselves into their Cities, which they had fortified strongly, The most
renowned of the <hi>Sarazin</hi> Kings at this time, were <hi>Aigoland, Bellingan, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nises,
Marsile,</hi> and <hi>Idnabala:</hi> But this last, as was said before, made shew of
much Friendship to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and of open hatred against the other <hi>Sarazin</hi>
Kings; with whom notwithstanding he held secret and strict intelligence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
<hi>Charlemagne</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>The first City that the <hi>French</hi> attempted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pampelune</hi> taken.</note> was <hi>Pampelune,</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Navarr,</hi> the which they took by force, but with much pains, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and loss. Having sackt this City, and put all the <hi>Sarazins</hi> in it to
the Sword, they marched to <hi>Saragoce,</hi> which yielded to them upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
as did also many other small Towns, being terrified with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Pampelune.</hi> This prosperous beginning encouraged <hi>Charlemagne</hi>
to advance forward, relying on his wonted Fortune, and good success:
But as he passed through the Provinces of <hi>Spain,</hi> like a Victorious Prince,
without any opposition, he divided his Army, and gave part of it to be
conducted by <hi>Milon</hi> of <hi>Angers,</hi> his Brother in Law, who in his march near
unto <hi>Bayon,</hi> was set upon by <hi>Aigoland,</hi> the <hi>Sarazin</hi> King, who in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
danger had thrust an Army into the Field,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Milon</hi> defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and now assaulted <hi>Milon,</hi> and
his Troops, little expecting any Enemy, and took him at such an advantage,
as he defeated him.</p>
            <p>This loss was very great; For Writers say, that forty thousand of the <hi>French</hi>
here lost their lives; <hi>Milon</hi> himself being also slain, for a confirmation of
the <hi>Sarazins</hi> Victory. <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was at this time afar off, and so not
able by any diligence to prevent the loss. Yet he suppressed his grief
and trouble, least he should discourage the whole Army: and so hastening
thitherward, he gathered up the remainder of those broken, and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Troops, withall, keeping the conquered Cities, and such as
were Friends, in their due Obedience: But after this, there fell out another
accident.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aigoland</hi> being puffed up with Pride through his late Victory,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aigoland</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </note> marched
with his Army into <hi>Gascoine,</hi> and besieged <hi>Agen,</hi> to divert <hi>Charlemagne</hi>
from his pursuit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns.</note> and to draw him home to defend his own Country. So
as <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> fearing least his own absence, and the <hi>Sarazins</hi> late Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
should cause any alteration in the minds of them of <hi>Guienne,</hi> being
then Subjects of whom he had no great assurance, he returned into <hi>France.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103996:148"/>
Aigoland</hi> had now continued some moneths at the siege of <hi>Agen,</hi> yet had
prevailed little, but only in over-running the Country, which he did free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(without any considerable resistance) even unto <hi>Xaintonge;</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men
in the mean time retiring into the Walled Towns, expected the
return of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> their King: <hi>Aigolands</hi> Army was very great, and
puffed up with the remembrance of their late Victory: So as <hi>Charlemagne</hi>
returning with his Forces from <hi>Spain</hi> well tired, he maintained his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
more through his authority, than by present force; yet did he give
life to the courage of his Subjects with his presence, and bridled the proud
<hi>Sarazin,</hi> who could not be ignorant with whom he had to deal, nor where
he was, being environed with the enemies on all sides, and in an enemies
Country.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Aigoland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aigoland's</hi> Policy.</note> pretending an inclination to Peace, gave <hi>Charlemagne</hi>
to understand that he had been the first Invader, and that his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into <hi>France</hi> was only to draw his Enemy out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to cause
him to leave to the <hi>Sarazins</hi> their conquered Countries free: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(said he) the Treaty of an accord is easie, seeing all the question
is only to leave to every man his own, and to suffer him to enjoy it quietly,
the World being wide enough for us all. But to the end this Treaty
might take good effect, after many messages to and fro, they resolve to
come to a Parlee: and upon <hi>Charlemagne</hi>'s Faith given, <hi>Aigoland</hi> came to
his Camp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> either really moved with a zeal for Religion, or at least, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it the colour of his Actions, gave the <hi>Sarazin</hi> to understand, that he
should have his Friendship if he would leave his <hi>Pagan</hi> Superstition, be
Baptized, and make open profession of Christianity. The <hi>Sarazin,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had a goodly Army, yet not willing to hazard any thing, and
content with his former revenge upon <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> desired nothing more
than to return quietly into <hi>Spain.</hi> And being now in the midst of his
Enemies Camp, to maintain his reputation, he made no shew at all of
fear, but talking to his own advantage (as if no Force, but only reason
should move him) he entred into a serious and cunning discourse with
<hi>Charlemagne,</hi> shewing, That unnecessary Wars were the ruin of Mankind, and
that he was grieved to see so much Blood spilt: That he had not begun, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
being urged by necessity to defend himself and his Countrey against the
Forces of <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> That he was not yet so dejected, nor his Forces so
weak as to refuse the Battel: But for that it would be an infinite loss to
hazard the lives of so many men, he desired rather to make tryal of the
right by some Troops, and they that vanquished, should be deemed to
have the right, and true Religion on their side: Protesting to yield to that
Religion, which should appear to be the best upon this tryal. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
and condition was accepted by <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> The combate was fought,
the proof made, and the Christian Troop vanquished that of the <hi>Sarazin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Aigoland</hi> protest openly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aigolands</hi> dissimulation.</note> that he would become a Christian,
but in heart he had no such meaning, and therefore took this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to fly from his promise. He gives <hi>Charlemagne</hi> a visit, and finds
him at the Table, well accompanied with his chief followers, (for then
it was the custome of Kings not to sit and eat alone) but, casting his eye
aside, he saw twelve poor men, ill apparelled, sitting upon the ground,
near to the Table of the Noblemen, and demanded what those poor, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
creatures were, which did there feed apart? One answered, <hi>That
they were the servants of God:</hi> He then replied, <hi>Surely your God is of small
account, whose servants are so miserable and contemptible:</hi> And thereupon
takes an occasion to retire himself, having lost nothing, but made great
advantage by this Treaty: Having hereby qualified the force of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne,</hi>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:103996:148"/>
viewed his Army, made shew of his own courage and dexterity, and
all without an Ambassadour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> on the other side,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> seeing himself thus deluded and affronted,
was resolved to take revenge for so notable a loss of men, and so bold an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the <hi>Sarazin,</hi> so that with all speed he raised an Army of a hundred
and thirty thousand men, and being thus fraught with Choler and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he returned into <hi>Spain.</hi> His first entry was prosperous: For in the
encounter he defeated <hi>Aigolands</hi> Army near to <hi>Pampelune,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aigoland</hi> overthrown and slain.</note> and for a Seal of
his Victory, he carried away the head of <hi>Aigoland</hi> his Enemy, who was
slain by the hand of <hi>Arnold</hi> of <hi>Belange,</hi> a Noble and Valiant Knight: But
the sequel was not answerable to the beginning: For notwithstanding the
overthrow of the <hi>Sarazin</hi> Troops, all the rest in <hi>Spain</hi> were not vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
where there were more Kings, and more men of War, who kept cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with <hi>Amurath</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which place was their Nursery
and Store-house.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marsile</hi> and <hi>Belingand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Sarazins</hi> rally.</note> two Brethren, were the chief of thè remainder
of the <hi>Sarazin</hi> Army, wherein there was a great <hi>Babylonian</hi> Gyant, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Ferragat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Gyant slain.</note> of an exceeding stature, him did <hi>Rowland</hi> slay, who was Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
to <hi>Charlemagne;</hi> after which, the <hi>Sarazins</hi> gathered together the
relicts of their broken Troops, and made a shew of resolute men, vowing
to sell their lives at a dear rate to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> being favoured by many
great and good Towns in the Countrey. <hi>Charlemagne</hi> makes a sudden
stop, and pursues not his Victory, God reserving to himself a Sovereign
power over all mens designes, yea, over the greatest, and in matters of
greatest consequence, to the end that all may learn to ask Counsel and
success of him, and it was his will and pleasure that the <hi>French</hi> Forces should
not conquer and possess <hi>Spain,</hi> the which he had reserved as a portion for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Nation.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Charles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Treaty of Peace.</note> who should have prosecuted his late Victory vigorously,
grew remiss, which encouraged <hi>Idnabala</hi> the <hi>Sarazin</hi> (who had free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
into the Camp) to make a motion of Peace. He was a good Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of his own Companions minds, what shew soever he made of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of himself. <hi>Charlemagne</hi> (finding by his late experience, that the event
of War is uncertain and doubtful, and that this War tended to the loss
of his Subjects, who imployed both their lives and goods for the purchase
of an uncertain Victory, and seeing himself overburdened with great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in his other Estates, to the preservation whereof, reason did summon
him rather than to seek for new) he seemed not unwilling to hearken
to the motion of <hi>Idnabala,</hi> who assured him, that he found the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins</hi>
affairs to be so desperate, that they would be glad to embrace his
friendship at whatsoever rate they purchased it. The Treaty hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
began, and the chief Article was propounded, which was, that
they should embrace the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, and this <hi>Charlemagne</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to urge with great vehemency: but finding the <hi>Sarazins</hi> obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in their refusal, he was content to grant them peace, paying him
some great sums of money, as a token that they had been vanquished by
him.</p>
            <p>And accordingly he sent a Noble man of his Court,<note place="margin">A Traytor.</note> named <hi>Ganes,</hi> to
treat with them, who (being by bribes corrupted by <hi>Marsile</hi> and <hi>Belin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gand</hi>)
undertook so to order businesses, that <hi>Charlemagne</hi> should return
into <hi>France,</hi> and by the way, should receive a notable disgrace: yet they
seemed to make such a composition and agreement, which in shew, was
very honourable for <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> to whom they promised to pay (as
an Homage, and acknowledgment for the Peace he should grant them)
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:103996:149"/>
what sums of money he would appoint, and that thereupon he should retire
with his Army into <hi>France;</hi> yet leaving such Forces in <hi>Spain</hi> as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to see the condition which should be agreed upon, performed. But <hi>Ganes</hi>
had discovered to them, that <hi>Charlemagne</hi> upon other accounts was necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to return, and therefore desired to leave the smallest Forces that he
could in <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Agreement being thus concluded,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> departed with his
Army, attending a better opportunity to effect what he had designed:
and he left his Nephew <hi>Rowland</hi> only with twenty thousand men, to see
the conditions performed. And to make his passage into <hi>France</hi> the more
easie, he commanded him to lodge in a place of advantage in the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi>
mountains, called <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cevaux:</hi> and so the <hi>French</hi> Army marched back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to <hi>France,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who little dreamed
of such an affront as he shortly after met with.</p>
            <p>Whilst the <hi>French</hi> Army were upon their retreat, <hi>Marsile</hi> and <hi>Bellin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gand</hi>
slept not, but gathering together all the Forces they could, they lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them secretly in the hollow Caves of those Mountains, being places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible,
and wholly unknown but only to the Inhabitants of those
Countries. They had intelligence given them by <hi>Ganes,</hi> what number
of men <hi>Charlemagne</hi> had left in <hi>Spain,</hi> under the command of <hi>Rowland,</hi> to
whom the reputation of his Uncle, and the good will of the People of
<hi>Spain</hi> in the chiefest Towns, was of more use than his twenty thousand
men, although they were the choice of all the Army. <hi>Rowland</hi> had no
fear of an Enemy,<note place="margin">Rowland assaulted.</note> whenas returning to his Garrison, he was suddenly set
upon by the <hi>Sarazins,</hi> who were far more in number than the <hi>French,</hi> who
seeing themselves thus treacherously assaulted, and compassed in, defended
themselves valiantly against those miscreants: But still fresh Troops of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razins</hi>
issued forth of these Caves, on every side, in so great numbers,
as that in the end, the <hi>French</hi> (tired and spent in so long and painful a conflict)
were oppressed by the multitudes, rather than overcome by the Valour of
their Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rowland</hi> in so great and extream a danger (gathering together the pieces
of his shipwrack) performed both the Duty of a good Commander,<note place="margin">His Valour.</note> and
of a valiant and resolute Souldier, fighting gallantly, and having beaten
down a great number where the Enemies were thickest, he at length
came where King <hi>Marsile</hi> was, whom he slew with his own hands. But
<hi>Belingand,</hi> holding the Victory absolutely his own, pursued the <hi>French</hi>
with great violence; insomuch as <hi>Rowland</hi> (not able to hold out any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)
retired himself apart;<note place="margin">His Death.</note> and finding his Death approaching, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to break his good Sword <hi>Durandall,</hi> but his strength failing
him, he died of Thirst, through so long and difficult a combate in that
hot Country: and with him died <hi>Oliver, Oger</hi> the <hi>Dane, Renald</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taubon,

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> made a Tomb for his Nephew <hi>Rowland,</hi> and honoured the
memory of those other worthy Warriers (who died in the Bed of Honour)
with Monuments: after which he was necessitated to undertake divers other
Wars, both in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> in all which it pleased God to give him
better success.<note place="margin">A Rebellion in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Italy</hi> (during <hi>Charles</hi> his troubles in <hi>Spain</hi>) had rebelled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
provoked thereto by <hi>Adalgise</hi> Duke of <hi>Beneventum,</hi> who endeavoured
to repossess the Race of <hi>Didier:</hi> but that attempt was soon suppressed by
<hi>Charlemagne,</hi> to the cost of the <hi>Lombard</hi> Rebells: Yet shortly after ensued
another War in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like occasion also bred a War in <hi>Bavaria:</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Wars in <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
               </note> For the King <hi>Tassillon,</hi> who
was Son in Law to <hi>Didier</hi> King of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> (being eagerly pressed by his
Wife, and wonderfully discontented with <hi>Charlemagne</hi>) shaked off the yoke
of subjection, and betook himself to Arms: But <hi>Charlemagne</hi> surprized
him with such celerity, that <hi>Tassillon</hi> was forced to sue for Peace; which
<hi>Charlemagne</hi> granted upon condition of his subjection and loyalty: But
again <hi>Tassillon,</hi> not able to contain himself, raised a new War in another
place, as when we stop one breach, it finds vent by another. He stirred
up the <hi>Huns</hi> and <hi>Avars</hi> (a neighbouring People to <hi>Austria,</hi> which was
one of the Estates of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy) against <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who yet
suppressed them with happy success; and <hi>Tassillon</hi> himself being again van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
by <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and found guilty of Rebellion and Treason, was
condemned to lose his Estate, according to the <hi>Salique</hi> Law: and with him,
the Kingdom of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ended, being now wholly incorporated into the
Crown of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Huns</hi> and <hi>Avars</hi> (of whose names joyned together, the word <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi>

the yoke of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy. They had formerly attempted by
War to disquiet the Country of <hi>Austria,</hi> whom <hi>Charlemagne</hi> had at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times opposed by his Forces, so that the War, at times, had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the space of eight years,<note place="margin">His Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> and the final issue was, that all the
Countrey obeyed him: The <hi>Danes</hi> also, the <hi>Sorabes,</hi> and <hi>Abrodites,</hi> and
the <hi>Westphalians,</hi> (who had all joyned in this War of <hi>Hungary</hi>) were also
brought under the obedience of <hi>Charlemagne.</hi> The limits of the Northern
Kingdom, called <hi>Austrasia,</hi> were so enlarged, that it was divided into two
Kingdoms, and the Realm of <hi>Austria</hi> which joyns upon <hi>France,</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Westriech,</hi> that is to say, the Realm of the West; and that which is
towards <hi>Danubius,</hi> was called <hi>Ostriech,</hi> that is, the Kingdom of the East,
<hi>Austria</hi> being then of a greater command than at this day. For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
all <hi>Hungary, Valachia, Bohemia, Transylvania, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Poland:</hi>
Then was the <hi>French Monarchy</hi> of a vast extent. But all these Nations
have since, either returned to their first beginning, or new Lords have sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
upon them.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy was greatly enlarged by the Prowess and<note place="margin">His education of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note>
Valour of <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> and his children were grown up, as in age, so in
knowledge and experience, through the careful education which their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Father gave them; who framed them to the management of affairs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
them to provide, that they might first succeed him in his Virtues,
and afterwards in his Kingdoms. But man purposeth, and God disposeth,
<hi>France, Italy, Germany, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> made the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the
West, and <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> being Master of these goodly Provinces, was in effect
an Emperour, but only wanted the Title, and the solemn Declaration of this

dignity. And shortly after, the Providence of God that gave him the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
ministred opportunity to him for the enjoyment of the latter, which
came thus to pass.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leo</hi> was at this time <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>

and bruised his face with their fists, and having dragged him ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously
through the dirt, they cast him into Prison, where yet he stayed
not long, being freed by a Groom of his chamber called <hi>Albin:</hi> and so having
recovered St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, he sent to <hi>Vingise</hi> Duke of <hi>Spoleto,</hi> intreating
him to deliver him from this miserable Captivity.<note place="margin">The Pope freed out of Prison. Flies to <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Vingise</hi> failed him
not, but came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and carried the Pope along with him to <hi>Spoleto;</hi>
where yet he stayed not long, but from thence went to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France,</hi> whom he found full of troubles. He complained that many of
the <hi>Romans</hi> sought to usurp his Power into their hands, and advised the
King to exact an Oath of Fidelity of them. <hi>Paschalis</hi> was there soon after
him, and accused the Pope of Adultery, and other gross crimes. <hi>Charlemagne</hi>
dismissed them both, and promised to be at <hi>Rome</hi> within a few months,
and accordingly prepared for his Journey.</p>

all shews of Honour, and within eight dayes he went into St. <hi>Peters</hi>

had any thing to say against Pope <hi>Leo? Paschalis,</hi> or <hi>Paschasires,</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus</hi>
had published the Popes crimes by Writ: but knowing how <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne</hi>
stood affected towards both parties, they appeared not; so none
prosecuting these crimes against him, the Pope was absolved upon his
Oath; wherein he swore by God and the four Evangelists,<note place="margin">Clears the Pope upon his Oath.</note> that all these
things were false which they layed to his charge: Whereupon the King
declared him innocent, and condemned his accusers, and within few dayes
three hundred of them were beheaded in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Field for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and affectation of liberty, on the eighteenth of <hi>December;</hi> and
shortly after, <hi>Charles</hi> was chosen Emperour: But before I speak of that, I must
represent you with a brief view of the present estate and condition of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The seat of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,<note place="margin">The State of the Eastern Empire.</note> since the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great,
remained at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a City of <hi>Thrace,</hi> situated in a convenient place
for the Guard of the Eastern Provinces: After which, all the West being
full of new Guests, who had expelled the <hi>Romans,</hi> the name, authority and
power of the Empire remained in the East, where now the State was in a
strange confusion, the Mother being banded against her Son, and the People
amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantine</hi> the Son of <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth, was Emperour at this time,
who from his Infancy was governed (together with the Empire) by his
Mother <hi>Irene:</hi> But being now come to the age of twenty years, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
the Government into his own hands.<note place="margin">Contention about Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> There was then a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
in the East, which had been continued from Father to Son for
fourscore years together, about bringing Images into the Churches. The
Bishops would needs bring them in: But the Emperours, together with
the greatest part of the People, opposed themselves against them. This
contention had its beginning under <hi>Philip Bardanes,</hi> was continued under
<hi>Leo Isaurus,</hi> and from him was derived to his Son <hi>Constantine,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronimus,</hi>
and to <hi>Leo</hi> the Fourth, Son to the said <hi>Constantine.</hi> This filled all
the East with infinite scandals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:103996:150"/>
The same fire of contention continued in the minority of our <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
who was yet governed by his Mother, a Woman of a violent spirit,
who had undertaken the protection of Images,<note place="margin">A Counsel from them.</note> and held a Counsel of many
Bishops for the defence thereof: But the people growing into a mutiny, by
force expelled them from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where there Assemhly was held.
But <hi>Irene,</hi> being resolved to carry on her design, assembled another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
at <hi>Nicea,</hi> City of <hi>Bithinia,</hi> honoured for having entertained the first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councel under <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, the first of that name: where it
was Decreed, that Images should be placed in Churches for devotion. But
<hi>Charlemagne</hi> did not allow of this Decree,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Images.</note> and either himself, or some other
by his Command, did write a small Treatise against this Councel, the which
bears this Title, A <hi>Treatise of</hi> Charlemagne, <hi>touching Images, against the</hi> Greek
<hi>Synode.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This crafty Woman made choise of the City of <hi>Nicea,</hi> that the name of
the ancient first Council held there, might honour this new invention
with the pretext of Antiquity: For there are some that confound the
first Council of <hi>Nicea</hi> with the second, and <hi>Constantine</hi> the fourth with the
first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantine</hi> continued in the hereditary hatred of his Father, and
Grandfather against Images, so as being of age, and in absolute possession of
his Empire, he disannulled all these new decrees, and caused the Images
to be beaten down in all places: Yet did he make all shews of respect
to his Mother, yielding unto her a good part of his authority and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
which respect was the cause of an horrible <hi>Tragedy.</hi> For this
Woman being transported for two causes (both by reason of her new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and for despight that she had not the whole Government in her
own power) grew so unnatural, that she resolved to dispossess her Son of
the Empire, and to seize upon it herself: And indeed the authority which
her Son had left her, and the free access which she had unto his Person,
gave her opportunity for the execution of her design. For having cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
such as had the chief Forces of the Empire at their command,<note place="margin">An unnatural Mother.</note> and won
them to her with her Sons Treasure, she seized on his Person, put out his eyes,
and sent him into Exile (where, shortly after, he died of grief) and took possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Empire.</p>
            <p>These unnatural and <hi>Tragick</hi> furies were practised in the East, whiles
that <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> by his great Valour built an Empire in the West.
<hi>Irene,</hi> in her Son <hi>Constantines</hi> life time would have married him with the
eldest Daughter of <hi>Charlemagne:</hi> but this accident crossed that design.</p>
            <p>After the Death of <hi>Constantine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Irene</hi> trears with <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Irene</hi> sent to <hi>Charlemagne</hi> to excuse her
self of the murther, disavowing it, and laying the blame upon such as had
done it (as she pretended) without her command. And to win the
good liking of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> she caused him to be dealt withall about mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
(for at that time <hi>Festrude</hi> was dead) with promise to consent that he
should be declared <hi>Emperour</hi> of the West, and that she also would resign
unto him the Empire of the East: But <hi>Charlemagne</hi> would not accept of
her profers.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Irene</hi> hated and deposed.</note> The Nobility and People of the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire did so hate
<hi>Irene,</hi> as having suffered her the space of three years, in the end, they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to dispossess her.</p>
            <p>This Woman, the unnatural murtheress of her own Child, being thus
publickly hated and detested,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nicephorus</hi> succeeds her.</note> 
               <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> a great and Noble man of <hi>Greece,</hi>
assisted by the chiefest in the Court, and with the good liking, and consent
of the People, seized upon the Empire, and took <hi>Irene,</hi> whom yet he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
banished, to give her opportunity and means to live better than she had
done: And afterward he treated, and agreed with <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:103996:151"/>
of the East continuing under his command, the other of the West should
remain to <hi>Charles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Transaction of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He treats with <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </note> and the consent of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Empire was ratified and confirmed to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and now
began the Division of the Empire into the East and West. That of the West
began in <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and continued in his Posterity, whilest they were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritors
of their Fathers virtues: But afterwards it was translated to the
Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who yet acknowledg <hi>Charlemagne</hi> to have risen from
a <hi>German</hi> stock, being born at <hi>Wormes,</hi> Crowned at <hi>Spire,</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at <hi>Aix,</hi> all Cities of <hi>Germany.</hi> Hitherto we have represented, what
<hi>Charlemagne</hi> did whilest he was King of <hi>France</hi> only: Now we are
come to consider what hapned to him, worthy of Memory, whilst he
was <hi>Emperour.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>The deeds of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> after he came to the Empire.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Romanists</hi> do boast that the Pope gave the Empire of the West unto
<hi>Charlemagne:</hi> But the truth is, the Popes had not yet come to that hight as
to pretend to a power of disposing of Empires and Kingdoms at their own
pleasure: But the right of <hi>Charles</hi> came another way. For before he came
to <hi>Rome Anno Christi</hi> 800. he had all <hi>France</hi> under his Government, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with <hi>Franconia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</note> and <hi>Austrasia;</hi> He had subdued a great part of <hi>Spain</hi>
unto the River <hi>Iberus,</hi> from the <hi>Sarazins:</hi> As also <hi>Saxony, westphalia, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
Hungary, Istria, Dalmatia.</hi> He had likewise subdued all <hi>Italy,</hi> except
<hi>Magna Graecia,</hi> and therefore he was entitled, <hi>Charles</hi> by the Grace of God
King of the <hi>Frenches,</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and <hi>Patricius</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi>
So he stiles himself in his Epistle to <hi>Alcwin:</hi> and <hi>Alcwin</hi> in an Epistle to
him, stiles him, The Glorious Emperour [<hi>Gallicarum</hi>] of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Rector
&amp; Defensor Ecclesiae:</hi> Both which Epistles are in the second Part of <hi>Alc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi>
Works. His Coronation was by the Decree and Prayers of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
People. <hi>Sigisbert</hi> in his <hi>Chronicon,</hi> shews the time, and cause, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
The <hi>Romanes,</hi> who in heart were long before faln from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of <hi>Constantinople:</hi> Taking the opportunity that <hi>Irene</hi> had picked out
the eyes of her own Son the Emperour, with one General consent they
resolved to proclaim King <hi>Charles</hi> for their Emperour, and to Crown him
by the hands of the Pope:<note place="margin">His Title to the Empire.</note> So on <hi>Decemb. 25. Anno Christi</hi> 800. they
Crowned him by the hands of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> as the Emperours were wont
to be Crowned by the Bishops of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and the People cryed
thrice, <hi>Carolo Augusto, à Deo Coronato, Magno &amp; Pacifico Imperatori, Vita &amp;
Victoria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Naucler.</note> And the Pope anointed him: As also his Son <hi>Pepin,</hi> whom <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne,</hi>
by a solemn Decree had made King of <hi>Italy.</hi> And the Pope knowing
the dangers which had oft befaln himself and his Predecessors, intreated the
Emperour that he would be <hi>Protector</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> the King of <hi>France,</hi> was advanced to the Empire,
partly by Inheritance, partly by the Sword, by dedition, and the Title
was given him by the People, and the Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet nothing was
proper to the Bishop, but the Coronation and other Ceremonies, which
he performed in the name of the People, according to the custom at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>
At the same time also it was agreed,<note place="margin">An Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> and the Pope.</note> that all the chief men of the
City, as well <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> as <hi>Secular,</hi> should give their Oath of Fidelity
unto the Emperour. Secondly, That the Emperours <hi>Missus</hi> should reside
in the Pallace of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to decide Pleas amongst the People: and that
there should be allotted for his maintenance, a part of the former Emperours
Patrimony. Thirdly, That if any mans cause was perverted by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Judges, and the wronged Person should implore the aid of the <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:103996:151"/>
or Emperours Commissioner, for Justice; and the <hi>Missus</hi> should adjure
the Judges, saying, <hi>By the Faith you owe unto my Lord the Emperour, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
you to do this man Justice:</hi> Then none should dare to decline, either to the
right hand or to the left, although the wrong were done by any of the Popes
Kinsmen. Fourthly, That the Mulcts which should be imposed upon any
guilty person, should be equally divided between the Emperours <hi>Missus,</hi> and
the Popes <hi>Missus.</hi> Fifthly, That if any goods fell under <hi>Escheat,</hi> they should
appertain to the Church, without an express gift of the Emperour. <hi>Continu.
Eutrop. Catal. Test. Verit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet all this right was not sufficient for <hi>Charlemagne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied.</note> nor did he enjoy
the Empire without contradiction. For he was forced to overcome the envy
of this assumed Title with great sums of money; Especially the Emperour
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> envyed it: but <hi>Charlemagne</hi> by his magnanimity prevailed
against their contumacy, wherein he excelled the <hi>Greeks:</hi> and he sent many
Ambassadours unto them: especially unto <hi>Irene,</hi> not only to treat for Peace, but
about her marriage, that thereby he might the better confirm his Title: But
before his Ambassadours came the second time to <hi>Constantinople (Irene</hi> being
sick) the People had Crowned <hi>Nicephorus</hi> on the first of <hi>November Anno
Christi</hi> 802.</p>
            <p>Yet did <hi>Nicephorus</hi> renew the League with <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> which <hi>Irene</hi> had
before made with him: but (<hi>as Sigonius</hi> saith) with express condition, that
<hi>Venice</hi> should be free betwixt the two Empires. In the mean time <hi>Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
was molested by the <hi>Sarazins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zonas.</note> and was forced to agree with them upon
hard conditions: He was also molested by the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> over whom he
obtained one great Victory; but when he refused all conditions of Peace,
they assembled together again to fight for their Lives and Land, in which
Battel they overthrew,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nicephorus</hi> is slain.</note> and killed <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> and his Son <hi>Stauracius</hi> was
wounded in the fight, and fled to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he was afterward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Emperour. But after three Months <hi>Michael Rangabis,</hi> his Brother in
Law, shut him up in a Monastery. Then were mutual Ambassadours
sent between the two Emperours, and a perpetual Peace was concluded
betwixt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was Crowned Emperour in the thirty third year of his
Raign, upon the the 25th of <hi>December,</hi> and in the fifty eighth year of his
Age. He fought many Battels and was always victorious. He had (as
was said before) Wars with the Heathenish <hi>Saxons,</hi> which, by times, lasted
thirty years:<note place="margin">The <hi>Saxons</hi> oft rebell.</note> He oft-times overcame them, and granted them liberty, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition that they would imbrace the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith; but upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
opportunity their Duke <hi>Wedekin,</hi> shaken off both Loyalty, and <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
At several times when <hi>Charlemagne</hi> had obtained a Victory, his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
was to erect a new Bishoprick:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> his Prudence. <hi>Crantz. in Saxon.</hi> Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks erected.</note> So that he erected seven Bishopricks
in that province, to which he annexed Princely Power, knowing well, that
such fierce People might sooner be tamed by Religion then by Armes. The
places where these were erected, were, <hi>Breme, Verda, Minda, Paterborne,
Osnabourg, Hildesem,</hi> and <hi>Halberstad.</hi> But though he gave the Bishops
power of Governing, yet the Nobles did not altogether loose the power
of administring in Publick affairs. At last, because the <hi>Saxons</hi> revolted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
he removed ten thousand of them, with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
into <hi>Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and sent some <hi>French</hi> to inhabit their
rooms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> lived fifteen years after that he had united the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy; yet not without many troubles. For <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moald,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Beneventum</hi> sought to disturb <hi>Italy</hi> in the behalf of the
<hi>Lombards:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Troubles is <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> but <hi>Charles</hi> prevented it betimes, imploying against him his
Son <hi>Pepin,</hi> a worthy and valiant Prince: and <hi>Grimoald</hi> being vanquished,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:103996:152"/>
was entreated with all mildness, and being restored to his Estate, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
afterwards a very affectionate, and obedient Servant to <hi>Charlemagne,</hi>
who was a prudent Conquerour, that knew as well how to use, as how to get
a Victory.</p>
            <p>After this it followed,<note place="margin">War with the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
               </note> that for some attempts made by the <hi>Venetians</hi>
against the Empire of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> in the behalf of the Emperour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople:</hi>
or (as others say) upon the false information of <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
of <hi>Grado,</hi> that <hi>Charlemagne</hi> commanded his Son <hi>Pepin,</hi> King of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
to make Wars against them: which he acordingly began with great
resolution, and took the Cities and Fortresses which the <hi>Venetians</hi> held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the main land, and at length besieged the City of <hi>Venice</hi> it self, both by
Sea and by Land, to the relief whereof the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour sent a Fleet:
about which Authors agree not; for some say that <hi>Pepin</hi> wholly took
<hi>Venice:</hi> Others say, that he only took some Islands thereof, and that the
place wich is called <hi>Rioalte</hi> defended it self: How ever it was, this War con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
long, <hi>Obeliers,</hi> and <hi>Becur,</hi> two great Personages, being the chief
Commanders for the <hi>Venetians.</hi> At last Peace was concluded betwix them,
and the <hi>Venetians</hi> had liberty to live after their own Laws and customs, and
the <hi>Venetians</hi> won great reputation for being able to defend themselves against
so potent and victorious an Enemy. <hi>Charlemagne</hi> would have the Country
which he had conquered from the <hi>Lombards,</hi> to be called <hi>Lombardy,</hi> that by
retaining their Name, he might somewhat sweeten their servile condition,
in the ruin of their estate.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Charlemagne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> makes his Will.</note> finding himself old and broken, and his Children
Valiant, Wise, and Obedient, he resolved to make his last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
wherein he divided his Kingdoms between his three legitimate Sons,
to wit, <hi>Charles</hi> his Eldest, <hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Lewis:</hi> In which he made his eldest
Son <hi>Charles</hi> King of the greatest, and best parts of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> To
<hi>Pepin</hi> he gave the Kingdom of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with some other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And to <hi>Lewis</hi> he bequeathed <hi>Provence,</hi> and that part of <hi>France</hi> which
bordereth upon <hi>Spain,</hi> together with some other Provinces. But all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
after another manner than he attended, God the Soveraign dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
of Kingdoms, having decreed otherwise to dispose thereof. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
also to reduce all his Kingdoms under one Law, making choise of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws above all others, both for the dignity of the Empire, and
because they seemed to him, to be most just and equal: But the <hi>French,</hi>
being loath to alter any thing in their customary Laws,<note place="margin">He gives Laws to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> desired, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him that they might be governed by the same: So as <hi>Gaul, Narbonne,</hi>
(which comprehends <hi>Daulphine, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Provence</hi>) do use the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Laws (as the ancient Provinces of the <hi>Romans</hi>) and the rest of <hi>France</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their customary Laws.</p>
            <p>It afterwards happened that a great Fleet of Infidels which inhabited
<hi>Spain,</hi> with the aid, and assistance of some <hi>Africans,</hi> invaded the Isles of
<hi>Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Corsica</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, for the defence whereof, the
Emperour <hi>Charlemagne</hi> sent commandment to his Son <hi>Pepin</hi> that he should
send thither against them a valiant Captain whose name was <hi>Bucaredus,</hi>
who took so good order as that he drove those Infidels out of those Islands,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Infidels</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note>
and slew five thousand of them in one Battel. And with no less good
success, the Emperour undertook another War against the Dukes of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians,</hi>
and <hi>Polanders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</hi>
               </note> which is a part of the ancient <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> who infest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Countries under his Dominions, against whom he sent his Son <hi>Charles</hi>
with great Forces of <hi>Burgonians, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Germans:</hi> And this young <hi>Charles,</hi>
imitating his Father, Warred valiantly, and with discretion against them,
and coming first to a Battel with the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> led by <hi>Leo</hi> their Duke,
he overcame them, as he did also at other times, and at last he slew <hi>Leo</hi>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:103996:152"/>
their Duke; the like success he had also against the <hi>Polanders,</hi> so as at length
they all became his Fathers Subjects. And for these Victories of <hi>Charlemagne</hi>
he was so much feared, and renowned through the World, that a great King
of the East; and <hi>Amurath,</hi> the greatest of all the <hi>Mahomatists,</hi> sent their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours,
with rich Presents unto him, desiring peace, and friendship: and
the like did all <hi>Christian</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> thus living with honour,<note place="margin">His War with the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </note> and in tranquillity, <hi>Godfrey</hi> King of
<hi>Denmark</hi> (which was a dependance of the Realm of <hi>Germany,</hi> and part of
<hi>Charles</hi> his Portion, as was hinted before) made War against him. This
<hi>Godfrey</hi> was a mighty Prince, and commanded over a large mighty Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and with great Forces came into <hi>Friesland</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> where he did
great harm. Against whom, the Emperour addressing himself (though
he was now Old, and unweildy) speedily departed with a great Army: but
by the way news was brought him that King <hi>Godfrey</hi> was dead, and that his
Army was returned into their own Country. And upon the same day news
came also,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pepin</hi> dies.</note> that his Son <hi>Pepin</hi> (who had raigned in <hi>Italy</hi> in great prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
was dead in the City of <hi>Millan,</hi> which was an occasion of great grief to
the old Emperour. Then did he return to the City of <hi>Aken,</hi> or <hi>Aix,</hi> unto
which place Ambassadours came to him from <hi>Hermigius,</hi> who succeeded
<hi>Godfrey</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> humbly desiring Peace. The like
came also to him from the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and others also from
<hi>Ambulat,</hi> a King of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who raigned in a great part of <hi>Spain;</hi> to
all which he returned gracious answers, and granted their Petitions: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
giving hearty thanks to God for that he was generally so well esteemed
of. But after this Sunshine, another storm returned, <hi>as the Clouds return af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the rain:</hi>
               <note place="margin">And <hi>Charles.</hi>
               </note> For it pleased God to take away another of his Sons, called <hi>Charles,</hi>
who lay on the borders of <hi>Germany</hi> for the defence thereof; so as now his
whole hope rested in his third Son <hi>Lewis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus man purposeth and God disposeth. Thus the Sons die before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thus we see the greatest cannot free themselves from the common
calamities of mankind. Thus both great Kings, and great Kingdoms have
their Period.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Crowns have their compass; Kingdoms have their date:</l>
               <l>Fortune her frowns: Felicity her fate.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus <hi>Charlemagne</hi> lost his Children, and his great Empire her best support
under God: For these two Princes (like Stars of the greater magnitude) did
shine bright by inheriting their Fathers virtues, and Valour, leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them <hi>Lewis</hi> their Brother, with large Territories, and few vertues, to
Govern so great an Estate.</p>
            <p>After the Death of these two great Princes,<note place="margin">New enemies rise up.</note> many enemies rose up against
old <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who seemed (as it were) to have lost his two Arms: as the
<hi>Sarazins</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> and the <hi>Normans</hi> in the Northern Regions:
But he vanquished them all, and brought them into his obedience and subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
old and broken as he was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> all his Life time held the Church in great reverence,<note place="margin">His love to the Church.</note> and had
imployed his Authority to beautify it, and bountifully bestowed his Treasure
to enrich it: But this great plenty, joyned with so long and happy a Peace,
made the Church-men to live losely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> (being himself well instructed in Religion) knowing of what
great importance it was, to have such as should instruct others to be sound in
the Faith,<note place="margin">He called five Councels.</note> and holy and exemplary in their lives, he at sundry times, called
five Councels in sundry Places of his Dominions (For as yet the Popes
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:103996:153"/>
had not challenged that power to belong to them) for the Reformation and
good Government of the Church: As at <hi>Mentz:</hi> at <hi>Rheimes:</hi> at <hi>Tours:</hi> at
<hi>Chaalons:</hi> and at <hi>Arles:</hi> and by the advise of these <hi>Ecclesiastical Assemblies,</hi> he
made and published many Orders for the good of the Church which were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together in a Book called, <hi>Capitula Caroli Magni.</hi> A worthy President
for Princes who seek true Honour by virtue, whereof the care of Piety is the
chiefest Foundation.</p>
            <p>In the Preface to this Book,<note place="margin">His Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions.</note> he thus saith, that he had appointed these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
with the Advice of his <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Counsellers:</hi> and that herein
he had followed the Example of King <hi>Josias,</hi> who endeavoured to bring the
Kingdom which God had given him, to the worship of the true God:
Some of his constitutions are these. He commanded to look to, and to
try the learning and conversation of such as were admitted into the Ministry.
He forbad private Masses, Also the confusion of <hi>Diocesses,</hi> requiring that no
Bishop should meddle in anothers <hi>Diocess.</hi> He forbad that any Books should
be read publickly, but such as were approved by the Councel of <hi>Calcedon.</hi>
He forbad the worshipping of Saints. He commanded Bishops not to suffer
<hi>Presbyters</hi> to teach the People other things then what are contained in, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the holy Scriptures. And <hi>lib. 2. ch.</hi> 3. he saith, <hi>Although the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Ecclesiastical Ministry may seem to stand in our Person: Yet by the
Authority of God, and Ordinance of man, its known to be so divided, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of you, in his own place and order, hath his own power and Ministry:
Hence its manifest that I should admonish you all; and you all should further
and help us.</hi> He admonished Bishops especially, to teach both by Life and
Doctrine, both by themselves, and the Ministers that were under them, as
they would answer the contrary in their accounts at the Great Day. He Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
that the Bishop of the first See should not be called the Prince of Priests,
or the highest Priest, or have any such Title, but only should be called,
<hi>The Bishop of the first See.</hi> That none can lay another foundation, then that
which is laid, which is <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and that they which lay Christ for their
foundation, its to be hoped that they will be careful to shew their Faith, by
bringing forth good Works.</p>
            <p>He held also a great Councel in the City of <hi>Frankfort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Counsel at <hi>Frankfort.</hi>
               </note> of the Bishops of
<hi>France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> which himself honoured with his own presence;
where, by general consent the false <hi>Synod</hi> of the <hi>Greeks</hi> (they are the
words of the Original) untruly called the seventh, was condemned, and
rejected by all the Bishops, who subscribed to the condemnation of it. This
was that Counsel (spoken of before) called by <hi>Irene</hi> at <hi>Nice,</hi> wherein the
bringing of Images into Churches for devotion, was established. In a
Word, if <hi>Charlemagnes</hi> medling with <hi>Italy,</hi> and his advancing the Pope,
for confirming that which he had taken, could be excused, he was unto
all Princes a pattern of magnificence, of Zeal in Religion, of learning, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
temperance, prudence, moderation, <hi>&amp;c. Alcwin</hi> saith of him,
<hi>Charles</hi> was a Catholick in his Faith, a King in power, a High Priest in
preaching, a Judg in his equity, a Philosopher in liberal Studies, famous
in manners,<note place="margin">His Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> and excellent in all honesty. He was so temperate, that
notwithstanding his great revenues, he was never served at the Table
with above four Dishes at a Meal, and those of such Meat as best plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his taste, which he used to the same end for which God created
them, which was for sustenance, and to support his Body, not for shew
and pomp.</p>
            <p>His ordinary exercise was hunting when he was at leisure,<note place="margin">His Exercises.</note> in time of War:
and in times of Peace, he attended to such as read Histories to him, and
sometimes he heard <hi>Musick,</hi> with which he was much delighted, having
good skill therein himself: He was very charitable, and a bountiful Alms-giver,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:103996:153"/>
and so careful to provide for the poor Cristians,<note place="margin">His Charity.</note> that in <hi>Syria,</hi> in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in other Provinces of the Infidels, where Christians
lived, he found means to have Almes-houses and Hospitals erected, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
for those thar were Poor.</p>
            <p>But there fell out a new accident, which drew out Great <hi>Charles</hi> again
to Arms in his old Age,<note place="margin">His last Wars.</note> and that was this; <hi>Alphonso,</hi> King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
the <hi>Chast,</hi> by reason of his singular, and signal temperance in that
kind, did inform, and advertise him, that there was now a very fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
and means offered for him utterly to subdue the <hi>Sarazins</hi> in <hi>Spain.
Charlemagne</hi> (who infinitely desired to finish this work, which he had so
often attempted with no great success) gave ear to the information and
advice, whereupon he raises an Army, and marches into <hi>Spain,</hi> relying on
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> favour, and assistance, they being <hi>Christians.</hi> Indeed <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi>
meant plainly, and sincerely, but so did not his Courtiers, and Nobles,
nor Associates, who feared <hi>Charles</hi> his forces no less than they did the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins,</hi>
and if <hi>Charles</hi> prevailed, the most confident of <hi>Alphonso's</hi> Servants and
Officers doubted to be dispossessed of their places, and Governments by a
new Master: and therefore they laboured to cross <hi>Alphonso,</hi> and to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand
<hi>Charles;</hi> but the Lot was cast, his Army was in the Field, and he
was resolved to pass on: But when he was entred into <hi>Spain,</hi> he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with so many difficulties, that being discouraged, he returned back
into <hi>France,</hi> and so concluded, and put a period to all his Warly enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
embracing again the care of the Church, and of Religion, as a fit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
for the remainder of his days.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was threescore and eight years old when he left the Wars,<note place="margin">His preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Death.</note>
after which he spent three whole years in his study, to prepare himself
for Death, in which time, he read much in the Bible, and read over al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
St. <hi>Augustines</hi> Works, whom he loved and preferred before all the other
Doctors of the Church: He resided also at <hi>Paris,</hi> that he might have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of conferring with learned men. There he erected a goodly U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity,
which he furnished with as learned men as those times could
afford, and endowed it with great priviledges: For he had an exceeding great
care to make it a Nurcery for the holy Ministry, that from thence the Church
might be supplied with able Teachers, whence also grew so many Colleges of
<hi>Cannons,</hi> with sufficient revenues annexed thereunto.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Charlemagne</hi> spent three years happily in the only care of his Soul, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an illustrious example to all Princes, to moderate, and ennoble their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with Piety, and so to enjoy their Temporal estates, as in the mean time
not to neglect their eternal concernments, and to think of their departure out
of this Life in time.</p>
            <p>Foreseeing his Death (whereunto he prepared himself by these exercises) he
made his last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He makes his Will.</note> leaving his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> the sole Heir unto his
great Kingdoms, and bequeathed to the Church much Treasure. But all
things and Persons in this World have an end: His <hi>Testament</hi> was but the
Harbinger to his Death; for presently after, he was taken with a pain in
his side, or Plurisie, and lay sick but eight days, and so yielded up his Spirit
unto God that gave it, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 814. and of his Age seventy one, and of
his Reign forty seven, including fifteen years of his Empire: His Body was
interred in a sumptuous Church which he had caused to be built in the
City of <hi>Aquisgrave,</hi> or <hi>Aix la Capelle,</hi> where he was born, and his memory
was honoured with a goodly <hi>Epitaph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was one of the greatest Princes that ever lived:<note place="margin">His virtues.</note> His virtues are a
pattern to other <hi>Monarchs,</hi> and his great successes the subject of their wishes.
The greatness of his <hi>Monarchy</hi> indeed was admirable:<note place="margin">His large Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</note> For he quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoyed all <hi>France, Germany,</hi> the greatest part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> all <hi>Italy;</hi>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:103996:154"/>
and a good part of <hi>Spain.</hi> At the time of his Death he was in peace with the
other Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> as also with the Kings of <hi>England, Denmark, Bulgary,</hi>
with the Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and with all the Princes of that
time.</p>
            <p>This Noble Prince was endued with so many excellent Virtues,<note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> that we
read of very few in antient Histories that excelled him, so that he may be
justly compared with the best of them: For in Martial Discipline, in Valour,
in Dexterity, in Feats of Arms, there are none that exceeded him. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
as many Victories, fought as many Battels, and subdued as many
fierce and Warlike Nations, as any one we read of, and that both before, and
after that he was Emperour. He was tall of Stature, very well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in all his members, passing strong: of a fair and grave countenance,
valiant, mild, merciful, a lover of Justice, liberal, very affable, pleasant, well
read in History, a great Friend of Arts and Sciences, and sufficiently seen into
them, and a man who above all, loved and rewarded Learned men. He was
very charitable in his Kingdoms, yea, in his very Court, he harboured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
many Strangers and Pilgrims. In matters of Faith and Religion he
was very zealous;<note place="margin">His Zeal.</note> and most of the Wars which he made, were to propagate
and enlarge the Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>He (being mis-led by the darkness of the times wherein he lived) supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
honoured and obeyed the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope that was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
thereof, together with other Bishops and Prelates, commanding his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
also to do the like. He was also very devout, and spent much of his time
in Prayer, Hearing and Reading. In his Diet he was very temperate, and a
great enemy to riot and excess; and though he was Rich and Mighty, yet fed
he his Body with what was necessary and wholesome, not rare, costly, and
strange.</p>
            <p>And yet his Virtues were not without their blemishes (as the greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
are not without some notable Vices) For in his younger dayes he was
much given to Women,<note place="margin">His blemishes.</note> adding Concubines to his lawful Wives, by whom
he had divers children: but this was in the time of his Youth: For afterwards
he contented himself with his Wife, and for a remedy of this imperfection,
though he was three or four times a Widower, yet he ever married again the
Daughter of some great Prince or other.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, he was an excellent Emperour, that loved and feared God,
and died when he was very Old, and full of Honour, leaving <hi>Lewis</hi> (the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of his Sons) the sole heir of his great Empire, but not of his Virtues: So
that this great building soon declined in his posterity.</p>
            <p>He had engraven upon his Sword, <hi>Pro Deo &amp; Religione,</hi> For God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
He used to set his Crown upon the Bible, as our <hi>Canutus</hi> sometime put
his Crown upon the <hi>Rood,</hi> both of them thereby intimating, that as all honour
was due to God, so true Religion was the best <hi>Basis</hi> of Government, and that
Piety was the best Policy.</p>

He had five Wives: the first was called <hi>Galcena,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> the Daughter of the King
of <hi>Galistria,</hi> by whom he had no Children. The second was <hi>Theodora,</hi> the
Sister, (or as others say) the Daughter of <hi>Didier</hi> King of <hi>Lombardy;</hi> whom
he kept not long, but repudiated her for sundry reasons. The third was <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debranda,</hi>
Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Suevia,</hi> whom he loved exceedingly,
and had by her three Sons, <hi>viz. Charles</hi> his Eldest, whom he made King of
the greatest, and best part of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany: Pepin</hi> his Second, whom
he made King of <hi>Italy, Bavaria,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Lewis</hi> his Youngest, to whom he left the
Empire intire, his Brothers being both dead in their Fathers Life time. This
<hi>Lewis</hi> was sirnamed <hi>Debonaire,</hi> or the <hi>Courteous.</hi> He had also three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
the Eldest was called <hi>Rothruda;</hi> the Second <hi>Birtha;</hi> and the Youngest
<hi>Giselia,</hi> who would never marry. His fourth Wife he had out of <hi>Germany,</hi>
called <hi>Fastrada:</hi> And his fifth and last was also a <hi>German</hi> Lady, called <hi>Luith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granda,</hi>
of the <hi>Suevian</hi> Race, by whom he had no Children.</p>
            <p>He shewed his love to Religion,<note place="margin">His Devotion.</note> by having one, during his Meal-times, that
either read to him some part of the Holy Scriptures, or else some part of Saint
<hi>Augustines</hi> Books, especially that <hi>De Civitate Dei:</hi> or some History. He was
also a great Friend to Learning, and therefore erected three Universities:
One was at <hi>Padua</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> another was at <hi>Boulognia;</hi> the third was that
in <hi>Paris,</hi> whereunto he was excited by our Countryman <hi>Alcwin,</hi> who was his
Tutor.</p>
            <p>His Sons he caused to be trained up in the Study of Liberal Arts;<note place="margin">His care of his Children.</note> and his
Daughters to learn to sow, and practice good Huswifry. He alwayes wore a
short Sword at his Girdle, in the Pummel whereof was engraven his <hi>Coat of
Arms,</hi> with which he sealed all his Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And used to say, <hi>Behold the
Sword which shall defend my Laws, and that shall be drawn and imployed against
those that break them.</hi> In the year eight hundred and four, the King of the
<hi>Scots</hi> entred into the first League which was between the two Kingdoms of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His League with <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> which was confirmed by succeeding Kings, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
one of them to add unto their <hi>Coat of Arms</hi> a double streak of <hi>Gules,</hi>
with <hi>Flower de Lisses</hi> round their <hi>Escutcheon,</hi> to shew that their Alliance with
<hi>France</hi> conduced much to the support of their Kingdom.</p>
