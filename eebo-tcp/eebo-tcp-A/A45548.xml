            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

oh give us grace for that little <hi>inch</hi> of our candle which is yet to <hi>burn,</hi> so to <hi>let our light shine before men, that they seeing our good works, may glorify thee our Father which art in heaven.</hi> To this end we pray thee, enlighten our blind minds, <hi>incline</hi> our crooked wills, <hi>soften</hi> our hard hearts, <hi>compose</hi> our distempered passions, <hi>mortify</hi> our earthly members, <hi>sanctify</hi> our whole man, Spirit, Soul, and Body, and <hi>preserve</hi> us blamelesse to the coming of our <hi>Lord Jesus.

                  <hi>Junil. in Bibl. pat.</hi> T. 1.</note> are the three Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels in which run the Streames of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ, from whence ariseth the division of its BOOKES into <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical, Prophetical,</hi> and <hi>Doctrinal</hi>: Not, but that all the Bookes of <hi>Scripture</hi> are <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> in which respect the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>it is profitable for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>; but,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> because some Books are chiefly concerned in narrations of things <hi>past,</hi> others in the predictions of things <hi>to come</hi>; and some are chiefly, if not only, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about <hi>Dogmatical</hi> Truths, and <hi>Practical</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, they are not unfitly thus distinguished. Of this latter sort are the <hi>Epistolary</hi> Writings, and therefore in this regard the fittest to be discussed among the people; The <hi>Prophetical</hi> Books are most congruous to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53018:7"/>
the <hi>Schooles,</hi> but the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> most suitable to the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit; those</hi> for exercising the Learned, <hi>these</hi> for feeding the Vulgar. Upon this account I have made choice of an <hi>Epistle,</hi> and in particular, (not without serious and mature deliberation, nor yet (I hope) without the blessed Spirits instigation) of this <hi>First Epistle General of S. JOHN</hi> to be the subject of my <hi>Postmeridian</hi> discourses.</p>
            <p>If any shall be inquisitive to know <hi>why</hi> among all the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the Holy Apostles I have pitched my thoughts upon <hi>this,</hi> I shall returne this threefold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, which as a <hi>threefold cord,</hi> (and that saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> is <hi>not easily broken,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 4.12.</note>) enduced me to this Work.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>One,</hi> (though indeed the least) is that I finde not any <hi>English</hi> Expositor upon it, nor yet many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Latine,</hi> except those who have undertaken Comments upon all the <hi>Epistles,</hi> whereas either in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> or both, I finde several excellent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters upon each of the rest: and truly, I shall esteem it an high honour conferred upon me by my <hi>God,</hi> if, through his gracious enablement by a (though imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) dilucidation of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> I may cast a <hi>Mite</hi> into the Churches-Treasury.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A <hi>second</hi> and more perswading reason is the <hi>congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> of it to the <hi>age</hi> wherein we now live, since there is the same occasion (as to general, if not particular consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations) now given to <hi>Ministers</hi> of handling, which St. <hi>John</hi> had then of writing this <hi>Epistle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To clear this you may be pleased to know, that there were <hi>two</hi> sorts of men in St. <hi>Johns</hi> dayes, to wit, <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian-Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Carnal-Gospellers, those</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely denied the fundamentalls of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>these</hi> whilest they had Divine phrases, seraphical expressions flowing from their lips, were sensual and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical in their lives, talking of <hi>Communion with God, dwelling in God, knowing the truth,</hi> and what not? and yet practising envy, malice, hatred, and all uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53018:7"/>
in their actions, against both these this <hi>Boanerges</hi> (for so he with his brother <hi>James</hi> are called by <hi>Christ,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> is intimated, in that we must <hi>aske according to Gods will,</hi> which cannot be unlesse accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that patterne; yea, in that we are called <hi>sonnes of God,</hi> it teacheth us to cry <hi>Our Father,</hi> and that chief Petition in it, <hi>Forgive us our sins</hi> is once and again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated.</p>
            <p>Finally, if you please, we may out of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> compile a <hi>Creed</hi> not much unlike that of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> (no lesse justly then commonly heretofore received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, though now almost forgotten by us,) in these or the like words. <hi>I believe in God the Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, just, holy, pure and faithful, who knoweth all things,</hi> (and is no lesse Almighty to do all things,) <hi>who is

            </p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Epistle</hi> is asserted to be St. <hi>JOHNS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed we do not finde him setting down his <hi>Name</hi> in any part of the <hi>Epistle,</hi> the other <hi>Apostles</hi> are <hi>express</hi> in this particular. <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iude,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in all <hi>Epistles,</hi> except that to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi>; but Saint <hi>IOHN</hi> in <hi>this Epistle</hi> is altogether silent, in the <hi>other two</hi> he only giveth himself the common title of an <hi>Elder</hi>: when he hath any occasion to mention himself in his <hi>Gospel,</hi> and that in things much tending to his dignity, it is done in a <hi>third person</hi> by way of circumlocution, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his <hi>Apocalypse</hi> he specifieth his <hi>Name,</hi>

            <p>It lets us see in general the <hi>humility</hi> of this holy <hi>Apostle,</hi> who thought so meanly of himself, that <hi>he</hi> accounts himself not <hi>worth</hi> the <hi>naming.</hi> Indeed on the one hand, (though its often too true of <hi>many,</hi> who arrogantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to <hi>blazon</hi> their own <hi>names</hi> and <hi>titles,</hi>) we are not to imagine that when the other <hi>Apostles</hi> prefixe their <hi>nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Besides this notion of <hi>humility,</hi> it may further be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and not improbably, that this <hi>concealment</hi> of his <hi>Name</hi> was an act of <hi>prudence,</hi> especially considering the <hi>time</hi> when it is most rationally conjectured to be written, to wit, (as the learned <hi>English Annotatour</hi> hath observed to my hand,<note place="margin">

There is no doubt a <hi>policy</hi> consistent with <hi>piety</hi>; which as all <hi>Christians,</hi> so <hi>Ministers</hi> may use in persecuting times. It was that our <hi>Saviour</hi> at least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his <hi>Disciples,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 10.16.</note> to be <hi>wise as serpents,</hi> with this cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they were <hi>innocent as Doves</hi>; and sure it is no injury to truth and innocency, if a man, a Minister in prudence, with-hold the publication of his name, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his enemies malice.<note place="margin">

            <p>But whether these or any other were the reasons of S. <hi>IOHN</hi>'s silencing his <hi>Name,</hi> yet it is without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, that he was the <hi>Penman</hi>; and indeed as <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius Alexandrinus</hi> hath not unfitly observed The <hi>Gospel</hi> and the <hi>Epistle</hi> are so concordant, often using the same phrases, that he who penned the one, must be acknowledged as the writer of the other.</p>

            <p>The useful <hi>meditations</hi> we may hence take up are, that since this <hi>Epistle</hi> is written generally to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in several places, we are to remember it is as well <hi>Catholick</hi> in respect of several <hi>ages.</hi> Indeed there is no <hi>age</hi> of <hi>man,</hi> but is herein instructed; so he saith himself, that

            <p>And indeed there are <hi>several</hi> advantages in <hi>writing</hi> above <hi>speaking,</hi> which might very well induce the <hi>Apostles</hi> to take this course. <hi>My tongue</hi> saith <hi>David, is the pen of a ready writer</hi>;<note place="margin">Ps. 45.1.</note> the <hi>pen</hi> no less truly is as the <hi>tongue of a ready speaker.</hi>

            <p>Upon these considerations it is more than probable that St. <hi>John</hi> and others of the <hi>Apostles</hi> did <hi>show by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> since the <hi>Christians</hi> of those times were scattered up and down by persecution, so that the <hi>Apostles</hi> could not reach them all in person, nor had they regard on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the present age, but to the propagation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity in succeeding, and therefore they made use of this way, to <hi>declare by writing.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>appellation</hi> here affixed to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is choice and comfortable, it is the <hi>word of life</hi>; a title which is made <hi>use of by</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he required of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> that they should <hi>shine as lights in the world,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.15, 16.</note>

               <hi>all the words of this life</hi>: suitably hereunto, it is that it is called else where the <hi>word of salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel of salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Grace of God that bringeth salvation,</hi> and the <hi>ingrafted word, which is able to save our souls</hi>; and yet once more, <hi>that word of Gods Grace, which is able to build us up, and to give us an inheritance among them which are sanctified.</hi>

It did not seem good to his wisdome to confer this <hi>jewel</hi> presently, but in the mean space that the <hi>Church</hi> might have somewhat to support her, he vouchsafed the <hi>promise</hi> of it: divine <hi>promises</hi> are as <hi>sweet bits</hi> to stay our stomachs before the full meal of his actual performances; the promise of Christs <hi>first</hi> coming was that which comforted the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and the promise of his <hi>second</hi> coming is that which now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viveth the <hi>Christian</hi> Church: and since we have found him making good his word in the one, we may assure our selves he will fulfill it in the other; since as he was so <hi>good</hi> as to <hi>give</hi> a <hi>word,</hi> so he will be <hi>so good</hi> as <hi>his word,</hi> and give the thing whatsoever it is that he is pleased to promise; for so it was in that singular eminent promise of <hi>Christ,</hi> who is therefore not unfitly called <hi>the word</hi>; and so much for that.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>life,</hi> and that <hi>eternal life,</hi> because <hi>in himself he liveth for ever</hi>; this is true of him, <hi>primarily</hi> as <hi>God</hi>: this being one of his choice attributes, that he is the <hi>living God,</hi> &amp; inasmuch as divine attributes are better expressed by the <hi>abstract,</hi> than the concrete, he is fitly said, not onely to be living, but <hi>life</hi> it self, and this <hi>life</hi> is most properly said to be <hi>eternal,</hi> because it is so, both <hi>a parte ante &amp; a parte post,</hi> from everlasting to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Secondarily,</hi> this is true of him, as <hi>Mediator, God-man</hi>;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53018:29"/>
since, though there was a time when thus he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to live, to wit, at his assumption of our nature,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.9. Rev. 1.18.

            <p>To sum it up, <hi>Christ,</hi> God-man, Mediator, is the <hi>life,</hi> that <hi>eternal life,</hi> in respect of his threefold <hi>offices,</hi> of <hi>King, Priest,</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi>: as Prophet, he is the <hi>life</hi> by way of <hi>Revelation,</hi> discovering this <hi>eternal life</hi> to us; as <hi>Priest,</hi> by way of <hi>impetration,</hi> procuring this <hi>eternal life</hi> for us; as <hi>King,</hi> by way of <hi>collation,</hi> conferring this <hi>eternal life</hi> on us: and as the fulness of <hi>water</hi> is dispensed by the <hi>Sea</hi> to the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the fulness of <hi>light</hi> is communicated by the <hi>Sun</hi> to the <hi>Air,</hi> and the fulness of <hi>Corn</hi> was divided by <hi>Ioseph</hi> among the <hi>people</hi>; so the fulness of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> even <hi>eternal life</hi> is conveyed by <hi>Christ</hi> to his <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore very justly doth this character belong to him.</p>
            <p>And now what should this consideration teach us, But</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>bewail</hi> our sad condition whilest we are <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ</hi>: for if <hi>Christ</hi> be the <hi>life</hi> all that know him not, or <hi>believe</hi> not in him, must needs be in a <hi>state of death</hi> and damnation.</p>
            <p>It is observable, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> whilest in the state of unregeneracy,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.1, 2.12.</note> saith, they were <hi>dead in sins and trespasses</hi>; and a little after, renders this as the <hi>reason,</hi> because at that time they were <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ</hi>; indeed as the <hi>body</hi> without the <hi>soul</hi> is corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, so the <hi>soul</hi> without <hi>Christ</hi> is spiritually <hi>dead</hi>; and alas, whilest we are in this estate, we are without all hope of life, being under the <hi>sentence,</hi> not onely of the <hi>first,</hi> but <hi>second</hi> death, and therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> saith expressely,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.36.</note> 
               <hi>he that believeth not the Son, shall not see

life, but the wrath of God abideth on him</hi>; oh heavy <hi>load,</hi> and unsupportable <hi>weight,</hi> which upon whomsoever it <hi>abideth,</hi> must needs <hi>crush</hi> him to peices, and sink him to the depth of <hi>Hell:</hi> Oh labour we then both in respect of our selves and others, to be <hi>sensible</hi> of our natural estate, and if we mourn over our friends <hi>dead bodies,</hi> much more should we mourn over theirs, and our <hi>dead soules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>seek</hi> after this <hi>life,</hi> because it is <hi>eternal,</hi> and to seek it by union with <hi>Christ,</hi> who is the <hi>life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed this <hi>temporal life</hi> may be <hi>used,</hi> but onely that <hi>eternal life</hi> is to be <hi>sought,</hi> the life that <hi>now is,</hi> is a fleeting <hi>shadow,</hi> a vanishing <hi>vapour,</hi> a <hi>day,</hi> which though never so pleasant, cannot be <hi>long</hi>; but the life <hi>which is to come,</hi> is a <hi>light</hi> ever shining, a <hi>leaf</hi> never fading, and such a <hi>day</hi> as shall know no <hi>evening:</hi> and now tell me which is most <hi>rational,</hi> to seek after that life which is <hi>lost,</hi> almost as soon as it is <hi>found,</hi> or after that life which being once <hi>found,</hi> can never be <hi>lost</hi>? to catch after that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>got,</hi> we cannot <hi>hold,</hi> or that which being once <hi>got,</hi> we cannot <hi>lose</hi>? and therefore that I may allude to our blessed <hi>Saviours</hi> expression; <hi>labour not for that which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth, but for that life which endureth to eternity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.27.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To this end, let it be our continued <hi>care</hi> to <hi>gain,</hi> to <hi>assure</hi> our <hi>interest</hi> in, and union with <hi>Christ</hi>; the <hi>Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> went to the <hi>Prophet</hi> for raising her <hi>dead childe</hi>: we must to <hi>Christ</hi> for the quickning our <hi>dead souls</hi>; it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry observable what St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith to this <hi>purpose:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>To whom coming as to a living stone, we also are built up as lively stones</hi>: so that if you know how we become <hi>living stones,</hi> it is by <hi>coming to,</hi> and being <hi>built upon Christ</hi> as our foundation; the <hi>soul</hi> cannot enliven the <hi>body,</hi> till <hi>infused</hi> into, and united with it, nor can we receive life from <hi>Christ,</hi> but by an <hi>interest</hi> in him: <hi>he that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood</hi> (saith <hi>Christ</hi> himself) <hi>hath eternal life</hi>; there is <hi>life, eternal life</hi> in the <hi>flesh and blood of Christ,</hi>

but then we must <hi>eat and drink</hi> it, that so this spiritual food may be incorporated into us, and we made one with <hi>Christ.</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>To <hi>clear</hi> this briefly, and yet fully, you must know, That <hi>objects of excelling brightness are best manifested through allaying mediums</hi>: thus the <hi>Sun</hi> being in it self so transcendently lightsome, cannot be looked on by us as it shineth in its own lustre, but best conveyeth its light to us through the <hi>clouds</hi>; and hence it is, that whilest the clouds obscure, they make the sun beams to us more obvious; the same is the case in this present matter, <hi>Gods face</hi> in it self, is so bright, that we cannot <hi>see it, and live,</hi> which made the <hi>Israel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> the <hi>Apostle</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding still higher and higher, he begins with <hi>hearing,</hi> as being that sense which is most capable of deception, from thence he riseth to that of <hi>seeing,</hi> which is more certain; <hi>one eye-witness being of more value than ten ear-witnesses</hi>: and yet because seeing might pretend <hi>ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria oculorum,</hi> the <hi>eye</hi> might be subject to <hi>delusion,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>another sense,</hi> which as it is <hi>crassior,</hi> so it is <hi>certior,</hi> more <hi>gross,</hi> so it is most <hi>sure</hi>; asserting, that what he declared with his mouth, was that which not onely his <hi>eare</hi> and <hi>eyes,</hi> but his <hi>hands</hi> gave testimony to. That one of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> namely, <hi>Thomas,</hi> did handle him with his hands, is expressed; and where it is said of this <hi>Apostle,</hi> that he <hi>leaned in his bosome,</hi> it implyeth that he <hi>handled</hi> him; nay, in as much as we find that the other <hi>Apostles</hi> did eate, drink, converse with him, nay, that he saith to them, <hi>handle</hi> and <hi>see</hi>; it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceived, that they might all handle him, so much the rather considering that it is here affirmed by St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> not onely of himself, but others; <hi>our hands have handled</hi>: nor doth this <hi>handling</hi> onely refer to his <hi>person,</hi> but his <hi>miracles,</hi> the <hi>fishes</hi> and <hi>loaves</hi> which he gave them to feed so many thousands with, the <hi>dead bodies</hi> which he raised to life, whereby the reality and verity of his miracles did the more clearly appear to them.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="1">1. To prove that <hi>Christs flesh and blood</hi> is not there <hi>corporally</hi> present, because then it must be <hi>visible</hi>; it is an undoubted maxime in Philosophy, <hi>omne corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um est quantum,</hi> quantity is inseparable from corporiety, and being so, it cannot but be visible and palpable; nay,<note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2.

Here is matter of <hi>Conviction,</hi> to perswade us of the <hi>verity</hi> of the <hi>Apostolical</hi> writings; It is true, the <hi>chief</hi> reason why we are to receive their <hi>writings,</hi> is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi> they were <hi>moved,</hi> and extraordinarily <hi>assisted</hi> in the penning of them, by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi>; but yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, this may be a <hi>secondary</hi> reason of our assent to what they testifyed and wrote, because it was no other than that <hi>which they had heard,</hi> nay <hi>seen,</hi> nay, <hi>handled</hi>; we all think it just and reasonable to believe a man when he speaketh not by <hi>hear-say,</hi> but <hi>personal</hi> experience: and why then, is it not reason that we should believe the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> who declare nothing but what they <hi>heard, saw, and handled</hi>? This was so rational an argument in St. <hi>Iohns</hi> account, that speaking concerning <hi>Christs</hi> being <hi>thrust</hi> through with a <hi>spear,</hi> he thus argueth: <hi>He that saw it bare record, and his record is true</hi>; therefore true, because of that which he saw:<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.35.</note> and hence it is, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> complaining of the <hi>Iews</hi> infidelity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting <hi>Christ,</hi> useth this aggravation; <hi>what he hath seen and heard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.32.11.</note> 
               <hi>that he testifieth, and no man receiveth his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi>; and in the same Chapter, <hi>Christ</hi> himself taketh up the same complaint to <hi>Nicodemus, verily, verily, I say unto thee, we speak that we do know, and testifie that we have seen, and you receive not our witness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To drive this nail to the head, there are but <hi>three</hi> things that can possibly be <hi>objected</hi> against this reason, which being cleared, I conceive it will remain unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable, and such as may convince a <hi>Iew,</hi> a <hi>Pagan,</hi> if they were not wilfully blind.</p>
            <p>That they <hi>say</hi> they <hi>heard, saw, and handled,</hi> what they never did, and so were no better than <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they did onely <hi>think</hi> they <hi>saw</hi> such things, but in truth did not, and so were themselves <hi>deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That that which they did <hi>hear, see, handle,</hi> will not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53018:43"/>
amount to a proof of <hi>what they declared,</hi> namely, that <hi>Iesus was the Christ.</hi> To all which, I doubt not but to return a full answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>first,</hi> such an <hi>accusation</hi> cannot aequitably be charged on any, except they either were men of <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>flagitious lives,</hi> and so not likely to make any <hi>conscience</hi> of a <hi>lye,</hi> or else that there were some great <hi>advantage,</hi> apparently accruing by such a lye, which perhaps might have an influence, not onely on a loose, but a civil person; now neither of these can in this case be alledged. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Apostles</hi> were men of <hi>holy</hi> and exemplary lives,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.15.</note> men that did <hi>shine as lights in the world</hi> by their good conversation, men whom those grand <hi>Apostates,</hi> and <hi>enemies</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> could charge with nothing but <hi>simplicity,</hi> and therefore no reason to suspect that they should tell such a gross lye, as to say, they <hi>heard, or saw, or handled,</hi> what they never did.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is sufficiently manifest, that they were not <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured</hi> to bear this Testimony by any <hi>gain,</hi> either of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> or <hi>profit,</hi> or <hi>pleasure</hi>; nay, in stead of <hi>gain,</hi> there was nothing but <hi>loss,</hi> they were <hi>hated of all men,</hi>

               <hi>for Christs names sakes</hi>; they <hi>forsook father, mother, friends</hi>; they were exposed to <hi>hunger, thirst, cold, nakedness, tortures,</hi> and <hi>most</hi> of them to <hi>death</hi> it self, <hi>nemo gratis malus est</hi>; no man will be wicked for nothing, nay, invent and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and stand in a lye, when no benefit, but a great injury redounds to him by it; and therefore we may justly conceive that it was nothing but the force of <hi>truth</hi> that prevailed upon them, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> burning as a fire in their bosomes, which could not be concealed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>second,</hi> These <hi>three</hi> things are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That where the <hi>object</hi> is <hi>sensible,</hi> if there be a <hi>fit organ,</hi> an <hi>apt medium,</hi> and a <hi>convenient distance,</hi> the <hi>sense</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:53018:44"/>
is not, <hi>cannot</hi> be <hi>deceived,</hi> nor is there any demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more certain: now these things, of which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> bear witness, were things placed within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of sense, as being concerning a <hi>man,</hi> his <hi>birth, death, resurrection,</hi> and the like, all which are sensible objects; and they who tell us they saw these things, were the <hi>companions</hi> of this man, alwayes <hi>neer</hi> to, <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> with him; nor did ever any deny them to be men of <hi>perfect sences</hi>; and therefore there is no reason to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a deceit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it was not <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> or a <hi>few,</hi> but <hi>many,</hi> who had this sensible experience; there were <hi>twelve</hi> who did continually attend upon <hi>Christ</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15 6.</note> &amp; after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, he was <hi>seen of above five hundred.</hi> Though one mans sense might be bad, or fallible, yet it is not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable that so <hi>many</hi> were deceived, especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that <hi>all</hi> they who testifie to us what they saw, <hi>agree</hi> for substance in one and the same testimony, not varying from, not jarring against one another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And yet once more, it is <hi>plurium sensuum experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>F√°lsa utique testatio si ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum &amp; auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; manuum sensus natura mentitur.

            <p n="2">2. The <hi>proving</hi> him to be a <hi>worker</hi> of glorious <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>

               <hi>the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and to the poor the Gospel is preached</hi>: And therefore, all these considerations being laid together, it remaineth as a clear truth, that <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is very <hi>reasonable,</hi> and the <hi>sensible</hi> experience which the <hi>Apostles,</hi> those <hi>first</hi> planters of Christianity, had concerning the things they declared and wrote, is a strong and undeniable <hi>reason,</hi> why we should give <hi>credence</hi> and obedience to their writings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To draw to an end, here is in the last place mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and that double.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            </p>
            <p>Indeed there are <hi>two</hi> things every good <hi>Minister</hi> should be careful to do, in respect of the things he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth.</p>

            <p>The truth is, what we take onely upon <hi>hear-say,</hi> or is only a <hi>fiction</hi> of our own brain, and an invention of our

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2.

               <hi>we now by writing the Gospel, communicate to you; we are the first members of the Church, but not the whole body, and therefore you as well as we are capable of the same benefits.</hi> And it is a tacite <hi>prevention</hi> of an <hi>objection</hi> which might be made; for whereas, when the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>we write the things we have seen concerning Christ,</hi> they might say or think <hi>what is this to us, we have not, cannot see or handle him,</hi> it is a priviledge not possible for us to attain; to this these words implicitly return an answer, that by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles writing</hi> what they <hi>saw,</hi> they, to wit, <hi>believing</hi> the truth of what was written, might have <hi>fellowship</hi> with them; and thus it is true of all <hi>Christians,</hi> who <hi>by</hi> faith have <hi>fellowship with Christ</hi> as well as the <hi>Apostles,</hi> though they never saw him, because the same interest in his person,<note place="margin">

               </note>2. <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> make the sense of these words, <hi>this is the promise</hi>; to intend thus much. The <hi>promise which we bring to you hath this condition annexed to it, to wit, of walking in the light</hi>; and therefore it is expressed with an <hi>if,</hi> an hypothetical conjunction; That then, which we have further to take notice of, and would by no means be omitted, is, that <hi>the promise of the Gospel is conditional</hi>; it is a position with a supposition, nor are the benefits in it granted absolutely, but respectively.</p>
            <p>It is a question moved by some how the <hi>promise</hi> can be <hi>free</hi> and yet <hi>cnoditional,</hi> not considering the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a <hi>meritorious cause,</hi> for which a thing ought to be, and a <hi>necessary condition,</hi> without which it cannot be effected; were there a proportion of <hi>equality</hi> between the thing <hi>promised,</hi> and <hi>required,</hi> the promise could not be <hi>free,</hi> but the <hi>Evangelical</hi> condition is such only, as maketh us <hi>meet</hi> for, not <hi>worthy</hi> of the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and therefore hath onely a proportion of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity. Mercy</hi> then is the <hi>spring</hi> from whence the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise floweth, but <hi>duty</hi> is the <hi>channel</hi> in which it runneth down to us. The primarie design of the <hi>Law</hi> was <hi>precept,</hi> commanding us to do, though there was annexed to it a <hi>promise,</hi> which upon doing what was commanded, we should receive. The principal scope of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53018:73"/>
               <hi>promise,</hi> revealing what <hi>God</hi> is pleased to do for us, yet so, as that there are <hi>precepts</hi> annexed to it, which require somewhat to be done by us, that we may obtain the promise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What then God hath joyned together, let not us put asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>: the most of us with <hi>Malchus</hi> have but <hi>one eare</hi> to hear the promise, but not the precept of the <hi>Gospel</hi>; we like well to gather the <hi>rose,</hi> and suck the <hi>hony</hi> of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, but the condition we hate as the <hi>pricles</hi> and <hi>sting</hi>; we would gladly have the <hi>priviledge</hi> assured, and yet we abhorre the <hi>duty</hi> required, but <hi>be not deceived,</hi> if you will have the one, you must do the other. <hi>God</hi> will not fulfill <hi>his</hi> part, unlesse we perform <hi>ours</hi>; and therefore it is in vain to expect an accomplishment of his promise, but on his own terms<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> in fine, the <hi>Gospel</hi> is a <hi>promise,</hi> let us not be so unthankful unto <hi>God and Christ,</hi> as to <hi>reject</hi> it: it is a <hi>conditional</hi> promise, let us not be so <hi>injurious</hi> to our <hi>selves,</hi> as to <hi>misapply</hi> it.</p>

            <p n="2">2. That therefore which is to be considered, is, <hi>in what respects this metaphor of light doth resemble the nature and attributes of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there are severall <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which are aptly delineated in the various <hi>properties</hi> of <hi>light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>light,</hi> of all bodies, is the most <hi>immateriall</hi> and incompounded, whereby the <hi>simplicity</hi> and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of <hi>Gods</hi> nature may be insinuated, which is void not onely of all matter, but of all composition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>light</hi> is the <hi>first</hi> of all the Creatures, which we find mentioned in the beginning of <hi>Genesis</hi>; the <hi>first</hi> thing that <hi>God</hi> said on the <hi>first</hi> day of the Creation was, <hi>Let there be light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1.3.</note> and this shadoweth forth the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of <hi>Gods being,</hi> who is both <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>first</hi> and the <hi>last,</hi> before all other things whatsoever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>light sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. The <hi>light</hi> is a Creature of a <hi>resplendent beauty</hi> and lustre, by reason of which, it is apt to dazle the eyes of the beholder, and this sets forth <hi>Gods transcendent maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> and glory, in which respect,<note place="margin">Psa. 104.2. 1 Tim. 6.13.</note> he is said to <hi>cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with light as with a garment,</hi> and to <hi>dwell in the light, which no man can approach unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>light</hi> is of that nature, that it cannot but <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it self</hi> for the good of others, shining upon the just
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53018:77"/>
and unjust; and this characterizeth the <hi>diffusive goodness</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> whereby it is that as he is good, so he doth good, and that to all.</p>
            <p>But there are more particularly <hi>two attributes,</hi> which <hi>light</hi> doth clearly discover, and which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the <hi>scope</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> especially the latter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The light is of a <hi>discovering nature,</hi> so that nothing can be <hi>hid from the heat thereof,</hi> it pryeth into every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">Ps, 19.16.</note> it peepeth in at every crevis, so that all things are made manifest by it; in which respect, it mindeth us of <hi>Gods Omniscience,</hi> whereby it is, that <hi>all things are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and open to him,</hi> even things that are most secret. To thee,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.12.</note> saith <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>darkness and the light are all one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 139.11.</note> because <hi>God</hi> seeth in the <hi>dark,</hi> as plainly as in the <hi>light,</hi> by his <hi>own light he revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him</hi> saith <hi>Daniel,</hi> finally, <hi>I try the reins</hi> saith <hi>God</hi> of himself,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.22. Ier. 17.10.</note> our minds being as apparent to him as the intrailes of a beast are to us, when the body is ripped up.</p>
            <p>It is a truth well worthy our <hi>meditation,</hi> that we may be hereby admonished to <hi>take heed to our wayes</hi>; indeed, in this respect, that which is appropriated to <hi>good men,</hi> is true of <hi>all men, they walk in the light,</hi> to wit, of <hi>Gods omniscience</hi>; and oh then, how carefu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> should we be of our walk? Alas, how vainly do <hi>hypocrites</hi> please themselves in the <hi>secrecy</hi> of their actions, and perhaps perswade themselves, that <hi>God</hi> himself taketh no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their doings; whereas <hi>his eyes are upon the ways of man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 34.21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>and he seeth all his goings, there is no darknes nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves, saith</hi> Elihu concerning <hi>God,</hi> Indeed, as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> excellently, <hi>If thou canst not hide thy self from the Sun, which is Gods Minister of light,</hi>

               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:53018:77"/>2. But to draw neer the <hi>Apostles</hi> scope, light is a <hi>pure</hi> defaecate body, a <hi>bright</hi> spotless splendor; though it shine upon <hi>filthy dunghils,</hi> it contracts <hi>no pollution,</hi> but still retaineth its pure lustre.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. For the better illustrating of this perfect purity and <hi>sanctity</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; it is that our <hi>Apostle</hi> goeth on, and to his <hi>affirmative</hi> addeth a <hi>negative, in him is no darkness at all.</hi>

            <p>More especially of this kinde, are presumptuous <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> a sort of men with whom our <hi>Apostle</hi> had here to do, and which of all others, deserve to be roughly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and that upon a double ground; the <hi>hainousness</hi> of their <hi>sin,</hi> and the <hi>highness</hi> of their <hi>self conceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Hypocrites are the <hi>worst</hi> of <hi>sinners</hi>; we may wrong a wicked man, in calliing him an hypocrite, but we cannot injure an hypocrite, in calling him a wicked man: what the <hi>moralist</hi> saith of the <hi>ungratefull,</hi> is as true of the <hi>hypocriticall</hi> person,<note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. Besides, hypocrites, though the <hi>worst</hi> of men, have the <hi>best conceits</hi> of themselves, and it is no easie matter to take them off;<note place="margin">Prov. 30.12.

they must apply <hi>corrasives</hi> to them; no man needs a more severe reprover, then the self flatterer.</p>
            <p>It is then a fit <hi>Item</hi> for all <hi>Ministers,</hi> when they have to do with <hi>hypocrites,</hi> to rebuke them sharply.

            <p n="1">1. For the better illustrating of this term <hi>darkness,</hi> be pleased to take notice, that there is a <hi>fourfold</hi> dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, namely, <hi>naturae ignorantiae, miseriae, nequitiae</hi> of nature, of ignorance, of misery, and of iniquity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Darkness of nature</hi> (properly and <hi>litterally</hi> so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) is the absence of light; when the <hi>Sun</hi> taketh its leave of our <hi>horizon,</hi> and all things are envellopped in the sable mantle of the <hi>night,</hi> then we justly say it is <hi>dark</hi>: of this darkness <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh, when he say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>God made two great lights,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Darkness</hi> when used in a <hi>borrowed</hi> sense, serveth to represent in Scripture a state,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of <hi>ignorance</hi> in divine matters, when the minde is destitute of spiritual knowledge, unacquainted with the mysteries of salvation.

            </p>
            <p>And indeed so truly, nay fully, doth this term of <hi>darkness</hi> agree to <hi>sin,</hi> that it taketh in all the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions under some notion or other, each of which, may serve as a several <hi>reason,</hi> why this appellation of <hi>darkness</hi> is given to it.</p>

When wicked men look upon the extent of <hi>Gods mercy,</hi> whereby it is, that he <hi>desireth not the death of a sinner,</hi> that he is a <hi>God pardoning iniquity, transgression and sin,</hi> not onely few, but many, small, but great, all sorts of sin: they promise to themselves a <hi>facility</hi> of obtaining forgiveness, whilest yet they indulge to their sins, not considering that God is <hi>just,</hi> as well as <hi>merciful, righteous,</hi> as well as <hi>gracious,</hi> and he is ready to <hi>pardon the penitent,</hi> so he will <hi>by no means clear the guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, when secure sinners hear of the infinite <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of Christs blood, how satisfactory it is for the sins of the whole world, and therefore much more of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular person, they are willing to perswade themselves

            <p>It may perhaps be here <hi>inquired why since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin is meritorious of punishment, the confession is not of pardon</hi>? for if the <hi>sin</hi> be therefore of so great a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,</hi> because <hi>against God,</hi> why shall not the <hi>acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> be of as <hi>great merit,</hi> because <hi>to God</hi>? The <hi>answer</hi> to which is iustly returned, <hi>partly</hi> that whereas our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions</hi> are <hi>purely sinful,</hi> our <hi>confessions</hi> are not <hi>purely penitent,</hi> since even when we <hi>confess our sins,</hi> we <hi>sin in confessing, partly,</hi> that whereas the <hi>demerit</hi> of the <hi>fault</hi> is chiefly <hi>respectu objecti,</hi> in regard of the <hi>person to whom</hi> the injury is done, the <hi>amends</hi> for the <hi>fault</hi> is <hi>respectu subjecti,</hi> principally considerable in respect of the <hi>person

by whom</hi> it is made: and hence it is that though the <hi>sin</hi> committed by us, bee of <hi>infinite demerit,</hi> because against an <hi>infinite justice,</hi> yet nothing <hi>done by</hi> us, can bee of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite merit,</hi> because wee are <hi>finite persons.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Confession, is not the instrumentall cause of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse</hi>: to clear this the more, be pleased to know, that there is a great deale of <hi>difference</hi> between that which is meerely <hi>conditionall,</hi> and that which is so a <hi>condition,</hi> as it is withall an <hi>instrument</hi>: that may be a <hi>necessary condition,</hi> which is onely required to the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification</hi> of the <hi>subject</hi> on whom the thing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, but that which is not onely a <hi>condition,</hi> but an <hi>instrument,</hi> hath some kinde of <hi>influence,</hi> into the <hi>Production</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> which is conferred, and this being <hi>well observed,</hi> will serve excellently to clear that <hi>Orthodox doctrine of justification by faith alone,</hi> we are <hi>justified,</hi> (a chiefe ingredient, whereof is <hi>forgivenesse of sinnes) onely by faith,</hi> not by <hi>repentance,</hi> not by <hi>charity,</hi> nor by any other <hi>grace or</hi> work, because it is <hi>onely faith</hi> which concurreth as an <hi>instrument</hi> to this work, in as much as it is the <hi>hysope sprinkling</hi> the soul with the bloud, the <hi>hand applying</hi> to the soule the righteousnesse of Christ, for which wee are forgiven, and justified: and hence it is, that the preposition <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Indeed the <hi>glory of God</hi> is much concerned in his being <hi>faithful to forgive,</hi> not only because of the <hi>thing it self,</hi> since if it be the <hi>glory of a man to passe by offences,</hi> much more is it <hi>of God</hi>; but likewise because of his <hi>word</hi> which is passed for granting a pardon, and therefore cannot be <hi>recalled, retarded, impeded</hi>; for if <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>promise</hi> any thing which he doth <hi>not effect,</hi> it must be either for <hi>want

of wisdom</hi> in foreseeing what might be done to prevent it, or for <hi>want of power</hi> to effect what he intends, or for <hi>want of stability,</hi> as if his mind were changed, and his good will altered, any of which if they could be <hi>fastened</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> were an high <hi>dishonour,</hi> and but to <hi>imagine</hi> them is <hi>blasphemy</hi>; that therefore it may appear his <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is infallible,</hi> his <hi>power irresistable,</hi> his <hi>will unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and so his <hi>name</hi> may be <hi>glorious,</hi> he must be <hi>faithfull in accomplishing,</hi> as all other, so this <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>forgiving.</hi>

            <p>When the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith we cannot be altogether <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin,</hi> what should that teach us, but to be so much the more <hi>careful,</hi> and <hi>watchful,</hi> since we daily <hi>gather filth,</hi> we had need to take the more <hi>pains</hi> in <hi>cleansing our selves.</hi> If I cannot <hi>shoot fully home,</hi> when I have <hi>done my best,</hi> I had need <hi>draw the arrow</hi> as far as I can, that I may come the <hi>nearer</hi> to the <hi>mark.</hi> Because my <hi>best knowledge</hi> is mixed with some <hi>ignorance:</hi> have I not reason to <hi>study hard,</hi> that I may attain the more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? seeing do what we can we <hi>shall slip</hi>; is there not cause of the more <hi>warinesse</hi> that we may not <hi>fall,</hi> or at least not <hi>often</hi>? these things <hi>if we say we have no sinne, if we say we have not sinned,</hi> are <hi>written,</hi> that we <hi>sinne not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, when the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith <hi>if we confesse our sins,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53018:180"/>
God is faithful and just to forgive</hi>; for what is this <hi>confession required,</hi> but that we might <hi>not sin</hi>? the truth is, <hi>confession</hi> is required not so much in reference to <hi>sin past,</hi> either to <hi>inform God of,</hi> or <hi>make him amends for it,</hi> but chiefly in reference to <hi>sinne for time to come,</hi> that hereby being the more <hi>sensible</hi> of the <hi>offence, guilt, shame,</hi> and <hi>griefe,</hi> attending, we may be both <hi>inraged</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged</hi> against it; he that by confession <hi>condemneth himselfe for his sinne,</hi> is thereby obliged to <hi>condemn sinne in himself,</hi> and the end of <hi>acknowledging</hi> our sins is, as that the <hi>sinner</hi> may be <hi>absolved,</hi> so that the <hi>sinne</hi> may be <hi>executed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more when the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth and cleanseth from all unrighteousnesse, and Christ is our Advocate and propitiation for our sinnes</hi>; these are <hi>sweet,</hi> yet <hi>strong arguments</hi> to disswade from <hi>sinne.

               <hi>And if any man sin.</hi> The right understanding of this clause, depends much upon the genuine <hi>sence</hi> of the <hi>Verb, sin.</hi> To which end you may please to observe a <hi>threefold</hi> signification of it in Scripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To sin,</hi> is as much at to <hi>live in sin,</hi> and so respects the general course of a mans conversation; In this sence I conceive that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <hi>Them that sin</hi> (that is, saith <hi>Calvin,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>To sin,</hi> is as much as to <hi>do some grosse act of sin,</hi> and

so respects particular falls in the course of a mans life; in this sence <hi>Joseph</hi> maketh these <hi>two</hi> paralell phrases, <hi>doing great wickednesse,</hi> and <hi>sinning against God.</hi> Thus when <hi>Iob</hi> saith of his <hi>sonnes,</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>To sin,</hi> is as much as <hi>to do any thing dissonant to that exact rule which the law of God sets before us,</hi> and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres to frailties and infirmities in this sence (no doubt) is that assertion of the <hi>wise man</hi> to be construed; <hi>there is no man that doth good and sinneth not,</hi> If you ask which of these is here meant,<note place="margin">Eccles. 7.20.</note> I answer</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>former</hi> of these acceptions is by no means here to be <hi>allowed. Christ</hi> is not, will not be an <hi>advocate</hi> for them that <hi>continue</hi> in their <hi>sins</hi>; he saith himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely, <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> to wit, <hi>lying in wickedness</hi>; the <hi>world</hi> of <hi>unbeleevers:</hi> impenitent sinners have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in <hi>Christs intercession,</hi> and indeed it is very obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable to this purpose, how our <hi>Apostle</hi> phraseth this <hi>clause,</hi> so as that <hi>wilful sinners</hi> might have <hi>no hold</hi> of it. For, observe 1. it is set down in <hi>conjunction</hi> with <hi>sin not,</hi> so much the particle <hi>And,</hi> intimateth, implying, that only those who make conscience of the <hi>caveat,</hi> have a share in the <hi>comfort, and if any man sin,</hi> to wit, who endeavoureth <hi>not to sinne.</hi> 2. It is set down with an <hi>if,</hi> he saith, not <hi>because we cannot but sin,</hi> (though this, as you shall hear presently, is his meaning) but <hi>if any man sin,</hi> as if he would intimate, that the <hi>sinning</hi> he speaketh of, is not a <hi>resolute,</hi> but a <hi>casual sinning; if any man sin,</hi> that is, <hi>if it happen</hi> that any man sin, to wit, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides</hi> his <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>course.</hi> 3. It is not in the <hi>future tence, if any man shall sin,</hi> lest that might be an <hi>encouragement</hi> to a man in future indulging to his sins, no, but in the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Aorist, if any man sin,</hi> being only intended to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

            <p n="2">2. The <hi>second</hi> of these acceptions may warrantably be <hi>admited,</hi> as at least an <hi>orthodoxe sence</hi> of these words, and so the verb <hi>sin</hi> in the <hi>former</hi> clause, and <hi>this</hi> may be <hi>construed identically,</hi> or <hi>differently</hi>; either thus, <hi>I write these things that you sin not,</hi> to wit, continue not in your sins, and <hi>if any man sin,</hi> that is, <hi>having left, do fall into sin</hi>; and so the construction is <hi>diverse</hi>; or thus, <hi>I write these things that you sin not,</hi> that is, <hi>take heed of grosse sins,</hi> and <hi>if any man sin,</hi> that is, <hi>happen to commit some gross act of sin,</hi> &amp; so the sence of the verb in both clauses is the <hi>same,</hi> &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this interpretation, here is manifestly implied a <hi>double possibility,</hi> the one of <hi>regenerate persons falling into grosse sins,</hi> and the other of <hi>obtaining pardon for them.</hi>

For <hi>as it covered the Law,</hi> so <hi>Christ the transgressions of the Law</hi>; as <hi>thence God gave answers,</hi> so <hi>by Christ his Evangelical Oracles are revealed</hi>; and as <hi>from thence God shewed himselfe propicious, so is he in Christ well pleased</hi>; but in this last analogy (in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it was called a <hi>propitiatory,</hi> and serveth to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose) though there is a fitnesse, yet not a fulness; for whereas the <hi>mercy-seat</hi> is called the <hi>propitiatory,</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because it had <hi>vim declarativam,</hi> a <hi>declarative vertue</hi> to <hi>signify, Christ</hi> is the <hi>propitiation,</hi> as having <hi>vim effecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam,</hi> an <hi>operative energy</hi> to <hi>procure divine favour,</hi> and therefore was <hi>God pleased</hi> to manifest himselfe <hi>benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> from the <hi>mercy-seat,</hi> because it was a type of <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom he is <hi>propitiated</hi> towards sinners.

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53018:197"/>
if that <hi>Christ</hi> must be in no other sense a <hi>propitiation,</hi> then the <hi>mercy-seat</hi> was; since it is sufficient to make a <hi>type</hi> that there be in <hi>some things</hi> a <hi>similitude,</hi> though not in all things an <hi>aequality,</hi> nor is it any <hi>wonder</hi> if there be more <hi>energy</hi> in the <hi>body,</hi> then in the <hi>shadow,</hi> since the <hi>shadow</hi> is but a <hi>resemblance</hi> of the <hi>body.</hi>

            <p n="2">2 Besides <hi>this allusion,</hi> which no doubt is most <hi>congruous,</hi> to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase, there is <hi>another</hi> more <hi>suitable</hi> to this of S. <hi>John,</hi> and that is in reference to the Sacrifices of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; <hi>attonement.</hi> Almighty <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Law</hi> appointed both the <hi>burnt-offering for sin in generall,</hi> and <hi>trespasse-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for particular sins,</hi> by which being offered up, he became <hi>appeased</hi> towards the sinner. Now all those <hi>Sacrifices</hi> did look at <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>attonement</hi> which was made by them, was not as considered in <hi>themselves,</hi> but as they did <hi>typify Christs death,</hi> and the <hi>propitiation</hi> to be wrought by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That those sacrifices did all of them typify Christ, seemeth to me an undoubted truth,</hi> and that among others for this <hi>reason,</hi> because <hi>by Christs death, they were abolished,</hi> and became <hi>mortua</hi> dead, yea soon after, <hi>mortifera</hi>; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, but deadly, upon this account, that to <hi>continue those Sacrifices,</hi> was to <hi>deny Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That whatsoever efficacy those Sacrifices had towards attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was onely in reference to Christ, must needs follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the former,</hi> since as when the <hi>antitype</hi> is accomplished, the <hi>type</hi> ceaseth, so the <hi>vigour</hi> of the <hi>type,</hi> whilest inbeing, is from its <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>antitype</hi>; in this respect it is that under the legall administrations, the <hi>people</hi> offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, were <hi>minded of Christ,</hi> and beleeving in him, and <hi>God</hi> was <hi>propitiated</hi> by those Sacrifices, as they did <hi>prefigure,</hi> and so as it were <hi>mind him of Christ</hi> to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred up a <hi>reall,</hi> and effectuall <hi>propitiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To close up this, it would not be passed by, how <hi>emphaticall</hi> our <hi>Apostles</hi> expression is, in that he doth not onely say of <hi>Christ</hi> he is <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>There is only <hi>one objection</hi> which carrieth in it a shew of reason, and therefore calls for a <hi>solution</hi>; It is drawn from those <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 3 16. 1 Ioh. 4.9.</note> in which <hi>Gods love</hi> to mankind is set down as the <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>sending Christ into the world,</hi> whereas if <hi>Christs coming into the world</hi> to dye, did <hi>propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate God</hi> for our sins, this <hi>love</hi> of his towards <hi>man</hi> should be the <hi>effect,</hi> not the <hi>cause</hi>; and those <hi>Scriptures</hi> should have <hi>run thus,</hi> not, <hi>God so loved the world that he sent,</hi> but, <hi>God sent his Son into the world that he might love it,</hi> and not in this was the <hi>love of God manifested,</hi> but by this was <hi>the love of God procured,</hi> to wit, the <hi>sending his only begotten Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>untye</hi> this <hi>knot,</hi> you may please to <hi>know</hi> that these <hi>two</hi> assertions are not <hi>irreconcileable; Gods love to us mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to send Christ</hi> to dye, <hi>Christs dying moveth him to love us:</hi> Indeed <hi>the love of God to man is in one respect the cause,</hi> and <hi>in another the effect of Christs death,</hi> and that thus it appeared to St. <hi>John</hi> is plain, in that he puts these <hi>two together</hi> in <hi>one</hi> verse, <hi>he loved us,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This assertion, <hi>Christ is the propitiation for the sins of the whole world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dist.</hi> 1.</note> may be understood, either <hi>exclusively,</hi> or <hi>inclusively,</hi> and in both considerations it is in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or other <hi>true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To say, <hi>Christ is the propitiation for the sins of the whole world exclusively,</hi> imports thus much, <hi>That there is no propitiation for the sins of the whole world, but onely by Christ,</hi> and thus we may take the <hi>whole world</hi> in its <hi>full latitude, pro omnihus &amp; singulis,</hi> and need not feare to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert that there <hi>never was, nor will be any man from the first Adam, to the end of the world, who did, shall, or can obtain propitiation for his sins except through Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 4.24.</note> Indeed <hi>God</hi> (according both to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase) <hi>is a consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 12.29.</note> and <hi>all mankind</hi> being <hi>fallen in Adam,</hi> is as <hi>stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>straw</hi> to that fire which must needs be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by it, <hi>if Christs blood</hi> did not prevent that consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>quenching</hi> the fire of his displeasure. Hence it is that S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith expressely, <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world to himselfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.19.</note> thereby intimating, <hi>That were it not for Christ, the world could not be reconciled to him.</hi> To this purpose it is that the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> speaking of <hi>Christ,</hi> useth a negative proposition,<note place="margin">Acts. 4.12.</note> 
               <hi>neither is there salvation in any other,</hi> and inforceth it with a strong confirmation, <hi>for there is none other name under Heaven, given among men whereby we must be saved,</hi> where that expression <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:53018:203"/>
Heaven</hi> is very observable, as comprizing in it the <hi>whole earth,</hi> which is under Heaven, with all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants therein. It is the promise of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Abraham, That in his seed, should all the nations of the earth be blessed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22.18.</note> that seed St. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds mistically of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Lyra's</hi> glosse is <hi>quia nullus consequitur salutem nisi per Christi be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictionen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3.8. <hi>Lyr. ib.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>because none can attain eternal life but through Christs benediction,</hi> and not much unlike is <hi>Bezas</hi> note on this place. <hi>Christ is the propitiation for the whole world,</hi>

               <hi>ut noverimus nusquam esse salutem extra Christum, that we may know salvation is not to be had any where without Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it is that may be <hi>inferred,</hi> which else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where is <hi>expressed,</hi> that since there is <hi>no propitiation but by Christ, none can pertake of this propitiation, but by faith in him,</hi> and the <hi>strength</hi> of the <hi>inference</hi> is built upon this foundation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whosoever have propitiation by Christ, must bee in Christ,</hi> and therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> whilest <hi>Heathens</hi> they were <hi>without Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.12.</note> and presently addeth in the same verse, <hi>having no hope</hi>; as if he would say, <hi>There is no hope of Salvation for them that are without Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>None but they who beleeve in Chirist, are in Him,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Apostle saith, Christ dwelleth in our hearts by faith,</hi> and those <hi>two</hi> phrases; <hi>being in the faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 3.17.</note> and <hi>Christ being in us,</hi> are used by him in <hi>one</hi> verse, as <hi>one</hi> expository of the <hi>other.</hi> The <hi>result</hi> of both which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions is,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.5.</note> that seeing there is <hi>no propitiation without Christ, and without being in Christ, none can obtain that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, but they who beleeve in Him,</hi> agreeable to which it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>God hath set him forth a propitiation through faith in his bloud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 3.25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed this must be rightly <hi>understood,</hi> and to that end qualified with these distinctions of <hi>seminall,</hi> and <hi>actuall,</hi> of <hi>implicite,</hi> and <hi>explicite</hi> faith, and of <hi>faith in Christ,

               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> 
               <hi>without faith it is impossible to please God,</hi> and that faith is not only to beleeve <hi>that God is</hi> but to beleeve that <hi>he is a rewarder of them that seek him,</hi> which cannot be without some <hi>knowledge of Christ</hi>; since it is onely in an <hi>Evangelical</hi> sense, that he is a <hi>rewarder,</hi> and as he is <hi>no rewarder</hi> of any that seek him, but for <hi>Christs sake,</hi> so none can rightly <hi>beleeve him</hi> a <hi>rewarder,</hi> who is altogether <hi>ignorant of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed when our blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> saith, <hi>This is life eternal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh 17.3.</note>

               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:53018:208"/>To unfold this truth aright, I shall briefly present two things to your consideration:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A price may be said to be sufficient, either absolutely, or conditionally</hi>; a <hi>price is</hi> then <hi>absolutely sufficient,</hi> when there is <hi>nothing more</hi> required to the participation of the benefit but onely the <hi>payment of the money</hi>; and thus we are not to conceive of <hi>Gods ordination,</hi> that <hi>Christs death</hi> should become an <hi>actuall propitiation</hi> without any other <hi>intervenient act</hi> on our part; He <hi>dyed</hi> not in this sense <hi>for any,</hi> much lesse <hi>for all</hi>; when therefore we say, <hi>God</hi> would that <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And hence it is, that though <hi>Christ dying,</hi> suffered that punishment which was designed to be <hi>satisfactory</hi> for the sins of every man, yet <hi>God</hi> doth justly <hi>inflict the punishment</hi> upon the persons of all them who <hi>are not by faith partakers of Christs death,</hi> because it was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to satisfy for them <hi>onely upon cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
