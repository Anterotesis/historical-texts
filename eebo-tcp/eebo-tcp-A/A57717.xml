            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving seen your treatise, and being in the
number of those to whom your discourse is
directed, I do in my own and others behalfs
returne you thanks, for your offer and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to hold forth somewhat for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of those who desire to walke by
rule, and cannot comply with alterations,
great, sudden, and of publick concernment upon such grounds,
as peradventure take with some others.</p>
            <p>In the argument you expresse your self thus, a declaration
hath been lately published, wherein the grounds are exprest of
setling the present government, with which if any be not so far
satisfyed as to think that settlement lawfull, yet even to such is
this discourse directed, which proposeth proofs, that though
the change of a government were beleeved not to be lawful, yet
it may lawfully be obeyed.</p>
            <p>I hope you wil not take offence, if I (having many times read
over, and as I was able weighed your treatise) do acknowledg,
that I am not yet satisfyed in that which is made the busines of

               </gap>
offence to any of different Iudgement, and I am apt to beleeve
that those that are true to the principles of Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
wil not take offence at me for proposing in a peaceable way
the grounds of my scruples, to such a casuist, as if the worke it
self be feasable, may be a probable instrument of clearing that
case wherein he hath appeared, and therin both satisfy the
spirits of many that truly fear the Lord, and be serviceable to
the establishing of the new fabrick, in a more honourable and
lasting way, than the greatest penaltyes can encompasse. For
my self I shall only adde thus much, that I am perswaded; if
you knew, how much unbeleef lodges in my heart, and how great
inconveniencyes I must wrestle with, in case my scruples be
not satisfyed; you would not much doubt, but that I would be as
willing to receive satisfaction, as you have exprest your selfe to
give it. Thus leaving the following lines to your consideration
I rest,</p>

            <head>An Enquiry after further satisfaction concerning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
a change of government beleeved to be unlawfull.</head>
            <p>THe Question is this, whether though the change of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
were beleeved not to be lawfull, yet it may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be obeyed?</p>
            <p>A late Treatise proposeth proofs for the affirmative;
which before we come to examine, it will not be amisse to consider
some things by way of premise towards the clearing of the point in
question.</p>
            <p>And here in the first place let it be considered, whence it is, that this
or that particular person, comes to be a Subject to this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Government or Governour? and this may be foure wayes.</p>
            <p>1. In regard of originall or naturall descent and inferiority. Thus in
the first age of the World, <hi>Cain, Abel, Seth,</hi> and t<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e rest of <hi>Adams</hi>
Children and their Of-spring, were under the government o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Adam</hi>
by naturall right; and this is founded upon the primitive tearms of the
5th. Commandement, <hi>Honour thy Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this head we may referre the subjection of the younger
Brother to the elder as being in ordinary course the Heir of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
government. And thus, with <hi>Chrysostom, Musculus,</hi> and others,
I understand that as spoken by God, to <hi>Cain</hi> the elder Brother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Abel. Gen. 4 7. Vnto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt
rule over him.</hi> The like Phrases are used in the 3d. <hi>chapter v.</hi> 16. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the subjection of the Wife to the government of the Husband.</p>
            <p>2. In regard of some speciall precept or institution of God. So when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
God doth expresly assigne a person to government over a
Kingdom, the Subjects of that Kingdome are thereupon bound to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
that person. So <hi>David</hi> was taken from feeding of Sheep to be
Ruler over <hi>Israel. 1 Sam. 16. 1. The Lord said unto Samuell, fill
thine Horn with Oyle, &amp; go, I wil send thee to</hi> Jesse <hi>the Bethlemit<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for I
have provided me a King among his Sons.</hi> The like we read concerning
<hi>Iesu,</hi> who was in particular appointed by God to be King over <hi>Israel.</hi>
These cases are extraordinary, and the ground of obeying in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
is, that Soveraignty of God whereby he bestows authority on
whom he pleases; exprest by some speciall word, whereby in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50030:4"/>
the title of government may be known to be by divine donation.
<hi>Ier. 27 5. 6. I have made the Earth, the man and the beast that are
upon the ground, by my great power, and by my out-stretched Arm;
and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me; and now have
I given all these Lands into the hand of</hi> Nebuchadnezer <hi>the Ki<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g of</hi>
Babylon <hi>my servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In regard of place. Suppose a man, with his family, goes into
some place which hath neither owner nor Inhabitant: he pla<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and
possesses that place, and hath by right of primitive possession, aut<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ority
to govern in that place; and if afterward any other come to dwell
within compasse of that Plantation he ought to be subject to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and government of the place; and so ordinarily, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Kingdome a man comes into; he is during his abode there subject
to the authority of the place; and here is the proper roome for that
saying, <hi>persona sequitur locum.</hi> And upon this account it is, that the
fourth Commandement enjoynes the governour of a Family or City,
to see that the Sabbath be not prophaned by the stranger that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their gates; for whilst he is within their bounds, he is within their
jurisdiction; and thus the patriarks by soj<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urning in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> became
subjects to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. In regard of consent. When those that are free to dispose of
themselves or others under a Government or Governour, do by such
consent constitute or lay a foundation for Government. Thus was the
originall of the <hi>Romans</hi> under <hi>Romulus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the learned Author of the
Treatise; <hi>de jure Magistratum in subditos</hi> informs us. <hi>A Romulo
populus Romanus creatus fuisse dicitur, quia prius originalis populus
non fuerit sed multitudo quaedam ex varijs gentibus &amp; populis col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecta.
Romulus in has gentes collectitias, non nisi ex ipsarum consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su
dominatus est.</hi> The Scripture gives many instances of the right of
government founded in consent or agreement: amongst others the
case of <hi>Iepthath</hi> is cleer. <hi>Iudg. 11. 8. 11. The Elders of Gilead said unto</hi>
Jephthah <hi>go with us and fight against the Children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>and
be our head over all the Inhabitants of</hi> Gilead, <hi>and the people made
him head and Captaine o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe it is considerable, in what respect the change of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is beleeved to be unlawfull, whether it be:</p>
            <p>1. Only in regard of the end, that those aime at, which do alter the
government. And in this case I conceive, if there be nothing to viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the change but a bad end in the changers; this doth not make it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50030:4"/>
Or 2. In regard of the comparative badnesse of the Government
brought in by change. As if instead of a well regulated monarchy, a
more turbulent democrasie were brought in. In this case I conceive, if
there be no exception against the change, but the bringing in of a lesse
commendable government, this doth not make it unlawfull to obey it.</p>
            <p>Or 3 in regard of the Commission that those have that do alter
the Government. For, if they be not plenipotentiaryes as to such an
act of instituting a new government; that new fabrick will want au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which is the soul of government, &amp; therefore I do not see how
it may be obeyd.</p>
            <p>As put case, in <hi>Eutopia</hi> the <hi>Majestas</hi> or supreme authority lies in 3.
Estates; a Prince, Nobles, and Representers of the Communalty in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
assembled if these by their joynt authority do make very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
alterations in erecting or abolishing Courts, enlarging or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
power of state-Officers. I make no question but in this case
the <hi>Eutopians</hi> may as well without seruple comply with these acts, as
with the other Statute-laws of that Kingdome; because these alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are acts within the compasse of the supreme authority.</p>
            <p>Again put case: these 3 Estates in Eutopia undertake to overthrow
the Fundamentall government, and set up one of those 3 to be the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and instead of the whole fundamental government, if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
were put whether the inhabitants of Eutopia might obey that
single estate as the sole supream, upon a Declaration or act of the 3.
estates to that effect: this I conceive a very difficult case: and the
clear stating of it wil require a man welg inshih<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Eutopian</hi> Government, and well studied in that grand question in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,

            <p>But put case, one of those 3. Estates in <hi>Eutopia</hi> will undertake to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the other 2, and to set up it self solely as supreme; and to Null
laws made by all 3 estates: if one that is not able to comprehend how
this act is within compasse of the commission of that one estate; doth
thereupon beleeve that change of Government not to be lawfull. If
the Question be put, whether one so beleeving may obey that change,
I must confesse I am not satisfyed in the Affirmative, and my reason is
this; Because if that change be not an act of authority it may not be
obeyed, and that it is not an act of authority, seems to me rational up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
obvious inferences from these grounds. <hi>Par in parem non habet
authoritatem. Totum aggregatum est maius qualibet sui parte. Ejus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
est leges abolere cuius est condere.</hi> The English of all which may
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50030:5"/>
be summed up in this: a lesser authority hath no authority over a
greater.</p>
            <p>Again put case, that estate in Eutopia was under a force when it did
decree that change of Governmenr: by reason of which force many
Members were kept away: and one that doth not question the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
power of that estate, doth yet beleeve that the change being made
by that Estate, under that disadvantage of force, is not lawfull. If the
question be put, whether in this case, he that so beleeves the unlawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of that change, may, till he be otherwise informed, obey that
change: I say as in the former case, I am not satisfyed in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
I shall illustrate this case by a supposition nearer home, there is
in the first leaf of the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eif Memento,</hi> the copy of an ordinance, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is exprest, That all Votes, Orders, Ordinances passed in either or
both houses of Parliament, between the 26 of July and the 6 of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
1647. were null and voyd at the making thereof, the Parliament
being under a force and not free. Now suppose that in this space of
time there had passed, in either or both houses of Parliament, a decree
for the chang of Government: suppose further that one that truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
the Parliament, and is of the same judgement with that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the 20 of AVGVST 1647. and knew of the force mentioned
therein; doth thereupon beleeve that change of government to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
if it be asked whether he, so beleeving, may lawfully obey
that change of government, I would answer, no, And my reason is
this; positive precepts do imply negative duty: I mean thus; that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
that sayes <hi>Honor thy Father and thy Mother,</hi> doth as well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
obeying that which is not authority, as command obeying that
which is authority: now that chang of Government (being (according
to the supposition) decreed, the Parliament being under a force) ha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h
nothing at all of authority in it: because the decree is null and voyd
at the time of the making there of.</p>
            <p>Now Reader take the right state of the question along with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the question is not concerning the forbearing of resistance, or concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
some kinde of occasionall compliance, but only concerning obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which is a duty of the 5 Commandement. Nor is the question
in general whether a change of Government may be obey'd, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it may be obeyed by one that beleeves the unlawfulnesse of the
change, nor shall it be questioned for me, whether though a change
of government were beleeved to be in some respect not lawfull, it
may yet lawfully be obeyed, but that which I hold is this, that if the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50030:5"/>
change of a government be beleeved not to be lawfull, for want of
sufficient authoriry in that change, then he that so beleeves may not
lawfully obay it. For this I could produce proofes; But I wave them;
and come now to consider, what the presbyterian proposer offers by
way of proofe.</p>
            <p>And in the first place that Scripture <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. is alledged. Which
Scripture if cleerely opend, and rightly appl<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, would state the
present and many other controversies. And here I grant that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
requires subjection both to authority, and to persons clothed with
that authority, Neither doe I deny, but that Scripture proves sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
due to <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> when they were invested in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
But here the proposer queries the lawfulnesse of their coming
to be invested in their authority, and sayes, that the Souldiers was the
foundation of <hi>Claudiuse's</hi> and of <hi>Neroes</hi> empire: and here I grant
that the Souldiery was the occasion or means by which they came to
be Emperours: But I deny that they received authority from the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery;
they received it from the people or Senat; and they had power
to give it. I toucht before the originall of the <hi>Roman</hi> Power. <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
was the first King, and he raigned by consent of those who had
power to give up their consent. This <hi>Romulus</hi> did institute as the great
councell a Senate consisting of 100 men; Which number afterwards
encreased. The power of the Senate to confirme a supreame Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
may be proved out of <hi>Livius</hi> and other authors. And that
<hi>Nero</hi> had the consent of the Senate is cleere, by what the proposer <hi>p.</hi>
3. cites out of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in these words. The Sentence of the Souldiers
was followed with the consent of the Senate, and then it was not
scrupled in the provinces. And that <hi>Claudius</hi> had also the consent
of the Senate, may be gathered out of approved authors, and is not
denyed by the proposer. I say then that, though the Souldiers could
not give them a legall title, yet the Senate both could and did. That an
unlawfull means and a legall title may meet together, I shall illustrate
by a similitude in an other kind. The Usurer lends a man 100 pound,
and has his bond for the principal and 8 pound interest; the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
dyes; the Executor may pay that 8 pound above the principal: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though the Usurer hath not a morall right to that 8 l. by lending
upon usury, yet he hath a legall title to it by the bond of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
So he that by usurpation encroaches upon a Crowne; if besides
this, he gaines also a legall title; may be obayed upon that legall title,
though not upon the ground of Usurpation. To this purpose is that

to that text Rom 13 doth Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> give to Dr. <hi>Ferne,</hi> his

Certainly they could have no power but that which was given
them by some agreement; if they challengd further it was no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
at all. And afterward <hi>p.</hi> 8. what they got and held meerely by
force without any consent or agreement, was no power, no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>From the Scripture argument the proposer passes to historicall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions
about the interruption of lineall succession to the Crowne in
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I might Answer that, <hi>a facto ad jus non valet argumentum.</hi>
Whatsoever title others have had in former ages, if the title since be
cleere, wee neede not trouble our selves with those observations,
which the proposer sayes, Learned men and states-men have been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of. I shall therefore here only cite some passages out of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
acknowledgment. <hi>Anno 1. Iacobi Regis. Your most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and loyall Subjects, the Lords spirituall and temporall, and the
Commons in this present Parliament assembled, in most humble and
lowly manner doe beseech your most Excellent Majesty, that (as a
memoriall to all posterities, amongst the records of your high court of
Parliament for ever to endure, of our loyalty, obedience, and hearty
humble affection) it may be published and declared in this high court
of Parliament, and enacted by authority of the same, that wee (being
bounden thereunto both by the lawes of God and Man) doe recognize
and acknowledge, that immediately upon the dissolution and decease of</hi>
Elizabeth <hi>late Queene of</hi> England, <hi>the imperiall Crown of the realme
of</hi> England, <hi>and of all the Kingdomes, Dominions, and rights belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the same, did by inherent birthright and lawful and undoubted
succession, descend and come to your most Excellent Majesty, as being
lineally, justly, and lawfully, next and sole heir of the blood royall of
this realme, as is aforesaid, and that by the goodnesse of God almighty
and lawfull right of descent, under one</hi> imperiall Crowne, <hi>your
Majesty is of the Kingdomes of</hi> England &amp;c. <hi>King—And

thereunto we most humbly and faithfully do submit, and obleige our

the first frnits in this high court of Parliament, of our loyaltie and
faith to your Majesty, and your Royall Progeny, and Posterity for
ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proposer likewise cites the judgement of a few divines and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists
for obeying the commands of an Vsurper. And I beleeve those
that abound with books may meet with far more of the contrary
judgement. But because our faith must not stand in the wisdome of
men; and we are upon a case of conscience, wherein the opinions of
men are of smal weight; I judge it superfluous to multiply Authors:
take therefore only 2. for a tast, Mr. Burroughs answer to Dr. Ferne.
p. 7. there is no body here that yet hath attempted to take any power
away from the King that law hath given him. Howsoever the point
of inheritance of conquest can not hinder; for first, none inherits
but that which his Progenitors had, and his Progenitors had no more
originally then by eonsent was given them; therefore the difference
between Kings by Inheritance, and Kings by election, in this case is not
much. And for conquest, that only settles former right, or makes
way to some farther agreement, to adde to what was former; the
right comes not from power to conquer, or act of conquering, but
from some agreement, precedent, or consequent. <hi>de jure Magistratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
p. 27. is qui alienos invadit nullo modo sibi subditos, et si cupiat
juste et ex bono et aequo dominari (sicut de Pisistrato et Demetrio Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laraeo
apud Athenienses legimus) potest tamen jure impediri, etiam ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata
manu, et a quibusvis vel infimae sortis, quibus vim inferre volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit,
quum nullo jure illi obstringantur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the alledging of Authors the Proposer comes again to argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and urging the former Scripture, tells us, it speaks not of obeying
those that shall be powers, but the powers that are, and those that are
in authority.</p>
            <p>I grant it is spoken of the present powers: but who are those?
surely those which are constituted powers, not those which are preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to power. Whatsoever force rises up to hinder the Parliament,
yet the Parliament is a power in being, because it has a legall being. To
this purpose is that which we read in Mr. Burroughs book, intituled
<hi>The glorious Name of God the Lord of Hosts,</hi> which book was printed
by order from a Committee of the House of Commons. In that book
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50030:7"/>
p. 47 he tels us, the Kingdome hath a Parliament in being, untill both
Houses have agreed to disolve it. And in his answer to Doctor <hi>Ferne
p.</hi> 3 He places the Emphasis upon the word power; for thus he writes;
We distinguish between the man that hath the power, and the power
of that man, and say although the power must not be resisted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the letter and sence of the Text, yet the illegal will and wayes
of the Man, may be resisted without the least offending against the
Text.</p>
            <p>To what the proposer demands concerning the covenant, I will on<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
only tell you what is lately publisht by Mr. <hi>Canne</hi> a great patron of
the late proceedings, in his booke against the Covenant <hi>p.</hi> 7. his words
are these. It is not possible that ever this Common wealth should be
setled according to what the Parliament hath lately declared, and the
Covenant duly observed; so incompatible is the one with the
other.</p>
            <p>To the proposers passage concerning heirs and successors in the
Oath of allegiance. I say (with submission to better information)
whereas the office of a King may outlive the race of a King, there are
therefore mentioned not only heirs but successours; that in case heirs
faile, yet Kingship might not dy, and therefore heirs is set first, and
successours after. But of this enough, and it may be also this may
seeme superfluous; for if the proposed alteration goe on, it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
both heirs and successours.</p>
            <p>To the last Quere of the proposer (if I understand the meaning of
it) there may be a sufficient answer pickt out of the last passage which
I cited out of Mr <hi>Burroughs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall therefore here conclude with the councell of the most wise
God, given by the wisest of Men. prov. 24. 21. 22. <hi>My Son, feare
thou the Lord, and the King: and meddle not with them that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
