         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Maiesties great example,
and your Lordships feruent
imitation, to increase in the

in part well fitted. For your
Honour cannot possibly find
in so little a room so much, so

your Lordship acceptable,
considering your small lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,

runne through his authors:
himselfe so briefe as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

what himselfe hath
said, and to haue it vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

and finally, so worthy, as
seeing the glorie of a great
Historian forestall'd by <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,</hi>

more honorable to be (as hee
is) the first among briefe
writers, then one among few

<pb facs="tcp:2509:6"/>
sowrely, without
whom the Criticks fame
had often-times beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
or none at all. In
mine <hi>Hypercriticks,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our countreys
Historie, I haue dealt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as a man desirous to
stirre vp a <hi>Liuie,</hi> or a <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
to our selues. There is
little left testifide touching
him, or rather nothing at

which is, that
hee liued in <hi>Traians</hi> time.
Coniecture propounds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

opinion) and so an <hi>Annaean</hi>
by line (that is, of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish-house,
or family of

<pb facs="tcp:2509:7"/>
who entitle him to bee of

diuinatorie reasons. His
generous, bright, and
flowrie writings (the best
memoriall) are aliue, and
now translated into our
vulgar, with as much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie
as one Englishmans
English could attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

ayme to his meaning,
howsoeuer it may bee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times mist, the diuersity
of Copies, like a change of
the marke, and the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
manner of his stile like
a sudden blast comming
betweene. For this is true,
that there are in FLORVS
sundrie knots, not easie to
<pb facs="tcp:2509:7"/>
vntie, while he, desirous to
speake quick, and close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
our vnderstanding
in him, wanteth roome as
it were, and that scope
which is, hath somewhat
thicke in it, amounting to
a clowdinesse:
<q>—breuis esse laboro,
obscurus fio—</q>
more perhaps, in this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
through corruption
of manuscripts, and Prints,
or of our duller-pointed
wits, then through his
fault, whose writings are
altogether as luminous,
as acuminons.</p>
            <p>First, the names of men,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
nations, places, offices, and
things, peculiar to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
need a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,
<pb facs="tcp:2509:8"/>
which this pocket-volume
will not handsomely
permit, at least-wise not in
present.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the words which
are here and there inserted
in a different letter through
the text of <hi>Florus,</hi> are for
the most part explanatorie
of the authors meaning, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
marginall notes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, one elegancie,
which is almost perpetuall in
him, and answers to the first
similitude, in which hee fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
the whole people of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in the person of a
<hi>MAN</hi> (as the frontispice
sheweth) it lost for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part, throughout the
translation, where the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
number sorts not so well,
<pb facs="tcp:2509:8"/>
but breedes perplexitie, or
obscurenesse.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The doctrines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
which hee followes both in
<hi>Theologie,</hi> and moralitie,
and vpon which the fabricke
of his narrations standeth,
are such as thou art to expect
from an heathen, with whom
<hi>Polytheism,</hi> or pluralitie of
Gods, was an article of faith,
and among whom, <hi>selfe-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
to auoid disgrace, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
an high point of true
magnanimitie, and the like,
which haue small danger in
them now, &amp; their <hi>examen</hi>
will else-where fall out fitly.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The numbers in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
the margine, signifie the
yeeres from <hi>Rome</hi> built,
which these letters, <hi>A. V. C.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:2509:9"/>
doe denotate, that is, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
Vrbis Conditae; in the
yeere of Rome Built,</hi> such,
or such. A discouerie not
worthy of any one, but onely
of them, who are nothing
else in a manner, but meere
English. Necessarie is it here
notwithstanding, for expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the author, who (as
the frontispice, which (with
the helpe of the authors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face)
interprets it-selfe,
vnfoldeth) by a most exact,
and studied method of brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
hath summ'd the whole
time of <hi>Rome</hi> in grosse, and
distributed it into ages, as
<hi>Lactatius Firmianus</hi> (vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE People of
<hi>Rome,</hi> from
King <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
to <hi>Caesar
Augustus,</hi> for the space of
seuen hundred yeeres, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
so many noble deeds
both in peace, and warre,
that if a man compare the
magnitude of their empire
with the number of the
yeeres, hee will thinke it
<pb facs="tcp:2509:12"/>
greater, then for the time.
They displayed their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ensignes so farre, and
wide vpon the globe of the
earth, that such as reade
their performances, may
learne in them, not the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of one people, but of all
mankind: For they were
tossed with so many labors,
and perils, that to establish
their empire, Vertue and
Fortune seeme to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Which thing, though
it be also principally worth
the knowing; neuerthelesse,
for so much as the very
greatnesse it selfe is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to it selfe, and the
varietie of matter makes
the mind abruptly flit from
one thing to another;<note place="margin">Aciem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionis abrumpit.</note> I will
<pb facs="tcp:2509:12"/>
imitate them who draw the
maps of countreyes, and
comprehend the whole
image <hi>of that great Body,</hi>
within as it were a narrow
table: And in so doing,
my hopes are, that I shall
offer vp somewhat towards
the admirable honours of
the whole worlds soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
people, when toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and <hi>yet distinctly</hi> in
it selfe, I shall aduance into
view their empires vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
greatnesse. Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
therefore the <hi>whole</hi>
people of <hi>Rome</hi> were but
as one single person; and
<hi>then</hi> running ouer all their
time, thinke how they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
and how they grew
strong; then, how they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb facs="tcp:2509:13"/>
to a certaine flower
as it were of youth, and
how in a sort they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
waxed old, wee shall
therein find foure degrees,
or <hi>maine</hi> progressions.</p>
            <p>The first reuolution was
vnder kings, for almost two
hundred and fiftie yeeres;
in which space they wrestled
and stroue about their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-citie
with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
This may be the
time of their infancie. The
following period, from the
Consulship of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and
<hi>Collatinus,</hi> to the Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi>
and<note n="*" place="margin">Marcus.</note> 
               <hi>Quintus Fuluius,</hi>
comprehends those two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
and fiftie yeeres, in
which they subdued <hi>Italy.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:2509:13"/>
This was a time most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for manhood, and
deeds of Cheualrie. It may
well be therefore tearmed
their youthfull age. From
hence, to <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi>
are <hi>those other</hi> two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
and fiftie yeeres, in
which he settled peace tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
all the world. And this
compasse of time is the very
Mans estate, and as it were
the strength and ripenesse of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. From
<hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> to our
dayes, there haue not passed
many fewer then two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
yeeres; in which,
through the vnworthinesse
of Emperours, the force <hi>of
the Roman people</hi> waxt
old, as it were, and wasted
<pb facs="tcp:2509:14"/>
it selfe: sauing, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the gouernment of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian,</hi>
their sinewes requicken,
and beyond all expectation,
the old age of the empire,
as if the youth thereof
were restored, growes
greene againe,
and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth.</p>

his waters, and a shee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolfe
following the crye
of the babes, left her yong
ones, and with her teats
discharged towards them
the office of a mother.
And in this plight, found
vnder a tree, <hi>Faustulus,</hi>
the kings shepheard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
them to his farme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
and bred them vp.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2509:15"/>
                     <hi>Alba,</hi> built by <hi>Iulius,</hi> was
then the chiefe citie of
<hi>Latium,</hi> which his father
<hi>Aeneas</hi> had reared. <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
was the foureteenth
king from these, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
his brother <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
of whose daughter
<hi>Romulus</hi> was borne. Hee
therefore, in the first heats
of his youth, chased his
vncle <hi>Amulius</hi> out of the
royall seat, and restored
his grandfather; himselfe
delighting in the riuer,
and mountaines, among
which hee had beene edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
was busied in plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the walls of a new
towne. These brothers
were twinnes; and it was
therefore agreed betweene
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2509:16"/>
them, to make the gods
iudges, which of them
should first enter vpon the
gouernement and rule.
<hi>Remus</hi> tooke his stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
mount <hi>Auentine,</hi> and
<hi>Romulus</hi> vpon mount <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine.</hi>
It was the fortune
of <hi>Remus</hi> to see birds first,
and they were sixe Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<hi>Romulus</hi> saw last,
but had twelue. So hauing
the vpper hand in this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
by bird-flight, he builds
his citie, full of hope, that
it would proue a martiall
one; according as those
birds, accustomed to bloud
and rauine, did portend.
A<note n="*" place="margin">Vallum.</note> trench and rampire
seemed sufficient to defend
the new citie; whose nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rownesse
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2509:16"/>
while <hi>Remus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided,
and leapt ouer, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
thereof, hee was
slaine; whether by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
commandement, or
no, is doubtfull. Certaine
it is, that hee was the first
sacrifice, and consecrated
the new cities fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with his bloud. There
wanted inhabitants. Neere
hand grew a groue, which
hee makes a place of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie;
and thither a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
companie of men
did forthwith flocke, some
of them <hi>Latins,</hi> some shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them some of those
beyond-sea <hi>Phrygians,</hi>
who were vnder <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
and of those <hi>Arcadians,</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:2509:17"/>
who hauing <hi>Euander</hi> for
their Generall, had come
flowing in. Thus of, as it
were diuerse elements he
gathered together one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and himselfe composed
of them the <hi>Roman</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
This was a worke of
Time, the increase of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
was a worke of
Men. Therefore they
sought wiues from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the neighbours;
whom, when they could
not obtaine by suit, they
tooke by force. For they
pretending to make shews
and games on horsebacke,
the maids assembled <hi>from
parts about,</hi> to behold
them, were seised <hi>as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pray.</hi> This ministred
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2509:17"/>
an occasion of present war.
The <hi>Veientes</hi> were beaten,
and put to flight. The <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninensians</hi>
had their towne
taken, and rased; and king
<hi>Romulus,</hi> with his owne
hands, offered vp to <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Feretrius,</hi> the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
spoyles, which he had
gayned from his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<note n="*" place="margin">Acron.</note>King. The gates of
<hi>Rome</hi> were betraid to the
<hi>Sabines</hi> by a silly<note n="*" place="margin">Tarpeia.</note> Virgin,
who had bargayned to
receiue for reward that
which they carryed on
their left hands, doubtfull,
whether shee meant their
shields, or bracelets. They
both to keepe their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and not to suffer her
to escape, ouer-whelmed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2509:18"/>
her <hi>to death</hi> with their
shields. The enemies thus
getting to the walls, there
rose a terrible conflict in
the very entrance, so farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
that <hi>Romulus</hi> was
glad to beseech <hi>Ioue,</hi> to
flay his people from their
shamefull flying. In this
place there is a temple,
and <hi>the statue of</hi> IVPITER
<hi>the Stayer.</hi> At last, they
which had beene rauished,
came <hi>running-in</hi> tearing
their haire, betweene the
two armies, as they were
furiously encountring. So
was peace made with <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
and a league ratified.
There ensued a matter
wonderfull to bee spoken.
The <hi>Sabine</hi> enemies lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2509:18"/>
their ancient seate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
with their whole

and share their horded
riches among their sonnes
in law for portions. Their
<hi>ioynt</hi> forces quickly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
the most wise <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
ordayned this forme
of common-weale. That
the young men, deuided
into tribes, should serue
on horse-back, and watch
in armour, to bee readie
for all sudden occasions of
warre: the councell of
estate should belong to
the old, and ancient, who
for their authoritie should
be called <hi>Fathers,</hi> and for
their antiquitie, <hi>Senators,</hi>
or <hi>Aldermen.</hi> These things
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2509:19"/>
thus established,<note place="margin">A. V. C. XXXVIII.</note> he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

harsh, and rough dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but a tempest rising
with an eclipse of the Sun,
made it seeme like the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of a God-head.
Which opinion, <hi>Iulius Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,</hi>
caused to go present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
currant, by affirming,
that <hi>Romulus</hi> had appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to him in a more maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall

was seene before: that hee
commanded, they should

admirable in the euent. For
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2509:21"/>
three of the one side being
wounded, and two of the

who remayned aliue, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
out his valour with
his wit, faynes himselfe to
flie, so to single forth the
enemie, and then turning
vpon each as they were
able to follow, ouer-came
them all. So (which was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
a rare glorie) the
victorie was gotten with
one mans hand, which hee
forth with stained by parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide.
Hee saw his sister
weepe at the sight of the

But the merit of his

offendor from danger, and
the crime was hidden with
in his valours glorie. Nor

their faith. For, being sent

according to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles

But the politike king, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilius,</hi>
so soone as hee saw

fresh spirit, as if hee had

which did put hope into

answered, That it

Nor was <hi>Tarquinius</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Such ioy was conceiued

for this new freedome, that
they could hardly beleeue

made it lawfull to appeale
from the Consuls to the

of a seeming castle might
not offend, he pluckt down
his house which stood

leuel. But <hi>Brutus</hi> to come

in the mid'st of the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie,
scourged them <hi>first</hi>

free, the first armes

when hee saw the stroake

the plough, did by his

the Consul, <hi>Lucius Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
as he was besieged, &amp;
almost distressed in his

the mid'st of seed-time,
when the officer of armes
sent from the Senate found
<note n="*" place="margin">patrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uni virum.</note>the honourable man
at his plough-worke. From

to passe <hi>reproachful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
vnder the yoke, like
cattle. And so the seruice
ending, he returned home
to his oxen, a triumphall
husbandman. O the
goodnesse of the Gods
how great was the speed!
The warre was all begun,
&amp; ended, within the space
of two and twentie dayes;
that the Dictator might
seeme to haue hastned

with differing euents. The

of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
They of <hi>Fidenae</hi>
were burnt with their

citie of the <hi>Veientes</hi> was
ransackt, and razed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
The <hi>Falisci</hi> yeelded

which was atchieued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2509:39"/>
How great a State the

endured, maketh euident:
this was the first time of
our wintring in tents, of
leuying money vpon the
Commons, to pay a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-campe:
and the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
of their owne free

neuer to rise from before
the citie, till they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

the last act of that cities

The hugenesse of the

Which season, it is

calamities, or glorious for
the proofes they gaue of

is, that the violence of

I may <hi>well</hi> think they were
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2509:41"/>
sent from heauen of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
the immortall Gods
desirous to try, whether
the vertue of the <hi>Romanes</hi>
might deserue the empire
of the world. These <hi>Galli
Senones,</hi> a nation natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fierce, of a wilde beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
their bodies huge
aswell as their warre-like
weapons, were in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
so dreadfull, as they
seemed no other then
borne to destroy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
and beate downe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
In former ages,
when the <hi>Ocean</hi> had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
all, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in an huge plumpe
from the vtmost coasts
of the earth, when they

in their way, and <hi>then</hi> sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themselues betweene
the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and <hi>Po,</hi> nor <hi>yet</hi>

also ouer <hi>Italie.</hi> They
lay now at siege before
<hi>Clusium.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
intercessours, as for
their fellowes, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates.
Ambassadors were
sent, as the manner is: But
what regard hath right, <hi>or

They carrie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
roughly; and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the quarrell, from
thence. Rising therefore
from before <hi>Clusium,</hi> and
comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> the

battell with an armie, at
the riuer <hi>Alia.</hi> The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2509:42"/>
at <hi>Cremera</hi> was
not more piteous. The
<hi>Romans</hi> therefore marke
this day among their black

they forthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
the walls of <hi>Rome.</hi>
There was no garrison.
Then, or else neuer, did the
<hi>Roman</hi> brauerie of minde
appeare. For, so soone as
might be, such of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours,
as had borne high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

<hi>for their Countries

and, <hi>those dire cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
ended,</hi> they were
each of them immediately
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2509:42"/>
put backe againe to their
houses, <hi>before which,</hi> they
seated themselues vpon
their Court-chaires, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled
in their robes of
state, and most honourable
habiliments, that when the
enemie came vpon them,
they might die in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
of their places. The
Priests, and Flamines, did
partly packe vp, in dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fats,
whatsoeuer was most
religiously esteemed of, in
their temples, couering
them vnder ground, and
partly trussed into carts,
transporting it away with
themselues. The Virgins
also of <hi>Vesta's</hi> colledge did
bare-foot accompany their
flying gods. At which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2509:43"/>
time, <hi>Albinius,</hi> one of the
common people, is said to
haue taken his wife &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
out of their waggon,
and placed those virgins
there. So that euen in
those dayes the religion of
the State was more deare
vnto vs, then priuate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Such as were able
to beare armes, whose

for captaine, vp into
the <hi>Capitoll,</hi> praying high
<hi>Ioue,</hi> as if he were euen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
then among them,
that as they were flockt
together for defence of his

protest their valour vnder

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2509:43"/>
                     <hi>Galls</hi> come, at first as men
amazed, finding the gate
wide open, suspitious of
some plot: but when they
found all hush, they enter
disorderly, with no lesse a
cry, then furie. They goe
to the houses, whose dores
stood euery-where open;
and when they beheld the
purple-cloathed Senatours
sitting in their chayres of
state, they worshipt them
<hi>at first</hi> as gods, or locall
Ghosts: but so soone as
it appeared they were
mortall men, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they disdained to
answer, they straightwayes
did <hi>as</hi> absurdly sacrifice, <hi>as

&amp; with fire-brands,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2509:44"/>
yron tooles, and force of

as low as the soile it stood
vpon. Seuen months (who
would beleeue it?) the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
houered about one
hill, hauing not onely by
day, but by night, assayed
all meanes to force it:
whom, when at last they
were mounted vp in the
darke, <hi>Manlius</hi> wakened
with the creaking of a
goose, threw headlong
backe from the top of the
cragge: and to put the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie
out of all hope <hi>of
staruing them,</hi> hurled
loaues of bread from the
castle, to make a show of
confidence, though their
famine was extreme. And
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2509:44"/>
vpon a certaine set day hee
sent forth <hi>Fabius,</hi> through
the middest of the enemies
guards, to performe a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
sacrifice vpon mount
<hi>Quirinal:</hi> who, by the
<hi>meere</hi> awe of religion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
vntoucht through
the thickest of the leaguers
weapons, and brought assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
backe, that they had
the gods their friends. At
last, when the barbarous
were tyred now with their
owne siege, contented to
sell their departure at a
thousand pound weight of
gold, and then also putting
in a sword ouer and aboue
their bargaine, into the
false ballances <hi>they weighed
by,</hi> insolently iustifying it
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2509:45"/>
by this cutting quippe, <hi>Woe
to them who are ouercome,
L. Camillus</hi> suddenly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayles
them at their backs,
and made such slaughter
<hi>among them,</hi> that all the
characters of destruction,
which fire had printed in
the citie, were blotted out
with the inundations of
the bloud of the <hi>Galls.</hi>
We may well giue thanks
to the immortall gods in
the behalfe it selfe of so
great a calamitie. That fire
and flame which destroyed
<hi>Rome,</hi> buried the pouertie
of <hi>Romulus.</hi> For what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

burning, but prouide, that
the citie which the Fates
ordained to be the mansion

seat of men, &amp; gods, might
not seeme to haue beene
consumed, or ouer-whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but hallowed, and
expiated rather? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
after <hi>Rome</hi> was thus
defended by <hi>Manlius,</hi> and
deliuered by <hi>Camillus,</hi> it
rose vp against bordering
nations more eagerly and
vehemently then before.
And to begin at those very
<hi>Galls</hi> themselues, shee, not
satisfied with hauing dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them out, beyond her
walls, but drawing after
her the ruines of countries,
wider ouer <hi>Italy,</hi> did so
bunt and pursue them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Camillus,</hi> as that at this
day there remains no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>step
of such a people as the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2509:46"/>
                     <hi>Senones,</hi> Shee made one
slaughter of them at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>Anien,</hi> where <hi>Manlius,</hi>
in a single combat, tooke
from the aduersarie cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
a <hi>Torques,</hi> or chayne
of gold. Thence were the
<hi>Manlij</hi> by-named <hi>Torqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</hi>
Another time shee had
the execution of them in
the <hi>Pontin</hi> fields, where
<hi>Marcus Valerius,</hi> in a like

of his armes; &amp; of that

were entituled <hi>Coruini.</hi>
Nor as yet giuing ouer, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labella,</hi>

if their obstinacie,
after six breaches of league,
and many notable ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes,
they were still
more stomachous. All
these things notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
the <hi>Romans,</hi> in fiftie
yeeres space, by <hi>the conduct
of</hi> their <hi>Fabij,</hi> and <hi>Papirij,</hi>
the fathers, and the sonnes,
did so subdue, and tame
them, and so razed downe
the very ruines of their
cities, that <hi>Samnium</hi> is at

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:2509:50"/>

at the Forkes of <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,
Veturius,</hi> and <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humius,</hi>
Consuls. For our
army being drawne by stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem,
and shut vp within
such a fastnesse, as out of
which it could not escape,
<hi>Pontius, captaine generall of
the</hi> Samnits, amazed at his
owne aduantage, asked
counsell of <hi>Herennius,</hi> his
father, who as an old soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
wisely bade him, either
to let all goe free, or to kill
them all. But hee, <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neither of the courses,</hi>
contented himselfe with
<hi>only</hi> disarming, and passing
them <hi>naked</hi> vnder forkes,
or gallowses; and so they
neither became friends as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2509:51"/>
                     <hi>in thankefulnesse</hi> for a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
and yet after the
foule dis-honour, greater
enemies then euer. The
Consuls therefore, by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
yeelding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
back <hi>to the</hi> Samnits,
came gloriously off from
the infamie of that league;
and the <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers
crying for reuenge, to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirius</hi>
their <hi>new</hi> Generall,
fell to raging (an horrible
thing to be spoken) with
their drawne swords, vpon
the very way it selfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to fight;
and in the battell (as the
<hi>Samnits</hi> themselues gaue
it out) the eyes of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
were on a bright
blaze of fire; and neuer

gaue ouer killing, till they

and a luckie signe giuen of
fetching home triumphs
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2509:54"/>
from beyond sea. <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>

<hi>Lucania,</hi> aswell renowned
for greatnesse, fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and a port, as admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in its situation: for
placed at the very entrance

fitly sends forth shipping
for our coasts, for <hi>Istria, Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum,

Africa,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sicilia.</hi> There
lookes vpon the harbor, in
prospect of the sea, the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
theater, the originall
cause of all her calamities.
They were then at their
solemne sports, when the
fleet of <hi>Roman</hi> gallies was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2509:54"/>
from thence espi'd to row
by the shore: and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

the <hi>Tarentines</hi> hurrie out,
and pell mell enter vpon

hereupon, ambassadours
from <hi>Rome</hi> brought a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint;
but they violate
their persons also, after a
lewd fashion, and filthy to
be spoken. Thus rose the
warre. Dreadfull were the
aduersaries preparations,
when so many nations stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at once on behalfe of
the <hi>Tarentines;</hi> and fiercer
then they all, king <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi>
who as in defence of that

her <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
was <hi>Greekish,</hi> came at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Thessalie, Macedonia,</hi> of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants
(till that time vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne)
of sea, of land,
men, horse, armour, and
the terrour of <hi>those</hi> wilde
beasts added. The first
battel was at <hi>Heraclea,</hi> and
<hi>Liris,</hi> a riuer of <hi>Campania,
Laeuinus</hi> Consul: which
was so desperately heady,
that <hi>Obsidius,</hi> captaine
of the <hi>Farentan</hi> troupe,
chargeing king <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
home, disordred, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
him, hauing first
cast away his ensignes, or
notes of a king, to abandon
the fight. There would
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2509:55"/>
haue beene an end, had not
the elephants come forth,
a sight of wonder, &amp; made
their race into the battell,
whose hugenesse, hideous
shape, strange smell, and
braying noise, amazed the
horse, and seeming huger
then they were, through
being vnacquainted-with,
put the armie in rowt, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
farre, and neere, and
made a monstrous hauock.
The secund battell at <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi>
in <hi>Apulia</hi> was more
fortunate, <hi>Fabricius,</hi> and
<hi>Aemilius,</hi> Consuls. For
by this time the feare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
of the elephants
was worne away, and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius</hi>
Minucius, a speare in
the fourth legion, cutting
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2509:56"/>
one of their trunkes off,
had made it appeare, that
they were mortall. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the iauelins were dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thicke at them also:
and firebrands hurld into
the towres, ouerwhelm'd
all the aduersaries squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
with the fall of their
burning workes: nor was
there any other end of the
ouerthrow, but that
which night made by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
king <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
last of them who
fled, being wounded in the
shoulder, was borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
armed, by his guard.
The last battell was in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania,</hi>
neere the fields
which they call <hi>Aurusin,</hi>
vnder the same Generals,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2509:56"/>
as before. And that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
which vertue was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to haue giuen heere,
for an vpshot, or clozing
victorie, fortune gaue.
For the elephants being
brought againe into the
vantgard, one of them a
yong one, being grieuously
wounded in the head with
a weapon,<note n="*" place="margin">auertit.</note> turn'd taile:
and as in flying, it rusht
thorow, ouer the bodies
of friends, and bemoned
it selfe in braying, the dam
knew it, and as it were to
take reuenge for her foale,
started out <hi>of her ranke;</hi>
then filled all with feare, &amp;
affright round about, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
then as if they
had been her aduersaries: so
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2509:57"/>
the same beasts which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away the first day
cleere, and made the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund
indifferent, gaue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the third past contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie.
But the warre with
king <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was not in
the fields abroad with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
onely, but with wit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and at home within the
citie. For the cunning
prince, after hee had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the first victory, hauing
well felt what manner of
men hee had to deale with
in the <hi>Romans,</hi> despaired
to preuaile by force, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
himselfe to deuices.
For hee burnt the slaine,
vsed his prisoners louingly,
and sent them home free
without ransome. And in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2509:57"/>
the necke of that, dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ambassadours to <hi>Rome,</hi>
labour'd by all possible
meanes to be admitted as a
friend. But the <hi>Roman</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
approued it selfe then
for excellent, in warre, and
peace, abroad, &amp; at home,
in all points: neither did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any victorie rather
show the valour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the high wisdome of
the <hi>Senate,</hi> and the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
slenders, then the
<hi>Tarentine.</hi> What kind of
men were trampled to
death in the first battell by
the elephants? all their
wounds were forward,
some found dead vpon
their enemies bodies, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
mans hand his sword,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2509:58"/>
threatnings left vpon their
browes, and anger liuing in
death it selfe. Which <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi>
so admired, that hee
said, <hi>O how easie were it for
mee, to become lord of the
world, if I were captaine of
the</hi> Roman <hi>souldiers, or
for the</hi> Romans, <hi>had they
mee for their king!</hi> And
what speed made they
who suruiued the first o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow,
in renforceing
their powers? when <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi>
said; I see as sure as can
bee, that I am borne vnder
the constellation of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi>
for that so many
more heads as I haue slain,
spring out of their owne
bloud, as it were out of
<hi>Lernas</hi> serpent. And what
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2509:58"/>
a <hi>Senate</hi> was that? when
vpon the oration of <hi>Appi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the <hi>Blinde,</hi> the kings
ambassadours who were
sent backe out of the citie
with their gifts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents,
confest to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi>
vpon his demand of what
they thought concerning
the enemies seat, <hi>that the
citie seemed a temple, the
Senate a parliament of
kings.</hi> Againe, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men were the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
themselues in camp?
when <hi>Curius</hi> sent the kings
physician back, who made
offer <hi>in secret,</hi> for a certain
summe to poyson him,
and <hi>Fabricius,</hi> hauing the
choise giuen <hi>by Pyrrhus,</hi>
refused to share a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2509:59"/>
with him. Or what
were they in time of peace?
when <hi>Curius</hi> preferred his
earthen dishes before the
<hi>Samnits</hi> gold; and <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
vsing Censorian seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
condemn'd it for rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
in <hi>Rufinus,</hi> a Consula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
nobleman, because hee
had siluer plate, in all to a
tenne pound weight. Who
wonders now, if the people
of <hi>Rome,</hi> with such quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
courages, and martiall
discipline, obtained victory;
or that by this one <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
warre they should in
foure yeeres space bring
into subiection <hi>(as they
did)</hi> the greatest part of all
<hi>Italy,</hi> most puissant nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
most rich common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2509:59"/>
&amp; most fertill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys?
Or what doth so
much surpasse beliefe, as
when you compare the
beginnings of the warre
with the conclusion? <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi>
conquerour in the
first field, harrased tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Italy, Campania, Liris,</hi>
and <hi>Fregellae,</hi> came within
ken of <hi>Rome,</hi> then almost
taken, as he beheld it from
the castell of <hi>Praeneste,</hi> and
within twentie miles off,
filled the eyes of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
citie with smoak, and
dust. The same prince, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
twice <hi>after that</hi> to
quit his campe, twice
wounded, and beaten ouer
land, and sea, into his
<hi>Greece</hi> againe; peace, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2509:60"/>
quiet, and the spoiles,
which were gotten from
so many the richest nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
so infinite, as <hi>Rome</hi>
was not wide enough to
containe her owne victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
For there neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
a more glittering, or
more goodly triumph, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
before this time, shee
had beheld nothing but
the cattell of the <hi>Volsci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

the<note n="*" place="margin">carpenta.</note> chariots of the

<hi>Rome</hi> saw nothing, which

it, that whereas they
could not come at it by

of them at the same time,
and with equall affections,
and forces, hauing in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

their associates, that
was the colour, but in very
deed spurred on with loue
of the prey (though the
newnesse of the attempt
troubled them, yet valour
is so full of confidence)
this rude, this shepheardish
people, and meere land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
did <hi>well</hi> shew, that
manhood made no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
whether it fought
on horse-back, or on ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord,
vpon the earth, or

Consul, they first
aduentured into those
streights which had beene
made hideous with poë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
monsters, and where
the current was violent;
but they were so farre
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2509:71"/>
from being deterred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
that they made vse of
the furie of the hurrying
tide as of a fauour: <hi>for fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

forthwith set vpon <hi>Hiero,</hi>
king of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> with such
celeritie, that himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
hee found himselfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
before hee saw
the enemy. <hi>Duilius,</hi> and
<hi>Cornelius,</hi> Consuls, they
durst also fight at sea. And
the speed then vsed to
build, and rigge a nauie
was certainely a signe of
speeding. For within three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
dayes after the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was fell'd, an <hi>armada</hi>
of one hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
saile, ridde at anchor
<hi>out of it;</hi> so that they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2509:71"/>
not the worke of ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights,
but as if by a kind
of metamorphosis, the
gods had turned them
such, and changed trees to
vessels. But the report
which goes of the fight is
maruelous, where these
slugges, and heauie bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
seized vpon the
quick and nimble nauie of
the aduersaries, who were
much more cunning at sea,
so farre as skill to shift aside
oares, and to dally out the
strokes of beake-heads, by
yare, and readie turning.
For the hands of yron, and
other the <hi>grappling</hi> engines
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the enemie
made much sport at, before
the battels ioyned; but
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2509:72"/>
were then compelled to
trie it out <hi>in good earnest,</hi>
as if they had fought on
firme land. Thus giuing
the ouerthrow at the Iles
of <hi>Liparae,</hi> their enemies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada
either sunke, or fled,
this was their first sea-tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
The ioy whereof,
how great was it? when
<hi>Duilius,</hi> Captaine generall
in that seruice, not thinking
one daies triumph enough,
did neuer come home from
any supper, so long as hee
liued, but hee would haue
torches borne lighted, and
flutes play before him, as if
hee triumphed euery day.
The losse, in regard of so
great a victorie, was but
light. The other of the

Consuls, <hi>Cnaeus Cornelius
Asina,</hi> entrapt by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
vnder colour of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
&amp; so surprised, became

Drepanum, Panormus,

were once in great feare of

of <hi>Camarina,</hi> but
through the excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Calpurnius Flamma,</hi>
a tribune of souldiers, wee
escaped. For hee, with a

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2509:73"/>
which hee had taken,
and meant to haue made

play, till our whole armie
was gotten out of danger.
By which his so prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

the citie <hi>Carala,</hi> and so

or <hi>Paenish-men,</hi> as
well by land, as sea, that
nothing now was left to be

selfe. <hi>Marcus Atilius Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
sayled with warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord
him into <hi>Africa.</hi> Yet
there wanted not some,
who fainted at the terrible
name which the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
seas had gotten. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
the tribune also, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
<hi>by his feare</hi> this
fearfull conceit, till the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
menacing him with
the naked axe, vnlesse hee
obeyed, made him take
heart, and put to sea, for
feare of his head. They
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2509:74"/>
forthwith plyde it with
oare &amp; saile: and the feare
of our comming was such
among the <hi>Paenish-men,</hi>
that <hi>Carthage</hi> had almost
set open her gates, and been
taken. The first reward of
this martiall voyage was
the taking of the citie <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea</hi>
(for that stands first in
sight vpon the <hi>Punick</hi> shore
like a fort, and sentinell)
and aboue three hundred
castles, besides the same,
were sackt, and rased. Nor
fought they only with men
but with monsters also; for
a serpent of prodigious big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and bred as it were to
take vengeance on behalfe
of <hi>Africa,</hi> vext our campe
at <hi>Bagrada.</hi> But <hi>Regulus,</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:2509:74"/>
who conquerd all things,
hauing spred the terrour of
his name farre, and neare,
multitudes of their youth
slaine, their captaines dead
at his foot, or fast in chains,
his nauie fraighted with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
spoiles, which he had
sent heauie laden away to
<hi>Rome,</hi> as stuffe for triumph,
laid siege to the chiefe seate
of that warre, <hi>Carthage</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and lodged close at

wheeld about a little,
only that <hi>Rome</hi> might haue

it, whose greatnesse is for

For the enemies turning
themselues to make vse of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2509:75"/>
forreine aids, the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
sent them <hi>Xantippus</hi>
for a Generall, who being
most expert in the Art of
warre, gaue vs a grieuous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow,
&amp; the most stout
<hi>Regulus</hi> himselfe (a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
which had neuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the <hi>Romans</hi> before)
fell aliue into the enemies
hands. But he was a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to beare so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse:
For his mind could
neither be conquered by
imprisonment, nor with the
message he vndertooke; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
quite contrary to that
which hee had in charge
from the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> he
deliuered his opinion <hi>in the</hi>
Roman <hi>Senate,</hi> That they
should not make peace, nor
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2509:75"/>
yeeld exchange of prisoners.
But neither was the maiesty
of the man embased by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
returne to the foe,
<hi>in discharge of his honour,</hi>
nor finally, by captiuitie,
nor by nayling on a gibbet
for punishment: nay, all
these things increased the
admiration of him. For what
other thing was all this else,
then that the vanquisht did
triumph ouer the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shers;
and though not ouer
<hi>Carthage,</hi> yet ouer fortunes

more eager, &amp; more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely
bent to take reuenge
for <hi>Regulus,</hi> then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe
victory. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
therfore bearing their crests
aloft, &amp; the warre comming
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2509:76"/>
back into <hi>Sicilia, Metellus</hi>
Consul made such a slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the enemie at <hi>Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
that there was no more
stirre in that Iland. An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of a most braue day
gained, was the seisure of an
hundred and twentie ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants:
a great prey, had
such an heard been gotten,
not by warre, but by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
<hi>Publius Claudius</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull,
the <hi>Romans</hi> were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
not by the enemie,
but by the Gods the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,
whose ceremonies they had
contemned, their nauie
forthwith sinking in the
place, where he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the birds to be cast
in, because they had giuen
signes he should not fight.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2509:76"/>
                     <hi>Marcus Fabius Buteo,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
met the enemies nauie
in the <hi>African</hi> sea, about
<hi>Aegymurus,</hi> sailing onward
to the inuasion of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
ouerthrew it. O how great
a triumph perished vtterly
at that time, by stresse of
weather! when the pillage
of the enemies ships, driuen
by diuerse winds, filled the
shores of <hi>Africa,</hi> the <hi>Syrts,</hi>
the coasts of all nations,
and the Ilands <hi>about,</hi> with
wrecks, and ruins. A migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
losse, but it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some respect to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the prince of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie
was intercepted by
tempest, and the triumph
miscarried by shipwracke.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2509:77"/>
And yet when the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>
spoyles floated vp &amp;
downe, and were split vpon
all the capes of land, &amp; Iles
about, the <hi>Romans</hi> triumpht
notwithstanding.<note place="margin">A. V. C. DXII.</note> 
                     <hi>Lutatius</hi>
Consul, an end was made of
this warre at the Ilands cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Aegates.</hi> A soret sea-fight
was there neuer; for
in the enemies armada was
their prouant, their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces,
their engines, their
weapons, and as it were all
<hi>Carthage;</hi> which burthen
was their bane: the <hi>Romans</hi>
nauie, yare, light, vnincum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
in one kind like a land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe,
and in another, like
a fight on horsebacke, they
were so guided with their
oares, as with bridles, &amp; the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2509:77"/>
gallies themselues seemed
liuing creatures, their
prowes, and beakes nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
fitted to strike here,
or there, at pleasure.
The enemies vessels there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
torne to pieces in a
trice, couer'd all the sea
with their shipwracks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Sicilia,</hi> and <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
So exceeding great
was that victorie, as no
question was moued <hi>now</hi>
about razing the bulwarks
of their enemies townes. It
seemed friuolous to rage
against the castell, &amp; stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls
<hi>thereof,</hi> when <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>

but so farre beyond the

the sides sustained, hee
would rather thinke the

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2509:82"/>
noble <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were
ashamed, seeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
thrust out of the
seas possession, and their
Ilands violently taken
from them, and they to
pay tribute, who were
wont to impose it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<hi>Annibal,</hi> then a boy,
bound himselfe by oath to
his father before the altar,
to take reuenge; wherein
hee was not slacke. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to beget matter for a

the ground, an ancient
rich citie of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and a
great, but grieuous moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her truth, and faith
to the <hi>Romans;</hi> whose

seeking causes of new
quarrels, ouerthrew to the
ground, with his owne, and
others hands, that by
breach of peace hee might
open <hi>Italy</hi> for himselfe.
The <hi>Romans</hi> make not a
greater conscience of any
thing then of keeping the
faith of leagues. Vpon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement
therefore that
their confederate citie was
besieged, they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
runne to their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,

choose to assay by way of

choose which of them you
like best, and take it among

words the voice went
round, hee should giue
them at his pleasure, which
he would; Bee it war then,
said he; and therewithall
flinging open the skirts of
his robe, in the midst of
the Counsel-house, which
hee had gather'd hollow,
and held vp till then, hee
did it with such an horrour
as if hee had indeed powr'd
warre among them out of
his lap, or bosome. The end
of this war was sutable to

from the snowie toppe of

After this ouerthrow

<hi>Sempronius</hi> Consul. There
the craftie enemies, in a

(a wonder to bee spoken)
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of the South,

The fourth, &amp; the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

but through the greatnesse
of the blow which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
there, it got to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
at the cost of fortie
thousand liues. In that
place the General himselfe,
earth, heauen, the day, and
all things else consented to
the fall of that vnfortunate
army. For <hi>Annibal</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to haue put counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit

moreouer in the open

did beat hottest, the
dust was infinite, and the

his battels, that the <hi>Romans</hi>
standing with their faces
towards all these disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages,
himselfe had the
whole fauour of the skie,
the winde, the dust, &amp; sun
at once to fight for him.
The enemies therfore were
so glutted with the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of two most mighty
hosts, that <hi>Annibal</hi> himself
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2509:87"/>
bade his souldiers, <hi>spare the

Bumilcar's</hi> sonne, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to haue said) <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
had as well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
how to make vse of
his victory, as how to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it. But, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
voice goeth, either
the fate of <hi>Rome</hi> ordain'd
to bee empresse of the
earth, or <hi>Annibals</hi> euill
<hi>Genius,</hi> or the Gods of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
now auerted, carried
him a diuerse way. <hi>For</hi>
when hee might haue put
his victory home, he rather
made choise to enioy it, &amp;
suffred <hi>Rome</hi> to rest, while
hee progrest to <hi>Campania,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Tarent,</hi> where both he,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2509:88"/>
and his armie lost, by, and
by their spirit so, as it was
truly said, that <hi>Capua</hi> was
<hi>Annibals Cannae.</hi> For him
whom neither the <hi>Alps,</hi>
nor force of armes could
daunt, <hi>Campania</hi> alone, and
the delicate warme springs
of <hi>Baiae</hi> did (who would
beleeue it?) subdue. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
the <hi>Romans</hi> tooke
breath, and rise as it were
from death to life againe.
Weapons wanted: they
tooke them downe out of
the temples. Fresh souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
wanted: they minister
the oath of warre to their
bondmen, and make them
free. Treasure wanted: the
lords of the counsell bring
gladly all they had, leauing
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:2509:89"/>
no gold to themselues,
but what was in their
brooches, belts, and rings:
the knights, and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
followed the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
example, and the
comoners the gentlemens:
to bee briefe, <hi>Leuinus,</hi> and
<hi>Marcellus</hi> Consuls, such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of riches was
brought <hi>together</hi> out of
priuate contributions for
the publike seruice, that the
eschequer had scarcely
bookes, and clerks enow
to enter the particulars.
What shall we say of them
<hi>at this time,</hi> in the choise of
magistrats? how great was
the wisdome of the centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or hundred-men, when
the yonger sort askt cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2509:89"/>
of the ancient, whom they
should nominate for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls?
For it stood them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not to deale with faire
force onely against so cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
an enemie, who had so
often beaten them, but to
meet with him also in his
owne policies. The first
hope of their empires re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie,
and, as I may say,
reuiuall thereof, was <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
who inuented a new
method of vanquishing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,
Not to fight.</hi> And
from hence it was, that in
happie time for <hi>Rome</hi> hee
got the nick-name, to bee
called, <hi>The draw-backe,</hi> or
<hi>Cunctator:</hi> and from hence
it came, that the people sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him, <hi>The shield of the</hi>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:2509:90"/>
state. Hee therefore so
ground and punned <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
by coasting him tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
all <hi>Samnium,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of <hi>Falernus,</hi> and <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
that whom plaine
strength could not breake
in pieces, delay might fret,
and weare. Soone after,
<hi>Claudius Marcellus,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
they durst <hi>also</hi> encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, came hand to
hand, draue him out of his
<hi>Campania,</hi> and forced him
to rayse his siege from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Nola.</hi> They durst in
like sort, <hi>Sempronius Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
Generall, pursue him
thorow <hi>Lucania,</hi> and set
vpon his backe in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat;
though, O the shame!
the <hi>Romans</hi> were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:2509:90"/>
to fight with the hands
of their bondslaues. O the
horrible confidence of a
people, among so many
aduersities! O the high
haughtinesse, and brauerie
of their spirit, in their so
extreme &amp; afflicted estate,
that being doubtfull of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<hi>Italy,</hi> they durst not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
tend to other
places; and when their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
flew vp and downe
at their throats, ouer all
<hi>Campania,</hi> and <hi>Apulia,</hi> and
made halfe <hi>Afrike</hi> in <hi>Italie,</hi>
did both at one time beare
the brunt of his assaults,
and at the same time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
forces into <hi>Sicilia,
Sardinia, Spaine,</hi> and other
parts of the world. <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:2509:91"/>
was sent into <hi>Sicilia,</hi>
which held not out long:
for the power of the whole
Iland was put apart into
one citie. <hi>Syracusae,</hi> that
great, and till that time, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered
chiefe-towne,
though defended by the
wit of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> did
yeeld at last. Her treble
wall, alike number of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
her hauen of marble,
and her fountaine <hi>Arethu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi>
so farre renowned, what
auayled they other then
thus farre onely, that the
citie was spared, in respect
of her beautie? <hi>Gracchus</hi>
seized <hi>Sardinia:</hi> neyther
did the wildnesse of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,
nor the monstrous
cragges of their <hi>mad</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2509:91"/>
(for so they were
called) stand them in <hi>any</hi>
stead. A terrible course
was taken with their cities,
and with their Citie of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<hi>Caralis,</hi> that the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong
nation, scarce worth
killing, might bee tamed
at last with the lacke of
their natiue soyle. The
two <hi>Scipio's, Cnaeus,</hi> and
<hi>Publius,</hi> sent into <hi>Spaine,</hi>
had pluckt away <hi>once</hi> all
hope from the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
but lost their hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
being destroyed by
the cunning inuentions of
the aduersarie. The <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio's</hi>
had gotten indeede
great dayes, when they
gaue ouerthrowes; but the
one of them was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2509:92"/>
and slaine by their
dangerous deuices, as hee
was busie to entrench; and
the other <hi>of them,</hi> hauing
fled into a tower, was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> round about
with fire-brands. That
<hi>Scipio</hi> therefore, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht
with an armie into
<hi>Spaine,</hi> to reuenge his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and his vncles death,
was the man to whom the
fates decreed so great a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
out of the conquest
of <hi>Africa,</hi> recouered all
<hi>Spaine,</hi> that braue martiall
countrey, ennobled for
cheualrie, and men of the
sword, that seed-plot of
the enemies armies, that
schoole-mistresse of <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
himselfe; <hi>he conquered</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:2509:92"/>
all of it, I say (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
to say it) from the
pillars of <hi>Hercules</hi> to the
Ocean, and I know not
whether more speedily, or
more easily: the speed,
foure yeeres speake; the
easinesse, one onely citie
manifesteth, being taken
vpon the same day in
which it was besieged; and
it was a fortunate signe of
<hi>Africa's</hi> conquest <hi>to ensue,</hi>
that <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi>
was so easily taken. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it is notwithstanding,
that the admirable conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
of the Generall was
of greatest force to subdue
the prouince: for he resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their yong sonnes, and
daughters, were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2509:93"/>
so pleasing, or faire, <hi>back</hi>
to the barbarous, without
permitting them to come
in his sight, that hee might
not seeme to haue once sipt
or skimd the honour of
their chastitie so much, as
with beholding them. This
was <hi>then</hi> the carriage of
the <hi>Romans</hi> in diuers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
abroad, who yet, for
all that, could not be rid of
<hi>Annibal,</hi> who stuck close to
them in the bowels of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie;</hi>
for most nations had
reuolted vnto him, and
himselfe, a most smart and
excellent captaine, vsed
<hi>Italian</hi> forces against <hi>Italy.</hi>
We neuerthelesse had tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him out of most of her
townes and countries. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentus</hi>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:2509:93"/>
came in againe of it
selfe. <hi>Capua,</hi> the seat, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
house, and the other
<hi>as it were, Carthage</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
was now also gayned
backe, the losse whereof so
greatly grieued the man,
that thereupon hee turned
all his strengths vpon <hi>Rome.</hi>
O people, worthie to bee
lords of the earth, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of all fauour, and to
haue the gouernment of
the affaires of men, and
gods! Driuen to the worst
of feares, yet gaue they not
ouer their enterprise, and
doubtfull how to keepe
their owne citie, they, for
all that, quitted not <hi>Capua,</hi>
but entrusting a part of
their armie to <hi>Appius</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2509:94"/>
and the residue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Flaccus</hi> into <hi>Rome,</hi>
they fought where they
were not, as well as where
they were. Why wonder
we therefore? For <hi>Annibal</hi>
encamping within three
miles of <hi>Rome,</hi> was resisted
by the Gods (nor will I
shame to confesse it) I say
by the Gods themselues,
because such store of raine
fell at euery remoue of his,
that he seemed put backe
by diuine prouision; not as
in defence of heauen, but
to keepe him off from the
citie-walls, and <hi>Capitol.</hi> Hee
therefore departed, &amp; fled,
and retired into the farthest
nooke of <hi>Italy,</hi> hauing done
all he could against <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:2509:94"/>
sauing only giuen it assault.
It is but a trifle to speake of,
but yet of much efficacie,
to shew the magnanimitie
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in that the
very field it selfe, where
<hi>Annibal</hi> encamped, being,
during the siege, set to sale,
found a chapman. On the
other side, <hi>Annibal,</hi> to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
their confidence, cryed
the goldsmiths row in the
citie, but no man would
buy of him. And thus we
may see there were presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
enow. But so great
vertue of men, and so much
fauour of the Gods came to
nothing. For <hi>Asdrubal,</hi>
brother of <hi>Annibal,</hi> came
out of <hi>Spaine</hi> with a new
armie, new strengths, new
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:2509:95"/>
weight of warre. <hi>Rome</hi> had
beene vndoubtedly quite
ruined, had that man ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with his brother: but
<hi>Claudius Nero,</hi> and <hi>Liuius
Salinator,</hi> vtterly distrest
him as he was encamping,
<hi>Nero</hi> kept <hi>Annibal</hi> off in
the farthest corner of <hi>Italy.
Liuius</hi> marcht with ensigns
spred, into the quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
quarter, that is, vp to
the very iawes of the first
descence from the <hi>Alpes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Italie,</hi> the distance as
great, <hi>from our other camp,</hi>
as all the length of <hi>Italie.</hi>
It is not easie to say, with
what high wit, and speed,
the two Consuls vnited
their campes, and giuing
battell to <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2509:95"/>
aware <hi>of that vnion,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroid
him vtterly, <hi>Annibal</hi>
al this while not once drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
what was done. Sure
it is, that when the newes
came to <hi>Aniball,</hi> and hee
saw his brothers head tost
out before his trenches, I
acknowledge (quoth hee)
the vnluckines of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
This was the mans first
confession, not without a
sure presage of the fate
which hung ouer his head.
And now it was certaine
out of <hi>Anibals</hi> own mouth,
that <hi>Aniball</hi> might be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished.
But the people of
<hi>Rome,</hi> full of confidence, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so many fortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
held it a gallant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to make an end of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2509:96"/>
the quarrell, with the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
enemie they had, <hi>and
that</hi> at his owne home, in
<hi>Africa.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A. V. C. DXLIX.</note> 
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> therefore
captain general, they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
thither the whole
weight of warre, beginning
to imitate <hi>Aniball,</hi> and to
pay him <hi>backe</hi> in his <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
for the mischiefes hee
did in their <hi>Italy.</hi> O yee
Gods! what forces of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druball,</hi>
what armies of
king <hi>Syphax</hi> did hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw?
what, and how
great were those two
camps, which hee in one
night consumed with fire?
To conclude, hee was not
now within three miles of
<hi>Carthage, as Aniball had
beene of Rome,</hi> but battred
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2509:96"/>
besieged gates themselues
therof: and thereby wrung
<hi>Aniball</hi> out of <hi>Italie,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which hee lay hard,
and heauie. Since <hi>Rome</hi>
stood, there was neuer a
grater day then that, in
which, two the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
captaines that euer
were before, or since, the
one of them, conquerour
of <hi>Italy,</hi> the other of <hi>Spain,</hi>
confronted each the other
in battle-ray. But <hi>yet</hi> they
came <hi>first</hi> to a parley about
articles of peace: <hi>at which</hi>
both of them stood a good
while without speaking a
word, as if mutuall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
had fixt them to the
ground. But when they
could not agree vpon a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:2509:97"/>
peace, the trumpets sound
a charge. It is cleare, by
confession of both parties,
that no armies could bee
better marshall'd, nor any
battell be sorer fought, as
<hi>Scipio</hi> reported of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal's</hi>
armie, and <hi>Anibal</hi> of
<hi>Scipio's.</hi> But <hi>Aniball</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
gaue place,
and <hi>Africa</hi> became the
conquerours reward, and,
after <hi>Africa,</hi> the whole
earths empire also.</p>

old,</hi> the eastern world, <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes,</hi>
and <hi>Darius,</hi> came then
to minde, in whose dayes
mountaines were cut tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and the sea was couerd
with failes. Besides this,
certaine prodigious signes
which seemed to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
somewhat from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
bred terrour; for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>
at <hi>Cumae</hi> was in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
sweate. But this
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2509:101"/>
was nothing else saue
the God-heads agonie in
fauour of his <hi>beloued
Asia.</hi> Nor, to say truth,
did any countrey so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
with mony, riches,
and munition, as <hi>Syria:</hi>
but they were <hi>all</hi> in the
hands of so cowardly a
king, as could glorie in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, then that hee
was ouercome by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.
Antiochus</hi> was thrust
into this warre, vpon the
one side by <hi>Thoas,</hi> chiefe of
the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> seeking <hi>in
vaine</hi> to draw the <hi>Romans</hi>
into an honourlesse league
with him against the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians;</hi>
and vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side <hi>Annibal,</hi> who <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
foil'd in <hi>Africa,</hi> a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2509:102"/>
also, and impatient
of peace, sought ouer the
world where to finde out
an enemy of the <hi>Roman</hi>
people. And what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of danger might that
haue proued, had that king
giuen himselfe ouer to his
directions? if <hi>Annibal,</hi> now
quite downe, had beene
trusted with the power of
<hi>Asia?</hi> But <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
relying vpon his owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
and the title of a
king, held it enough that
hee moued warre <hi>by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Europe</hi> did now
without controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the <hi>Romans. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
demanded backe
the citie of <hi>Lysimachia,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the coast of <hi>Thrace,</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:2509:102"/>
built in <hi>Europe</hi> by his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
as a parcell of his
inheritance. With this as
it were starre, or constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the tempest of the
<hi>Asian</hi> warre being stirred,
kings assembling in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie
number; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
brauely giuen, when
<hi>Antiochus</hi> had thus wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all the humours of
<hi>Asia</hi> with wonderfull
noise, and tumult, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
himselfe to sports, &amp;
wanton pleasures, as if hee
had already gotten the
garland. The Iland <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baea</hi>
was diuided from the
maine land with <hi>Eurypus,</hi>
a narrow sea hauing many
ebbes, and flowes. here <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
pitching his paui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2509:103"/>
of silke, and gold,
hard vpon the brinke of
the murmuring sea, at the
sound of flutes, and other
musick, and though it were
winter, yet had hee roses
brought fresh from all
parts, and lest hee should
in nothing seeme to play
the captaine, he tooke mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of fine young boyes,
and girls. Such a king
therefore as this, whom his
owne riotous humours
had already conquer'd, the
people of <hi>Rome,</hi> assailing
that Iland, by <hi>Marcus
Atilius Glabrio,</hi> Consul, at
the very first bruit of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
was glad to flie the
place. And albeit he had
gotten to so notable a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2509:103"/>
steepe passage as that of
<hi>Thermopylae</hi> (euer to bee
glorious in the death of
those three hundred <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians)</hi>
yet not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to trust that strength
the <hi>Romans</hi> made him giue
way aswell at land, as sea.
Without delay he returns
into <hi>Asia. The charge of
his</hi> nauie roial hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>Polyxenes,</hi> and
<hi>Annibal.</hi> For <hi>himselfe</hi>
could not endure so much
as to looke vpon a fight.
So his whole force at sea
was torne in pieces by the
gallies of <hi>Rhodes, our Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius
Regillus their</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral.
That <hi>Athens</hi> may
not flatter it selfe, we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Xerxes</hi> in <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:2509:104"/>
in <hi>Aemilius</hi> wee matcht
<hi>Themistocles,</hi> and did as
great an exploit in taking
<hi>Ephesus,</hi> as the <hi>Greekes</hi> did
in taking <hi>Salamina.</hi> At that

brother, that <hi>Scipio Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus</hi>
who had so lately
conquer'd <hi>Carthage,</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
voluntary vnder him
there, as lieutenant gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
it seemed good to
make an end of that warre.
The king was already bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
out of the sea, but wee
goe farther. Our campe is
pitcht at the riuer <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and the mountaine
<hi>Sipylus.</hi> It is incredible to be
spoken what powers of his
owne, and of his friends
the king had there. Three
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2509:104"/>
hundred thousand foot,
and not a lesse number of
horse, and of seithed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots;
besides these, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
of an huge size, glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
in gold, purple, siluer,
and their owne iuorie,
stood as bulwarks on both
hands of the battell. But
all these preparations were
hindred by their owne
<hi>confusiue</hi> greatnesse, and
with a showre, which
powring suddenly downe
did, most luckily <hi>for vs,</hi>
wet, and weaken the strings
of the <hi>Persian</hi> bowes.
There was first a feare, by
and by a flight, and then a
triumph. <hi>Antiochus</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
it pleased the <hi>Romans</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:2509:105"/>
to vouchsafe him peace, &amp;
a piece of his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
so much the more
willingly, because hee had
so easily giuen it ouer.</p>

(for it was but foure yeeres

of the other two, the least
in labour. For the fight
was not so much with the
men, as with the citie it
selfe, the euen whereof
was certainely the greatest
that could bee: for it made
an end of <hi>Carthage.</hi> To
comprehend in minde the

<hi>it was thus,</hi> in the first, the

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2509:114"/>
it was driuen away <hi>out
of our coasts,</hi> in the third it
was ended. The cause of
this <hi>last</hi> warre was, for that,
contrary to the articles of
league, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
had once prepared an army
at land and sea, against the
<hi>Numidians,</hi> and often terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
the borders of <hi>Masi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassas</hi>
kingdome. Wee bare
fauour to this good and
friendly king. When the
war was settled, the Senate
debated what should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of <hi>Carthage. Cato,</hi>
whose hatred admitted no
satisfaction, would haue it
vtterly rased: but when the
Consull demanded ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
opinion, <hi>Scipio Nasica</hi>
stood to haue it preserued,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:2509:115"/>
lest the feare of a riuall ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
remoued, the felicitie of
<hi>Rome</hi> might growe <hi>ouer-ranke,</hi>
and riotous. The
<hi>Senate</hi> made choise of a
middle way, <hi>which was,</hi> to
remoue the citie out of her
old seate. For nothing see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to them more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
then to haue <hi>such</hi> a
<hi>Carthage</hi> as should not bee
feared. <hi>Manilius</hi> therefore,
and <hi>Censorinus,</hi> Consuls, the
people of <hi>Rome</hi> inuading
<hi>Carthage,</hi> the nauie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
(which vpon ouerture of
peace they willingly yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
was, in sight of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
fired. Then calling
foorth the princes, they
commanded them, vppon
perill of their heads, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:2509:115"/>
the countrey. Which
blacke decree kindled so
great choler in them, as
they resolued to endure the
worst that could be, <hi>rather
then obey it.</hi> Lamentations
<hi>hereupon</hi> did forthwith fill
the citie, and the crie went
round, To ARMES, the
finall resolution beeing,
whatsoeuer came of it, to
rebell. Not for that they
had now any hope left <hi>to
free themselues,</hi> but because
they held it better that
<hi>Carthage</hi> should bee ruind
by their owne hands, then
their enemies. The furie
of the rebels may be conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
by this, that they
pluckt downe house-tops,
and houses, <hi>with that tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:2509:116"/>
to build a new nauie;
for want of yron &amp; brasse,
their smiths wrought gold,
and siluer into armour; and
the matrons clipt the haire
of their heads to make cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
for engins. <hi>Mancinus</hi>
Consull, the siege waxt hot
both at land, and sea. The
hauen of the fortifications,
and the first, and second
wal were dismantled, when
the castle notwithstanding,
called <hi>The Byrs,</hi> made <hi>such</hi>
a resistance as if it had been
another citie. Though
there was no doubt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowing
it, yet the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio's</hi>
seemd ordaind by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie
for that purpose. The
people therefore of <hi>Rome</hi>
require to haue a <hi>Scipio</hi> for
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:2509:116"/>
accomplishing that warre.
And that was the sonne of
<hi>Paulus,</hi> conquerour of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
whom the sonne of
that great <hi>Scipio Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
had adopted, to vphold
the glory of his house, with
this intention of the fates,
that the citie which the
grandfather had humbled,
the grand child should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert.
The enemies <hi>being</hi>
shut vp within the castle,
the <hi>Romans</hi> sought also to
cut off the sea. But the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi>
digge out a new
hauen vpon another side of
the towne, not to flie out
at, for no man did beleeue
they could escape, but from
the which a new armada
issued, as if it had growne
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2509:117"/>
vp <hi>suddainely of it selfe.</hi>
Meane-while no day, nor
night went ouer their
heads, in which some new
worke, some new engine,
some new band of forlorne
fellowes appeared not, like
<hi>so many</hi> sodaine flashes of
flame rising out of cinders,
after the fire hath been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in ouerwhelming rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish.
But things at last
growing absolutely despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
fortie thousand men
yeelded themselues, and,
that which you would

was the first man <hi>of them.</hi>
How much more boldly

and it being vncertain
whether hee did not also

it with his tongue. <hi>Metellus</hi>
therefore, chiefely busie in
ordering the affaires of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
had now this also
added to his charge, to take
reuenge. From hence grew

his first forces, through
the open fields of <hi>Elis all
along</hi> the bankes of <hi>Alpeus.</hi>
One battell made an end of
the warre. And now the
citie it selfe was begirt with
a siege, when, as the fates
would haue it, <hi>Mummius</hi>
came to the victory, which

Finally, the inhabitants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning

no part of the world

<hi>Spaine</hi> neuer had a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition

vs, nor at any time
a minde to put all her

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2509:120"/>
and with the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> hils,

had enstraitned her
before she was aware there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<hi>and was</hi> of all other
prouinces the onely one,
which neuer vnderstood
her owne abilities till shee
was conquerd. The warre
lasted here almost two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres, from the times
of the first <hi>Scipio's</hi> till <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
Augustus,</hi> not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
or cohaerently, but
as causes were ministred:
nor with <hi>Spaniards</hi> at first,
but with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi>
or <hi>Penish</hi>-men in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
Thence grew the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2509:121"/>
of the warres. The first

inuaded <hi>Spaine</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge

as far as <hi>Gades,</hi> &amp;
the shores of the <hi>Ocean.</hi>
Ther is more in it, to keepe
a prouince, then to make

were sent with forces hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

yet <hi>such was their noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to make a peace with
him also, when they might
haue had the killing of all
his army to a man. But
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> no
lesse ashamed, nor stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
lesse at the reproach
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2509:126"/>
of these conclusions of
peace with the <hi>Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi>

themselues from the
dishonour of that base

<hi>Mancinus</hi> to the enemie.
But Generall <hi>Scipio,</hi> one
throughly season'd for the
ouerthrow of cities by the
burning of <hi>Carthage,</hi> grew
hot at length vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.
But hee had more
worke within his owne
campe, then in the open
field; with his owne men,
then with the <hi>Numantians.</hi>
For his armie hauing <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
other captaines</hi> beene
formerly tired with dayly,
and iniust, but specially
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2509:127"/>
seruile labours, such of
them as knew not how to
vse their weapons, were
commaunded, <hi>for their
ease who knew the vse,</hi> to
carry more stakes, and
earth to the rampire, and
<hi>that</hi> those should be rayed
with durt, who would not
be smeared with bloud. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that, strumpets, sculli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and all things else
which were not of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
to be vsed, were cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
It is a saying, that
<hi>Such as the captaine is, such
is the souldier.</hi> The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
thus reduced vnder
discipline, encounters the
enemie, and then came
that to passe which no
man did euer hope for; the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2509:127"/>
                     <hi>Numantians,</hi> in sight of all
men, ranne away. They
would likewise haue yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themselues, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
would haue beene
<hi>but</hi> tolerable for men to
accept. But nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
<hi>Scipio,</hi> sauing a
real, and absolute victorie,
they in such extremities
resolue to make a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
sallie, after they first
had feasted well, as at their
last viands, with halfe-raw
flesh, and a kinde of broth,
or drinke made of corne,
and called by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
keale, or <hi>Caelia.</hi> This
resolution of theirs disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer'd
to <hi>Scipio,</hi> hee would
not afford, to men so min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the fauour of battell,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2509:128"/>
but girts them vp close
with foure camps, and
hemming them round
within trench, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terscarph,
they besought
him for fight, that so hee
might dispatch them like
men. But when that
would not bee granted,
they agree to rush out
howsoeuer, and comming
so to handy-strokes, very
many of them were slaine;
and famine now comming
fast vpon <hi>the residue,</hi> they
liued yet a little longer.
Their last helpe was to
flie, but their wiues brake
their horse-bridles, and
committing an heinous
offence through loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft
them of that remedy.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2509:128"/>
Their end therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now no longer to bee
deferred, their sufferance
turnes into furie, decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among themselues to
die in this manner: They
made away their captains,
themselues, and towne
with the sword, with poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and with setting all on
fire. Goe thy wayes, O
thou most valiant citie of
the world, and in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
most happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
in the very worst that
happened vpon thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, for protection of
thy friends thou didst de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
thy selfe with thine
owne hand, and for so
long a time, against that
people which had all the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2509:129"/>
earth to backe, and beare
them out. To conclude,
the citie which was <hi>thus</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the greatest cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnder heauen, lest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it selfe for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to reioyce in ouer it.
For, there was not a man
of all <hi>Numantia</hi> left aliue
to bee trail'd in chaines;
spoile, and bootie, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
poore folkes, there
was not any; their armor,
&amp; munition were burnt.
So all the triumph which
could bee had, was ouer a
name alone.</p>

his goods that he did so.
The people therefore of
<hi>Rome</hi> entring vpon the
whole estate, retain'd it not
by fight, &amp; force, but (which
is more iust) by vertue of
his deuice, and testament.
It is hard to say, whether
they lost this legacie, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer'd

a yong fierce prince, &amp;

hee seis'd by force.
He had the slaghter also of

But the kingdome
of <hi>Numidia</hi> gaue to it selfe
a great blow, and though
<hi>Anibal</hi> was rid out of the

in him which was to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
for he, the most false &amp;
crafty prince vnder heauen,
ventured vpon the people
of <hi>Rome,</hi> glorious, for great
acts, and not to be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the sword: and yet
things fell out beyond all
mens imaginations, that he
the king, who surpast all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in cunning, should
himselfe bee surprised by
cunning. This prince, gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d-child
to <hi>Masinissa,</hi> and by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
the son of <hi>Micipsa,</hi>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:2509:134"/>
moued to it by ambition of

to murther his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and yet not fearing
them so much as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and people of <hi>Rome,</hi>
vnder whose protection,
and wardship they were,
wrought his first black feate
by practice, and vpon that
plot geting <hi>Hiempsals</hi> head,
as hee was contriuing how
to kill <hi>Adherbal also,</hi> and
hee flying to <hi>Rome</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
<hi>Iugurtha</hi> by soundly
monying his Ambassadors,
<hi>to bribe others with,</hi> drew
<hi>euen</hi> the Senate also to take

first victory which he gaind
of vs. Afterwards, when
<hi>Scaurus</hi> was appointed by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2509:135"/>
the state to make partition
of the kingdome betweene
himselfe, and <hi>Adherbal,</hi> he
conquerd the noble quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Roman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale
by corrupting
him, and effected thereby
his vndertaken wickednesse
the more boldly. But hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
acts neuer lye hidden
long. The bribing of <hi>Scau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
came to light, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
was made to reuenge
the parricidiall murther by
warre. <hi>Calpurnius Bestia,</hi>
Consull, was the first em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploid
into <hi>Numidia.</hi> But
the king, experimentally
knowing, that gold could
doe more against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
then Iron, bought
his peace. Guilty of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2509:135"/>
premisses, hee notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
both came vpon sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and safe-conduct to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and with like audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
suborning the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
murthered his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor
in the kingdome,
<hi>Massina</hi> grand-child of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinissa.</hi>
This was another
cause for the <hi>Romans</hi> to take
armes vp against the tyrant.
The reuenge therefore was
committed to bee taken by
<hi>Albinus.</hi> But (ô the shame!)
<hi>Iugurtha</hi> so ouerbribed his
armie also, that our men
voluntarily giuing way, he
got the victory, and our
camp withall; and reckning
it in as a part of the price,
that hee suffered the armie
which he had bought, to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2509:136"/>
escape his hands, did put
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs dishonorable terms.
At the same time, <hi>Metellus</hi>
steppeth out against him,
not so much in reuenge of
the <hi>Roman</hi> empire, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
the blemishes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and dealing most cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly,
one while by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
another while by
threats, and fayning flight
when hee meant nothing
lesse, matcht him at his own
weapons: nor contenting
himselfe with the waste, &amp;
desolation of fields, and
villages, made attempts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the chiefe fortresses of
<hi>Numidia,</hi> and long time
sought to get <hi>Zama,</hi> though
in vaine: neuerthelesse hee
sackt <hi>Thala,</hi> where the kings
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2509:136"/>
munition, and treasures lay.
So hauing stript him out of
his cities, hee pursued him
through <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and
<hi>Getulia,</hi> flying his owne
confines, and kingdome.
Last of all, <hi>Marius,</hi> much
augmenting the armie, as
hauing, according to the
obscuritie of his birth,<note place="margin">A. V. C. DCXLII.</note> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the scumme of <hi>Rome</hi>
to the oath of soldiers, sets
vpon <hi>Iugurtha</hi> wounded as
he was, &amp; already forced to
flie, and yet ouer-came him
no more easily then as if he
had beene fresh, and vnbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
This man most fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
mastred <hi>Capsa,</hi> a citie
dedicated to <hi>Hercules,</hi> sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the middle of <hi>Africa,</hi>
enuironed with sands, and

serpents, and scaled <hi>Mulu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha,</hi>
built vpon a steepe
mountaine, a certaine <hi>Ligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
leading vp to it vpon
break-necke clifs, and high
ouer-hanging places; and
gaue to <hi>king Bocchus,</hi> who
for kindreds sake tooke his
part, a terrible ouerthrow at
<hi>Cirta. Bocchus</hi> thereupon
distrusting his owne estate,
and fearing to be drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another mans ruine, as
accessarie, indented for his
owne peace, and safetie at
the perill of <hi>Iugurtha.</hi> So
that most false and slipperie
man, by his father in Lawes
practices ensnared, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traid
into the hands of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</hi>
Thus in the end the

that citie, which he like

the <hi>Ocean</hi> hauing swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2509:139"/>
their countreyes,
sought newe habitations
where they could finde
them out, through the
world: and being bard all
entrance into <hi>Gall,</hi> &amp; <hi>Spain,</hi>
they wheeling about to <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi>
sent their ambassadors
to <hi>Silanus,</hi> where hee lay
encamped, and from thence
to the <hi>Senat,</hi> entreating that
martiall common-weale to
allot them out some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of land, in stead
of pay; for which they
should <hi>alwayes</hi> vse the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of their hands, and
swords, at their good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
But what land should
the <hi>Roman</hi> people diuide
among them, who were
ready to goe together by
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2509:140"/>
the eares among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
about lawes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the allotting out of
grounds? Their petition
therefore being reiected,
what they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
by entreaties, they
concluded to winne by
force. Nor could <hi>Silanus</hi>
hold out against them in
the first brunt of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
nor <hi>Manilius</hi> in
the second, nor <hi>Caepio</hi> in
the third. They were all
of them defeated, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
out of their tents, and
trenches. They had made
an end of vs, had not <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
hapned to liue in that
age. Yet euen hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
not daring presently
to encounter them, held
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2509:140"/>
his souldiers within their
strength, till that inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rage, and furious on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,
which goes current
with the barbarous for
true valour, fell. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they marcht about
back, craking, and vpbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vs, and asking in scorn
(so confident they were of
sacking the citie) what
they would haue home to
their wiues. Nor more
slowly then was menaced,
they rusht thorow the
<hi>Alps,</hi> that is to say, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
barres of <hi>Italy,</hi> in three
maine battels. <hi>Marius</hi>
makes wondrous speed <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and out-stripping the
enemy, by shortest cuts
ouertakes the <hi>Theutons,</hi>
                     <pb n="254" facs="tcp:2509:141"/>
who had the vantguard,
at the very climbe of the
<hi>Alps,</hi> in a place called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae
Sextiae,</hi> and quite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strest
them in their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
security. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
was master of the
valley, and riuer, and our
men had no water <hi>to
drinke</hi> at all. Whether
<hi>Marius</hi> tooke that <hi>drie</hi>
ground of purpose, or
turn'd by wit his errour to
aduantage, is doubtfull to
say, but courage inforced
by necessity, was for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
the cause of victorie.
For his army crying out
for water, <hi>Yee are men</hi>
(quoth hee) <hi>and there it is:</hi>
they fought therfore with
such courage, &amp; made such
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2509:141"/>
slaughter of the <hi>enemies,</hi>
that the <hi>Romans</hi> hauing
the day, dranke not more
water out of the colour'd
riuer, then they did of the
bloud of the barbarous.
Surely, king <hi>Theutobocchus</hi>
himselfe, who was wont to
vawt ouer foure, or fiue
horses let together, had
scarce any time to get one
now for himselfe to flie
away vpon, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apprehended in the
next forest, was single an
whole shew himselfe,
being a person of so huge
an height, as hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topt
the tropheas selues.
The <hi>Theutons</hi> vtterly
<hi>thus</hi> destroide, hee turnes
vpon the <hi>Cimbrians.</hi>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:2509:142"/>
(who would beleeue it?)
clambring ouer at the crags
of <hi>Tridentum,</hi> through the
snow, which makes it win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all wayes on the <hi>Alps,</hi>
and raiseth them higher
then naturally their ridges
are, came rolling down vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Italy</hi> in plumps. They
attempted to passe the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>Athesis,</hi> not by bridge,
or boat, but according to
their lubberly wits, assaid
to stop it first with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
but when they saw
they could not stay the
streame with their hands,
and targets, they plasht
downe trees, and so crost
ouer: and had they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
set on towards the
citie, the perill had beene
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2509:142"/>
extremely great. But in the
<hi>Venetian</hi> grounds, whose
mould is in a manner the
finest of all <hi>Italie,</hi> the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse
of the ayre, and soile
entendred their spirits; and
being otherwise well soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the vse of bread,
sodden flesh, and sweete
wines, <hi>Marius</hi> in very good
season sets vpon them: they
praid him to assigne them
a day of battell, which hee
named to be the next of all.
They ioyned in a most
spacious champaine called
<hi>Caudium,</hi> and there one
hundred, and fortie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of them left their
liues: so they were fewer
now <hi>in the whole first num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
by another third. They
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2509:143"/>
had the execution of the
barbarous for an whole
dayes space. These also
taught our captaine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
to piece out manhood
with martiall cunning, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
<hi>Anibal,</hi> and his artes
at <hi>Cannae:</hi> for hauing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
with, a mistie day, &amp;
by that <hi>an</hi> aduantage to
charge them at vnaware, &amp;
the same a windie one also,
which might serue to carry
the dust into their eyes, and
faces, <hi>Marius, making vse
of all,</hi> ranged his battell
towards the rising Sunne,
so that the brightnesse, and
repercussion of the beames
vpon <hi>our</hi> helmets, made
the heauens seem as if they
were on fire, as was by and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:2509:143"/>
by, afterwards vnderstood
by the captiues, nor was it
a lesse worke to ouercome
their wiues, then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
For hauing made
a <hi>barricado</hi> about them
with carts, and waggons,
they strooke at vs from
aloft, as it were from towr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toppes,
with slaues, and
lances. Their death was
as gallant as their fight.
For when the ambassage
which they dispatched to
<hi>Marius,</hi> could not obtaine
liberty <hi>at his hands,</hi> and
priesthood (nor was it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
they euery-where
strangled their infants, or
pasht out their braines, and
either, one of them kill'd
the other, or making
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2509:144"/>
halters of their tresses
of haire trust themselues
vp by the necks, vpon
boughs, or the rails of their
carts. King <hi>Beleus</hi> fighting
couragiously was beaten
downe dead, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his will. The <hi>other</hi>
battell <hi>consisting</hi> of the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurins,</hi>
which had taken
vp the smaller hils of the
<hi>Norick Alps,</hi> as it were for
a back, or succour to their
fellowes, betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to base flight, and
trading in robberies, slipt
away whither they could,
and vanished. These so
glad, and glorious newes,
concerning the libertie of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and the deliuerance
of the empire, came <hi>first</hi> to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:2509:144"/>
the peoples eares not by
men, as the manner is, but
(if it be not against religion
to beleeue it) by the Gods
themselues. For the same
day, vpon which the thing
was done, young men
crown'd with laurel, were
seene before the temple of
<hi>Castor,</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
letters to the Praetor,
and a common rumour
without a knowne author,
luckily ran in the theater,
The <hi>Cimbrians</hi> are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
Then which thing
what could be more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
or glorious? for <hi>Rome,</hi>
as if lifting her selfe <hi>on tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe,</hi>
vpon her owne hils, she
had beene present at the
sight of the battell, the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2509:145"/>
people, as is vsuall in a shew
of sword-players, clap
their hands in applause, at
the self-same instant in
which the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> were
ouerthrowne in battell.</p>

The first king of all these
nations, and countreys
was <hi>Atheas,</hi> afterwards
<hi>Artabazes,</hi> who descended
of the seuen <hi>Persians.
Mithridates</hi> comming of
him, was the mightiest of
<hi>them</hi> all. For whereas foure
yeeres serued against <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi>
&amp; seuenteene yeeres
against <hi>Anibal,</hi> he resisted
fortie yeeres, till finally
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:2509:147"/>
subdued in three huge
warres, the felicity of <hi>Sulla,</hi>
the vertue of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and
the mightinesse of <hi>Pompei,</hi>
brought him to nothing.
Hee pretended <hi>for</hi> the
cause of his hostility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lieutenant <hi>Cassius,
Nicomedes</hi> of <hi>Bithynia,</hi>
whom hee charged with
inuading his confines.
But the truth is, that
blowne-out with ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hee coueted the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie
of all <hi>Asia,</hi> and, if
hee could, of <hi>Europe</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Our vices gaue him
hope, and confidence
vnto it. For being diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
among our selues
with ciuill warres, the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
opportunitie allured
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:2509:148"/>
him and <hi>Marius, Sulla,</hi> and
<hi>Sertorius</hi> laid that remote
side of the empire open.
In these wounds of the
commonweale, and amidst
these tumults, this sudden
whirlewinde of the <hi>Pontick</hi>
warre, as if taking aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the times, blew
from off as it were the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
watch-towre of the
Northerne world at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
vpon vs, being both
wearie then, and diuerse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distracted. The first
blast of this warre swept
away <hi>Bithynia from vs</hi> in
a trice. Then the like
terrour fell vpon <hi>the rest
of Asia.</hi> Nor were the
cities, and nations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
slow in reuolting to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2509:148"/>
the king. And hee was at
hand, and prest <hi>them</hi> hard,
vsing crueltie as a vertue.
For what was more dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dire, then that one edict
of his, by which hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
all men thorow
<hi>Asia,</hi> who were free of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to be massacred? At
that time certainely, hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
temples, altars, and all
<hi>sorts of</hi> lawes, <hi>aswell</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
as humane, were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated.
But this terrour
vpon <hi>Asia,</hi> vnlockt <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
also to the king.
By <hi>Archelaus</hi> therefore,
and <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> hee
disseised vs <hi>there</hi> of all,
excepting <hi>Rhodes onely</hi>
(which held for vs more
firmely then the rest) of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2509:149"/>
                     <hi>the Iles of</hi> the <hi>Cyclades,
Delos,</hi> and <hi>Eubaea,</hi> yea
and <hi>Athens</hi> also, the
glorie it selfe of <hi>Greece.</hi>
The terrour of the kings
<hi>name</hi> breathed now vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Italy it selfe,</hi> and
vpon the verie citie of
<hi>Rome. Lucius Sulla</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
an excellent good
man, while hee was in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of armes, and of no
lesse violence, shoued
the enemie backe as it
were with one of his
hands, from encroaching
anie farther. And first
hee brought <hi>Athens</hi> to
such extremities <hi>by siege,</hi>
that hee made that citie
(what man would cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
it?) which was the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:2509:149"/>
mother of corne, to eate
mans flesh for hunger, and
vndermining their port <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus,</hi>
and more then sixe
walls of theirs, after he had
tamed them, yet, though
himselfe called them the
most ingratefull men, hee
neuerthelesse restored to
them their temples, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
for the honor, <hi>and
reuerence</hi> of deceased an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors:
and when <hi>Eubaea,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Baeotia</hi> had now chased the
garrisons away which the
King had billetted vpon
them, hee discomfited all
the royall forces together,
in one <hi>set</hi> battell at <hi>Chero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naea,</hi>
and in another at <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomenus:</hi>
and <hi>from thence</hi>
crossing forthwith into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:2509:150"/>
distrest <hi>Mithridates</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
and there also had
beene an end of the quarell,
if his desire had not rather
bin to haue triumpht spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
ouer the enemie then
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pletely: this was the state
in which <hi>Sulla</hi> left <hi>Asia.</hi> The

recouerd <hi>Bithynia</hi> of <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi>
and <hi>Cappadocia</hi> of
<hi>Ariobarzanes;</hi> as if <hi>Asia</hi>
had againe beene ours, as at
the beginning: but <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
was but repulsed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
This course therefore
daunted not the <hi>Ponticks,</hi>
but set them more on fire.
For the king hauing had <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
and as it were tasted the
bait of <hi>Europe,</hi> sought to
recouer it now by the law
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2509:150"/>
of armes, not as belonging
to others, but, because hee
had once lost it, as his own.
These fires therefore, as
not sufficiently quencht,
brake out into a greater
flame then before; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<hi>the king</hi> repairing his
armies, augmented with
greater numbers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earst;
and to bee briefe, with the
whole powers of his realm,
he inuaded <hi>Asia</hi> againe by
sea, and land, and riuers.
<hi>Cyzicum</hi> a citie ennobled
with a castle, walls, port, &amp;
towers of marble, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the shores of <hi>Asia.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this place, as if it
were another <hi>Rome,</hi> hee
bent his vtmost abilities:
but the citie was encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:2509:151"/>
to withstand vpon the

couetousnesse, will'd
his people to scatter fardles
and money as they fled, to
slacken the pursuers speed:
neither was his flight more
fortunate by sea, then it
was by land; for his nauie
which consisted of one
hundred saile, deepe laden
with munition, ouertaken
with a tempest in the sea of
<hi>Pontus,</hi> suffered such foule
spoile, as answered the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
of a battel at sea: no

beeing as it were in

haue giuen order to the

<hi>Mithridates.</hi> Though all
the strengths of that most
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2509:152"/>
powerfull kingdome were
in this wise ground to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet losses made his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
greater. Betaking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
therefore to his next

the whole <hi>East</hi> almost, and
<hi>North</hi> of the world to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie
his ruine. <hi>Iberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

were solicited to take part,
&amp; <hi>Pompet's</hi> fortune sought
euery where about for dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,

beholding <hi>Asia</hi> on fire
with new combustions, and
that more kings sprung still
out of other, iudging it no

while in the meane space

the powers of <hi>enemy</hi>-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
might vnite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
he forthwith makes
a bridge of boates, and, of

was the first of ours who
passed ouer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and
lighting vpon the flying
king in the middle of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
made a dispatch of
the warre (how great was
the happines of the man!)
in one onely battel: this
was fought by night, and
the moone was also for vs:
for shining at the backe of
the enemie, as if shee were
in pay on our side, and in
the faces of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the
<hi>Pontickes</hi> mistaking their
owne shadowes, proiected
long, as at her going down,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2509:153"/>
laid at them as at the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
bodies of their enemies.
So <hi>Mithridates</hi> was that
night vtterly vanquished.
For from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
hee was able to doe
nothing, though trying all
the wayes possible, after
the maner of snakes, whose
head being bruised, they
threaten last of all with
the taile. For after his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape,
his meaning was to
terrifie <hi>Colchos,</hi> the sea-coasts
of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and our
<hi>Campania,</hi> with his sudden
comming: then, ouertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the port <hi>Pyraeus,</hi> to
ioyne the countreyes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as farre as betweene
<hi>Colchis,</hi> and <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> from
thence to march through
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2509:153"/>
                     <hi>Thracia, Macedonia,</hi> and
<hi>Greece,</hi> and so to assaile <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
vpon the sudden. These
were his projects, and they
went no farther. For his
subiects reuolting from
him, and himselfe preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the treason of his
sonne <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> hauing
labourd in vaine to effect it
by poison, he kild himselfe
with his sword. Meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
<hi>Cnaeus</hi> the Grreat,
pursuing the remainders of
the rebellion of <hi>Asia,</hi> flew
vp, and downe <hi>at pleasure</hi>
through diuers countreys,
and nations. For following
the <hi>Armenians</hi> towards
the east, and taking <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata</hi>
their principall citie, he
granted back the kingdom
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2509:154"/>
to <hi>Tigranes,</hi> vpon <hi>his</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
But in marching
north, towards <hi>Scythia,</hi> he
guided his course by starrs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as if he had bin at sea; puts
the <hi>Colchians</hi> to the sword;
takes the <hi>Iberians</hi> to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
spares the <hi>Albanes,</hi> and
encamping vnder mount
<hi>Caucasus</hi> ir-selfe, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Orodes,</hi> the <hi>Cholchian</hi>
king, to descend from
thence into the plaine; <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toces,</hi>
prince of the <hi>Iberians</hi>
to giue in his children for
hostages: of his own meere
motion he rewards <hi>Orodes,</hi>
sending vnto him out of
his <hi>Albania,</hi> a couch of
gold, and other gifts; then
turning his forces South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
&amp; marching through
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2509:154"/>
                     <hi>Libanus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus,</hi>
he displaid the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ensignes round about,
passing through those odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous
woods, and groues
of balme and frankincense.
The <hi>Arabians</hi> were at his
seruice. The <hi>Iewes</hi> assaid to
defend <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> But he
forced that citie also, and
saw openly that grand my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
as vnder a skie of
<hi>beaten</hi> gold; the brethren
at ods about the kingdom,
<hi>and</hi> hee made vmpire, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged

extinguish at once, and for

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2509:157"/>
with a kinde of diuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
For hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of ships aswell

guarded both the sides

who so shrowded

pyrates wheresoeuer, thus
enuironed, within as it were

vtterly distressed. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
vndertooke <hi>Cilicia,</hi>

were forward to

being ouerborne, they
would seeme to dare: but
yet no farther, then as only
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2509:158"/>
to brooke the first shocke.
For when they beheld the
beake-heads of our clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gallies charge in ring
vpon them, they forthwith
strooke saile, threw away
oares, made a generall
showt (a signe among them

life. A victory gaind with

Thus at the same

<hi>Rhodanus,</hi> and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:2509:163"/>

demand <hi>of vs</hi> other habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
hauing first set
their townes on fire. A
solemne signe among them
of neuer returning thither.
But <hi>we</hi> asking time for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation,
and during that
delay, when <hi>Caesar,</hi> by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
downe the bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>Rhone,</hi> had taken from
them the meanes of flying
away, hee by and by led
backe that most warlike
people into their olde
homes, as a shepheard
driues his flocks to their
sheep-folds. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
battell which was
fought against the <hi>Belgia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi>
was much more bloudy, as
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:2509:163"/>
against men who fought
for freedome. Here the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
did many famous
feats of armes, and this of
<hi>Caesar's</hi> was most singular,
that his army inclining to
flie, hee snatcht the target
from one who was run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away, and charging
vpon the face of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
restored the battell
with his <hi>owne</hi> hand. After
this hee encountred the
<hi>Veneti</hi> at sea, but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
was greater with the
<hi>Ocean</hi> then with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
shippes. For they
were bungerly made, and
mis-shapen, and had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
beene split with
our beake-heads, but the
shallow places hindred
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2509:164"/>
the fight, that the tide
withdrawing vpon course,
during the skirmish, the
<hi>Ocean</hi> might as it were
seeme to haue beene stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in the battell. He had
<hi>elsewhere</hi> also to deale with
difficulties which grew
from the nature of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and places. The
<hi>Aquitans,</hi> a subtill genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
betooke themselues
to grots, and holes vnder
ground: <hi>Caesar</hi> had damd
them vp. The <hi>Morini</hi>
slipt aside into the woods:
hee commanded to fire
them. Let no man say the
<hi>Galls</hi> are onely fierce, they
vse fraud also. <hi>Induciomarus</hi>
assembled the <hi>Treuirists,
Ambiorix</hi> the <hi>Eburones,</hi>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:2509:164"/>
and making a combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>among themselues</hi> in
<hi>Caesars</hi> absence, both of
them found out his <hi>seueral</hi>
lieutenants generall. But
<hi>Titus Labienus</hi> stoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
the one of them, &amp;
brought that kings head
away. The other laying
an <hi>ambuscado</hi> in the vally,
ouercame <hi>vs</hi> by craft, and
so the campe was sackt,
and the gold <hi>thereof</hi> taken.
There wee lost <hi>Cotta,</hi> with

euer bee-meet with that

<hi>Rhene,</hi> for all that, escaped

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:2509:165"/>
that it should be a free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer,

ground of warre against
the <hi>Germans</hi> was at first
most iust. For the <hi>Sequani</hi>

to mee <hi>if hee will, and what
concernes it him what our</hi>

The terrour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of this new nation
was so great throughout
the campe, that they who
were of the maine battell,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:2509:165"/>
made euery-where their
last wills, and testaments.
But those giant like bodies,
by how much the huger
they were, by so much
were they the fairer marke
for a sword, or dart to hit.
What the feruour of our
souldiers was in the fight,
cannot bee set forth in any
example more clearely
then in this, that when the
barbarous whelm'd their
shields ouer their heads,
couering themselues as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a roofe, or pent-house,
or as a tortoys vnder the
shell, the <hi>Romans</hi> sprung vp
vpon the shields, and
from thence did cut their
throats. Againe, when the
<hi>Menapians</hi> complaind <hi>to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:2509:166"/>
vs</hi> of the <hi>Germans, Caesar</hi>
passeth ouer the <hi>Mose,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a bridge of boats, seekes
out <hi>Rhene</hi> it selfe, and the
enemies, among the <hi>Herci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
woods. But all the
whole race of them was
fled into the wildes, and
marshes, the army of the
<hi>Romans</hi> appearing on a
sudden on this side the
banke of <hi>Rhene,</hi> strooke
such an amazement among
them. Nor did we crosse
that riuer onely once, but
againe also, and that by a
bridge made ouer it. At
which time their affright
was much augmented,
when they beheld their
<hi>Rhene</hi> taken prisoner as it
were, and yoaked with a
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2509:166"/>
bridge, betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
afresh in flight to
their forests, and fennie
places; that which most
fretted <hi>Caesar,</hi> being that
hee had not whom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.
Thus all made ours
both at land, and sea, hee
casts his eye vpon the <hi>Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and as if the <hi>Roman</hi>
world sufficed not, his
minde was set how to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue
another. For this
cause gathering a nauie, he
made for <hi>Britaine.</hi> Hee
crost into <hi>Britaine</hi> with
marueilous speed; for
weighing anchor out of
the harbour of the <hi>Morini,</hi>
at the third watch, hee
was landed in the Iland
before noone. The shores
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:2509:167"/>
there, were full of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
troubled troups, and
the chariots of war whirled
vp and downe <hi>disorderly,</hi>
their riders quaking at the
wonder of the sight: their
feare therefore was instead
of a victorie. The timorous
<hi>Britans</hi> yeelded vp their
armes, and gaue hostages:
and <hi>Caesar</hi> had <hi>then</hi> marcht
farther, had not the <hi>Ocean</hi>
giuen his shatterd fleete a
sore scourging with his bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
Thereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnd
into <hi>Gall,</hi> and with a
greater armada, and more
forces <hi>then before,</hi> did
thrust out once againe into
the same <hi>Ocean,</hi> and againe
pursuing the same <hi>Britans</hi>
into the <hi>Caledonian</hi> woods,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:2509:167"/>
he also caused <hi>Cauelianus,</hi>
one of their kings, to bee
fast bound in chaines. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
himselfe with this
(for his intention was not
to get prouinces, but glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie)
he makes back into <hi>Gall</hi>
with more spoiles then at
first, the <hi>Oceans</hi> selfe more
quiet, and fauourable, as if
it confest it selfe too weake
for <hi>Caesar.</hi> But the last
mightiest conspiracie of
the <hi>Galls,</hi> was, when that
prince so dreadfull for sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
martiall skill, and
courage, and whose very
name seem'd deuised to
strike a terrour, <hi>Vercinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torix,</hi>
drew at once all the
<hi>Aruernois,</hi> and <hi>Bituriges</hi>
the <hi>Carnutes,</hi> and <hi>Sequani</hi>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:2509:168"/>
into a league, by speaking
bigge among them, when
the assemblies of people
were thickest, <hi>as</hi> in their
groues vpon festiuall, and
counsel-dayes, erecting
their mindes <hi>thereby</hi> for
recouerie at their antient
libertie. <hi>Caesar</hi> was at this
time absent <hi>out of Gallia,</hi>
busie in taking fresh mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> and the
<hi>Alps themselues</hi> heapt
high with winter snowes,
and so the wayes cloyed
vppe, they presumed hee
was fast, and safe enough.
But of how fortunate a
rashnesse was hee at the
newes? Ouer cragges, and
cliffes of mountaines,
thorow wayes, and drifts
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:2509:168"/>
of snow, till that time
pathlesse, hee with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
bands of souldiers
got into <hi>Gall,</hi> vnited his
winter-camps there, which
stood farre distant, and was
himselfe in person in the
middle of <hi>Gallia,</hi> before
the remotest part feared
his comming. Then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulting
the heart-strengths
of the warre, hee destroy'd
<hi>Auaricum,</hi> and a garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in it of fortie thousand,
and leuel'd <hi>Alexia</hi> to the
ground with fire, which
had two hundred, and
fiftie thousand fighting
men to rescue it. The
whole stresse of the warre
was about <hi>Gergouia.</hi> For
that most spacious citie,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:2509:169"/>
hauing foure score thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
defendents, walls al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
a castell, and craggie
cliffes, was girt-in round
by <hi>Caesar</hi> with workes,
stakes, and a ditch through
which hee drew the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and with eighteene
seuerall camps in the
whole compasse, and an
huge counterscarpe, by
which meanes he tamed it
first with famine, and such
of the defendents as durst
sally out, being either
cut in pieces in the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with the sword, or
gored vpon the stakes, hee
at last constrained it to
yeeld. That very king
himselfe, the principall
glorie of <hi>Caesars</hi> conquest,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:2509:169"/>
both came like an humble
suitor into the campe, and
throwing his caparisons,
and armes at his foote,
said thus vnto him, <hi>O
thou most valiant of men,
thou hast conquer'd a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
man.</hi>

only said, he would answer
at <hi>Seleucia.</hi> The Gods
therfore, who take reuenge
for violating publike

the stratagems, and strokes
of the enemies. <hi>For</hi> first,
<hi>Euphrates,</hi> the onely riuer

And presently <hi>thereupon</hi>
the enemies <hi>Cauallery</hi> gaue

their shot of arrowes vpon

already said) the age of
gold, voide of hainous fact,

puritie of that shepheardish
originall continued, and
the immiuent feare of the
<hi>Paenish</hi>-men maintain'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs ancient discipline.
The other hundred
yeeres (which wee reckon
from the destruction of
<hi>Carthage, Corinth, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi>
and from the date of
the last will, and testament
of <hi>king Attalus</hi> (in which

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:2509:173"/>
of so vast domestick mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
made wretched, &amp;
worthie to bee blushed at.
For as it was noble, and
goodly to haue conquer'd
<hi>Gallia, Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi>
most fertil, and most powr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prouinces, the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
also, &amp; <hi>Britans,</hi> great
names, but more for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the empire, then
for the vses thereof: so was
it a brutish, and a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing to fight, and
bicker at home, at the
same time, with our owne
citizens, associates, bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
fencers, and the
whole Senate with it selfe.
And I know not, whether
it had not beene better
for the people of <hi>Rome</hi>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:2509:173"/>
to haue rested content with
<hi>Sicilia,</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> yea, or
to haue wanted them also,
hauing <hi>Italie</hi> at command,
then to growe to such
greatnesse as to bee consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with their proper
strengths. For what other
things else bred ciuill fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
but the too much
ranknesse of prosperitie?
The first thing which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
vs, was the conquest
of <hi>Syria,</hi> &amp; next after that,
the heritage of the king of
<hi>Pergamus</hi> in <hi>Asia.</hi> The
wealth, and riches <hi>of those
countries</hi> were the things
which crusht vnder them
the morall vertues of that
age, and ouerthrew the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweal drownd in her
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:2509:174"/>
owne vices as in a common
sinke. For what cause was
there why the people of
<hi>Rome</hi> should stand so hard
for fields, or foode, but as
they were driuen by the
hunger which prodigalitie
had procured? From hence
therefore sprang the first,
and second <hi>Gracchan</hi> sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp; that third <hi>Appulei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
And out of what other
ground did it growe, that
the knights, and gentlemen
<hi>of Rome</hi> separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from the Lords, to
haue soueraigne power in
seates of iudgement, but
<hi>meerely</hi> out of couetousnes,
that so they might conuert
to priuate lucre the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
paiments due to the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:2509:174"/>
State, and euen iudgements
in law it self? This brought
in the promise of making
all <hi>Latium</hi> free of <hi>Rome.</hi>
from whence rose the war
with associats. And what
bred the warre with bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?
what? but the great
nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of them in families?
whence came the armies
of fensers against their ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but for the excessiue
prodigality <hi>vsed in showes</hi>
for gaining popular fauour?
While the <hi>Romans</hi> giue
themselues ouer to showes
of sword-players, they
brought that to bee a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and Arte, which
was before <hi>those times</hi> the
punishment of enemies.
And, to touch our more
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:2509:175"/>
gallant vices, was it not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-much
wealth which
stirr'd <hi>among vs</hi> riualities
in honours? Or did not the
stormes of <hi>Marius,</hi> and
<hi>Sylla,</hi> and the magnificent
furniture of feasts, &amp; sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
presents, rise out of
that abundance, which are
long would bring forth
beggerie? This was it
which made <hi>Catiline</hi> fall
foule vpon his countrey.
To bee briefe, what other
fountaine had that very
desire <hi>in some</hi> of soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
&amp; to rule alone, but too
much store of wealth? But
that desire did mutually
arme <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi>
with those mortall enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which like the furies
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:2509:175"/>

ther wer very many bride-wels,

for where villaines were
the souldiers, and sword

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:2509:191"/>
the basest of men, these
augmented the worst of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
with the scorne of so
vile indignitie. <hi>Spartacus,
Crixus,</hi> and <hi>Oenoma</hi> brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vp <hi>Lentulus</hi> his schole
of fence, with three score
and ten such companions
as themselues, or more,
burst out of <hi>Capua,</hi> and
calling bondmen to their
banners, and assistance,
when aboue ten thousand
sturdie bodies were assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
they were not then
contented onely to escape,
but they would also bee
reuenged. The first, as it
were alter, which pleased
them, was mount <hi>Vesuuius.</hi>
There being besieged by
<hi>Clodius Glaber,</hi> they slipt
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2509:192"/>
downe the rifts of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
mountaine by ropes of
twigges, and descended to
the lowest rootes thereof,
and suddenly forcing an
entrie at an issue of the
camp, where no such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was dreamt of, did sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
it: after that, other
camps also. Then roue, and
wander they ouer <hi>Vhora,</hi>
and all <hi>Campania<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> nor satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with wasting villages,
and hamlers, they make a
terrible destruction in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,
Nuceria, Thurij,</hi> and
Metapont. Their numbers
daily so increasing; as that
now they were a full ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
they make bucklers
of wouen osiars, couerd
with hides of beasts, and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:2509:192"/>
forge out the yron of their
worke-iayles into swords,
and tooles of warre. And
that no grace of a full hoste
of men might be wanting,
they backe the horse which
they found at aduentures,
to raise a cauallery, and
brought to their captaine
the ensignes, and <hi>fasces</hi>
which were taken from our
Pretors. Nor refused hee
to vse them, though of an
hireling <hi>Thracian</hi> becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a souldier, of a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
a fugitiue, then a strong
theefe, and last of all, vpon
trust of his abilities of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
a sword-player: who
celebrated the death of his
owne captaines slaine in
battell, with princely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:2509:193"/>
commanding such as
he tooke prisoners, to fight
at sharp about the funerall
fire, as if it would cleere all
passed disgrace, if of a

giuer of sword-games. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, setting also vpon
<hi>Consuls,</hi> he cut in pieces the
army of <hi>Lentulus</hi> in the
<hi>Appennine,</hi> raised the camp
of <hi>Caius Cassius</hi> at <hi>Mutina.</hi>
Puft vp with these successes,

a broyle, then a war,
the cruelty, such as it was,

of the quarell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
but the next was
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:2509:195"/>
more grimme, and bloudy,
such as had the vpper hand
embrewing their weapons

the third outwent, in

the madnesse of reuenge
had all the strengths of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi>
to bolster it, their hatred
<hi>one of the other</hi> raging so
long, as till none were left
to kill. The beginning, and
cause of the warre, was the
insatiable thirst of honour
in <hi>Marius,</hi> while he labourd
by the law of <hi>Sulpitius</hi> to
take from <hi>Sulla</hi> his decreed

possesseth as a conquerour
the captiue <hi>Capitoll,</hi> that
fort which had escaped the
<hi>Paenish</hi>-men, yea and the
<hi>Galli Senones</hi> also. Then
by an act of the <hi>Senate,
Sulla's</hi> aduersaries proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
enemies of the State,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2509:196"/>
they had law on their side
to rage against the present
Tribune, and most of the
contrary faction. <hi>Marius</hi>
by seruill flight saued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or rather, fortune kept
him in store for another
warre. <hi>Cornelius Cinna,
Cnaeus Octauius</hi> Consuls, the
fire which was not well
put out rose afresh, and that
certainely by reason of the
disagreement, when it was
referred to the people,
whether such as the Senate
had proclaymed enemies
should bee recalled. They
came to this generall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
with their swords
about them: but they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing
who wished quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<hi>Cinna,</hi> leauing the

<hi>Marius</hi> returnes from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi>
the greater for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
because prison,
chaines, flight, and banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had endeare his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
At the name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of so great a man, there
is flocking to him from far,
and neere, bondmen (O
the hainousnesse!) &amp; stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
rogues were armd: and
the distressed Generall easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found an army: so that,
as demanding restitution
to his countrey, out of
which he was expelled by
force, he might <hi>well</hi> seeme
to haue good reason for his
doing, had hee not <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>
wrought his cause by
cruelty: but returning dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2509:197"/>
with Gods and
men, the hauen-towne <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia</hi>
a pupill, and foster-child
of <hi>Rome,</hi> was at the
first assault taken, and with
horrible destruction pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
From thence he enters
the citie in foure battels,
<hi>Cinna, Marius, Carbo,</hi> and
<hi>Sertorius</hi> leading them,
where, after that the whole
band of <hi>Octauius</hi> was bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
from mount <hi>Ianiculum,</hi>
presently, vpon a signe
giuen, they fell to killing
the princes, and chiefe
lords, much more sauagely
then is vsed either in a
<hi>Paenish,</hi> or a <hi>Cimbrian</hi> citie.
The head of <hi>Octauius,</hi>
Consul, was pitcht vpon a
pole before the <hi>Rostra,</hi> and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2509:197"/>
the head of <hi>Antonius,</hi> a
Consularie man, was set on
the boord before <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
himselfe: <hi>Casar,</hi> and
<hi>Fimbria</hi> were murthred
in that place of their
houses where their house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
Gods stood, <hi>and
Crassus</hi> the father, and
son, each insight of other.
<hi>Bebius,</hi> and <hi>Numitor</hi> were
drawne with the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
hookes through the
middle of the <hi>Forum. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus</hi>
freed himselfe from
being made the scorne of
his enemies by smothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
<hi>Merula, Iupiters</hi>
priest, bespurtled the eyes
of <hi>Ioue</hi> himself, with the
bloud which sprung out
of his veines in the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol.
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2509:198"/>
                     <hi>Ancharius</hi> was runne
through, <hi>Marius</hi> himselfe
looking on, because when
<hi>Marius</hi> saluted him, hee
reacht not out forsooth
that fatall hand of his.
These Senators he massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
between the <hi>Calends,</hi>
and <hi>Ides</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in that
seuenth Consulship of his.
What would haue become
of things, if <hi>after that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion

beene Consul but a yeere?
<hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Norbanus</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,
that third worst whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde
of ciuill surie thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
forth with all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
it had; at which
time seuen legions of the
one side, on another fiue
hundred cohorts stood in
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:2509:198"/>
armes, and <hi>Sulla</hi> hastned
out of <hi>Asia</hi> with a victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
army. And certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Marius</hi> hauing shewed
himselfe so mercilesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Sulla's</hi> friends, how
great cruelty was there
neede of, for <hi>Sulla</hi> to bee
euen with <hi>Marius?</hi> Their
first encounter was at
<hi>Capua</hi> by the riuer <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnus,</hi>
and there the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of <hi>Norbanus</hi> was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ouerthrowne, and all
<hi>Scipio's</hi> forces, vpon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable
ouerture of
peace, speedily oppressed.
Then <hi>Marius</hi> the yonger,
and <hi>Carbo,</hi> Consuls, as if
the hope they had to get
the victorie were quite
dead, yet not to perish vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuenged,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:2509:199"/>
they parentated
to themselues with the
bloud of the Senate. And
besetting the Senate-house,
such of the Senate,
whose throats they meant
to cut, were drawne out
from thence, as out of a
<hi>sheep-penne, or</hi> prison.
What slaughters were
there in the <hi>Forum,</hi> in
the <hi>Circus,</hi> and open
Temples? For MVTIVS
SCAEVOLA, the priest,
embracing the altar of
<hi>Vesta</hi> in his atmes, is onely
not buried in her fire.
<hi>Lamponius,</hi> and <hi>Telesinus,</hi>
ringleaders of the <hi>Samnits,</hi>
waste <hi>Campania,</hi> and <hi>Etru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
more dreadfully then
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and <hi>Annibal</hi> did,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:2509:199"/>
and vnder the colour of
siding, reuenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
The whole forces
of the enemies were quite
distrest at <hi>Sacriport,</hi> and
port <hi>Collin,</hi> or <hi>Hill-gate.</hi>
There <hi>Marius,</hi> and here
<hi>Telesinus</hi> were destroyed.
But warre, and slaughter
ended not together. For
the sword was vnsheathed
euen in peace, and they
who freely yeelded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
were also depriued
of their liues. It is not
lesse <hi>hainous,</hi> that <hi>Sulla,</hi> at
<hi>Sacriport</hi> and <hi>Hill-gate,</hi>
did cut in pieces aboue
threescore and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
But then it was war.
Hee commanded aboue
foure thousand vnarmed
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:2509:200"/>
citizens, who had yeelded
themselues, to bee put to
the sword in the publike
village. These <hi>though</hi> so
many <hi>slaine</hi> in cold bloud,
yet are no more <hi>then foure
thousand.</hi> But who can
number them who were
kill'd euery-where tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
the citie by any
one who lifted? till <hi>Furfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
admonished, that
some ought to bee left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue,
that there might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
whom to commaund.
Hereupon was that huge
table hung out, in which
two thousand <hi>by name,</hi>
cull'd forth of the very
flowre of the Senate,
knights, and gentlemen,
were proclaimed to die.
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:2509:200"/>
A new kinde of edict. It
were tedious, after al these
things, to historifie the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in <hi>cruel</hi> sport of <hi>Carbo,</hi>
of <hi>Soranus,</hi> the Praetor, and
of <hi>Venuleius,</hi> and how <hi>Bae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
was not slaine with
the sword, but torne in
pieces with hands, as with
the pawes of sauage beasts.
How <hi>Marius,</hi> brother of
the Generall <hi>Marius,</hi> was
thrust with his eyes, hands,
and thighes into the earth,
before the tombe of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,</hi>
and in that state kept

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:2509:202"/>
by <hi>onely</hi> one captains

firebrand of that commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
blazed, it rose <hi>all</hi> out of
<hi>Sylla's</hi> ashes: for <hi>Lepidus,</hi>
in his insolencie, desirous
to innouate, prepared to
annull the acts of that
mighty man, nor without
<hi>good</hi> cause, if at least wise it
could haue beene done
without great calamitie to
the common-weale. For
when <hi>Sulla,</hi> the <hi>Dictator,</hi>
had by the aduantage of
the vpper hand, proscribed
his enemies; such of them
as ouerliued, being recalled
<hi>from banishment</hi> by <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
to what else were they
called but to warre? and
when the goods of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:2509:204"/>
citizens were adiudged,
and giuen away by <hi>Sulla</hi>
vnto others, though they
were <hi>but</hi> badly taken, yet
being they were taken by
law, the repleuin of them
did doubtlesly endanger
the <hi>greene raw</hi> peace of the
State. For which respect it
was expedient that the
common-weale sore sicke,
and hurt, should rest it selfe
howsoeuer, lest the wounds
thereof should breake out,
and bleede afresh in the
curing. When therefore he
had frighted the citie with
his turbulent orations, as
with an alarme, he went
into <hi>Etruria,</hi> and from
thence presented an armie
against <hi>Rome.</hi> But, before
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:2509:205"/>
this time, <hi>Lentulus, Catu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
and <hi>Cnaeus Pompeius,</hi>
the captaines, and <hi>as it were</hi>
ensigne-bearers of <hi>Sulla's</hi>
tyranny, had planted an
army at <hi>Miluius</hi> bridge, &amp;
mount <hi>Ianiculus:</hi> and by
them repulsed at the <hi>very</hi>
first brunt, and proclaimed
traitor by the <hi>Senate,</hi> hee
fled <hi>backe</hi> without bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
into <hi>Etruria;</hi> from
thence retired to <hi>Sardinia;</hi>
and there in sicknesse, and
repentance ended his dayes.
The victors, a thing rarely
seene in ciuill warres, <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated
their affections,</hi> and
contented themselues to
hold all quiet.</p>

for firing the citie in many

of all common-weale, and
for doing that, whatsoeuer
else, which euen <hi>Anniball</hi>
himselfe would not haue
seem'd to haue wished. All
which purposes, with what

were they by him attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
himselfe a <hi>Patritian,</hi> a
Senatour of the highest
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:2509:206"/>
ranke; but that is not so
much: there were in of the
<hi>Curij, Porcij, Sullae, Cethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi,
Autronij, Vargunteij,</hi>
and <hi>Longini:</hi> and what
potentates were they by
birth? what ornaments of
the Senate? <hi>Lentulus</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
chiefely at that time
Praetor, had all of these for
a blacke guard to his most
black designes. Mans bloud
was added as a pledge of
the conspiracie, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
about in cups and gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
they dranke: a most
horrible thing, had not the
end, for which they dranke
it, beene more horrible.
The goodliest empire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heauen had seene the
last daies of it selfe, had not
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:2509:207"/>
that plot hapned in the
Consulship of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and
<hi>Antonius,</hi> one of which
discouered the same by his
diligence, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
it by force. The
intelligence of this so vast a
treason was giuen by <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia,</hi>
a base cheape trull, but
not so wicked as to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of paricide. Then <hi>Cicero</hi>
the <hi>Consull,</hi> calling a Senate,
made an oration against the
hainous traytor to his face,
against the guiltie person
there in presence, but
wrought no greater effect
then <hi>onely</hi> to make the foe
shift for himselfe, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
professing to bee such,
threatned to put out the
fire with pulling downe all.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:2509:207"/>
So he departs to the armie
which <hi>Manlius</hi> had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in <hi>Etruria,</hi> with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to assaile the citie. <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,</hi>
diuining that himself
was the man of his family,
to whom soueraigntie was
destinated in <hi>Sibylls</hi> verses,
had in fit places, against the
set day, dispersed men, fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes,
and weapons ouer
the whole citie: nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with complices at
home onely, the ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> at
that time, as it hapned, in
towne, were dealt with, to
<hi>stirre their nation</hi> to armes:
and the frensie had gadded
ouer the <hi>Alpes,</hi> if vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
discouerie made by
<hi>Vulturius,</hi> the letters of the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:2509:208"/>
Praetor had not beene atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in the going. Hands
were hereupon forthwith
laid, at <hi>Cicero's</hi> commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
vpon the <hi>Allobro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:</hi>
and the practice was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
proued against <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus</hi>
in the Senate. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put to the question
what should be done with
the malefactors, <hi>Caesar</hi> was
of opinion, their liues
should be spared, because
they were persons of great
honor: <hi>Cato</hi> censur'd them
to death for their treason:
which opinion was secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by all, and they were
strangled accordingly in
prison. Though thus a
part of the conspiracie was
choakt, yet <hi>Catiline</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:2509:208"/>
not from his enterprise,
but with ensignes spred

his natiue countrey,
and encountred on the way
by the armie of <hi>Antonius,</hi>
is beaten downe, and slaine.
How grimly they fought,
the euent sheweth: not a
man of the enemies was
left, and looke what place
each one fought in, vpon
the same he lost his life, and
couerd it with his body.
<hi>Catiline</hi> was found starke

The madnesse of

it-selfe within the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as if shee tride how it

it not thunder out of <hi>Italy;</hi>
but the furie of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and
<hi>Pompey</hi> did hurrie, &amp; sucke
into it both the citie, <hi>Italy,</hi>
races, nations, &amp; in a word
the vniuersall empire, with
a kind as it were of deluge,
and gulph of fire, so farre

bee onely called a ciuill,
neither yet a sociall, no nor
a foraine, but rather a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
common of all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and more then a war.
For if wee looke vpon the
captaines, the whole <hi>Senate</hi>
was in sides; if the armies,
on the one part eleuen le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
on the other, eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,

Orient; if the space of the
warre, foure yeeres, and
that, considering the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
it wrought, but
a short time; if the place,
and flage, vpon which it
was acted, <hi>Italy,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence
it turn'd it selfe into <hi>Gall,</hi>
and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and fetching a
compasse from the west,
it sat down with the whole

and <hi>Thessaly;</hi> thence it
crosseth suddenly into
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:2509:210"/>
                     <hi>Aegypt;</hi> then it glanced
into <hi>Asia,</hi> and lay heauy
vpon <hi>Africk;</hi> last of all, it
reel'd back into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and
there at length it went
out, and died. But the
warre, and hatred of the
factions ended not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For that rested not, til
the rancour of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
parties had in the
heart of the citie, &amp; middle
of the Senate, satisfide it
self with the bloud of their
conquerour. The cause
of so monstrous mischiefs
was the same, which it v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to be of al, too too
much prosperity. For <hi>Q.
Metellus,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Afra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
Consuls, when the
maiestie of <hi>Rome</hi> preuailed
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:2509:211"/>
through the world, and
the people chanted the
fresh victories <hi>of Pompey,</hi>
the <hi>Pontick,</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi>
triumphs, in <hi>Pompeis</hi> thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
his ouer-great power
(as it often falleth out) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
enuy among the leysu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
citizens, <hi>Metellus</hi> for
abatement of his triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>Crete, Cato,</hi> who alwaies
ranne bias to the mighty,
detracted <hi>Pompey,</hi> &amp; found
fault with his actions. The
griefe hereof draue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrie,
and compelled him
to prouide strengths for
vpholding his dignitie. It
hapned <hi>Crassus</hi> at that
time flourished in honour
of bloud, riches, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
and yet still coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:2509:211"/>
more. The name of
<hi>Caius Caesar</hi> was vp, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence,
and spirit, and
had the honour of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship.
But <hi>Pompey</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertopt
them both. <hi>Caesar</hi>
therefore struggling to get
dignity, <hi>Crassus</hi> to increase
it, <hi>Pompey</hi> to keepe what
he had, and all of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
greedie of great
power, easily made a match
to set vpon the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.
Therefore, while
each of them vseth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
strengths for his own
glory, <hi>Caesar</hi> inuaded <hi>Gall,
Crassus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Asia, Pompey Spain,</hi>
three most puissant armies.
And thus the whole world
was now become to bee
held by three princes in
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:2509:212"/>
partnership. This domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wore out ten yeeres
time. From that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
because til then they
were ballanced among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
through a mutuall
feare, vpon the slaughter of
<hi>Crassus</hi> by the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
and the death of <hi>Iulia, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
daughter, who marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Pompey,</hi> maintained
concord between the son,
and father in law, by the
league of nuptial loue, emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
brake forth present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<hi>Pompey</hi> now was iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of <hi>Caesars</hi> greatnesse,
and <hi>Caesar</hi> badly endured
<hi>Pompeis</hi> supereminencie.
The one brookt no equall,
the other no superior. But
O the sinne! they stroue in
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:2509:212"/>
such sort for principality,
as if so great a fortune of
empire had not beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for two. Therefore
<hi>Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi>
being Consuls, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
of the first pact <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them</hi> once broken,
the <hi>Senate</hi> consulted to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employ
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi>
labour'd the same; nor was
<hi>Caesar</hi> himselfe against it, if
in the first comitiall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
or choise-moot,
there had beene respect
had of him, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship;
which <hi>honour</hi> ten
Tribunes had with <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peis</hi>
good liking decreed

afterwards, vpon <hi>Pompeis</hi>

should haue come, &amp; sued
for it after the<note n="*" place="margin">more maio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> old wont.
On the other side, hee ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
demanded executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the decree, &amp; would
not cashier his armie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they at home were as

For this cause he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
enemy. <hi>Caesar,</hi>
throughly nettled at the
newes, resolued to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
with the sword, the
rewards of his sword. The
first field, &amp;<note n="*" place="margin">arena.</note> Sand-plot of
ciuil war was <hi>Italy;</hi> whose
castels <hi>Pompey</hi> had furnisht
with slight-garrisons. But
all of them were as it were
ouerwhelmed with <hi>Caesars</hi>
sudden comming-on. The
first alarm was sounded at
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:2509:213"/>
                     <hi>Ariminu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Then was <hi>Libo</hi>

then <hi>Vmbria, Domitiꝰ</hi>
then <hi>Corfinium.</hi> And the
war had bin made an end
of without bloud, if, as hee
attempted it, he could haue
oppressed <hi>Pompey</hi> at <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disium.</hi>
But he escaped by
night through the closures
of the besieged hauen. A
shamful matter to be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
the late president of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,
vmpire of peace, &amp; war,
fled in a torne, &amp; almost na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vessell, ouer that sea,
which himself had triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pht.
Nor is <hi>Pompey</hi> sooner driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
out of <hi>Italy,</hi> then the Senat
out of the citie, into which
almost empty of people
throgh feare, <hi>Caesar</hi> entring
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:2509:214"/>
made himself Consul. The
sacred <hi>inmost</hi> treasury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Tribunes op'ned
it somewhat too slowly, he
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to be broken vp:
&amp; violently seis'd the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,
and patrimony of the
people of <hi>Rome,</hi> sooner then
he did the soueraignty. <hi>Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
driuen away, &amp; fled, he
had a more minde to take
order for <hi>securing</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,
then to pursue him.
He kept <hi>Sicilia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sardinia,</hi>
the <hi>publick</hi> pledges of corn,
by deputies, or lieutenants
generall: there was not an
enemy in <hi>Gall,</hi> himself had
made it all peace there. But
passing in perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against the
<hi>Pompeis</hi> in <hi>Spaine, Massilia</hi>
was so bold as to shut her
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:2509:214"/>
gates. Poore <hi>Massilia,</hi>
while it would faine haue
peace, fel into a war, throgh
feare of warre. But because
it had strong walls, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it should be taken

<pb n="403" facs="tcp:2509:215"/>
vpon their retreate into
<hi>Celtiberia,</hi> hee drew a

them to yeeld for

<hi>Spaine</hi> taken in, and
the farther <hi>Spaine</hi> delayd
not. For what could one

fastning of ropes vnder wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
but the tide comming
in, freed two of the vessels:
one of them which carryed
the <hi>Opitergins</hi> was entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
in the cords, &amp; produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
an effect worthy to be
commended with honour
to posterity: for a band of
scarce one thousand young
fellowes held play from
morning till night, against
the force of an whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
enuironing them on
all sides: and when by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
they could finde no
way forth, at the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of <hi>Vulteius,</hi> their
Coronel, they slue one the
other. In <hi>Africke</hi> also, such
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:2509:217"/>
like was the valour, and
aduersitie of <hi>Curio,</hi> who
sent by <hi>Caesar with commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
to receiue that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince,
&amp; proud for hauing
repulsed, and put <hi>Varus</hi> to
flight, was vnable to stand
the sudden comming-on
of king <hi>Iuba,</hi> and the caual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie
of the <hi>Mauritanians.</hi>
Hee might haue fled, but
shame perswaded him to
die together with that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
which his temerity had
cast away. But fortune now
importunately demanding
to make scores euen, <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
had chosen <hi>Epirus</hi> for
the seate of war: nor was
<hi>Caesar</hi> slowe: for hauing
made all safe at his backe,
though it were the depth
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:2509:217"/>
of winter, and so the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
vnfit, yet hee embarkt
for battell; and encamping
at <hi>Oricum;</hi> when that part
of his forces which was left
behinde with <hi>Antonius,</hi> for
want of shipping staid with
the longest at <hi>Brundisium;</hi>
hee was so impatient, that
for fetching them, hee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
at midnight, and
in a frigat to venture ouer,
though the sea was terrible
rough. His words to the
master, afraid at so great a
danger, are not forgotten.
What fearest thou? thou
carryest <hi>Caesar.</hi> When all
the forces which either
side could make, were
drawne together, &amp; their
camps confronted each the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:2509:218"/>
other the generals gouernd
themselues by diffre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
<hi>Caesar</hi> naturally fierce, &amp;
longing to dispatch, offers
battell, eggeth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh
to it: one while by
besieging the camp, about
which his workes ran six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
miles (but what
could besieging hurt them,
who hauing the sea open,
abounded thereby with all
prouisions?) another while
with assaulting <hi>Dyrrhachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
in vaine (for the situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it made it inexpug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable)
and besides all this,
with daily skirmishes, as
the enemie sallied forth (at
which time captain <hi>Sceua's</hi>
manhood was admired, in
whose target one hundred,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:2509:218"/>
&amp; twenty shot were found
sticking) now with sackage
of <hi>Pompeis</hi> confederate ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as when hee wasted
<hi>Oricum,</hi> and <hi>Gomphi,</hi> and
other fortresses of <hi>Thessali,
Pompei,</hi> on the contrarie,
contriues delayes, and
wayes of putting of, that,
by closing the enemy on all
parts, hee might breake his
heart with lack of victuals,
and the violent humor of
his most fiery aduersarie
might coole, &amp; falter. This
wholsome counsell did not
long auaile the author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
soldier, hee blames lying
idle, confederates cry out
vpon delay, and the <hi>great</hi>
lords tax him with ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>So the destinies thrusting
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:2509:219"/>
thinges headlong on,</hi> in
<hi>Thessaly,</hi> and the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain
fields of <hi>Philippi,</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
for the place of fight,
the fortunes of <hi>Rome,</hi> the
world, and all mankinde
were set vpon a cast. The
people of <hi>Rome</hi> neuer saw
in one place together so
great forces, nor fortune so
many mighty persons at a
time. There were aboue
three hundred thousand
in both the armies, besides
the aides of kings, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators.
Signes of an immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
downefall were neuer
more apparent; runnings
away of beasts ordaind for
sacrifice, swarmes of bees,
notable ouercastings of the
skie in day time. <hi>Pompey</hi>
                     <pb n="411" facs="tcp:2509:219"/>
himselfe dreamt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
that he heard a noise
in his <hi>owne</hi> theater <hi>at
Rome,</hi> sounding about him
in the nature of a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and in the breake of
day hee was seene (fie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie!)
before his maine
battel in a black vpper gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Caesars</hi> armie was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more fresh,<note place="margin">pullo ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo.</note> &amp; fuller of
spirit. The sound of the
charge came first from
<hi>Pompeis side,</hi> but the shot
from the other. The ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelin
of <hi>Crastinus,</hi> who
began the fight, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and being runne into
the <hi>gaping</hi> mouth with a
sword, and found dead
with it so, among the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases,
did by the nouelty
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:2509:220"/>
it selfe of the wound, well
declare, with what choler,
and madnesse hee fought:
neither was the issue of the
battell lesse admirable: for
whereas <hi>Pompey</hi> had such
multitudes of horse, as hee
thought to circumuent <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
easily, himselfe was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuented:
for after they
had fought a long time vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
euen termes, and, at a
signe giuen them by <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
his troupes of horse fell
on in flanke, the <hi>Germane</hi>
cohorts made so boystrous
an impression vpon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that they seemd foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
&amp; these to haue come
on horsbacke: the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the light-armd
souldiers ensued vpon the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:2509:220"/>
slaughter of the flying hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troupes:
then the terrour
striking farther, one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
putting another into
rowt, the rest of the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was made as it were
at a stroke. Nothing was
more the bane of that day,
then the hugenesse it-selfe
of the armie. <hi>Caesar</hi> was
much in that battell, and
halfe between souldier and
soueraigne: speeches of his
were ouer-heard as hee rid
vp, and downe; the one
bloudy, but according to
<hi>the</hi> Art <hi>of the sword,</hi> and
powerfull for gaining the
day, <hi>Souldiers, foine at the
face;</hi> the other tending to
vaine glorie, <hi>Souldiers, spare
our countrey-men;</hi> when his
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:2509:221"/>
owne selfe <hi>notwithstanding</hi>
chased them. Happie <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
for all this miserie, had
hee shared in the fortune of
his slaughtred armie: but
he ouer-liued his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
that with the more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
he might poste for
his life through <hi>Thessalian
Tempe;</hi> bee beaten from
<hi>Larissa;</hi> and vpon a forlorn
rocke of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> studie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he should flie into <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,
Africa,</hi> or <hi>Aegypt;</hi>
briefely, that vpon the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusian</hi>
shore, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of a most vnworthie
king, by the counsell of gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded-men,
and (to take all
the misfortunes together)
that murthred by the
sword of <hi>Septimius,</hi> his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:2509:221"/>
vnder the eyes of his
wife, &amp; children, he should
conclude his dayes. Who
would thinke that the war
should not bee determined
with <hi>Pompeis</hi> life? But the
embers of the <hi>Thessalian</hi>
fire waxt much more hot,
and forceable then euer:
and in <hi>Aegypt</hi> there was
warre without <hi>any</hi> parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
<hi>of ours:</hi> for when <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomea,</hi>
king of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
had committed the most
hainous act of all those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
during the ciuill warre,
and had, by means of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peis</hi>
head, settled his owne
termes with <hi>Caesar,</hi> fortune
casting about for a reuenge,
<hi>therby</hi> to appease the ghost
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:2509:222"/>
of so great a potentate,
wanted not occasion. <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi>
that kings sister,
throwing herselfe at <hi>Caesars</hi>
feet, besought restitution
to her part of the realme.
To plead for her, came
the ladies beauty, which
was doubled by this, that
so rare a creature seem'd to
haue wrong, &amp; the hatred
born to the king himselfe,
who, in killing <hi>Pompey,</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifide
the fortune of the
<hi>contrarie</hi> faction, not <hi>Caesar,</hi>
against whom hee would
also, without all question,
haue dared as much, if it
would haue serued his
turn. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Caesars</hi> pleasure
therefore was, that shee
should bee restored to her
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:2509:222"/>
kingdome, <hi>by as it were a
Gauelkind,</hi> he being forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
be-set in the palace
<hi>roial,</hi> by the same instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
who murthred <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
with wondrous valour,
&amp; a slender company, did
beare the brunt of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
army. For, by firing the
next tenements, &amp; the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senal,</hi>
he dislodged the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
who plide him from
thence with shot. From
thence he suddenly escaped
to the penile of <hi>Pharus.</hi>
Beaten out of that, &amp; glad
to plunge into the sea, hee
got, with admirable good
fortune, to the next ships,
by swimming, fain to leaue
his robe in the waues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by chance, or of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:2509:223"/>
that the aduersarie
might pelt, &amp; mawl it with
stones, and shot, <hi>in stead of
him.</hi> Receiued at last a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his own mariners, &amp;
assailing the enemy in all
quarters at once, hee paide
the ghost of his son in law
the vengeance due to it,
vpon that cowardly, and
trayterous nation. For
not onely the kings tutor,
<hi>Theodorus,</hi> (author of
the whole warre) but not
so much also as those
maskes of men, <hi>the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs,
Photinus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ganyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
flying by sea, and land,
came to euill ends. The
<hi>yong</hi> kings body was found
as it lay <hi>wallowed</hi> vnder
mud, <hi>and known</hi> by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:2509:223"/>
of a golden curace, or
brest plate vpon it. New stirs
were likewise in <hi>Asia, begun</hi>
in <hi>Pontus,</hi> fortune watching
as it were of set purpose,
to make this the end of
<hi>Mithridates</hi> kingdom, that
the father should bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and the
sonne by <hi>Caesar.</hi> King
<hi>Pharnaces,</hi> rather vpon
trust of our discord, then
his owne valour, fell vpon
<hi>Cappadocia</hi> with an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
armie. But <hi>Caesar</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vpon him, in <hi>onely</hi> one,
and that too (so to say) not
an whole battell, ground
him <hi>as it were</hi> to dust,
after the manner of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which at one, and
the same moment of time,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:2509:224"/>
came, hit, and went away:
neither was it a vaine brag
which <hi>Caesar</hi> made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that the enemie was
ouerthrowne <hi>there,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euer hee set eye vpon
him. Thus went matters in
forreine parts. But in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi>
the fight of <hi>Romans</hi>
with <hi>Romans</hi> was more
deadly, then <hi>it had beene</hi> in
<hi>Pharsalia.</hi> Hither the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
of the shipwrackt
faction were driuen by a
certaine pang, or fit of fury:
nor would you call them
remaines, but a whole, and
entire warre. <hi>Pompeis</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were rather scatterd
then consumed. His tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
made them more
solemne, and zealous to
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:2509:224"/>
fight. Nor did the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Generals degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
For <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi>
founded full enough in the
place of <hi>Pompeis</hi> name. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>
king of <hi>Mauritania,</hi>
made one in the quarrell,
forsooth that <hi>Caesar</hi> might
haue the more to conquer.
There was therefore no
difference, nor oddes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Pharsalia,</hi> and
<hi>Thapsus,</hi> sauing that the
eagernesse of the <hi>Caesarians</hi>
was both the more, &amp; the
more sharpe, as chafing
that the war grew though
<hi>Pompey</hi> was dead. To bee
briefe, a thing which neuer
hapned till then, the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
sounded a charge,
through the souldiers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:2509:225"/>
without the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
The ouerthrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
at <hi>Iuba,</hi> whose ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
not <hi>throughly</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to fight, and but lately
taken wilde out of the
woods, quite confounded
at the sudden shrilnesse,
forthwith dis-ranked their
friends army, &amp; made that
the captaines could not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
by flying, all of them
comming to their ends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably.
For <hi>Scipio</hi> was
now gotten on ship-boord,
but his enemies ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him, he ran his sword
thorow his owne belly; &amp;
one asking after him in
search, he answered in these
very words, <hi>The Generall is
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:2509:225"/>
well. Iuba</hi> gotten into his
palace, after a royal ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet
made to <hi>Petreius,</hi> the
companion of his flight,
among his cuppes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
call'd vpon him for a
killing. And <hi>Petreius</hi> had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of that both for the
king, and himselfe: so the
viands, halfe as it were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and the funerall mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
swam mixt with roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and <hi>Roman</hi> bloud to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<hi>Cato</hi> was not at
this battell, but encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at <hi>Bagrada,</hi> hee
lay for defence of <hi>Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
as at the other maine
fort, or barre of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi>
But hearing the defeat
of his partners, hee dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
not at all, but (as it
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:2509:226"/>
became a wiseman) did
euen ioyfully hasten his
owne death. For after hee
had embraced, and bidden
good night to his son, and
companions, hee reposed
himselfe awhile in his bed,
hauing perused by a light
<hi>Plato's</hi> booke of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the soule, and
then, about the first relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the watch, vnshea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
his sword, hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
thrust himselfe with
a re-enforced stroke into
the body. After which, the
physicians presumed to
wrong the braue man with
laying salues, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
till they were out
of the roome: but then hee
rashed them away, and the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:2509:226"/>
bloud following amaine, he
left his dying hands in the
very wound. Warre, and
sidings brake out againe, as
fresh, as if there had neuer
past a stroke in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell:
and by how much
the troubles in <hi>Africa</hi>
were beyond those in <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saly,</hi>
by so much <hi>Spaines</hi>
surpassed those in <hi>Africa;</hi>
&amp; the brother linesse of the
Generals drew exceeding
sauor to that side, when for
one <hi>Pompey</hi> there stood vp
two. The encounters ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were no where so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
or hazardous. The
first conflict was in the very
mouth of the maine <hi>Ocean,
Varius,</hi> and <hi>Didius oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely</hi>
lieutenants generall.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:2509:227"/>
but the strife with the sea
it selfe, was sorer then that
of Fleete with Fleete: for
the <hi>Ocean,</hi> as it were to
chastize owne countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for their madnesse,
dasht <hi>indifferently</hi> of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their nauies in
pieces. What a ghastly,
and hideous sight was that,
when at one, and the same
instant, seas, stormes and
tackle fought together!
Adde to all this, the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
situation of the place,
where the shores of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and <hi>Mauritania</hi> on this
coast, and on that, doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in a manner to claspe,
and meete the sea both me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,
&amp; maine <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,</hi>
and <hi>Hercules</hi> pillars,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:2509:227"/>
                     <hi>opposite mountaines,</hi> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ouer. At which time,
foule weather, and fierce
battell raged round about.
After this, both parts ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
here &amp; there, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselues in the siege
of cities; whose case was
miserable, while betweene
the leaders of seuerall sides,
they smarted deepely for
their friendship with the
<hi>Romans.</hi> The last battell of
all was at <hi>Munda.</hi> Here the
fight was not answerable to
the felicity of other fights,
but doubtfull for a long
time, and discontentiue; so
as fortune plainely seemed
to deliberate vpon the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of some, I know not
what, thing. Certainely,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:2509:228"/>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> himselfe was seene
before the armie sadder
then for his wont, whether
in regard of humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or as suspecting that
the excesse of prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
would not hold out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,
or as fearing the
same things which <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
found, so soone as once
he came to be what <hi>Pompey</hi>
was: but in the very battell
it selfe, after the armies had
with equall slaughter done
nothing for a long space
but kill, suddenly (the like
whereof no man liuing
could remember) in the
most heate of the fight,
there was a deepe silence
on both sides, as if they
were agreed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this was euery
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:2509:228"/>
ones coneit of it. Last of all,
which <hi>Caesar</hi> in foureteene
yeeres before had neuer
seene, the selected tride
band of his old souldiers
(an hainous matter) gaue
backe: so that although
they fell not as yet to flat
running away, nothing
was playner notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
then that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
more for pure shame,
then valour. <hi>Caesar</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
putting his horse from
him, ranne like a mad-man
into the head of the battell:
there hee staid such as were
shrinking, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firming them,
and finally cried, and flew
through all the squadrons
with his eyes, and hands in
that perturbation, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:2509:229"/>
hee debated within
himselfe, what to doe with
himselfe, if the worst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell,
and his countenance
was, as of a man, who
meant to make his owne
hand his owne executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
had not fiue cohorts
of <hi>the Pompeian</hi> horse cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the battell, as sent by
<hi>Labienus</hi> to guard the
campe in danger, giuen a
semblant of flying: which
either <hi>Caesar</hi> did himselfe
beleeue, or cunningly lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hold vpon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of that seeming, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
as vpon flyers, and did
thereby both put fresh spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
into his owne people,
and did also daunt his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies:
for his people
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:2509:229"/>
thinking they had the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hand, followed the
more boldly, and the <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peians,</hi>
while they supposed
their fellowes ranne away,
did fall themselues to run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
How great the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was of the enemies, and
the wrath, and furie of the
victorious, may bee by this
coniectured: such as esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of the field, beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
themselues to <hi>Munda,</hi>
and <hi>Caesar</hi> commanding
them to bee forth with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
a rampire was made
by piling vp dead bodies,
dragg'd <hi>thither</hi> from all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and fastned together
with speares and iauelins.
An abominable spectacle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

The third was the

with her vncles by <hi>Sylla's</hi>

His countrey therefore not

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:2509:231"/>
besides all these, himselfe

<hi>Antonius,</hi> Consull, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of a king were
offred: all which prooued
but as ribbands, or trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings

the mildnesse of this prince
was lookt vpon with enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

was to free mindes
cumbersome. Nor was the

and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and other
<hi>Patricians, Lords of the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:2509:232"/>

assassinate him. How great
is the force of fate! the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
was knowne far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade;
a scroll was giuen
also to <hi>Caesar</hi> himselfe, vpon
the very day <hi>of the fact;</hi> &amp;
though an hundred beasts

of them had any signe of
luckines. He came into the

the Senators stabd at him,
as he sat in his court-chair, &amp;
with twenty three wounds
he was driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ground.
So, he who had embrewed
the whole earth with ciuill

<hi>which had</hi> but newly <hi>beene</hi>

whither warre could not

all the nations of that
tract, the <hi>Brenns, Senons,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Vindelicians,</hi> by his son in
law <hi>whose mother hee had
married, Claudius Drusus.</hi>
How sauage those crafty
people were, appeared wel
enough by the women,
who for want of <hi>mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous</hi>
weapons, pasht their
<hi>sprawling</hi> babes on the

in the souldiers faces, as
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:2509:251"/>

barres, themselues wrapt

Against them hee went in

bridges to be made. Here
the waters, and enemies
empeaching him, as our
souldiers were slacke to
scale, hee rasht a target out
of one of their hands, and
led the way, the troupe

bloud which dropt from
him, making him shew the
brauer, and his danger it

he assaild the enemy at the

wall'd in with two wilde fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,

<hi>Drauus, Sauus,</hi> and <hi>Ister,</hi>
and they, hauing first fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
their next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
retired themselues
within their defences. For
taming these hee sent out
<hi>Vibius:</hi> who slue them on
either banke of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.
The armours of the
vanquisht were not consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with fire, as the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

preserued, and throwne
into the streames, that the
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:2509:252"/>
newes of their fellowes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
might so be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed
to the residue.
The <hi>Dalmatians,</hi> for the
most part, dwell close at
wood-sides, which makes
them wondrous forward
more then all other, to
commit robberies: <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
by burning <hi>Delmini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
their principall citie,
had now as it were cut off

How wilde, and grimme

is horrible to bee

The <hi>Mysians</hi> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

to sacrifice, and eat the
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:2509:253"/>
bowels of those captaines
<hi>of ours</hi> whom they should
kill. I may very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the Gods heard their
speech: they could not
stand out the sounding of
a trumpet. <hi>Domitius,</hi> a
captaine, strooke no little
terrour into the barbarous,
himselfe a man of a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
blunt wit, but which
did well enough among his
likes, who carrying, <hi>for
as it were his crest,</hi> a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing-dish,
or little harth
vpon his helmet, and the
coales thereof kindling
with the motion of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
the flames seemed to
blaze as if his head were on
fire. Before them in time,
the most mightie people
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:2509:254"/>
of <hi>Thrace</hi> rebelled, who as
barbarous as they were,
yet were accustomed to
militarie ensignes, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
yea and to <hi>Roman</hi>
weapons also: but being
vtterly subdued by <hi>Piso,</hi>
they shewed their wood
rage in their very bondage
it selfe. For attempting to
gnaw their chaines in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with their teeth, they
punisht their owne wilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
The <hi>Dacians</hi> keepe
them to their mountaines,
till the yce haue knit both
the bankes of <hi>Danubius</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and then as often
as it is <hi>hard</hi> frozen ouer,
they passe it, as vnder the

                     <hi>Caesar Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
thought good to
make that practice too hot
for them, though it was a
most difficult matter to
come where they were.
Sending <hi>Lentulus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>against them,</hi> he draue
them beyond the farther
banke, and planted garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
on the hither. If <hi>Dacia</hi>

The <hi>Sarmatians</hi> gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,
and ride in champaine

They haue nothing but
snow, and thinne woods.
Their barbarousnesse is so
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:2509:255"/>
great, as they vnderstand
not what peace meanes.
Would <hi>Germany</hi> also had
not thought it so great a
matter to ouercome. It
was more basely lost, then
gloriously gained. But
<hi>Augustus,</hi> forsomuch as
he knew his father hauing
twice past ouer <hi>Rhene</hi> by

there in honour of <hi>his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,</hi>
he desired to make a
prouince of it: and it was
done, could the barbarous
aswell haue brookt our
vices, as <hi>obeyd</hi> our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
<hi>Drusus,</hi> sent into
those regions, first tamed
the <hi>Vsipetes,</hi> then ouer-ran
the <hi>Tencthers,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Catti.</hi>
For hee had trimm'd a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:2509:255"/>
high hillock in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a trophea with the
most speciall spoils of the
<hi>Marcomanni.</hi> After that, he
inuaded these <hi>other</hi> most
puissant nations, the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusci,
Sueuians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sicambri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
at once: who burning
twenty captains of <hi>ours,</hi> had
bound themselues by that
fact to maintaine warre <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs,</hi> with so assured
hope of victory, that they
diuided the prey by bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
before-hand. The
<hi>Cherusci</hi> they would haue
the horse, <hi>for their share;</hi>
the <hi>Sueuians</hi> the gold,
and siluer; the <hi>Sicambri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
the prisoners. But all
went quite backward on
their sides. For <hi>Drusus</hi>
                     <pb n="484" facs="tcp:2509:256"/>
preuailing, did share, and
sell their horses, cattel, and
chaines <hi>of gold,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
as lawfull prize.
Moreouer, hee left garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
euery-where behinde
him, and guards for defence
of the prouinces. Vpon the
riuer of <hi>Mose,</hi> of <hi>Albis,</hi> of
<hi>Visurgis,</hi> and the banke of
<hi>Rhene,</hi> hee planted aboue
fiftie castels. Hee ioyn'd
<hi>Bonna,</hi> and <hi>Gelduba</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with bridges, and
strengthened them with
shipping. Hee opened the
<hi>Hercinian</hi> wood, till that
time pathlesse, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene.
To conclude, such
was the peace in <hi>Germany,</hi>
that the men seemed not
the same men, the soile see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:2509:256"/>
other then it had bin,
and the ayre it selfe more
milde, and temperate then
euer. And that most gallant
yong gentleman (I call him
not so, out of flatterie, but
as he well deserued) dying
there, the Senate, which it
neuer had done to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
surnamed him of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,
Germanicus.</hi> But it
is more difficult to keepe
a prouince, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
it. Prouinces are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued
by the sword, but
retayned by iustice. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that reioycement was
short. For the <hi>Germans</hi>
were rather ouercome
then tamed, and vnder
Generall <hi>Drusus</hi> they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
admitted our customs,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:2509:257"/>
then submitted to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
When hee was once
dead, they beganne to hate
the lawlesse humour, and
pride of <hi>Quintilius Varus</hi>
no otherwise, then as they
would haue hated cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie.
But hee durst set
vp a Law-Court, and
sit in iudgement within
his campe, as if hee had
beene able to restraine
the violence of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
with his serieants
roddes, and cryers voice.
But they, who now a
good while since had seene
their blades canker'd with
rust, and their horse <hi>of
seruice</hi> growne foggie
with ease, no sooner saw
our gownes, and lawes
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:2509:257"/>
more cruell then our
weapons, but they make
<hi>Arminius</hi> captaine, and
fall to armes. When <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
in the meane space, was
so aduenturous vpon trust
of peace, as hee tooke
no heed at all, though the
conspiracie of the captains
was foretold, and disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to him by <hi>Segestes,</hi> a
prince among them. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(O strange securenes!)
as hee sat vpon the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
citing parties, they
at vnawares assaile him
on all hands, taken ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
vnprouided, and
fearing no such matter,
sacke his campe, and
destroy three legions. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
followed the vtter
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:2509:258"/>
losse of things there, with
the same fate, and minde
that <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> did
the deadly blow at <hi>Cannae.</hi>
Nothing was more blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
then the slaughter
which was made through
the woods, and marshes;
nothing more intolerable
then the insultings of the
barbarous, specially against
pleaders at the bar, pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the eyes of some,
and lopping-off the hands
of other some; one had
his mouth stitcht-vp, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his tongue was first
cut out, which the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
<hi>actor</hi> grasping in his
hand, sayd to it: <hi>Thou
viper, at last giue ouer hiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</hi>
The body of the
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:2509:258"/>
Consul himself, which the
souldiers had in their pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
buried, was digged out
of his graue. The barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
doe as yet withhold
two of our ensignes, &amp; two
of our eagles; the third
the eagle-bearer plucking
off, before the enemies layd
hand vpon him, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it <hi>hidden</hi> in the hollow
of his belt, was plunged so
into the bloudy marsh. By
this ouerthrow it came to
passe, that the course of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
which had not stopt at
the <hi>Ocean,</hi> stayd vpon the
banke of <hi>Rhene.</hi> These
things hapned north-ward.
In the South of the world
there were rather hurly-burlies
then war. The <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulanians,</hi>
                     <pb n="490" facs="tcp:2509:259"/>
&amp; <hi>Gaetulians</hi> who
border vpon the <hi>Syrts,</hi> were
chastised by <hi>Cossus</hi> captain
generall, at <hi>Caesars</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
who was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
proper-named <hi>Gaetuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi>
The victory spreds wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Hee left the <hi>Marmari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Garamants</hi> for <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
who subdued them: &amp;
might haue return'd <hi>entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Marmaricus,</hi> but that
his modesty rated not his
conquest so high. In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient,
there was more to
doe with the <hi>Armenians.</hi>
Thither <hi>Caesar</hi> sent one
of his nephewes. Both
were of short life, and the
one of them inglorious.
For <hi>Lucius</hi> died of sicknes
at <hi>Massilia: Caius</hi> died
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:2509:259"/>
in <hi>Lycia</hi> of a wound, as he
recouerd <hi>Armenia,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
it selfe to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.
Pompey,</hi> hauing
vanquisht king <hi>Tigranes,</hi>
tide the <hi>Armenians</hi> to this
only poynt of bondage,
that they should haue no
gouernours but at our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
This right of
ours, hitherto intermitted,
was reuiued by <hi>Caius,</hi> not
without bloudshed, and
yet without much bicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
for <hi>Domnes,</hi> whom
the king had made gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Artaxat,</hi> faining
a reuolt, assailes him as he
was busie in perusing a
scroll, which himselfe had
reacht vnto him, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it containd an account
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:2509:260"/>
of the treasures; and with
his drawne sword, runnes
him into the forehead. but
the <hi>Barbarian</hi> was tilted at
on all sides by the armie,
who being destroyd with
sword, and fire, into which
hee threw himselfe woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">superstiti e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam non Caesari sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfecit.</note>
satisfied <hi>Caius</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing
<hi>him,</hi> but did not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<hi>Caesar.</hi> In the west
part of the world, all <hi>Spain</hi>
was at quiet, excepting that
quarter which abutting
close vpon the rocks where
the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> mountaines
end, is washt with the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ocean.</hi> Here, two most
puisant nations, the <hi>Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians,</hi>
and <hi>Asturians</hi> liued
free from command. the
<hi>Cantabrians</hi> were the more
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:2509:260"/>
forward <hi>of the two,</hi> the
haughtier also, and stifer
in holding out a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>for</hi> not contented to
maintaine their owne free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
they sought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croch
vpon their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and wearied the
<hi>Vaccaeans, Curgonians,</hi> and
<hi>Autrigons,</hi> with often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions.
against these men,
because they were said to
deale more outragiously
then ordinarie, <hi>Caesar</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
not an expedition
<hi>to be made by any other,</hi> but
went in person: came him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to <hi>Segisama;</hi> pitcheth
his camp; and from thence
euen then, diuiding his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
into diuers parts,
hemd all <hi>Cantabria</hi> about,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:2509:261"/>
and conquerd that wilde
nation, by inuironing them
as beasts within a toyle. nor
was the <hi>Ocean</hi> theirs: for
our army well-appointed
for warre, plaid vpon the
backs of the enemie. His
first battell against the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabrians</hi>
was vnder the
walls of <hi>Vellica.</hi> from
hence they fled into that
most steep high mountaine
<hi>Vindius,</hi> whither they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
the waues of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean</hi>
might as soone haue
clambred, as the <hi>Roman</hi>
armie. thirdly, the towne
<hi>Arracillum</hi> made great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
but yet was taken
at the last. In the siege of
mount <hi>Edulius,</hi> about
which hee had drawne a
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:2509:261"/>
trench of fifteene miles in
compasse, the <hi>Romans</hi>
mounted on all sides: and
when the barbarous saw
no possibilitie to escape,
their strife was who should
kill themselues first with
fire, and sword amidst their
feasts, or with poison, which
is commonly there scruzed
out of Tax-trees, and so
the greater part of them
deliuerd themselues from
that which seemd to them
captiuitie. <hi>Caesar</hi> had these
seruices done for him by
<hi>Antistius, Furnius,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi>
his deputies, while
himselfe wintred vpon the
sea-coasts of <hi>Tarracon.</hi> He
present in his owne person
at the doing, drew some
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:2509:262"/>
of the vanquished from
dwelling on the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains,
of some hee tooke hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and of others he made
slaues, and sold them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
garlands. It seemed to
the Senate an action wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of laurell, and a chariot:
but <hi>Caesar</hi> was now at that
heighth, as he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
to triumph. About
the same time the <hi>Asturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
came powring downe
from their mountaines in
an huge troupe, nor did
they stay their owne,<note place="margin">vt barbari impares.</note> (as the
barbarous are vnruly) but
pitching their campe by
the riuer <hi>Astura,</hi> and, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding
their force into three
armies, they prepared to
assaile three seueral camps
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:2509:262"/>
of the <hi>Romans</hi> all at a time.
the fight had beene doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and bloudy, and had
made an end of both parts,
they comming then, as
they did, so strong, so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
and with such sound
deliberation, but that the
<hi>Brigaecins</hi> betrayd them,
by whom <hi>Carisius</hi> hauing
intelligence, he came vpon
them with an armie, and
destroyd their deuice, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
the battell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
so was not vnbloudy,
such as remained vnflaine
of that most puisant assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
retired themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the citie <hi>Lancia:</hi> where
the fight was so sharpe and
hot, that when our souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
demanded leaue to set
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:2509:263"/>
fire on the citie after it was
taken, the Generall could
hardly obtaine the fauour
at their hands, that it
might rather bee a moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Roman</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
standing, then burnt to
the ground. This was the
last warre of <hi>Augustus
Caesar,</hi> and the last rebellion
of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Constant allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and eternall peace
forthwith ensued, aswell
by reason of their owne
inclination more bent to
peace, as by <hi>Caesars</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
who fearing the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which mountaines
bred in them, commanded
them to inhabit <hi>from
thenceforth</hi> in those camps
of his which were vpon
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:2509:263"/>
plaine ground. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to bee found a matter
of high wisdome. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
round about was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
full of gold-oare, of
vermilion, orpiment, and
other colours. Hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
commanded the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
should bee searcht, and
wrought. For while the
<hi>Asturians</hi> digged their
owne treasures, and riches
which lay deepe hidden, to
serue others turnes, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
also began to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their value. All the
West; and South of the
world being at peace, and
Northward also (excepting
onely the <hi>Rhene,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babius)</hi>
as likewise in the
East, betweene <hi>Taurus,</hi>
                     <pb n="500" facs="tcp:2509:264"/>
and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> those other
<hi>countreys</hi> who were free
from our power, had a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
notwithstanding how
great it was, &amp; reuerenced
the people of <hi>Romes</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ouer nations. For both
the <hi>Scythians</hi> sent their
ambassadours, and the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matians</hi>
also, desiring
friendship. The <hi>Seres</hi>
moreouer, and the <hi>Indians</hi>
inhabiting right vnder the
Sunne it selfe, came with
precious stones, and pearls,
and dragging elephants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
along after them among
their presents, thought
not so much of any thing
as of the length of the
way, which tooke vp foure
yeeres trauell: and the <hi>very</hi>
                     <pb n="501" facs="tcp:2509:264"/>
colour it selfe of the men
spake for them, that they
came from vnder as it were
another Sunne. The <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
in like sort, as if they
repented their victorie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
the ensignes taken at
the destruction of <hi>Crassus.</hi>
So all mankinde had eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-where
an entire, and
continuall either peace, or
paction. And <hi>Caesar Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
seuen hundred
yeeres from after the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of <hi>Rome,</hi> durst shut
the Temple of double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
<hi>Ianus;</hi> twice onely
clozed before that time;
once vnder king <hi>Numa,</hi> and
the other time when the
first warre of <hi>Carthage</hi> was
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:2509:265"/>
concluded. From hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,
bending his minde
to peace, hee corrected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in the times
<hi>which were</hi> prone to all
mischiefe, and which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
in riotous loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
with graue, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
edicts. For these so
many, and so wondrous
great deeds of his, hee was
called <hi>perpetual Dictator,</hi>
and <hi>Father of his Countrey.</hi>
It was also debated in the
Senate, whether, because
hee had founded the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
hee should bee styled
<hi>Romulus.</hi> But the name
<hi>Augustus</hi> seemed to bee a
more holy, and venerable
word <hi>then the other,</hi> that
so euen now while hee
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:2509:265"/>
liued on the earth, hee
might bee <hi>as it were</hi> dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide
by the name it
selfe, and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
