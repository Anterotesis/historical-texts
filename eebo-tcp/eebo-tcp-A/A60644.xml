         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THou art to underſtand, that the na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tural
man can neither ſee nor receive
the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
Spiritually diſcerned, and it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritual
minde that is onely in a capacity
to receive and underſtand thoſe things
which by the Spirit is declared and made
manifeſt, for the Spirit is the key by
which Divine truths are opened, and by
the intelligence of it they alſo come
to be underſtood, and the teſtimony which
hath been publiſhed and held forth unto
the precious truth of God in theſe latter
dayes, hath been abundantly ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, by the Spirits, Power and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
through the faithfull and choſen
witneſſeſs of the New birth, unto whom
the Lord God everlaſting, hath revealed
his ſecrets, and open the myſteries of
<pb facs="tcp:43721:4"/>
glorious kingdome; and hath given unto
them the tongue of the learned, and the
power and wiſdome of his heavenly life,
whereby they are able to divide the word
aright, and to diſpence the Goſpel of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
peace, and they have faithfully
ſerved the Lord in their generation, and
have not been negligent to run the way of
his commandements, but early and late
have laboured in their holy calling
whereunto the Lord hath called them in
the work of the Goſpel, and their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doth ſtand for God this day, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a ſweet Savour in the hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and that glorious truth which ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
hath been poured forth by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit of God, and ſo wonderfully is
ſpread abroad through the testimony of
his faithfull Servants, it doth ſtand and
remaine as a ſure record which cannot be
raced out, &amp; though it might be ſufficient
to clear the Lords faithfull ſervants on
their own behalf, as alſo to leave all people
without excuſe, who hitherto have ſhut
their hearts againſt it, yet ſuch is Gods
<pb facs="tcp:43721:4"/>
tender love, that he continues his favours
and goodneſs, and in the openings of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in the riches of his mercy, he fills his
children and ſervants with an overflowing
cup of his precious virtue, which yet
doth conſtraine them to make known the
true and perfect way of peace, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
the word of eternal life unto the
Sons and Daughters of men, and though
many have walked unworthily, and have
requited the Lord unkindly, yet doth
his compaſſion move to his own begotten
that ſits in deſolate and ſollitary places, as
a babe without comfort, and in the vertue
of his own life he keeps his teſtimony freſh
upon the hearts of his meſſengers, and they
run in his power and are not weary, and
walkes in his love and are not faint; but
continues in their race of well doing
though many faces have ever been ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: therefore whoſoever thou art
that reads in this booke, conſider the end
of its manifeſtation, for it is not publiſhed
to be onely ſeen and read, but to manifeſt
the truth as it is in Jeſus, which thou art
<pb facs="tcp:43721:5"/>
to weigh and ponder in the fear of God,
for the matter in this booke doth lye out
of ſight to the carnal eye, and the matter
cannot be underſtood by reading the
words onely, but by taking heed to the
meaſure of Gods Spirit in thee, for if
thou doe not read with the Spirit of God
in thee, thou cannot underſtand the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the words, though thou may read
them over and over; for whoſoever would
come to the true knowledge of God they
must come to the meaſure of his Spirit
themſelves, or otherwiſe they may read but
reap no profit, and ſo the Scriptures have
been read and heard, but the Spirit not
being minded in thoſe that read and hear,
there is not an underſtanding of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of which the words teſtifie, and ſo the
the book is ſealed though the words be
read and heard, (marke that) for there is
not another way to come to the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, but through death to that
part which would comprehend him, and
though a faithfull teſtimony may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
by words and writings, yet cannot
<pb facs="tcp:43721:5"/>
any thereby come to the knowledg of God,
for God is not ſo to be comprehended,
therefore it concernes every one that comes
into the world to minde the light of
Chriſt, with which they are enlightened,
&amp; to wait in it for the Revelation of God;
for there is none knowes the Father but
the Son, and he to whom the Son reveales
him, and whoſoever would compaſs the
knowledge of God in any other way, or
by any other thing, they can never come
to a true knowledge of him; for where
the will and deſire is let at liberty to the
comprehending of God and Chriſt, there the
minde overruns the true light in which the
ſecrets of God are opened and revealed,
and though words and writings may in
themſelves be true, yet none can profit by
them, but as they joyn to that of God in
themſelves, for the ſecrets of God cannot
be any otherwiſe known or attained, but
as there is a patient waiting in that which
openeth, by it to be gathered into the nature
of that which is opened, and whoſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſs
knowledg by any other way, it is the
vaile which ſpreads over their hearts, and
<pb facs="tcp:43721:6"/>
blinds their mindes for beholding the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of God in his light and life, and
though ſuch as ſo gather knowledge may
ſeem wiſe in what they kn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w, and in their
knowledge ſatisfie themſelves, and esteeme
themſelves to be the higheſt; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they are as ſtrangers unto the
heavenly miſteries of the glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for though the natural man may
hear all words, and read all writings
which from the life is declared, yet is the
miſtery hid from his eyes, and by how
much he ſearches in his own wiſdom to
know, and ſtrives vvith that part to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the miſterie in the words decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
by ſo much the more doth he thicken
the vaile upon his underſtanding, and
th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ugh a man may fill himſelfe with ſuch
a knovvledge, and by his curious ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gather and compaſs much riches, yet it
is no more but enriching the falſe birth;
&amp; exalting it with pride in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of its riches; and though ſuch a man
perſwade himſelf that he knows all things,
yet he knows nothing as he ought to know,
<pb facs="tcp:43721:6"/>
neither is he any more but as ſounding
Braſs, and a tinkling Cymbal; and there
is no greater danger then to fall into this
Sea of Knowledg, and to be toſsed about
with its restleſs waves; for it is as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to number the Stars in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as for a man that ſwims in the
Sea of Knowledg to be at reſt. So, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
this learn to underſtand, that the
way of God is not as the way of man; and
it is most certain, that he which ſeeks
riches by his own knowledg, he runs in
his own way, and the end of that way is
death, but the way of God is life and
peace, and there is none can find it with
all their ſearching and comprehending,
but by quiet and patient waiting, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
man comes to feel the light of Chriſt
with which he is enlightened, and ſo
comes down into the humility, and into
the poverty, where the light ſtops his
wanderings and runnings, and prevents
him for walking in his own way, and with
the light he comes to ſee the danger that
he is in, and ſo comes to stand still in
<pb facs="tcp:43721:7"/>
ſilence, in which man being contented,
and waiting patiently upon God, the light
will turn him from his own way, and
the cunning devices of his own heart, and
bring him into the new and living way,
and there will become his leader and
teacher, and ſo lead him in the croſs to
his own Will, Wiſdome, and Reaſon, the
power of God which is the croſs of Chriſt,
will ſtrike over it, and croſs it, and yoak
it down, and ſo he will be humbled to the
death of the Croſs, where to his own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
he will become a fool, and to his
own riches he will become poor, and there
dye the death to his own life, and then
the babe riſes up in the power, and the
ſecrets of God is with it, and that is the
great gain of godlineſs, when man is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
out of himſelf, and comes to Chriſt, in
whom is all the treaſures of wiſdom and
true knowledg, and in whom the fulneſs
of the God-head dwelleth bodily; this
is true tranſlation out of the earthly
into the heavenly, where the babe knows
the Father, and ſits in the feeling of his
<pb facs="tcp:43721:7"/>
preſence with joy, and there it is truly
contented with what it hath, and waits
in patience to receive what it hath not,
and whether it have more or leſs, it is
contented, and covets not beyond the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
giving; and here is immortal food
which ſatiſfies the immortal ſoul, which
never can be compaſſed or gained in mans
own way, ſo to die is the greatest gain,
and to become a fool, poor and nothing,
is the way to be truly wiſe, rich, and
poſſeſſe all things, and through this ſtrait
gate, and in this narrow way is perfect
peace and rest for ever.</p>
            <p>And now, Reader, be thou diligent to
underſtand what thou readeſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
thy preſent ſtate, that thou may not
ſecure thy ſelf in thy own way as if there
was no danger, and take up thy rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou haſt paſſed through death, there
is that in thee which would ſave its life,
and will reaſon ſtrongly to defend it, but
if thou love that life and ſeek to ſave it,
thou looſes life eternal, therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate,
the matter is weighty, and do
<pb facs="tcp:43721:8"/>
not deceive thy ſelf through thy own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
nor do not wrong thy ſelf with a vain
hope, as if all ſhould be well hereafter,
but wait to underſtand what the power of
God hath done for thee, and what thou
haſt denied in pure love to God, for if thou
do not follow Chriſt in the daily Croſs,
thou art not his Diſciple, and if not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple,
then not an heir of God, nor a joynt
heir with Chriſt of the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
therefore pleaſe not thy ſelf with
thy own comprehenſions, as if thou had
compaſſed God and Chriſt with thy own
wiſdome, but conſider whether thou be
regenerated and born again of incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
ſeed, and whether thou ſit in the joy
of Gods ſalvation, and whether thou have
thy portion in his Kingdom, this is
weighty for thee to conſider; for if in ſome
meaſure this be not fulfilled in thee, and
witneſſed by thee, in deed and in truth,
thy latter end will be bitterneſs if thou
continue in thine own way, and then thy
fair ſayings will not help thee, nor thy
wealth and riches comfort thee, when the
Lord ſaies, <hi>Depart from me.</hi> Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:43721:8"/>
bow to the day of the Lord in thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that thou may feel Chriſt to conquer
the reſtleſſe part in thee, and to ſubject
the worker of iniquity; and do not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the tenders of Gods love unto thee,
but when he calls do thou hearken, and
when he reproves do thou obey, and when
he commands do thou follow, and then,
where ever he leads thee, he will be with
thee, and in all thy afflictionſ he will
comfort thee, and with his arm of power
he will ſupport thee, and out of all thy
troubles he will deliver thee, and there
thou wilt know him and feel him beyond
thy own wiſdom and reaſon, and he will
make thee run when thy reaſon would
stop thee, and will be ready to ſave thee
when the enemy tempts thee, and ſo thou
wilt know him a God at hand, if thou be
faithful to his councel, therefore fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and ſubmit unto him, whilſt his
love is to thee, for he is God, and there
is not another, <hi>who can see him, and
live?</hi> who can ſtand bef<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re him and not
be conſumed? who can eat of the tree of
life and not die by the flaming Sword?
<pb facs="tcp:43721:9"/>
All fleſh is graſs, and the height of all its
glorie must paſs away; but who are born
of the ſeed immortal, they ſhall proſper
unto a fair ſtature in Chriſt, and in him
live for ever. So do thou mind the light
and power of God in thy Conſcience, and
read in meekneſs and fear, and the truth
in thy inward parts will anſwer to the
truth of what thou readest, for truth is
but one in all, and it anſwers to its own
as face anſwers face in a glaſs; and if
thou with the truth in thee, readeſt the
teſtimonie without thee, thou wilt feel a
perfect cloſing with the matter in unitie,
for in the truth there is neither error nor
deceit, but a plain, ſimple, harmleſs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
life in all godly ſincerity, in which
thou feeling thy heart diſpoſed, thou wilt
both read and profit; and if ſo it come
to paſs concerning thee, give God the
praiſe and glory, and therein the labour of
my love will have true rejoycing, who
ſeeks the good and welfare of all men,
and the glory of God alone.</p>

            <p>Quest.<hi> HOw doth God manifeſt himſelf
unto man, ſo as man may
know him to be what he is?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A.sw. By opening himself in his love,
whereby his own light breaketh forth
from himself, in which he manifests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto man, to be what he is.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What is that light, by which God
manifests himſelf unto man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. That light is Christ, who is one
with God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But is the light of Chriſt, one with
God in nature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for God is light, and the light
is one with his nature.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How doth Chriſt manifeſt the nature
of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. In his light and life, in which he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43721:10"/>
is the brightness of the Fathers glory, and
the express image of his person.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And where is ſuch a manifeſtation
of God to be known?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It is to be known within man.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Doth God manifeſt himſelf within
man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, and man cannot know him
by any other way, but by the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of himself in his light within
him.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And hath every man ſuch a light
within him, by which God doth manifeſt
himſelf unto him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for every man that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world is enlightned by Christ.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is that the true light with which
every man is enlightned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, it is the true light, for it is the
light of Christ.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is there not another way to
come to the knowledge of God, but by that
light within?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Nay, there is not, for Christ is the
light, and Christ is the way, and all other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43721:10"/>
wayes leads from God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How may it be known that the light
doth come from God, and that God doth
manifeſt himſelf in it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Because the light is pure, holy, just
and righteous, which is the nature of
God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But how may it be known in ſuch a
manifeſtation of its purity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. By its checking, convincing, and
reproving for sin, and every evil thought
word, and work, which man in the fall
hath a love unto, and pleasure in.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But is that which checks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
man in his conſcience for his ſin,
the true light of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for there is nothing else within
man that will check or reprove him so
sin and evil.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But may it not be a natural light
within man that hath ſuch reflexions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him for his ſin and evil, as to convince
and reprove him for it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It is the natural light of Christ
but not of man in the fall, for there his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43721:11"/>
nature is corrupted, and the powers of
darkneſs hath dominion over him, and
that is the nature from which all ſin and
evil is committed; and that nature which
commits ſin, will never convince or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
for it; for if it was ſo, it would
be againſt it self, and therefore it muſt
needs be, that it is the light of Chriſt
which convinces and reproves for sin,
becauſe in him there is no ſin, and the
ſin is committed in another nature, and
is againſt him, which with his light he
reproveth, as being against him, and ſo
it is a natural light from Chriſt, which
reproves the natural man in the fall.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But hath man at any time known
God as he is God, by that light which is
within him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for the Apoſtle said, The light
which ſhines in our hearts, gives us the
light of the knowledg of the glory of
God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, and so
he hath been known, and is known, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the meaſure of light manifeſt
in Chriſt within man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43721:11"/>
Q.<hi> And is there any thing in man that
is of a contrary nature to the light, which
doth oppoſe it, and by which man is vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the knowledge of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, there is darkneſs in man, in
which the ſeed of enmity lodgeth, which
doth oppose the light, and vailes man
from the knowledg of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How is darkneſs and light in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
one to the other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. In their several workings, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their natures; for darkneſs leads
to that which is evil, and the light leads
to that which is good, and ſo they are in
oppoſition one to the other, for when
the darkneſs worketh unto ſin, the light
reproves it, and when the light worketh
unto good, the darkneſs oppoſes it in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth the Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
ſtand in the Natures or Seeds of
light and darkneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, it doth so, for the ſeed of light
is Chriſt, whom God hath elected and
chosen before the foundation of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43721:12"/>
world, and the ſeed of darkneſs is the
Devil and enmity which is reprobated
for ever.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And did <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> ſignifie
the nature of theſe ſeeds, in which the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
and Reprobation ſtandeth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, they did so, for <hi>Jacob</hi> was
of the true seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father
of the faithful, unto whom God ſealed
his Covenant, and to his ſeeds ſeed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and <hi>Eſau</hi> was of the seed of Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and so was out of Gods Covenant
Reprobated.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How did <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> ſtand in
the ſight of God whilst they were in the
womb, ſeeing that before they were born,
or had done either good or evil, <hi>Jacob</hi>
was loved of God, and <hi>Eſau</hi> hated?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. They stood in their natures or
seeds in which each was conceived, and
though both in <hi>Rebekahs</hi> womb as twins,
yet the one was of flesh, the other of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and <hi>Eſau</hi> being of the flesh, he was
out of Gods Covenant, and <hi>Jacob</hi> being
the true seed, he was in Gods Covenant;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43721:12"/>
so <hi>Jacob</hi> was in the Election and God
loved him, but <hi>Eſau</hi> was in the reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and God hated him, and thus God
beheld them in the womb before they
had done either good or evil, that
his own purpose according to Election
might stand.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And hath theſe natures or ſeeds
been in every man through all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, they have so, for they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
two natures or people, and so Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath been againſt Nation in man
through all generations, in the natures of
the two seeeds.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What is the ſtate and condition of
people that remaine in the fall, and abides
in the tranſgreſſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. A state of trouble and vexation
of Spirit.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What diſpenſations muſt people
paſſe thorow to come unto peace and reſt
in God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. They must pass thorow the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of the Law and the Prophets, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43721:13"/>
Chriſt the ſubſtance, in whom is rest
and peace eternal.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What is the Law in it ſelfe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It is holy, spiritual, just and good.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Is not that which is holy, ſpiritual,
juſt and good, a diſpenſation in which
peace and rest is enjoyed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. As it comes to be fulfiiled by
Christ it is, but the dispensation of it,
as it is the Law, is not, for the Law
makes nothing perfect, and there can be
no true reſt and peace, but in that which
is perfect and makes perfect.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What then doth the adminiſtration
of the Law ſerve unto, if it make nothing
perfect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It ſerves as a Schoolemaſter to
bring unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How is it as a Schoolemaſter in its
adminiſtration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. In correcting and judging the
transgressour, and instructing and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in righteouſneſs, for the Law was
added because of tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Is not Chriſt manifest through the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43721:13"/>
diſpenſations of the Law and and the
Prophets?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. According to that diſpenſation
unto which they ſerve, he is ſo, but it is
but darkly as in a glaſs.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How must the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
be paſſed thorow to come unto Chriſt
who fulfills them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. By observing the Statutes and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
that is therein contained,
whereby there is a going forward to the
more full enjoyment of the perfection
of Christ, who fulfills the Law and the
Prophets, in the more glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of his own fulneſs and perfect life.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Is the adminiſtration of the Law in
force in this preſent age?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, it is in force to take hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all transgressours, and it is Ministred
in juſtice againſt the transgreſſour, which
erres from the Statutes and Ordinances
that is therein contained.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But are not people in this age un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Goſpel adminiſtration, and are
they to be brought back again under the
Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:43721:14"/>
A. They that have not passed thorough
the administration of the Law in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they are not under a Goſpel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
and therefore they cannot
be brought back again, because they
never went forward, but they are to be
brought into that which hitherto they
have not known nor understood, for a
Goſpel administration barely profeſſed
will not doe people any good, and so it
is that many in this age looks over the
Law as an administration below their
profeſſion, and that the Law was a more
proper administration in ages past, and
more particularly to the Jews, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
that it hath its proper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
in man, whileſt ſin and
tranſgreſſion remaines in him, and so it
is in as full force in this age, upon all
tranſgreſſours, as ever it hath been in ages
past; for whosoever in this age that
doth offend in one point of it, they will
be found guilty of all, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will take hold to the correcting
of the guilty, for God will by no means
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43721:14"/>
clear the guilty.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is the throne of judgement ſet
up under the Law to judge and condemne
the tranſgreſſors of the Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, it is ſo, that every man might
fear the Lord God, who gives forth his
Law in man to be kept and not to be
broken.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But is it poſſible that man can keep
the Law in all things, and not offend in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, or that he can performe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirings
of God in that diſpenſation as it
is a Covenant of works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. If there was not a possibility on
mans part to keep it, then it would seem
hard that the Lord should command it
and require it, and for not keeping it to
judge and condemne for it: and there
was some in ages past, that walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord with perfect hearts, and
that under the adminiſtration of the
Law, but the ſhortneſs of obſerving or
mans part is the weakneſs and unprofit
ableneſs of the fleſh, ſo that he many
times cannot doe the things that he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43721:15"/>
would, and therein the first Covenant is
found faulty, not in it ſelfe, but in the
ſinfull flesh; and if it had not been ſo
concerning the obſerving of the firſt
Covenant, there could not be place for
the ſecond, and therefore the works of
the first Covenant doth not obtaine life
and ſalvation, but the free grace in the
ſecond Covenant, that all people might
dye to themſelves according to the fleſh,
and live unto God according to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that so life and ſalvation may not be
of works but by Grace, in the rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God through Jesus Chriſt, who
in his full and glorious appearance in
man is the end of the Law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousneſs,
and brings life and immortality
to light by the Coſpel, and then there is
no more ſervitude or bondage under the
Law, because of the weakneſs of the
fleſh, but redemption wrought by the
power of Chriſt from under it, into a
more perfect ſtate of freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in his own life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> What is ſignified by the Propheſies?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:43721:15"/>
A. The nearer approaching or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nigh of Christ in his own fulness and
and perfect life, that whereas he hath
been seen but darkly, as in a glass, under
the Law, he may be seen with open face
in the compleat beauty of his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Cospel.</p>
            <p>Q <hi> Of what ſervice are the Scriptures
as they are given forth and recorded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Much every way unto thoſe that
have received the same Spirit from
which they were givenforth, for unto ſuch
they are profitable, and makes wise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
salvation, and are unto them of ſervice
for inſtruction, edification and comfort,
the ſame Spirit in them receiving the
Testimony of the Spirit as it is declared
in the Scripture, and there is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and union in the Spirit within, and
alſo in the words without, and ſo there
is inſtruction, edification and comfort by
the Scriptures unto all that are in the
ſame Spirit as gave them forth.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But are they of no further ſervice
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43721:16"/>
then onely a Teſtimony of thoſe things
which was preſent in that time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. So much of them as was given
forth by the holy men of God, through
the inspiration of the Almighty, they
testifie of Christ, who was, and is, and is to
come, and that is onely their ſervice in
their place, that through the Testimony
therein declared unto Christ, all people
might come unto him, and have life.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> By what doth Chriſt manifeſt his
life, ſo as that it may be known to be his
life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. By his light he manifeſts it, and as
the light is received by which it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
ſo is life received in it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Is the light and the life diſtinct
Principles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Nay, the light is Christ, and the
life is Chriſt, and they are not diſtinct
Principles, but he is known to be light
in manifeſting, and life in quickening.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What is the adminiſtration of Chriſt
in the appearance of his own fulneſs and
perfect life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:43721:16"/>
A. An adminiſtration of love, grace,
and mercy.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth he appear to ſalvation in
that adminiſtration of his love, grace and
mercy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. To as many as receives him in that
appearance, he becomes their ſalvation,
but ſuch as reject him, he is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Is not that adminiſtration univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
to ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The manifeſtation of it is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
unto all, but unbelievers have no part
in it, as an adminiſtration to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What is his adminiſtration in that
appearance of love, grace, and mercy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such as reject him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. An administration of Judgment,
to cut down and destroy the worker of
iniquity, and the gain-saying and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
nature.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How doth he appear in love and
judgment, in one and the ſame admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. He appears in love to the tender
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43721:17"/>
breathings which ſimply thirſteth after
him, and in judgment to the obſtinate
and rebellious nature, that ſtands in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
against him.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How is this adminiſtration of the
love, grace, and mercy of Chriſt to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. By his light in the conſcience, for
the light is manifest from his love and
life, and guids up to his love and life all
that obey it in its manifeſtation.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How doth the light manifeſt it ſelf
in order to the attainment of life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It manifests it ſelf against all that
in man, which alienates him from the
life.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How is man alienated from the life?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. By the power of darkneſs which
ruleth in him, and leads him captive.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What is captivity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The bondage of the seed of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What is that which cauſes bondage
and captivity upon the ſeed of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The seed of the evil doer, and
the generation of its unclean nature,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43721:17"/>
from which is produced all the heart
luſts with which the holy ſeed of God is
oppreſſed and burdened.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But doth the light of Chriſt in
the Conſcience make manifest the ground
of bondage?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for the ground of bondage is
darkneſs, and the light makes darkneſs
manifeſt, and appears against it, and all
the deeds of it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What is the state of man in bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. A state of grief, ſorrow, pain, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
tribulation, diſtreſſ, ſighing, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
crying, complaining, heavineſs and
groaning.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Is that the ſtate of all people that
are alienated from the life of Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for man in the fall and in the
apostacy is under the power of darkneſs
and all the evil deeds of darkneſs gender
together in a body, and that is the body
of ſin and death that lies upon him, and
the ſeed of God travels in pain under it
and groans to be delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:43721:18"/>
Q.<hi> But are not ſome people joyful whilſt
they are alienated from the life of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. the ſeed of the evil doer may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
over the ſeed of God, but that joy
is bondage, and it is a joy that muſt come
into mourning, and end in ſorrow, and in
the midst of that joy there is ſometimes
a sense of trouble and pain.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What are the deeds of darkneſs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
that do oppreſs and burden the
ſeed of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Fornication, uncleanneſs, lacivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
inordinate affections, evil concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisence,
covetouſneſs, drunkenneſs, pride,
anger, malice, envy, witch-craft, hatred,
variance, strife, foolish jesting, vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
vain thoughts, idle words,
praying in the will of the flesh, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the wiſdom below, ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
with all other things which are acted
by the motion of the fleſh, which are all
of a contrary nature to the pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeed of God, and is the oppreſſion and
burden of it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But how may ſuch people know when
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43721:18"/>
they live in ſuch things which doth burden
and oppreſs the ſeed of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. By the light of Christ in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
for the light doth make them
manifeſt, and also reproves them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth the light of Chriſt make
ſuch diſcoveries in the conſciences of
people?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for there is never a secret
thought but the light ſhews it; if the
heart intend any evil, it is ſeen in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and that which makes ſuch dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
is the light, for the light makes
all things manifest (mark) all things, and
if all things, then there is not any thing
that is hid from it; and so people may
know when there is an inclination or an
intention in their hearts to do any thing
that they ſhould not do, they ſometimes
are ſenſible that they ſhould not intend
that which they do, and will ſay, They
ſhould not have ſuch thoughts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
as is ſtirring in them, and so they
ſee in ſecret what they incline unto, and
many times are secretly convinced of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:43721:19"/>
vil of their own intentions and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and are ſtopped from doing that
which they have an intention to do; and
that which thus ſecretly discovers, and
ſecretly convinces, it is the light of Chriſt,
and ſo the compaſſion of God manifeſts
it self in the light, and he reacheth to
the oppreſſor with rebuke, and to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in love and mercy.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What is the ground of the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of the light by which ſuch diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are made?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The ground of its manifeſtation is
the love of God, for he would not that
any ſhould periſh; and all people in the
fall are in a periſhing ſtate, and therefore
he manifests his light to convince and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the ſinner in his way, that he may
turn from his way and live; and hereby
he is manifeſt to be a God gracious and
merciful, in that he would not the death
of a ſinner, but ſhews the sin to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and reproves him for it, that he might
forſake it and find mercy.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But can man be freed from ſinne
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43721:19"/>
whilest he is in the body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, if he love the light which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
it, the light will free him from it;
for in the light there is no ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they that joyn to the light which
reproves ſin, they with the light are guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of ſin, and so they come from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Satans power which is the ground of
ſin, unto the power of God which takes
the sin away, and thereby the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
comes to be purged and cleanſed
from all iniquity and ſin, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of Chriſt comes to be revealed in
a new life.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But is not the grace of God free by
Jeſus Chriſt, and hath not Chriſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
the work of ſalvation by himſelf
alone?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The grace of God is free by Jeſus
Christ, and in his light it is freely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
and therein it appears unto all, and
brings salvation unto all that receives it,
and so it may be felt what Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhes
for ſalvation by himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
which will not fall to an unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43721:20"/>
part, either as to what he hath done,
or is doing, in thoſe that believe in him.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But if there be a believing in Chriſt
for Salvation, doth not his Salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto ſuch without any thing done on
their part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Christ is the Author of Faith, and
there is none can truly believe untill he
give them Faith in his power, and he
doth not give Faith to any but such as
obeyes his light, and therefore such as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plis
Salvation by Christ through their own
beliefe of what he hath accomplished
for Salvation, they are not in the Faith
which ſaveth, but contrariwiſe are in the
unbeliefe to his light and power, in which
he bringeth Salvation, by the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his life.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How doth the light within man
manifest it ſelfe in order to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It manifeſts it ſelfe against the
darkneſs, and all the deeds of it, it finds
out all wandering thoughts, and vaine
immaginations, ſo that man may ſee
with the light that is within him, when
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:43721:20"/>
the darkness tempts him, and when the
luſts of the fleſh are moving to any evil;
and thus doth the light within man
manifest it selfe in order to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is the light an univerſall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
unto all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, And that without reſpect of
perſons.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is the love of God univerſally
tendred unto all in ſuch a manifeſtation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, For the light being manifeſt
from the love, it tendres it ſelfe in the
manifeſtation.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is the love received by all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom it is ſo tendred?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Nay, for many reject the light,
and will not become ſubject to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
of it, and they that doe ſo, they
doe not receive the love which in that
manifestation is tendred unto them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But is there any thing that lyes on
mans part in order to his ſalvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, he is to obey the light and
follow it, and then the light will teach
him to deny himselfe, and to take up the
daily Croſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:43721:21"/>
Q.<hi> And doth the light work in order
to ſalvation if man obey it and follow it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for he that obeyes the light
and followes it, he doth not abide in
darkneſs, but comes to the light of life.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Hath man power in himſelfe to turn
to the light, and to obey it, and follow it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Nay, of himſelfe he can doe nothing
that is good, nor turn from any thing
that is evil, but if he ſtand ſtill when the
light reproves him, he there answers it in
obedience, as not joyning with that
which the light reproves him for, and so
by giving diligence to the reproofe, and
ſtanding ſtill when reproofe comes, he is
there in obedience to it, and then the
love which is tendred in that manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it casts it selfe about him, and with
its strength it separates him from the
sin, and begets a dislike in him unto it,
so that he begins to abhor the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of it, and then in the ſtrength of
the love, he turns from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
unto the power of God, where the
light becomes his leader and teacher, in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43721:21"/>
the way of peace, ſo that Salvation is in
the light alone, and not by any thing
which is done by man of himſelfe, yet
the light requires man to yeild himſelfe
unto it, and yeilding himselfe unto it, he
answers the requirings of it in obedience,
and so becomes a ſervant to the light in
all things.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What doth the light work when
man ſo yeilds himſelfe to ſerve it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It then rises in power, and is felt to
be powerfull to the pulling down the
ſtrong hold of ſin, and unthroaning the
powers of darkness, whereby the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
corrupted nature comes to be
crucified, and fleshly lusts condemned,
and so the burdens, weights and loads
are removed, under which man hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
and groaned.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But is the light ſufficient to ſave
man from all ſin, and to preſent him holy
and blameleſs before God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, it is so, and they that love it
knowes it to be so, for the light is Christ
and all power in heaven and earth is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43721:22"/>
unto him, and there is nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
with him, nor too hard for him,
if man doe not reject him and rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth the power in its riſing
work contrary to mans own will, wiſdome,
and reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for the power is the Croſs
unto the will, wiſdome and reason of
man, and in all things worketh as a cross
unto that nature, and ſtops it, and
chaines it, and yoaks it down when it
would be at liberty.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is that work of the power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Salvation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, if it be obeyed that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer
doe not quench it, it puts a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the precious and the vile,
and so riſes as a hammer and knocks
down the vile, and takes hold on it as a
fire and burnes it up, and ſo man comes
into the furnace where God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
fire.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But can any abide the day of his
comming in ſuch a diſpenſation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:43721:22"/>
A. Yes, ſome there be that doe abide
it, who loves not their lives unto death,
but truſts in the Lord though he kills
them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is Salvation wrought through
ſuch a diſpenſation of Christ?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for he is terrible whilest the
wicked stand in his sight, and reveales
himselfe in flaming fire to execute ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon the rebellious nature, for
his appearance unto Salvation is in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against all, and upon all, that would
not that he ſhould reigne.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth Chriſt worke this worke
in man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for ſin is within man, and
there must Christ work to purge his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
if ever he be made clean.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But doe none know Christ to be
Salvation, but ſuch as feeles his work
within them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. No, for it is to be underſtood
that whilest man remaines in the fall, he
is under the power of darkneſs, and
therefore the power of Christ must work
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43721:23"/>
within him to subdue the power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that ruleth over him, and to ſave
him from the temptations that the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
entangles him in, and ſo man is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to stand in the pure fear of God,
and to waite for the appearance of his
power, to deliver him out of the ſnares
in which he lyes entangled in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and then he will feele the work of
the power in him, to caſt out the ſtrong
man which hath kept the house, and the
power will keep man in the awe that he
dare not sin, for who have felt the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord for ſin, they ſtand in
the pure fear, leaſt at any time their
feet ſhould ſlip into ſin, and this is true
love to God, when ſin is denyed, with
which his Spirit is greived.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth the power work effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Salvation as man yeilds himſelfe
unto it, and denyes that which it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
him for?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, it works effectually unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
by destroying death, and him
that hath the power of it, which is the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:43721:23"/>
Devil, and so by the work of the power,
the old man is crucified, &amp; the old works,
words, and thoughts, they all dye, and
ſin is condemned in the fleſh, and the
fleſh is brought into subjection and ſilence
through death; and this man must know
wrought in him by the power of God, if
ever he come to eternal life, for no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
thing that must enter into the
Kingdome of God, and therefore it must
be denyed and put off before the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
can be obtained.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But muſt man paſs through death
and riſe again whileſt he is in the
body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, For except he be regenerated
and born again, he cannot enter into the
kingdome of God; and therefore he must
dye to the first <hi>Adams</hi> flesh, and be
quickened and raised again in the second
<hi>Adams</hi> spirit, and so in the resurrection
and life enter the Kingdome as a little
child.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth the work of the power
bring death upon the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> through
out?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:43721:24"/>
A. Yes, for no part or propertie of the
first <hi>Adam</hi> that must live before God,
and as the second <hi>Adam</hi> rises in power,
the first <hi>Adam</hi> is put to death; and so
the quickning spirit of the second <hi>Adam</hi>
goes over the ſinful fleſh of the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
and there is the reſurrection of the
ſeed, and the tranſlation of man into its
nature, where he receives a new body,
and a new life, in which body and life
he bears the image of the heavenly, and
then he is blameless in Body, Soul, and
Spirit.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is that the way by which man
must come to inherit life eternal?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for life eternal is only in the
Son, and man in his own life is alienated
from it, and therefore he must dye to
his own life, before he can inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life in the Son.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is there none that pleaſes God
but who are thus regenerated and born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. None in the flesh can please God,
and therefore man is to wait in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43721:24"/>
for a new birth, which is not after the
fleſh, but after the ſpirit, which birth
of the ſpirit is the Fathers beloved Son,
in whom he is well pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How doth the power diſpoſe man in
the death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. It disposes him in stilness, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all fleſhly motions in ſilence, so as a
little child he lyes nakedly and innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before God, and hath no will, nor
wisdom, nor reason left in him, but all
baptized down into the sufferings of
Chriſt, where they are diſſolved into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs,
and there the power kils him
and gives him life again; and ſo man
layes down his own life, and takes up
life in Chriſt, in which life he comes to
be raiſed in the reſurrection of Christ;
and here is the paſſing from death to
life, where man puts on Christ, and is
made a new creature, and in a new life
he then ſerves God, and pleaſeth God,
for his thoughts, words, and works are
all changed, and with a new tongue he
then ſings the new ſongs, and gives glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43721:25"/>
and honour and praise, and thanks
unto him that ſits upon the throne, who
lives for ever, and ever, and this is in
ſubſtance the whole matter.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But doth not the birth of the ſeed
meet with much oppoſition in its reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, whileſt it is in the travaile it
is ſtrongly oppoſed by a contrary nature,
and many dangers that lyes near on every
hand, untill death have paſſed upon all,
as is ſaid before, but when the power
hath crucified the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and that the ſeed be raised into the
glorious liberty of its own life, then the
ſeed reigneth, and hath dominion and
government over all oppositions, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
in victory.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But how is oppoſitions removed,
and dangers eſcaped in the travaile?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. By Faith in the power, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be kept cloſe to the leadings of it,
and so the power will remove oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and defend from dangers, for the
watch being kept to it, and the Faith
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43721:25"/>
ſtanding ſtedfast in it, the enemy hath
no power to prevaile though he may
tempt, for the living power is as
a wall on the right hand and on the left,
to preſerve from dangers, and it goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as a conquerour to remove oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and comes behinde as a ſafe guard
to keep off the Enemy, for ſmiting the
hind moſt part of the Campe, and thus
Chriſt by his power is all in all every
way to the travailing Babe, that cannot
rest in any place below the freedome of
his own life, and therefore let none enter
into unbeliefe, as if oppoſitions could
never be removed, nor dangers clearly
eſcaped, for he that quickeneth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
life to breath after him, he is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in his power, and he doth aſſuredly
save to the utmost the birth of his own
begetting, which abides in the ſimple
tender breathings to poſſeſs more of his
life.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But may there not be captivity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the power be received, and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be quickened by the power to breath
after God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:43721:26"/>
A. That preſent ſtate is captivity, for
that which by the power is quickened
to breath after God, it is then in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and breathes in the power to be
delivered out of captivity, and as the
power is received, and Faith kept in it,
the power works in order to deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But may there not be captivity after
there be deliverance in ſome meaſure
wrought by the power?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, there may be ſo, for if the
minde erre from the power, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
enter, there may be captivity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in thoſe very places out of which
the power hath wrought deliverance,
and so many may come to taste of the
good word of God, and the powers of
the world to come, and yet may goe
back again, and here captivity comes
upon many who have had a long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile
out of Egypt, and have ſeen great
and wonderfull things wrought by the
power.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But is not the power ſufficient to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43721:26"/>
preſerve from going a ſtray, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again into ſuch a ſtate, as to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
captivity after it have wrought deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The power is as ſufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
as to deliver, and is not at al weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the one then in the other, but where
ſuch a ſtate comes to paſs, there is not
Faithfulneſs to the power, but tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
enters and prevailes, and ſo the
minde goes from the power into the
temptations, whereby there is away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
for the darkneſs to riſe again,
which in the day of tenderneſs and
faithfulneſs to the power, was kept in
ſubjection under the yoak.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth the power follow after
ſuch again, after they erre from it, and
doe not abide faithfull in it, to recover
them and deliver them out of their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for the Lord waites to be
gracious, and though there may be a
backsliding, yet he doth not ſhut up his
compaſſion, but condiſcends in bowels of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43721:27"/>
tenderneſs to follow the wandering
ſheep which is gone a ſtray, and by the
word of his power he calls to return and
if there be a yeilding to the word of
power, and a joyning to it again, the
Lord heales the backslidings, and loves as
freely as ever he did, and ſo he brings
the erring ſheep again into the Fold,
and gives it paſture amongſt his Flock,
and here he ſhews his goodneſs in the
Riches of his mercy.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth the power preſerve and
keep all ſafe in their travaile that abide
in it Faithfully?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for they that abide in the
power, and are guided by the power,
they doe not erre, but by the power are
kept through faith unto Salvation, and
all the babes that live in the power,
they receive ſtrength in the power, and
doe not faint.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What are the dangers that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
whilest the ſeed is in travaile?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. There be very many which the
light diſcovers diſtinctly, yet I ſhall
name a few of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:43721:27"/>
1. To glory in the fleſh, with that
which is manifeſt from God in the day
of tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>2. To gather the manifeſtation of
truth into the wiſdome below, and to
enrich the falſe birth.</p>
            <p>3. To center in the forme or practice
of truth, as it ſtands in appearance one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>4. To lye down at eaſe after some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of truth be received.</p>
            <p>5. To live upon the knowledge of
what is ſeen a far off.</p>
            <p>6. To enter into unbeleife in time of
tryal and afflictions.</p>
            <p>7. To run out of the preſent meaſure
of truth, and to hunt after the knowledg
of it through the comprehension.</p>
            <p>8. To feed upon any thing that flowes
not from the immediate openings, and
ſpringings of the life.</p>
            <p>9. To draw any concluſion of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to lye down in it as in a place of
reſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe with many more, which with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43721:28"/>
the light may be ſeen, are all great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
in the travaile, and temptations lyes
very near in them, which being joyned
unto, bring the ſeed into captivity, after
there may be deliverance out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How may ſuch dangers be eſcaped,
and a ſafe way walked in, through the
travaile?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. By keeping in the everlaſting po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and living by Faith in it, for the
power is the croſs unto mans own will,
and ſtops <hi>Nimrods</hi> hunting nature, and
chains under al the unruly affections, and
ſo the minde abiding in the power, all
dangers are eſcaped, and the innocent
babe is safely preſerved out of the hands
of all its enemies.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What are the places particularly
where the power becomes ſuch a defence
as to preſerve the birth ſafe in its tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. The loweneſs and humbleneſs
of minde.</p>
            <p>2. The poverty and nakedneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:43721:28"/>
3. The nothingneſs and emptineſs.</p>
            <p>4. The ſimplicity and innocency.</p>
            <p>5. The integrity and ſincerity.</p>
            <p>6 The faith and patience.</p>
            <p>7. The meaſure of the power recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Theſe places with many more, which
with the light may be underſtood, are
places where the power over ſhaddowes
the birth, and is a ſure defence unto it,
whereby it is preſerved out of all dangers
whileſt it is in the travaile.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But when there is a cleare ſight
through ſome opening of the life, may there
not ſafely be a reaching to it, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
of it into poſſeſſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Oh no, take heed in that place,
for if there be a reaching forth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
that which may clearly be ſeen
through ſome opening of the life, that
which openeth will preſently shut up by
darwing it ſelfe into its own perfect na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and fullneſs, and then the enemy
suddenly preſenteth a tranſformed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in the likeneſs of that which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43721:29"/>
was truly opened, and the reaching part
being at liberty, it catches at the enemies
preſentation as if it was the ſame thing
which was ſeen in the openings of the
life, and so laies hold upon it with an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
desire and compaſſeth the falſe
likeneſs into poſſeſſion, but miſſes of the
true ſubſtance, for when there is ſuch a
pure opening in the life, and that there
be a clear ſight, that it is the ſpring or
fountain which the innocent thirſteth
after, then there is to be a ſilence in the
fear, that ſo, that which openeth may
compaſs that which thirſteth, and bring
it into a larger poſſeſſion of its own ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſo it is the life which openeth,
which must gather and compaſs that
which thirſteth into its own opening,
and that is a true and everlaſting poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of endleſs riches, which none can
compaſs to themſelves, though there may
be a clear ſight in ſome openings, for the
life is jealous of its own glory, and will
not give it to another, and so ſhuts up it
ſelfe again when there is a reaching to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43721:29"/>
compass it through any opening.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But doth not ſome ſtreams flow to
the thirſty in ſuch an opening of the life,
by which it is refreſhed and comforted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. If there be ſilence in the fear, the
thirſty receives conſolation and ſatiſfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
through that which is meaſured
forth from the fulneſs in the opening,
and ſo the ſtreams of virtue doth reach
unto it; and there is not to be a reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth to compaſs the fountain, &amp; here
ſtrength is renewed through the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the mercy.</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Is not that which is taſted and felt
to conſolation and refreſhing at one time,
good for the ſame uſe and ſervice at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. As it comes freſh from the fpring,
and ſo the ſame it is; but if the ſame as
it hath been once taſted and felt, then it
is not, for the babe muſt have the breſt
and the freſh milk from it again for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
and refreſhing, when ever it
ſtands in need, for that which once hath
been taſted, and felt, and digeſted, is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43721:30"/>
never good for nouriſhment any more,
and therefore the babe is ever to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the fountain of its natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
and in ſilence and fear waiting,
all things good for food will be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it from time to time, according to its
need, and so the new birth lives by new
food, which is never corrupted, but in
the fountain is preſerved ſweet and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury,
the feeling of which as it is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
in the freſh openings of the life,
is pure consolation and refreſhing.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is reſt and peace attained in
the conſolation and refreſhing through ſuch
a miniſtration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, the babe hath reſt and peace
in it, for being conſolated and refreſhed
through the miniſtration, it lyes down
in reſt and peace, and ſo through nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
and reſt, it grows up into a
more perfect ſtature of the meaſure of
Chriſts fulneſs, and becomes ſtrong in the
Lord.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How is the birth diſposed when it
comes into ſuch a ſtature of the meaſure
of Chriſts fulneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:43721:30"/>
A. It is disposed in love, mercy, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs,
meekneſs, peace, justice, equity,
uprightneſs, sincerity, innocency, and
ſimplicity, in which it bears the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Image of Christ in his own perfect na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in his heavenly wiſdom is in
all things disposed towards God and
Men.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth the pure Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſist
in the manifeſtation of ſuch virtues
and graces?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The pure Religion conſiſts in the
power and wiſdome of God, and ſuch
virtues and graces are manifeſt from the
pure Religion, and are the effects of it,
and ſo ſpreads abroad as natural branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of the life.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth all things become new
in man after he be ſo changed through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for when all the old is dead
and buried by the reſurrection of the
ſeed, then all things becomes new in
man, for the new birth hath new thoughts
words, and works, and a new tongue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:43721:31"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> And hath not the new birth any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with the old in any place?</p>
            <p>A. Nay, that is not poſſible, for they
are contrary one to the other in all
things, and there is no agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them in any thing.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But do thoſe things which are in
appearance manifeſt the natures of the
two ſeeds?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for as they are contrary in
nature, so they are contrary in manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth the nature of the evil
ſeed produce a manifestation according to
its nature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for every manifeſtation hath
a conception before it be manifeſted,
and the evil ſeed being in government,
it ſends forth a manifeſtation according
to its nature, and so the tree may be
known by its fruit.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What is the manifeſtations that from
the evil ſeed are produced?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. They are generally included in
thoſe things which are by people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerated
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43721:31"/>
obſerved, who are called
the world, or worldly people, and ſo the
pride of life is not of the Father, but of
the world, that is a manifeſtation of the
nature of the evil ſeed which ruleth in
the world; and so it is concerning all
other things which are observed by
people unregenerated, who are not of
the Father, but of the world.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And cannot thoſe that are born of
the ſeed of God, joyn with thoſe things
which by the world are obſerved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Nay, there is an impoſſibility lyes
there also, for they are born of another
nature, and there is no agreement in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traryes,
either in nature or manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth not the world, or the
birth of the fleſh, deſpiſe and hate the birth
born of God, becauſe it cannot anſwer
what is obſerved in that nature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, and alſo perſecutes it, and
that is the ground of all envy, ſtrife, and
perſecution outward, becauſe the birth
born of God, delights to do the will of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43721:32"/>
God, and the will of God being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the will of man, the birth born of
the will of man, hates the birth born of
God, and perſecutes it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth the birth born of God
endure perſecution without reſisting or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for it ſuffers in the will of
God, and ſo lyes down in the patience
and quietneſs, in which it hath true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
and peace, through all things
that comes to paſs by outward tryals
and afflictions.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Then is it not the birth of the fleſh
that ſtrives and perſecutes about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for the nature of it is envy,
and where it is not bowed unto, then
it perſecutes, and ſpoyles, and deſtroys
in its envious nature, and ſo revenges it
ſelf in cruelty upon ſuch as cannot walk
in its way.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth not God wonderfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with his own birth in a state of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
tryals and ſufferings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43721:32"/>
A. Yes, more wonderfully then can
be expreſſed in words.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How doth he appear with it in ſuch
a ſtate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. In his endless, love, mercy, and
goodness, through which his bowels of
compassion breaketh in tenderness unto
his afflicted children, whereby they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſtrength in him to ſtand in every
tryal that comes upon them for their
faithfulneſs unto him.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And do all born of God put their
trust in him alone?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for they have not another to
truſt in beſides him, therefore they
wholly caſt their care upon him in all
conditions, and he forſakes them not
in their adverſity, but strengthens their
faith, and keeps them in patience to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
unto the end.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And what doth outward afflictions
work for ſuch as are exerciſed in them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. They work for much good every
way, for thereby man comes to see his
own nothingneſs and emptyneſs, and is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43721:33"/>
brought into humbleneſs of minde to
wait upon God, for the renewing of
his ſtrength in the preſent exerciſe, that
he may not be weary nor faint in it.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Then is it not good to be exerciſed
in outward afflictions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Man is not to make choice of any
thing, but to stand in the will of God;
and if for the exerciſe of his Conſcience
towards God, afflictions do betide him,
then he will feel it work for much good;
but the choice of it in his own will doth
not bring any comfort.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Is there any chuſes outward ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
in their own will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. There may that come to paſſe
through the will as may cauſe outward
sufferings, but it cannot be truly ſaid that
the will chuſes the ſufferings, but may
act or practice ſuch things as may cauſe
outward ſufferings to be inflicted.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> How may it be known when a man
ſuffers in the will of God, and when he
ſuffers for any thing done in his owne
will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:43721:33"/>
A. It may be known by the motion of
Gods power in him, for by the power
the underſtanding is informed into the
truth, as also, what is not of the truth,
and ſo the power conſtraines a man that
is joyned unto it, to bear witneſſ unto
the truth, and againſt that which is out
of the truth; and whoever comes into
outward ſufferings for rhe exerciſe of
their Conſcience, in this teſtimony they
ſuffer in the will of God, but ſuch as
barely from the Scriptures concludes
something to themſelves, either to be
truth, or not the truth, and so puts their
own concluſions into practice, and then
for their own concluſions comes to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
it cannot be truly ſaid of ſuch, That
they ſuffer in the will of God, or that
they chuſe ſufferings in their own wills,
but in their wills have concluded ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to themſelves, and have choſen
their own concluſions, which in practice
differs from the practice eſtabliſhed by
Nations Laws, for which cauſe there
are ſome that comes into outward ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43721:34"/>
but more in that place which
chuſes liberty rather.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But may not a man in wiſdome ſo
order himſelf as to eſcape all outward
ſufferings, concerning the exerciſe of his
Conſcience, by conforming to the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the preſent times, and yet keep
a good conſcience towards God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Man in his own wiſdom may ſo
order himſelf, as to eſcape all outward
ſufferings in that place by conforming,
but this is to be underſtood, that ſuch a
man doth not ſtand in the will of God,
neither in so doing can he stand with a
good Conſcience towards God; for, he
that conforms to any practice which
man obſerveth, being convinced that
ſuch a practice is not according to the
mind and will of God, and ſo would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
outward ſufferings by conforming,
and doth not stand in the power of God,
to bear a teſtimony for God, that man
is not born of the ſeed of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> In what doth the teſtimony of God
ſtand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:43721:34"/>
A. It ſtands in the ſeed, which hath
the mind of God, and delights to do the
will of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And do all, born of the ſeed, bear
forth a teſtimony for God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, they have a teſtimony in the
ſeed, and ſuch ſtands in the power, and
bears witneſs unto the truth, and are not
aſhamed of their teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> What do ſuch bear teſtimony unto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. To the truth as it is in Jeſus, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>A. They teſtifie against all deceit and
wickedneſs, vain cuſtoms, faſhions, and
traditions of the world, againſt all hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie
and double-mindedneſs, will-worſhips
and ſelf-righteousneſs, with all
things generally that is manifeſted by the
birth of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And is that the ground why out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
afflictions betide thoſe that are born
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:43721:35"/>
of the ſeed of God, and bears forth a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
for God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, for the ſeed of the evil doer
being at enmity againſt the ſeed of God,
it labours every way to suppreſs the
teſtimony of it, and so the birth of the
fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh hath alwayes perſecuted the birth
of the ſpirit; and this is to be obſerved,
that where there is no teſtimony, there
is no perſecution; for if the birth of the
fleſh can be anſwered in its way, and not
teſtified against, it will not perſecute,
becauſe it is anſwered by its own nature,
and it is againſt its nature to perſecute
its ſelf, and ſo it is, that the world loves
its own, and hates ſuch as are not of it,
and perſecutes them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> And doth not God anſwer all ſuch as
are faithful in their teſtimony with peace
and joy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes, he is their ſtrength and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great reward, and they have much
peace in him, and fulneſs of joy in his
preſence.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> Why do not ſuch as are born of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43721:35"/>
ſeed of God, revenge themſelves upon their
adverſaries when they may have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Because revenge is contrary to
their nature, for they are born of the
peaceable nature of Chriſt, in which
they love their enemies, and bears good
will to all men, and ſo they lye down
in the will of God, and gives their back
to the ſmiters, and cannot resist nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
but are ready to do good to those
that hates them and perſecutes them
not rendring evil for evil, but overcoms
the evil with good; and herein it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that they are born of God, and
knoweth God, and so commits their
cauſe unto him, as unto a faithful crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi> But are not ſuch people in great
bondage through outward ſufferings and
afflictions, and is not their ſuffering
grievous unto them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. As to their bodies they are in much
bondage and ſufferings, but they have
inward liberty in God, and are the freeſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43721:36"/>
of all people, and they count their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
afflictions but light, in compariſon
of their inward joy and glory, for they
are the living babes out of whoſe mouths
God perfects his praise, and this is the
change wrought in man by the mighty
power of God, in which power the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
kingdome is known, and the
riches of it inherited, in which the babes
ſits down rejoycing in the midſt of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
tribulations, and they learn the
new ſongs, and ſings them with new
tongues, with which they magnifie the
Lamb that lives for ever and ever: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſo, <hi>Amen.</hi> Glory be to the moſt

               <p>
                  <hi>A.ſw.</hi> Our ground and foundation is
Jesus Christ, who is the only begotten
of the Father, and God hath layed it
for us, and not we to our ſelves; and
it is a sure foundation in it ſelf, and alſo
ſure unto us, as being layd of God for
us, and this is the foundation and princi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
of our Religion.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> Where do you hold forth this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
to be laid, which you ſay is laid
God for you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is laid of God within us, and
the rock of our ſafety, and ſo we hold
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43721:37"/>
forth to be a sure foundation, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſtrength and power of it, which
defends it ſelf that the gates of Hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
prevail againſt it, nor againſt us that
ſtand stedfaſt upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> How do you manifeſt this inward
foundation, which you ſay is Christ, to be
the true and only foundation which God
hath laid?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. From the feeling that we have of
it, by which we know that it is ſure in
us, and from that ſure and certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which we have of it in the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we manifeſt it from its own nature

it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It is unchangeable, in light, life,
power, wiſdom, and glory, full of all
goodneſs, virtue and mercy, and in its
nature and being is unmoveable.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> How do you manifeſt it to be the

A. From the unchangeableness of its
own nature and being, for wee know
that God doth not lay any viſible or
changable things for a foundation, but
that which is of himſelfe within, and is
invinſible to the natural eye, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable
in its own nature, that is the
foundation which God layeth, and wee
know no man can lay another.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And is that which is within you
the only foundation upon which you ſtand,
and the principle of your Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. That of God within us is ſo, for
we know it is Chriſt, and being Chriſt,
it muſt needs be onely, and principal,
for that which is onely, admits not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and that which is principal is
greateſt in being, and thus we know
Chriſt in us, to be unto us the onely and
principal, who was before all things, and
in whom all things conſiſt.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But doe you hold that this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and principle within you is ſufficient
to give eternal life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, we doe ſo, for as we know
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:43721:38"/>
that it is Chriſt in us, so we also know
the eternal life which is in him, and that
he is ſufficient to give eternal life from
his own fulneſs, unto as many as receives
him, in the gift of his grace manifeſt
within them.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> How came you to the knowledge of
that foundation and principle, which you
ſay is within you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By the light which is manifeſt
from it, that in our hearts gives us the
light of the knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> How doe you know that it is a true
light which gives you ſuch a knowledg?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By the operation and effects of it.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> How doth it operate unto ſuch a
knowledge?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By the ſtrength of its power in us,
whereby that knowledge which was
gained through comprehending comes
to decay and dye, and a loſs comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all that which hath any way been
fetched in by the motion of the earthly
wiſdome.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And doth it effect ſuch a thing in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43721:38"/>
you by its operation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, it worketh effectually in us, to
the crucifying of that nature which hath
rebelled againſt God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> Doth it operate unto ſuch effects in
you without Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Nay, for it is the foundation and
principle of our faith, and as our Faith
ſtands in it, we know the operation and
effects of it by our Fath, and in this Faith
we pleaſe God, becauſe we believe that
by his power in us, he is able to ſubdue
all things to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> How come you to receive this
Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By yeilding our ſelves to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation
of the light, whereby we
come to be drawn and gathered into the
nature of it, and so receives Faith in it as
the gift of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But have you not ſome Faith in it
before you yeild your ſelves unto it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. We have a perſwaſion wrought in
us, that it is of God, and so yeilds our
ſelves unto it as being perſwaded that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43721:39"/>
it is truth, and by yeilding our selves unto
it, and receiving of it in its manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we thereby come into union with it,
and knowes it to be the author and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher
of our Faith.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And doth that Faith give you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of eternal life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, it doth ſo, for Chriſt is the
author of it, whereby we are aſſured of
his love towards us, and in the Faith
that we have in him, we are sure that he
is Christ the ſon of the living God, and
by this Faith wee live in the aſſurance
of eternal life.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But how may your Faith be knowne
unto others to be true Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By the fruits and effects that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
from it, through which it may be
known unto others to be true Faith.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> What are thoſe fruits and effects by
which your Faith may ſo be known?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Love, Mercy, Meekneſs, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Peace, Long-suffering, Patience,
Righteousneſs, and Holineſs of life,
which is the fruit of our Faith, by which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43721:39"/>
others may know that it is true Faith.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But how doe you believe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By the Faith that we have in
Chriſt Jeſus, our foundation and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
through which we know that he is
ſalvation unto us, and doe believe that
there is not another name given under
heaven by which any can be ſaved, but
the name of Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But is there no true Faith but what
ſtands in a principle within?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. There is but one true Faith, and
that ſtands in a principle within, which
is Chriſt, and the myſtery of it is held in
a pure conſcience, and this is a living
Faith, in a living principle, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Faiths are dead.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And can none have true Faith unto
Salvation and life eternal, but ſuch as are
of your opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Wee are not in any opinion, but in
the principle of life, by which we are
ſaved, and receives life; and in this ſtate
wee ſtand not in any opinion, but in a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:43721:40"/>
feeling of life and Salvation, for all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are in notions and apprehenſions,
in which none feeles the life and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Chriſt, but what they apprehend
in the natural part, unto that they give
up their own beliefe, and ſo erres from
the life in themſelves, and neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leives
unto Salvation, nor receives life
eternal.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But do you judge all to be in the
unbeliefe, that are not juſt as you are in all
things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Nay, wee doe not so, for we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that in every Nation, he that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God and worketh righteouſneſs is
accepted of him, and wee alſo believe
that none can fear God and work righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
to be accepted of him, but as
they are in some meaſure guided by the
principle of his light in their conſcience,
and have some Faith in it towards God,
and we believe that many in ſome ſmall
meaſure doe thus fear God, and work
righteouſneſs, though they doe not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the principle, by which they are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43721:40"/>
drawn to doe it, and ſuch we doe not
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udge to be in the unbeliefe, but have
unity with them in that meaſure of Faith
in which they ſimply breath after God,
and according to their underſtanding
walkes in his fear, and ſerves him in
righteousneſs; and though ſuch be not
juſt as we are in all things, yet being in
any meaſure guided by our principle to
fear God and work righteouſneſs, wee
truly love them, and have tenderneſs
towards them, that in the principle they
may grow in Faith, and be as we are in
all things.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And doe you ſimply act from your
Faith, in ſingle love to God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, wee doe so, for we know that
our Faith proceeds from his love unto
us, and that is the overcomming power,
by which we are conſtrained to love
him, for he hath begotten us; and
quickened us in his life, in which our
Faith is kept freſh and living unto him:
and by the ſame we act in ſimplicity and
fervent love towards him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:43721:41"/>
Q.<hi> What is your Faith concerning
Chriſt in you as a mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Wee believe that Chriſt in us,
doth offer up himſelfe a living ſacrifice
unto God for us, by which, the wrath
and justice of God is appeaſed towards
us, and that through the offering end ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Chriſt for us, the hand writing
of ordinances which stood against us is
blotted out, and a mediation wrought
between God and us; and ſo we know
the conſideration of Chriſt unto us, and
his mediation with the Father for us, and
this is he in whom our Faith standeth as
the one mediator between God and
man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> What is your Faith concerning
Chriſt in you, as an interceſſor?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Wee believe that Chriſt in us doth
interceed the Father in our behalfe, and
by him we doe appeale to God in all
our distreſſes, and we believe that all
our breathings toward God have acceſs
unto him through the interceſſion of
Chriſt for us, for as he knows what we
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43721:41"/>
want, so he alſo knows the Fathers will,
and according to our want and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will he makes interceſſion, through
whose interceſſion all our breathings are
accepted of God, and not onely ſo, but
we have also boldneſs to draw nigh unto
God, and by Chriſt, our interceſſour we
have acceſs to the throne of grace, and
findes grace to helpe us in the time of
our need, so that we are relieved in our
diſtreſſess and afflictions through Christ
that loves us, who by his mediation and
interceſſion prevails with the Father for
us.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> What is your Faith concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
whith God by Chriſt in
you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Wee believe, through the offering
and ſacrifice of Chriſt for us, that God
is ſatisfied concerning our ſins, which in
our alienation was committed againſt
him by us, for as then Christ bare our
ſins for us, ſo now by the offering up
himselfe unto God on our behalfe, our
ſins are blotted out and done away, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43721:42"/>
we through him are reconciled unto
God, and having reconciled us, he is
eaſed of the ſins which he bare for us in
our alienated ſtate, and ſo he hath ſlaine
the emnity which was the wall of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between God and us, whereby we
that ſometimes were ſtrangers unto God,
and enemies in our own mindes by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
works, are now reconciled unto him
in Christ, so that we are no more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
and ſtrangers in the emnity, but
through the reconciling power of Christ
in us we are brought nigh unto God,
and in his Covenant of life and peace,
we know his pardoning mercy in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of our sins.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But doe you now believe that you
are now come to ſuch a ſtate as to be free
from ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Wee believe that Jeſus Chriſt the
righteous doth make us free from ſin, for
in him there is no ſin, and we being made
free by him, we are free indeed; so that
we now live by the Faith that is in him,
and by our Faith in him we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43721:42"/>
victory over the world, the fleſh
and the devil, and in the victory we are
freed and walkes with Chriſt in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But doe you believe that you are ſo
freed from ſin as not to commit ſin whileſt
you remaine in the body, or that there can
be ſuch a perfect ſtate attained in this
life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Wee believe that with God all
things are poſſible, and we alſo believe
that whoſoever are born of God doth
not commit ſin, but is perfect as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father is perfect, whose children
they are; and we believe that ſuch a
ſtate is attainable in this life, whileſt in
the body.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But is it ſo with you at all times as
that ſin hath no power over you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. There is a ſtate whileſt the birth
is in travaile, as that temptations may at
ſometimes prevaile; for in that ſtate
the birth is not come into full ſtrength
through the growth of Faith, and ſo
may sin through weakneſs, but where it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43721:43"/>
is ſo, there is a cry goes unto God to be
delivered, and though there may be
ſuch an over comming in weakneſs as
that ſin may have ſome power, yet that
which cryes to God in the ſence of sin,
it hath an advocate with the Father, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Jesus Chriſt the righteous, and he is
the propitiation by whom the attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is made, and through whom the
ſin is pardoned and remitted, and ſo the
birth grows ſtronger in the Faith, and
goes on from one degree to another,
until it be made perfect in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But doe you believe that ſuch of you
as are grown into ſuch strength as to have
victory over the world the fleſh and the
devil, are not lyable to temptations, and
that the motions of the fleſh doe not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
move and ſtir in you to commit
ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, we finde that daily, but we
conquer over them through him that
loves us, so that when temptations are
proffered, we resist them in the power of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43721:43"/>
Chriſt, and when the motions of the fleſh
doe move or stir unto ſin, we ſubdue
them and keep them under, and by our
Faith in Chriſt we have victory over
them, and though ſuch temptations and
motions may be stirring as alive in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
yet unto us they are all dead, and
we are dead unto them; and though
they may tempt us, yet they prevaile
not, for by Chriſt we are preſerved in
the hour of temptation, and the wicked
one toucheth us not, and thus we are
kept by the mighty power of God,
through Faith unto Salvation, and
knows Chriſt in us to reigne over ſin,
which ſometimes hath reigned over us,
and in the dominion of his life we are
conquerors in victory, and so our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is in Chriſt in whom there is no
ſin, and we know that he is the finiſher
of ſin, and the bringer in of everlasting
righteouſneſs unto us, and in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and holy life, we live to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Father.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But if all theſe things be done for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43721:44"/>
you by Chriſt within you, then what doe
you believe concerning that great worke
which by the death of Chriſt was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
on the Croſs in time paſt according
to the Scriptures, or doth not this your
Faith concerning ſuch things done for you
by Chriſt in you, make voide his death
upon the Croſs, and the benefits which is
to be received thereby?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Wee believe that all things which
are ſpoken by the holy Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
concerning Christ, are true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scriptures: &amp; we believe
that all the dispenſations of God which
are manifested by the Scriptures are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
true, and that they were all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
according to the determinate will
and councell of God, so that our Faith
concerning Chriſt in us, and the work
which he there worketh for us, doth not
at all make voide any of the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God, which in times paſt was
revealed unto his holy Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and by them teſtified in the
Scriptures; so that the work which the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43721:44"/>
Father then gave unto the Son to doe:
we believe that he fulfilled and finiſhed
according to the Fathers will, and that
all things partaining to life and ſalvation
was fully and perfectly in him, and that
he humbled himſelfe to the death of the
Croſs; and from death did riſe againe:
and we believe that he is the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and the life, and gives eternal life to
all that believe in him, but that any doe
believe in him as he is Christ, who are
diſpiſers of his light and life in them,
that is not our Faith, for as we know
him in us, and ſo have our Faith in him;
we likewise know the dispensation of
God in times past, and the end of their
manifeſtation, and the time of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
and the Scriptures are fulfilled
in us who live in the Faith of Christ, and
walkes in his Spirit: and we alſo know
and believe, that he is the ſame Chriſt in
us, which in dispensations paſt did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himſelfe to the Croſs, and doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
his work in us according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
councell and will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43721:45"/>
so that our Faith concerning Chriſt
in us, doth not at all make voide what
he hath done or wrought in times paſt,
but doth fully &amp; perfectly eſtabliſh it as a
true diſpenſation, &amp; by our Faith in Chriſt
we know in a good underſtanding, the
things that are paſt, preſent, and to
come, and that Chriſt is yeſterday, to
day, and the ſame for ever, and of his
life, nature, and being there is neither
variableneſs nor changing, but an endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſubſtance of immortality, who is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with the Father in the ſame glory
that he had with him before the world
began, who through every diſpenſation
hath manifeſted his glory, and in this
diſpenſation of his light and life he is
come unto us, and we know him to be
the firſt and the laſt, the beginning and
the ending, for him hath God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſealed, and in him our Faith ſtands
ſtedfaſt.</p>
               <p>A. <hi>And have you ſuch faith in God,
and love unto him, as that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
unto all his commands, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43721:45"/>
him in all things according to his
will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, our faith is ſuch in him, and
our love unto him, as that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
unto all his commands; for as he
hath loved us and given Christ for us,
even ſo is our love begotten unto him,
and in his love unto us, which is the
ground of our love unto him, we in the
same are made willing to run the way of
all his commands, according to his will
and they are not grievous unto us.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But whether, do you not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the things you do for life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, we do not so, for we have life
before we have motion to act or do any thing
that is pleaſing unto God, and in
the life we have ſalvation, and so life
and ſalvation is freely given us of God
and by his grace we are ſaved, through
our faith which we have in him, and that
puts us upon motion and action to do
his will in all things, and yet not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon what we do for life, but to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43721:46"/>
anſwer his will in all faithfulneſs, becauſe
he hath given us life; and ſo we do not
act or do any thing for life, but do all
things which he commands us from the
motion of his life, and this is life before
action, which moves us to action, and
not action before life, thereby to attain
life; and so we are his workmanship cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works,
which God hath before ordained that
we ſhould walk in them, and this is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of God to be the fruit of our
life and faith, and in these good works
we walk to his glory, and depends upon
him alone for the renewing of our
ſtrength to continue in them unto the
end.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But how do you manifeſt your good
works which you ſay are ordained of God
for you to walk in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By our faith we manifeſt them, and
the manifeſtation doth clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
the nature and root to be of God,
in which they are created, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and root in which they are created
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43721:46"/>
being of God, they must needs be good,
and ſo they are good works as being of
God, and of God ordained that we
ſhould walk in them, and that of God
in every conſcience bears witneſs to the
ſame, ſo that we know all our works to
be wrought by him in us and for us, and
we do walk in them who are born of
him, and he alone hath the glory, though
the natural man perceiveth not from
whence they are, nor whither they
goe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And is it your faith and love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God that makes you ſuch a willing
people to ſerve God, and to do his will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, it is ſo, for the day of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
hath overcome us, and therein he hath
begotten us unto a lively hope by the
reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead,
and in him our faith and love is encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſtrengthened to run without
wearineſs, for in his life we have moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and action, whereby we are willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disposed to ſerve him, and to do his
will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:43721:47"/>
Q. <hi> But how do you know all theſe things
you act and do, are the commands of God,
and according to his will?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. By the word of his power in us,
through which we are made ſenſible of
all his commands unto us, for as we are
born of him, ſo we know his voice, and
by his word we are inſtructed in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and thereby put upon motion to
act and do them, and in our duty he
gives us his peace, by which we know
that all those things which we act and
do, are his commands unto us, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But are you ſo conſtrained through
your faith and love towards God, as to
anſwer him in all things that he commands
you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, for if we ſhould ſay we love
him, and do not keep his commands, we
ſhould be lyars; but we do ſo love him,
and our faith is so ſtedfast in him, as that
we are thereby constrained to keep his
commands in all things, for it is natural
unto his own birth to delight to do his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:43721:47"/>
will, and to do whatſoever he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and hereby we know that his love
is perfected in us, and our faith and love
is ſingle unto him; and as his good will
is manifeſted unto ns, even ſo is our
hearts diſpoſed in good will towards all
men.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> What good will have you to ſuch as
you judge and condemn, becauſe they are
not like-minded with you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Much every way, for that which
we judge and condemn in any, is only
that ſpirit which wrongs them, by which
our good will is manifeſted unto that
which ſuffers wrong, and this is our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to truth; and knowing
that the judgment of the Lord is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to truth, and having felt it ſo in our
ſelves, through the condemnation of ſin
in the fleſh, we judg ſin in the fleſh in
whomſoever it reigns, that ſin in the fleſh
may be condemned, and they in the
ſpirit may be justified; and herein we
manifeſt the univerſal love of God to
be ſhed abroad in our hearts, in which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43721:48"/>
our good will extendeth unto all men.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And is that the love with which you
love your enemies?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, for as God had pity upon us
in the day of our alienation from him,
and followed us with many tender viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and also many righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
even ſo we know that he would
not have a ſinner to periſh, and in this
love we labour for the good of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and it is the greateſt manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of love to an enemy when his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is not ſought, but rather a conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
to recover him out of the ſtate
of his enmity, into a ſtate of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and peace; and we know that there
is none that are enemies unto us, but they
are enemies unto God, and crucifies his
life in themselves, and therefore our
love is in pity towards them, though
they be enemies unto us, knowing that
they cannot have peace with God whilſt
in that state they remain.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And are you ſo diſpoſed towards
your enemies as that you cannot ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenge
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43721:48"/>
when they do you wrong?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, that is the disposition of our
nature, not to ſeek revenge, though we
do ſuffer wrong; for the revenging na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is in the fall, in which people are
enemies unto God, and one to another;
but it is not ſo with us whom God hath
redeemed, for though we may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
enemies, yet we are not enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any, though in the power of God by
which we are redeemed, we do bear te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
againſt the evil and the ſin, and
that ſpirit in us doth not ſeek after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
but in all long-ſuffering and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
we bear the enmity of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and waits to ſee their converſion
out of the enmity, whereby our good
will is manifeſted in love to their
ſouls.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But are you not the cauſe of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
that comes upon you, as being
contrary minded unto all other people,
and ſo are enemies to your ſelves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Nay, the cauſe of our ſufferings
are not from our ſelves, but from that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43721:49"/>
spirit which cannot bear our teſtimony
which God hath given us, which teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
being contrary unto the actings
and workings of the spirit of darkneſs,
it provokes the minds of ſuch in whom
it ruleth to enmity againſt us, and that
is the ground why ſufferings comes upon
us, and we are clear for being enemies
unto our ſelves in it, as having our faith
and love towards God in thoſe things,
for which we ſuffer.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But why can you not be conformable
unto thoſe things which other people ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and practice outwardly, and yet
keep your Faith and love towards God
inwardly, and ſo have your Faith to your
ſelves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Becauſe we dare not deny, or own
that outwardly which God doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
to us inwardly, either to be truth,
or out of the truth, for ſo we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
our Faith and love towards him every
way; and it is not poſſible that any
ſhould keep Faith and love to God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and conforme to any practice
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43721:49"/>
outwardly which is contrary to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
principle, for as the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Spirit is dead, so Faith without
works is dead alſo, and they that have
Faith to themſelves in the power of God,
they alſo have Faith in him to ſerve him
in works of truth and righteouſneſs, and
so we ſhew our Faith by our works, for
the Spirit of Faith being lived in as the
inward principle, the body is diſpoſed
by its motions, and it doth never diſpoſe
the body to conform unto any outward
thing which is contrary to its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so that the body is not to act the
ſpirit, but the ſpirit is to act and govern
the body, and where it is ſo, both the
inward and the outward agrees in one,
and there is faith inwardly and good
works outwardly, and we have a good
evidence of the ſpirit in our ſelves that
so it is with us, whereby we are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon our foundation inwardly, and
for joyning with any practice that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to it outwardly, and here our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
are alive unto God in his ſpirit, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43721:50"/>
are acted and ordered by the power of
it according to his will, and vvhere it
is not ſo, there is not the ſence of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the body, and ſo a dead body
vvhich others may move and order in
their own vvay.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> Well, but demonstrate in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
your Non-conformity, as firſt, why
you cannot conform to the Diſcipline of the
Church of England, as it is now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
outwardly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Becauſe vve do not find that it is
eſtabliſhed upon our foundation and
principle inwardly, and therefore vve
cannot have faith in it, nor love towards
it; and if vve ſhould conform to it out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardly,
contrary to the inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of our faith, vve ſhould commit ſin,
for that which is not of faith, is ſin; and if
vve ſhould do so, vve ſhould commit a
great evil, and our faith and love unto
God vvould be loſt, and therefore it is
vvhy vve cannot conform to the vvay
and Worship now observed according
to that Discipline or order, because the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43721:50"/>
spirit of God, by which our bodyes are
alive to God, doth not ſo order and
diſpoſe us, and vve dare not order our
bodies in our own choice, for if we could
do ſo, and not ſin against God, vve ſhould
rather chuſe to conform then ſuffer, but
vve know, that if vve ſhould do so, vve
could not keep our conſciences void of
offence towards God (though we might
in ſo doing please many men) but should
come under his rebuke and correction
for transgression; and so in our single
faith and love towards God, we ſtand in
the will of God, and dare not move to
obſerve any thing outwardly, but as the
motion of his power and life disposes us
inwardly, in which vve have true peace
and ſatisfaction in our greatest tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and hereby it may be underſtood
why vve cannot conform in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And why is it that you cannot
ſwear at all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Because it is contrary to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
principle, and our principle being
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43721:51"/>
the truth it ſelf, we know that as we
are acted and diſpoſed by its motion,
that all our words, promiſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
are ſure and ſtedfaſt, for
they are firmly eſtabliſhed in our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and therefore we dare not ſwear
at all, knowing our yea is yea, and our
nay is nay, in a ſure and ſtedfaſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that changes not, and our faith and
love towards God is in our principle, and
if we ſhould ſwear at all, we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
our principle, which is Christ the
truth, vvho commands us not ſwear at
all, and our faith ſtanding in him, and
our love being towards him, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to keep his command, becauſe
we know that all his commands are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to truth, and we believe that
if we ſhould ſwear at all, vve ſhould go
into tranſgreſſion, and fall under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
and then we ſhould looſe the
anſwer of a good Conſcience, and peace
with God, which is of more value unto
us, then the highest favours in the
world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:43721:51"/>
Q. <hi> But doth your faith and love, which
you ſay is towards God, lead you wholly
into oppoſition to the ordinances of men,
who are to rule and govern Nations and
Kingdoms?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Nay, our faith and love towards
God makes us to be ſubject to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of men for the Lords ſake, and
we do not deſpiſe Government outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but do believe that actual ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ought to be given in all things that
pertain to the preſervation and well-being
of ſuch as are under the power of
it, and for this cauſe pay we Tribute,
and Cuſtome, and that not only for fear,
but for Conſcience ſake, whereby our
actual Subjection is manifeſted and our
Conſciences kept void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and men; for as we know
that our inward principle is juſt and
righteous in it ſelf, ſo vve believe that
every power in outward Government
that rules in Justice and Righteouſneſſe
between man and man, is to be owned
and ſubmitted unto, and not in any wiſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43721:52"/>
to be reſiſted or denyed; and this is
ſomething of our faith concerning this
particular, vvhereby it may appear that
vve are not vvholly in oppoſition to the
Ordinances of men, as they act in Juſtice
and Righteouſneſs for the well-being one
of another, which is the main end of all
outward Government.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But do you not believe that you
ought in all things to be actually ſubject
according to the inſtitutions of Laws which
are in being?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Nay, that is not our Faith, for
vvhere any Law concerns our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and that contrary to our inward
principle, in that caſe vve dare not be
actually ſubject; for as our principle is
the greateſt in power, and ſo it is most
worthy of our ſubjection, and our faith
and love conſtrains us ſo to do; and
vvhere any outward Law, lyes againſt
our inward principle, as to things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to our Conſciences, vve in that
caſe are paſſive, and patiently ſuffers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, and ſo vve believe and are ſure,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43721:52"/>
that the exerciſe of our Conſciences, in
matters of Worſhip and Religion, is to
ſtand ſingle unto God alone, and not to
be reſtrained or limited by any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of men.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> Why can you not give reſpect and
honour unto perſons that are in power
and Government, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
which are uſed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Becauſe it is againſt our faith to
reſpect perſons according to customes,
for we have not the faith our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Christ in reſpect of perſons; and yet
we give honour and reſpect to all men
unto vvhom it is due, but the Hat and
Knee is a beggarly honour, and not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be either given or received for
honour, being far below the honour
that comes from above, and we being
born of the Royal ſeed of God, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
give honour to any thing below it;
and all the cuſtoms that are in being,
and given, and received for honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, they are all below the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſeed, and the birth born of the ſeed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43721:53"/>
can neither give nor receive such honor:
and this is our faith in this particular,
That we are to honour God, and all
men in the Lord, but Cuſtoms and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
with the Hat and Knee, we
believe and are ſure that God doth not
require us to give reſpect or honour unto
any perſon after that manner; and by
our faith we live in our principle, and
vve know that there is no honour due
unto any man, but as he hath ſome uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the light and power of God in
himſelf, which is the principle unto
vvhich all honour belongs, and unto
ſuch we can give honour with our hearts,
though our Hats remain in their place of
ſervice, and our bodies ſtand without
moving, and this is the honour which
we do give unto vvhom it belongs, and
it is the honour from above, and not from
below.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And why is it that you are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
minded unto all other people, both
in your behaviour and language, ſeeing
there is none beſides you that behaves them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:43721:53"/>
after ſuch a manner, and you being
ſo contrary unto all people in your beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
and language, it makes you redicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in their eye, and to become a reproach
in your generation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The reason why we are contrary
minded unto all other people in ſuch
things, is this; we being come unto
Chriſt the light, life and truth, we are
come to a principle which differs from
other people, and as we are regenerated
and born again of incorruptible ſeed,
we are not of the ſame minde as other
people are, nor as we our ſelves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
have been when we lived in the
vanities of our mindes, and as our change
is wrought by the power of God, so is
the Spirit of our mindes renewed unto
God, and our behaviour and language
is from that which is pure in it ſelf, and
as is the root ſo are the branches, and in
this lyes the difference between us and
other people, which is the cause that
makes us rediculous in their eye, no
that our behaviour and language are ſo
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43721:54"/>
in themſelves; but proceeding from a
plain, simple, honest minde in us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to truth and righteousness: the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and high minded looks upon them as
rediculous because contemptible in
their eye, and ſo ſpeaks reproachfully
and ſcornfully of us, for our behaviour
and language is from another principle
then other peoples are, and if it was not
ſo, we ſhould be as much esteemed and
reſpected amongst them, as when we
were one with them in behaviour and
language, which now being made to
differ in our principle, and to appear
contrary unto them, their reproach and
ſcorn fals upon us as a rediculous people,
but we know it is better with us, now
that we endure ſuch reproaches becauſe
of our difference, then in the time when
we lived in the pleaſure of ſin, and
had reſpect and eſteem, and not reproach

               <p>Q. <hi> But is there not ſome which hold an
inward principle as you doe, and yet doe
not behave themſelves after your manner,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:43721:54"/>
but can obſerve the things that are in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
both in behaviour and language?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. There may be ſome ſuch, but
they are not upon our foundation, and
though they may hold an inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
yet they are not of us, for we
know that the birth of the flesh hath an
inward principle, and that will allow the
liberty in behaviour and language ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the cuſtomes uſed; but we
ſay that ſuch an inward principle that
doth allow ſuch an outward practice
is not of God, but of the fleſh, which
anſwers the nature and will of the flesh,
in behaviour and language, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
follow ſuch as our examples, though
they may hold an inward principle, but
are made to differ from them both in
root and branch; for we believe and
are ſure that the Son of God is come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, and hath given us an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to know him that is true, and we are
in him that is true, and being in him that
is true, we know our behaviour and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is according to truth; and so we
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43721:55"/>
know that all our works are wrought in
God, and by Faith in him we ſtand,
and unto him alone gives glory for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> But how may people come to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that it is ſo with you as you ſay,
more then with others, who may ſay as
much for themſelves in their way as you
doe in yours?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. There is no other way for any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be ſatisfied in this matter, but by
taking heed to the principle of God in
themſelves, for as we are born of God,
there is none can know us as to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
concerning us, either in principle
or practice, but as they come to the ſame
principle in which we are; for if people
will onely reason about things that differ
they may weary themſelves and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſatisfied, for we doe not onely ſay
that ſo it is with us, and so preſs it upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to believe it, barely from our say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but we press all people to a joyning
with the light and power of Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them, and if they come unto that, then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43721:55"/>
we know that we ſhall be manifeſt in
their conſciences, and be known where
we are, and ſo it is not what we or any
others may ſay in our own case, that can
give true ſatisfaction to any enquirer;
but what the witneſs of God in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſaith: for if that doe not ſeale to
what is ſaid, there is not any thing that
is ſaid, which can clearly evidence the
matter in queſtion, and if vve be not
found by the vvitneſs of God to be as
vve ſay, then let us not be believed, but
if vve be ſo, then people may be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that vve are not only ſayers, but alſo
doers; and if vve cannot be believed by
our ſayings, being others may ſay as
much as vve in their ovvn caſe, yet let
us be believed for our vvorks ſake
vvhich from our principle is manifeſt to
be of God, vvhereby vve are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
from all faire ſayers, vvho may
have many good words, but not in the
life, and ſo are fruitleſs in good works
and the witneſs of God will never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
with a ſeale unto their ſayings
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43721:56"/>
though they may ſpeak never ſo faire,
but we know that whoſoever doth the
Fathers will, ſhall perfectly underſtand
our principle, doctrin and works, by
which they may come to be ſatisfied
that we doe not ſpeak of our ſelves, nor
act of our ſelves, but in the eternal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the power and life of Chriſt, who
is our foundation and principle; and
they that would be ſatisfied concerning
us any way, they muſt finde us and
know us in the principle of life where
we are, and not in their own reason
where we are not, for it is not poſſible to
finde a man where he is not, or to know
him untill he be found and beheld in the
place where he moveth, and ſo let none
reason about us, for there they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
know us or come unto us, but let all
feele to that of God in them and be
faithfull to it, and then they will not
ſay, the Quakers Religion is but young in
years, or lately come up, and we know
them not, nor what their new doctrin
meanes, by which people comes to be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43721:56"/>
ſo altered and changed; but they will
know and underſtand, that our life is hid
with Chriſt in God, and that his life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in us, and we in it, and so be put
out of all doubts and queſtions in the
reaſonings concerning us; and receive
ſatisfaction in all things that pertaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, in life and godlineſs, in which our
Religion is pure, holy and undefiled,
and was before unholineſs or unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
was; and will remaine in i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
purity vvhen years ſhall pass avvay and
be no more, and this is the meaning of
our doctrin, to bring people to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
word of God in themſelves, that
they may come into reſt and peace in
the pure Religion, where God is known
in his loves grace, and riches of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> If your Faith give you ſuch aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of your principle and Religion to be
true and right, then why cannot you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it by force, and ſo free your ſelves
from that outward bondage which you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for your Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:43721:57"/>
A. Our Faith doth give us ſuch an
aſſurance, but yet we cannot ſtrive with
our oppoſers and oppreſſours, nor any
way by force of carnal weapons ſeek to
defend it, for we know that it is ſufficient
to defend it ſelf, &amp; alſo to defend us that
live in it, and our weapons are Spiritual
and not carnal, &amp; we fight the good fight
of Faith in the power of the Prince of
peace, and ſo we war againſt ſin, but
followes peace with all men, and can be
ready in every office of love to doe
good to our greateſt enemies, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we have been ſufficiently proved to
be a peacable people under every power
by which we have or doe ſuffer, and
we have never reſiſted, nor ſought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
upon any, but in all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
our cauſe unto God, in whose sight
we stand approved, and he knows
that as we are in words or appearance,
even ſo we are the ſame in heart, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his judgement and tryall we appeale
in our innocency, and the principle of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43721:57"/>
his life in every one doth bear witneſs
for us, and all that hearken unto it, will
receive a true evidence in themselves
concerning our innocent and peaceable
life.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi> And doe you refer your tryal in all
things to your own principle in others,
which you ſay is Chriſt, the light, and
life, and witneſs of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, We doe ſo, for as we know
that all judgement in heaven and earth
is committed unto Chriſt, so we know
that there is not another that can truly
try or judge of us beſides him, and
therefore we have boldneſs to refer our
tryal in all things unto him alone as
knowing that his tryal and judgement
is according to truth in every man, and
as our Faith is in him, and our love unto
him, ſo we know that he will not
condemne the works of his own hands,
but juſtifie the fruit of his own life, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and virtue, and his tryal and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will clearly evidence for us, that
we are his, and not our own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:43721:58"/>
Confeſſion. <hi> It may now be perceived,
that you do not hold or maintain the
things that you do to be from your ſelves
or in your own wills but from Chriſt the
foundation and principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Yes, it is plainly ſo, for of our
ſelves we can do nothing, but through
Chriſt, in whom vve have our ſtrength,
vve are able to do all things; ſo that
our ſufficiency is in him alone, and by
his power in us, all our good works are
wrought for us, and unto him they all
return, that he in all things may have
the preheminence, and the glory for
ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved.</hi> It being so, there is no good
ground why you ſhould be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
or any way ſuffer for your Faith
and Religion, ſeeing that what you do
is from the power of Christ, and his
works are not to be denyed by any, nor
you to ſuffer in any caſe for the faith you
have in him, and the love you have to
him; and ſeeing that you deny your
ſelves in what you do (which many
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43721:58"/>
hitherto have thought you did not) and
that you are willing to be tryed and
Judged according to the Judgment of
truth in Christ, you ought not in any
wiſe to suffer by any other Tryal or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whatſoever; and all ſober, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
people may be well ſatisfied with
this Demonſtration, that your principle
is of God, and that your faith and love
is unto God, and your good will unto
all men, and none need not any farther
ſtand in doubt of the truth of it, but
may be fully perſwaded that you have
Salvation and Eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt,
which may overcome all that are yet
contrary minded unto you, to joyne
with your principle, that they may be
of your Faith and Religion, who are a
people that loves God ſo singly, and
lives amongst men so peaceably, which
indeed doth clearly manifeſt your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Religion to be of God.</p>

               <head>A manifeſtation of Prayer in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
and Prayer in the Spirit
of God.</head>
               <p>IT hath been a common Obſervation
through Ages and Generations, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
ſomething as a duty unto God by
way of Prayer; &amp; this common obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath deſcended from one generation
to another (ever ſince the Apoſtacy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred)
in a cuſtomary and formal way,
ſtill obſerving the practice in words, and
continuing the ſame as a duty unto God
in the ſame manner and form, not at all
regarding or conſidering the present
want, or neceſſity of the preſent Age or
Generation, nor the preſent ſtates and
conditions of particular people, but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>ſame Words,</hi> and in the <hi>ſame
Form,</hi> from time to time, and from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to generation; and so it flows,
as a natural stream in a common and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43721:59"/>
customary practice, from one generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to another; and hence it is that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
continue asking but do not receive,
<hi>becauſe they ask amiſs,</hi> not feeling the
Spirit that makes interceſſion. And so
the <hi>Phariſees</hi> made long prayers, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the greater damnation, becauſe
they prayed not in the Spirit, but in the
cuſtomary formality, which by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was condemned. And it is very ſad
that people ſhould all their life-time be
complaining and asking, and never come
to receive ſatisfaction: And this is the
common way of Prayer in this preſent
generation, who have many prayers in
formed words, and with their mouths
do often repeat them, and in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
make a practice of them, and ſo at
ſet-times, and in ſet-prayers, ſpend away
their dayes, but feel not the Lord nor
his goodneſs. And this common way of
Prayer, now uſed in the common Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
never brings people to obtain, but
keeps them alwayes asking; where, in
anſwer to the Commandments, they pray<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:43721:60"/>
no this wiſe, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,
and encline our hearts to keep this Law;
and write all theſe thy Laws in our hearts,
we beſeech thee.</hi> Now, if they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
their hearts to the Spirit of God
in themſelves, and obey it, then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
would encline their hearts to keep
God's Law, and the Spirit would write
his Law in their hearts, and put it into
their inward parts, and it would keep
them that they ſhould not depart from
it, and there they would feel Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and ſo come to receive an answer
of their Prayers: For when the heart of
man doth not encline to the Spirit of
God, it is in rebellion againſt him, and
God doth not ſhew mercy to the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious;
and ſo people paſs over their time
in words, but want the life which ſhould
do them good; and when they come
to finiſh their dayes, their hearts are as
far off from Gods Law, as the firſt day
when they began to pray, That he would
encline their hearts to keep it; and they
have no aſſurance that God will shew
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43721:60"/>
them mercy, though they have been
praying in words all their life-time. And
likewiſe in anſwer to the <hi>Lettany,</hi> where
they pray after this manner, <hi>Good Lord
deliver us:</hi> And, <hi>We beſeech thee to hear
us good Lord.</hi> And this is the ſame in
their latter dayes, as in the beginning;
and it is manifeſt that they are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from thoſe things as in words
they pray to be delivered from, nor are
not heard in those things which they
beſeech the Lord to hear them in, and
ſo they ſpend their dayes in obſerving a
cuſtomary formality, and never come
to any aſſurance that they are delivered,
or that their requeſts are heard and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
And again, in that which they
call the <hi>Creed,</hi> they confeſs they believe
in God; now they that believe in God,
their hearts are enclined to keep his Law,
and he shews them mercy, and hears
them, and delivers them, for they that
believe in God, they do his will; and if
any man do his will, him he heareth.
And then again they confeſs, <hi>That they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43721:61"/>
are miſerable ſinners, and do thoſe things
they ought not to do:</hi> And if ſo, then not
Believers; for they that believe in Christ
are not miſerable ſinners, neither do those
things they ought not to do, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in Chriſt they are ſaved, and he
takes away their ſin that makes them
miſerable, and ſets them free from their
miſery, and they do thoſe things that
are well-pleaſing in his ſight; for they
that truly believe in Chriſt, they do not
only confeſs their ſins, but also forſake
them, and so find mercy with the Lord;
and they are not alwayes complaining
that they do those things they ought not
to do, but know his Will and do it, and
are bleſſed in their deed. And again,
in that which they call the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi>
they generally say, <hi>Our Father:</hi> Now
the Children of God are not miserable
sinners, nor do not those things they
ought not to do; for, <hi>whoſoever is born
of God, doth not commit ſin:</hi> And, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſinneth, hath not ſeen him, neither
known him:</hi> And there are not any that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43721:61"/>
believe in God, or can call God <hi>Father</hi>
in truth, but thoſe that are born of him;
for thoſe that are born of fleſh and of
blood, and of the will of man, they do
not believe in God, neither can truly call
God <hi>Father;</hi> for that is the nature in
vvhich ſin is committed, vvhich makes
people miſerable, and that is the nature
in which they do thoſe things they ought
not to do, and that is the nature in which
there is no ſaving health; and there is
not any prayer accepted of God, which
in that nature is performed: for none in
the flesh can please God; and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is offered unto him in that nature, he
doth not regard it, for it is the nature
from which all wickedneſs proceedeth,
and <hi>the prayers of the wicked are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
unto God.</hi> And though there
may be many which may deny the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vvay of Prayer,, as it is uſed in
the common Worſhip, and ſet up ſome
other way of Prayer, as more excellent;
yet whilſt the Fleſh, and Blood, and
Will of man conceives it, and performs
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43721:62"/>
it, there is no difference in the ground,
between that vvhich they deny, and
that which they ſet up and practise, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth God regard it any more than
that which they deny. And though ſuch
Prayers may not appear ſo formal, as
thoſe that are commonly uſed in the
common Worſhip, yet they are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the very ſame womb, and do not
at all differ in the ground: for as the
Wiſdom of the fleſh hath composed so
many ſet-prayers in words, and hath
preſcribed a way to observe and practise
the same, and that none is either to add
or diminiſh as to vvhat is ſo compoſed;
even ſo the ſame Wiſdom may deny that
preſcribed way, as being formal, and
may invent ſomething inſtead of it, in a
higher miſtery of iniquity; and though
they may not ſpeak in ſuch formal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
words, yet in the ſame Wiſdome
their words are formal, not at all differing
in the ground or conception, but only
in the expreſſion and obſervation, and
in their practiſe it is as formal as that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43721:62"/>
which they deny; for they have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
obſervation by way of Prayer, in
what they practiſe, which in it ſelf is as
formal as the ſet-prayers commonly uſed
in the common Worship; for they can
ſet their own time both to begin and to
make an end; and when they will they
can utter vvords, and vvhen they will
they can be ſilent; and they have their
own conceptions at command, and can
either perform or not perform in their
own time; and this is the uncleane part
vvhich offers unto God, which he doth
not accept, neither is any Prayer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
or accepted of God, but the
Prayer which is offered to him by his
own birth.</p>
               <p>So that theſe few things being ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
conſidered, it is manifeſt, that the
way of Prayer, as it is now commonly
uſed, obſerved, and practiſed in the
common Worship, is not true prayr, but a
bare formality, and not onely ſo, but alſo
contradictory, &amp; ſo is not performed with
a right understanding; and it is as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43721:63"/>
that all other wayes of praying,
which are conceived and performed
in the wiſdom of the fleſh, is not true
Prayer, neither doth God regard it more
then the other, becauſe it is performed
in the ſame nature, and differs in nothing
but in the manner; and however they
may differ in the practice, yet they meet
in the ground, and are offered up in
the unclean part, and ſo are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with an underſtanding, as Prayer
in the Spirit of God is.</p>
               <p>Now the Spirit of Life, which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
from God in every mans consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
doth ſo enlighten him, as to make
him ſenſible that he is a ſinner, and in
himself is miſerable, and eternally liable
to the Wrath of God, without the Lord
appear for him, and work his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and as man takes heed to that
Spirit which doth ſo enlighten him, and
makes manifeſt his condition to him,
then the Spirit begins to quicken and ſtir
up ſomething in him that deſires after
God, and breathes after God, and the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43721:63"/>
sighs and groans begin to arise in a true
ſence of miſery, and the breathings go
forth in the earnest of the Spirit unto
God, and the cry ariſes for help and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance;
and though that which is
quickened by the Spirit, to breath in
the Spirit, be but as a babe in youngneſs,
and that it doth not know what to pray
for as it ought, but ſtands ſighing, and
groaning, and mourning, in the ſence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdens,
weights and loads that lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, yet the Spirit in that ſtate helpeth
its infirmities, and makes requeſts for it
according to the will of God, for the
Spirit knows what the Babe wants, and
with what it is burdened, and so makes
interceſſion unto God for it; and in the
Spitit the Babe hath acceſs to God; and
though it be but young, yet it cryes <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi>
Father, and ſo it breathes in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and cryes in the Spirt, and prayes to
the Father in the Spirit; and the ſighs
and groans, do riſe from a true ſence of
its own weakness, and the want of Gods
Mercies; for it underſtands in the Spirit
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43721:64"/>
what it wants, and is ſenſible what bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
lyes upon it, and in the Spirit it
draws nigh to God, and ſubmits its ſelfe
to the Throne of his Grace, and there
finds Grace to help it in its need, for the
Spirit brings reliefe from the boſome of
the Father, and ſupplies the Babe in all
its wants, and every breathing is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
unto by the Spirit; and here the
Babe prays aright, and asketh according
to the will of God, and he hears its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings,
and in his compaſſion he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth
its petitions, and ſo it comes to
receive from his own hand, and he gives
unto it daily bread, and nourishes it with
his own virtue, after which it breatheth,
and ſtands by it to help it in the hour of
temptation, and ſo the Babe begotten by
the Spirit, prays in the Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
from the Spirit, and is ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the virtue of the Spirit; and this
is true prayer, though never a word be
ſpoken through utterance: for the Babe
breaths in the Spirit and cryes in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and prayes in the Spirit; and as it so
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43721:64"/>
breaths, and cries, and prayes in ſecret, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
so the Father which ſeeth in ſecret,
doth reward it openly, and by his power
removes the burdens from it, and with
his own hand lifteth up its head, &amp; in his
own time he delivereth it out of all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
and from its quickning and firſt
breathing it goes on from ſtrength to
ſtrength, and from virtue to virtue, even
as by the Spirit of the Lord; and having
received ſtrength in the Spirit, then by the
Spirit it hath utterance given, and can ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
words by the help of the Spirit, and so
prayes in the Spirit, and prayes with an
underſtanding; and that which it expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
in words by the help of the Spirit,
and by the ſtrength of the Spirit, that is a
comfort to every babe that is breathing
in the ſame Spirit; and ſo the babes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by the Spirit, pray in the unity of
the spirit, and their prayers return into
their bosome, and are answered with
a seal of the same spirit, for they ask in the
Name of Christ, and in his Name they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their ſatisfaction; and ſo here is a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43721:65"/>
time of ſighing, &amp; groaning, &amp; mourning,
&amp; complaining; &amp; a time of breathing, &amp;
crying, &amp; praying; &amp; a time of receiving,
&amp; rejoycing, wherein the babes of life do
come to inherit that w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> they have brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
after, &amp; so come to the living praises
unto God, who hath anſwered their prairs
in the riches of his Grace and Mercy.</p>
               <p>So all must come to the ſpirit of God, by
the ſpirit to be ordered, and ceaſe from
their own words &amp; from their own time,
and learn to be ſilent until the ſpirit give
them utterance; for the Lord is weary of
all formality &amp; hypocriſie, &amp; he hath no
pleaſure in any ſuch performances, for his
Controverſie is against the <hi>Son of Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
but he will exalt the <hi>Son of his Love;</hi> &amp;
bleſſed are they that are born of his life,
for whatsoever they ask in his Name, their
Petitions are answered, &amp; their Requeſts
granted, &amp; the prayrs of ſuch are only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and not the prayrs of those that
think to be heard for their much babling,
who have many words, but not in the
life.</p>
