            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>In this Engagement we loſt four private Souldiers, &amp; four Indians, two Officers and twelve Chriſtians, and Indians wounded; and we had an account by ſome of our Indian Priſoners that made their eſcape, that we killed of the Enemy 33, whereof we found but 27, among which was their Commandant, one Captain, and two others Officers, with two of their commanding Indians, and 26 wounded. We reſcued between forty and fifty Priſoners.</p>

               <p>IT is not unknown to ſome of you, that I came laſt <hi>October</hi> into theſe parts upon no other occaſion than to view the Fronteers, and put them in the beſt poſture I could, to ſecure us and you, from the Attempts of the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians,</hi> our Enemies and yours. And in order to this I ſent a ſupply of Amunition, Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, and Chriſtian Souldiers, ſufficient to prevent any Inſult from our Enemies, and it had the effect I expected, for they durſt not face the weakeſt of our Garriſons. I came now for your Relief, and have loſt no time; the ſame day that I had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from hence that our Enemies were in this Country. I put my ſelf on board a Sloop, and brought with me 150 Chriſtian Souldiers, beſides Volunteers, and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved here before I could be expected; I then immediately marched to <hi>Schenactady,</hi> from whence I ſent you ſupplies of 200 and odd men, Amunition, Proviſion, &amp;c. with which thoſe that joyned you before, under the Command of Major <hi>Schuyler,</hi> might have ſecured an entire Victory, and prevented the <hi>French</hi> and their Indians from any poſſibility of getting back to their own houſes, but it has pleaſed God to order it otherwiſe. I had alſo 200 Chriſtians more upon their march, who arrived here, and would have been a conſiderable Reinforcement to us, but the Action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, I commanded them back to their former Reſidence, till further Orders. It is obvious to me, and I believe to you all, that this Calamity is fallen on you by your own faults. I could never ſuppoſe my Brethren, the <hi>Mohaques,</hi> would be ſo ſupine and careleſs, as to ſuffer the <hi>French,</hi> and their Indians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to enter their Caſtles without the leaſt Reſiſtance. Theſe men that have an Enemy near, muſt ſleep with Arms in their Hands, and one eye open, that is, they muſt keep Scouts and Spves, ſo as never to become a prey to their Enemies, by their own negligence. I muſt adviſe you, that for the future, you keep ſtrict watch, ſo that I may have timely notice of the Enemy's motion, and you will then ſee how eaſily they will be defeated.</p>
               <p>I hope it is now apparent to you, that the great of King of <hi>England</hi> is ready to apply his Arms for your defence, when you conſider, that in a very few days I am come perſonally to your Aſſiſtance, with near 400 Chriſtian Souldiers. I have had the Honour to bear Command under the great <hi>King of England,</hi> my Maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where I have ſeen the <hi>French</hi> fly before his Victorious Arms; and laſt Summer it pleaſed God to add to his Victories, by the defeat and deſtruction of their Fleet, in which moſt of their Ships were burnt or ſunk.</p>
               <p>I came now in great haſte, and brought no Preſents with me, but deſign (by the bleſſing of God) to be with you at the beginning of Summer, to give you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to wipe off your Tears for the Brethren that are lately loſt, to renew the antient Covenant Chain, and to give you further Aſſurances of the Great King of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66285:6"/>
                  <hi>England</hi>'s Favour, and of my own Readineſs upon all occaſions to appear as his Servant, for your Protection againſt our Enemies and yours.</p>
               <p>My preſent care now is, to provide for the <hi>Mohaques</hi> Nation, about which I have given my directions to Major <hi>Sehuyler,</hi> who will appoint them a place for their Reſidence; I have alſo ordered ſome Corn for their preſent ſupport, which they will receive from him. I muſt add, that it concerns your Honour &amp; Reputation to make ſome brisk attempt upon our Enemies, and this with what ſecrecy and expedition you can, that thoſe People may ſee you retain the antient Courage of your Anceſtors, and I do not queſtion but God will give you ſucceſs by a ſevere Revenge on our Enemies and yours.</p>
               <p>I am informed, that your Young Men have killed the Horſes of ſome Chriſtian Souldiers, who were upon the ſame ſervice with you (it is not Brotherly) and I deſire for the future, you will take care to prevent ſuch Outrage, that the antient Covenant Chain may be preſerved inviolably on your parts, as it will be on the part of my Maſter, the great King.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I muſt tell you, that I doubt there is ſome falſe Brother among us, who keeps intelligence with our Enemies, concealing their deſigns, and expoſing ours; if you have one French man among you, he will be true to his Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by betraying you. I have order'd you ſome Bread and Bear, and deſire you will drink the Healths of my great Mr. and Mrs the Victorious King and moſt Illuſtrous Queen of <hi>Great Brittain, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all their Majeſties Territories in <hi>America;</hi> and ſo bid you farewell.</p>

               <p>WHen we arived at <hi>Schenectady,</hi> after our march againſt the Enemy, you was pleaſed to deſire us to come hither, where we heard you, <hi>Great Swift Arrow,</hi> ſpeak, and participated of your Favours, we acknowledge that the Enemy, the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada</hi> have fallen upon our Brethren, the <hi>Mohaques,</hi> and deſtroyed their three Caſtles, which we can attribute to nothing elſe but their not hearkening to the <hi>great Swift Arrow</hi>'s good Advice, which was to keep good Guard and out Scouts.</p>
               <p>We return you, <hi>Brother great ſwift Arrow,</hi> our hearty Thanks for your care in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the <hi>Mohaques,</hi> that they may not ſtarve, nor be in want in this extremity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother, great ſwift Arrow,</hi> You propoſe to us the atracking the Enemy in their Country, to ſhew them that we have not loſt the Courage of our Anceſtors; we return you our hearty Thanks for your good Encouragement, for we are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner drunk with the Blood lately ſhed by them. It is not uſual for us, while we are in that grief and annixity, as now we are, to proceed to revenge our ſelves of the Enemy; you have loſt your Blood as well as we, there ore that Blood ought to be revenged unanimouſly by both ſides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother, Great Swift Arrow,</hi> You recommend us to go and attack the Enemy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66285:6"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brother, Great Swift Arrow,</hi> While you preſs us to go and attack the Enemy of <hi>Canada</hi> by Land, we expect, according to the many Promiſes and Engagements made to us, to hear of a conſiderable Force to go with great Guns by Sea, that the Enemy might be aſſaulted both ways, and ſo over-come; we preſs this the harder, becauſe a great part of our ſtrength is now broke, and therefore take it not amiſs that we puſh this point of taking <hi>Canada</hi> by Sea, ſince its impoſſible to be done by Land alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother, Great Swift Arrow,</hi> We return you our hearty Thanks, that you are ſo ready to aſſiſt us upon any occaſion, and for the good advice to be watchful, and keep out good ſcouts and ſpyes; it is probable, that we would have done a great deal more damage to the Enemy had we been ſo well provided with all ſorts of Amunition, as the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Canada</hi> are; but ſome of our men have Guns, and no Powder nor Ball, and ſome but Bows and Arrows, as Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> ſaw, when we came up to him; but the Governour of <hi>Canada</hi> ſupplies his <hi>Indians</hi> with all ſorts of Arms and Amunition, which we found now when we engaged them.</p>
               <p>We pray you, <hi>Great Swift Arrow,</hi> to have a careful Eye over us, ſince this party of the <hi>French</hi> that has deſtroyed the <hi>Mohaques</hi> Caſtles, is but part of his ſtrength, he is working with the <hi>Ottawawa</hi> and <hi>Dowaganhaes Indians,</hi> where he has a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazeen, and ſupplies them with all ſorts of Amunition, and we fear that that force will come down upon us ſtill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother, Great ſwift Arrow,</hi> We return you thanks for remembring our dead, and that you will condole their death, when you come up in the beginning of Summer, but you can expect no Return from us, being in ſo mean a capacity and condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother, Great Swift Arrow,</hi> You inform us of the great Victory that our Lord of Lords (meaning the great King of <hi>England)</hi> has got upon the <hi>French,</hi> the common Enemy at Sea, which is admirable, and all the Nations are heartily rejoyced at it, and we hope that the great God that has his Seat above the Heavens, will give the ſame ſucceſs to our great Lord of Lords Arms in this part of the World, over his and our Enemies, the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We pray that you would be pleaſed to acquaint our great Lord of Lords, who lives over the great great Lake, of our mean Condition, and what poſture we are in, and how eaſy it is to deſtroy <hi>Canada,</hi> if all our great Lord of Lords ſubjects in theſe Collonies would unite and joyn together, with ſome Ships that carry great Guns, which our great Lord of Lords can eaſily ſpare us, after this late Victory over the <hi>French</hi> at Sea.</p>
               <p>We deſire that you would be pleaſed to order a Smith to be with us in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to repair our Arms, that we may defend us from the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Excellency replyed, That he hoped they were ſufficiently ſatisfied of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to aſſiſt them, and that the Force the <hi>French</hi> had now ſent was the moſt they could make; and if they would but keep out ſcouts, and advertiſe his Excellency timely of the Enemies coming, his Excellency does not doubt, with the ſtrength he has in his Province, to deal with the Governour of <hi>Canada,</hi> and all his Power.</p>

                  <hi>Brother great ſwift Arrow,</hi> We anſwered your Excellency's Propoſals yeſterday, but had not time to conſult with that deliberation as we ought, and if therefore there be any thing omitted, or if we failed of our duty, we beg that you would be pleaſed to pardon that omiſſion; for we muſt declare in behalf of all the Nations, that we are ſingularly obliged to you, <hi>Brother great ſwift Arrow,</hi> for your ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary diſpatch and ſuddain arrival here for our Relief, with ſo conſiderable a Force, the like never having been done before, whereby we ſee your readineſs and allacrity to help and aſſiſt us.

We are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for your kind expreſſions, to be ſo ready to come for our Relief, and that you warn us to come and acquaint you as ſoon as we ſee the Enemy a coming a far off, not doubting of your Power to protect us, ſince we have ſeen a ſufficient proof of that already by this late Expedition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother great ſwift Arrow,</hi>  we do emgage to make a narrow enquiry as ſoon as we come into our Country, about the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners, who we ſupect may betray us: we have had two bouts with the <hi>Onedeys</hi> about the Prieſt <hi>Milet</hi> that is among them, and we intend to try the third time.</p>
               <p>We deſire that you, <hi>Brother great ſwift Arrow,</hi> may come up as ſoon as the Bark is looſe upon the Trees, ſince we have a deſign upon the Enemy.</p>
               <p>We forgot to anſwer you in that buſineſs about the Young men killing the Horſes we acknowledge, its not Brotherly, but very ill done, and as ſoon as we come into our Country we will take ſuch methods that it may be prevented, by finding out them that have done it, cauſing them to make Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>His Excellency replyed, that he was much concerned that they ſhould exerciſe their Arms one againſt another, while there is an Enemy in the Field, and hopes they will for the future endeavour to prevent ſuch Irregularities: That they may be now ſufficiently convinced how ready the Arms of the great King of <hi>England</hi> is to ſuccour them; &amp; that his Excellency, for his own part will never ſpare to expoſe his Perſon for their ſecurity. That the Rum ſhall be prohibited upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and that the moſt he requires of them, is to be vigilent and careful, and not ſuffer themſelves to be ſurprized, and then they need not fear the <hi>French.</hi>
