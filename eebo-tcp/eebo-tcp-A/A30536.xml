            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Riends,</hi> My Master is a High and Mighty, and powerful Prince, and very Honourable; And fear, reverence, respect and subjection belongs to him alone, from you and all mankinde, he is wise and understanding, and of great strength: And his dominion is from everlasting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting; And he can do whatsoever he will in Heaven and Earth; for he rules with his Iron Rod over the World, and whatsoever he saith, it is done; for his Word is an everlasting Command; If he say to a man Live, it is so; and if he say to him Die, It cometh to passe; and if he give peace to a man or a Nation, none can make War; and if he make War with a person, or in a Nation, no man is able to make Peace. For why, he hath all power in his hand, and to him all Judgement and Authority is given, he is the Sonne of the living God, the everlasting Creator; he was, and is, and is to come; his eye beholdeth all things, and his Arme compasseth Heaven and Earth; and what his purpose is, he hath alwayes, and will ever bring it to passe; if he set up Rulers, they must rule; and if he pull them down, none can hinder; whom he will he honoureth, and if it be his pleasure, he bringeth men to shame; if he break a Nation down, none can build it up; and if he confound Powers and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities in the Kingdomes of men, they all fall as withered grasse before him; Behold ye men! he is so great and mighty, and of so great Authority, that whatsoever he saith, it is done, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he willeth, it cometh to passe; and none is able to resist him and overcome his power; when his pleasure is to accomplish a

work; By him all things are that be, and all things live that hath life, and through him all things moveth, and of his fulnesse every creature in Heaven and Earth receiveth; and this my Master is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether honourable in birth and otherwise; and altogether mighty in all his works; he is just and merciful, full of goodnesse, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and truth, and all vertue dwells in him: and his Judgment and Mercy, his Authority and Meeknesse: and his wrath and his Love, they are Companions; And what are ye before him? or how shall ye be able to resist him? or to turn backward what his purpose is concerning you and this Nation? for ye have no being nor breath without him. Behold ye men; ye are verily as the dust before the winde, so are ye to him soon blown away, and your place not found, as the Grasse before the Mower, so are ye before him, soon cut down and withered, and your beauty utterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, as a Potters vessel under an iron Rod, even so are you to him, he can immediately break you, never to be bound up, as a drop to the Fountain, so are you to him, soon dried up, and made nothing; wherefore ye men, ye mortal creatures, ye igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant persons, sons of a transgressor, ye dust and ashes; for thus you are in comparison of him this mighty Prince; Hearken to his Message which cometh to you from him: Hear and fear, and be not stout-hearted against the Lord God that is about to speak unto you.</p>
            <p>As for this little Island of <hi>England,</hi> wherein your present place and being is; it is an Island which the Lord hath shewed great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto, in ages past, and in this present time: and I must tell you he hath a purpose of love towards it, and to honour it in the view of the world, though through great tribulations, and he hath an intent of great good unto it: For he hath a seed, a precious seed in it, scattered abroad, and he hath a people that feares his Name, and hath walked in his wayes, and he hath made them, and elected them, and what they are, it is by him: that he may dwell among them, and have the whole Government over them all, yea, he hath a speedy purpose verity concerning this Nation, and he will purifie it in Judgment, and refine its inhabitants through the fire of tribulations, that it may be pleasant to him, and fit to do his Will: he hath a purpose to work some great thing in it I must tell you, as he hath said unto me, so to do; he will have his Name exalted and reverenced in this Island, and his terrour shall be sent out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60998:4"/>
of it through the world, and his branch from it shall spread over the earth, he doth purpose in his season to take it into his own hand, and to sway the Government therof with his own Scepter, and to set up Righteousnesse alone, and to overthrow all oppressions and oppressors, and the Kingdoms of this world must become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Lord, and of his Christis.</p>
            <p>True it is, such hath bin the coming to passe of time, and of things for many Ages by-past, that my Master hath bin as it were banished from the Nation, and hath not bin suffered to enjoy his Right, but hath bin expelled, even as it were by the force of Satan, and Antichrist, who hath long usurped Authority over the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this Nation; and in my Masters absence, lamentable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, cruelty, unmercifulnesse, tyranny and oppression, hath bin exercised upon the inhabitants, and the poor creatures hath bin held in great slavery by their Rulers, that have ruled by the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons power, and bin kept in great blindnesse and ignorance, and under great oppression both in body and spirit, by Antichristian Teachers, for this many years, even while the great King hath bin absent, and as it were gone into a far Countrey: even all this time hath Antichrist and the devil ruled and reigned, and hath made and executed oppressing and tyrannical Lawes and Decrees, both in Church and State, and all the Nation hath bin out of right order, and laid waste and barren of good fruit, and it hath bin as a wildernesse, by reason hereof; and men that have ruled for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, have not ruled singly by my Masters Authority, but by another power, though not without the knowledge of my Lord, neither as though he had not power to have done otherwise; but for his own pleasure he hath suffered it thus to be, and let men go on to rule and govern in their own wills, and after their own lusts; and people have walked wickedly towards him, and towards one another, and all this he hath suffered, not as if he gave tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it: for his messengers now and then, and his witnesse in peoples consciences, have bin reproving their ungodly wayes, and he hath often shewed his dislike by divers wayes and tokens, and many judgments and strange overturning: to the way and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of both Rulers, Prophets and Teachere of this Nation: But yet they have gone on, against his minde, and contrary to his Will, notwithstanding his Reproofs and Judgements, not that he had not power to have executed his pleasure in wrath upon them,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60998:5"/>
and to have destroyed them al together, and have made the Nation a heap, and as nothing, long before this day: for power was in his hand to have done it: But he hath bin long-suffering, and of great patience, and born all things, and taken the injustice, and cruelty, and wickednesse, and idolatry, and all unrighteousnesse that hath abounded in the Nation upon himself, and suffered under it, and born it for its season, while woful and lamentable oppressions hath bin practised in Civil State, even hellish Laws, and devilish Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors of them, mercilesse Tyrants have born the Scepter, and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for many years over the inhabitants, and in Church and State, hath bin hainous Idolatry, and Superstitious vanities committed in a high nature, and measure, and even all men, and States of men, &amp; orders of men, of every degree, hath bin abominably corrupted, in the fight of my Lord; even from the Prince to the Begger, even Rulers and Subjects, Teachers and People, Judges and Prophets, they have bin corrupted both in heart and hand, and they have dealt falsly, and wickedly towards him, and towards one another, even to the great displeasure and vexation of him, and his blessed Spirit, and to the high provocation of him, to their own destruction, if his long suffering had not prevailed, and all this, while he hath layed, as it were asleep, and at rest in himself, and he hath left men to try them, what they will do, and he hath given them a day, many Kings and Rulers, he hath let them have a little time, to see how they would use it, but they have abused it, and not Ruled for him, nor accomplished his work, nor fulfilled his will, but acted even in defiance of him, and of his Power, and to his great dishonor, Alack! I must be plaine with you, my Lord hath bin utterly exiled, and greatly dishonored, and highly provoked and vexed, by reason of such proceedings, as hath bin in this Nation for this many yeares, through the corruption of all sorts of men in place, and power, who hath not ruled for him, but for the Devill, to their own corrupted ears, only he hath suffered men to go on in their course for a season, some as it were appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Stage for a time, and suddenly cast down again, for their iniquities sake, and his hand hath bin in all these things, though very privatly and secretly, not known and discerned by the Sons of men, yet hath he Ruled over the Kingdoms of men, and pulled down one and set up another, and to forbear the severall actings and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of many by-passed ages, and to come to this generation, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60998:5"/>
to speak of things that have happened within these few years, and of the changing and overturning that hath hapned in this Nation; such was the cruelty, tyranny, and oppression, and Idolatry, both in Church and Civil State, that the People of this Nation were held under, in the dayes of Papal-Power, such I say, was the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heighth of Cruelty, and tyranny of that time, that not any that feared or reverenced my Lord, in any measure could scarce live, or have a being in the Nation, even against every man, that did but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline towards him, and desire the knowledge of his waies, Hells mouth was opened against them, and they were swallowed up, and many of their lives taken from the Earth, by the hellish power that had in that day usurped Authority in this Island, and when thus it was, then he looked down from Heaven, and his bowells of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion were opened, for the sake of the oppressed People that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after him, in so much that he broke, and threw down the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their oppressors in some measure, as it stood in Papall-Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and when the iniquity of that power was filled up, he took vengeance upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I must tell you, it was he that brought it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, even the destroying of that Power in this Nation, and freeing the Nation from it, though the men that were instruments in the cause were not his Servants, otherwise then as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> served him, for he hath a secret way to have a service from the wicked, and such is his Power, that he can turne the wickednesse of the wicked to his glory, and he can make a Rod to whipp his Adversaries, and burne it when he hath done, and he hath often destroyed one wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse by another. Well, but to leave that, though he did in some measure free this Nation from much tyranny and cruelty, in the casting out Popish Authority, yet alack the Nation in a few yeares was neare as much violated by Injustice, tiranny, and cruelty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the prelatical power, as ever it was once under the Papal power, though before there had bin some small reformation, and change in outward appearance, though little in ground and nature, yet op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and tyranny in Civill State, and Idolatry, and Superstition in Church and State, and all profaness and wickednesse among people, was grown so high, like as it had bin under the Papal power before, and all that desired after the Lord, and was weary of iniquity, and of the then present oppressions and Idolatries, were persecuted, and slain, and destroyed, and Injustice and cruelty excercised upon them, even allmost to the rooting out of righteousnesse, and to the grieving of

the Lords Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well then, because of the cry of the People, and the oppression of the Nation under that Authority, my Lord looked down again, and even for his Name sake, and his seeds sake, he had compassion on this Nation, to set it free, and to break off its oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and by his hidden hand and secret power, he overthrew that oppressing power of Kings, Lords, and Bishops, both in Church, and Civill State, and brought some Tyrants and Oppressors to just execution, for their wickednesse and in a great measure, he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the people of this Nation in many things, and there was a part of reformation wrought, and much pretended and looked for, and all this came to passe through him, and my Lord did accomplish it, however the instruments by which he wrought proved deceitfull, and became oppressors, as others before them, and though there was in this Nation a day of great troubles, and warrs, and contention, and great strife, and the wasting of much blood, and earthly treasure, and none of these things I must tell you, fell without the ordering of my Masters hand, yet so it was, and came to pass, that after this Nation was restored to peace; though much unrighteousnesse, and Injustice was removed, yet there was much also left behinde, and men that he had used as instruments in his hand in a good work, and to whom he had given wisdom, and understanding, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in much mercy, and in great deliverance, yet they even turned to seeke themselves, and became corrupted in the spoyles of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and when peace, and plenty abounded, the Lord was forgotten again, and then the Land fell under oppressors, and began again to cry out for freedom, even when other horns of the first Beast sprang up, and went one each of them after his fellow, and though one horne hath striven to break another, yet after one hath bin cast down, another hath risen, and made an Image to the first, and ruled and reigned by the same Spirit and Authority derived from the Dragons power, in cruelty and oppression, and made Lawes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted them, to the dishonour of the Lord, and to the great oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his people, and to the filling of this Island with Injustice and cruelty, even from one generation to another, untill this day, and thus up and down, hath times and seasons bin altered, power and Authority changed, and altered, Statuts, Lawes, and Decrees, changeable, and alterable, for as the iniquity of one power was filled up, that was cast down, and another had its day, till the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the first was also finished, that he might partake of the same
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60998:6"/>
judgments, and in all these over-turnings, breakings down, and over-throwings, the very hand of my Lord hath bin, though secretly, and not discerned, yet his power hath brought about, and suffered all these things to come to pass, and who shall charge him with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice? or who shall say what hast thou don? or why hast thou don it? for as I have said, he is a high and mighty Prince, and can do whatsoever he will; and he is the Supream Power and Authority which Rules and Reignes in, and over all the Kingdomes of men; and what though he hath used wicked men, as an instrument to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish his work, and made the wicked his Rod, and even brought it to pass, that one wickednesse should destroy another, and one op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor break down another, and the Kingdom of Antichrist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found its self, yet what of all these things? all flesh must bee silent before him, and all people, and the whole Earth must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto him, for the Government and Dominion over Heaven and Earth are his, and all Power and Dominion belongs to him alone, and all Judgment is in his hand, to bring to pass whatsoever he will, and by whomsoever, as he pleaseth.</p>
            <p>But now my Friends, though I would not be tedious to you, yet must I tell you the truth, and faithfully deliver the Lords Message un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: and as concerning this last overturning, there was something of the hand of my Lord in it; and hee can, and will bring forth his own work and praise by it, and it shall be for the good of all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that waites upon him, though there was much ambition and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ends in the Instruments, and neither part were perfectly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to the Lord in their proceedings; but their work was tasted with the false Idolatrous spirit of self-seeking: Yet notwithstanding the Lord may bring forth his Government, and his pleasant Plant, through and beyond all this, even out of another Root, which yet appears not among either of them, and Righteousnesse may arise in the Nation contrary to both of them, out of another stem, and he will set up his Kingdom, and in the mean time leave one Potsheard of the Earth to break another. And as for you that now sits on the Throne and beares Rule,<note place="margin">Is meant here chiefely the new <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> * (so called.)</note> whether <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> (so called) chiefly, though it is not without my Master, for he hath the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, at least, yet you are not the onely men of his Choice, truly called of him to the place of Government, neither is your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment the Government of the Lamb, neither must it be for ever established by him; its foundation is not blessed, nor can its build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60998:7"/>
be prosperous: For why? alas, it is but another Horn of that fourth Beast, that hath been made to Rule over the world, and upon the earth for many Generations, and it is but hitherto a very little refined from the last, and is of the last, even as the eight was of the seventh, spoken of by that servant <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.11. and it may also make warr with the Lamb and his followers for a little season, and it may have a small measure of injustice, and persecution to bring forth in the Land, even till the words of God be fulfilled, and his Kingdom be fully come; the way of which is but yet a preparing by all these overturnings: and this your present Government Originally is lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened with the spirit of the old Dragon, that hath killed the Saints, and drunk their blood, and how should the Lord establish it? Nay, your Kingdom may prove but small and little, and full of uproars, and troubles, and little peace, and satisfaction, and establishment in it to your selves, nor the people under you; but confusion will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, and feare will compasse it about: Though this I must tell you, as you are men, you have your day of Trial, what you will do, as many others have had before you, and something you may and ought to do, if but to make the Whore (the false Church) more naked, and to scourge her, more than some others have done; and indeed my Lord requires something more of you (as such) to do, then others before you could do, and you have a price put into your hands which you may improve to the Lords honor, and to the Nations good, and to our own happinesse; which if you be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Lord to do what he requires of you, and if you become meek and humble men and fear his name, and deny your selves, and not seek your own honours, nor any earthly advantage to your selves; if you do thus, then My Lord will shew Mercie to you, and you shall not suddenly fall before your enemies, though many may rise up against you; but your daies shall be lengthened, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Lord may be turned to your longer continuance, and not to your sudden destruction, and if you walk in this way, and Rule, only for the Lord, then shall you be honoured as men, if not as an Authority, and you and the Nation preserved in peace, and the force of the wicked shall be turned backward, and you shall not suddenly fall. And the late sundry overturnings in this Nation may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to you, that you follow not the stepps of those that God hath cast out, lest you come to the same end of confusion and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie: For as concerning that Assemblie of men that last sate on the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60998:7"/>
Throne, something was done by them, in their day and time, and in both their assemblings in some things they served my Lord, and they were a Rod in his hand to smite his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet they were not faithfull to the end, till all his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were destroied; but rather joined themselves to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord and his people, and were hastening on towards the waie of Oppression, and persecution; and it was time for the Lord to remove them, and to laie them aside, as an emptie vessel, sometimes useful; and to break them as a Rod, sometime of service to be a scourge upon his Enemies; and when the day of their trial was over, which God gave unto them, being any longer (for present) unfit Instruments for his hand, then he cast him into the fire; and this his purpose came to passe upon them, so that they and the whole Nation may be contented and yield themselves subject, to what he hath done concerning them; for they being entring into the very same spirit of wickednesse, of oppression, and persecution, which the Lord had once reproved through them, and cast out by them; then was a Rod raised up against them; even as they had been against others, and they were dealt withall as they had done to others; and this was in the justice of my Lords hand, and what hath Mortal man to question his proceedings? and though some of you (present Rulers) be looked upon as great Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Tyrants in your dealing towards them; and doubtless the men of that part will seek vengeance against you, even by preaching and praying, and they will curse you in the name of their God, and seek continually your destruction, as such as have taken away part of their strength, and cast down their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol: But alass! all this is nothing, for the Lord doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as men: For these things must needs thus come to pass for the furtherance of the Kingdom and Government of Jesus Christ, that it may arise through all; and if you were but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to what the Lord requires of you in your present procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; what you have done unto them should not be reckoned on account against you, neither by God nor good men: But, and if, you of the Army, be alwaies treacherous and disobedient towards him, and abuse your power, and disregard your price

that God hath given you, and trifle away your hour about pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Honor, and such self-seeking matters, and the Cause of God be neglected by you, and his people continued oppressed sufferers under you, as they have long been, even then shall you be cast aside with shamefull disgrace, and the heavie hand of the Lord shall be upon you in judgment, and you shall be smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more then any before you; your Estates shall not be spared from the spoiler, nor your soules from the Pit, nor your persons from the violence of men, no nor, your necks from the axe; for if you be unfaithfull, and continually treacherous to the Cause of God, then shall you be left to the will of your Enemies, and they shall charge treacherie and treason upon you, and your persons and estates shall be given for a prey to your Enemies, and you shall not deliver your selves, neither will the Lord deliver you from the execution of mercilesse men; for my Lord shall leave the cruel-hearted to plead with you.</p>
            <p>Wherefore that you may be warned, I advise you be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, let not the cause of God fall, nor the cause of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies prosper before you, for there is no other way, wherby you can be preserved, nor no other defence shall you ever find from the wrath of the Lord, and from the fury of your devouring Enemies, then your faithfullnesse in Gods cause, and therfore relieve the oppressed, and take off all oppression, break down all unjust Lawes, and set all people free, from unjust burdens, and let all oppression cease, both in Church and Civill State, and even all oppressive Lawes, and unjust Judges, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil men in power, let all this be removed, and the Nation clean quitted and discharged even from all men, and Lawes whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that have held under oppression the Persons, Estates, and Consciences of the good people of this Land, and let the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be corrected, and all orders and places of men, and Lawes and decrees purified, for this my Lord, the great King requireth; and he will suddenly have it brought to passe in the Nation, if not by you, then contrary to you, and to your utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and this is the very substance of my Message to you, that my Master hath given me to say unto you, and on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half I am come to claime of you my Masters long lost right, let him have his right, from which he hath long bin banished, I

            <p>And therfore ye men, do not strive with him in this matter, but yeeld unto him, the excercise of your own consciences by his Spirit in you, and let him do so unto all others, even as yee hope to prosper, and upon the penalty of his sore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure

upon you in this World, and in the World to come; and let just men and righteous men, and meek men, and men that have the fear and wisdom of God in them, without exceptation of Birth or otherwise, let such men have the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and judgment committed to them, to determin in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man; down with all the false hearted flatterers that have ruled for man, and not for God, and for themselves, and not for the good of the people, cast all such out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, for the good among you is choaked by them, down with all that judge for rewards, &amp; away with all hireling rulers, that executes the Law for money, and will not plead the cause of the poor without great fees; and down with all that will not serve places of Trust without so large stipends, away with all these things out of the Land, for they are hainous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions unto men, and great abominations in the sight of God, and the Land has long groaned under the waight of these things, and the Earth is weary of them, and my Lord requires their utter dissolution, as being iniquities fully ripe, and having the guilt of so much cruelty, Injustice and oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, lying upon the Nation because hereof, therfore is the Lords season to destroy them, and remove them out of the Land, which if you be the instruments in such a work, it will be your greatest Crown, and your perpetuall honour, for the Lords purpose is one way or other to cleanse the Land of all these and other oppressions whatsoever, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Land may be a free people from all the heavy yoakes of Antichrist, which hath long sorely pressed them down, and the purpose of the Lord is to break the yoakes of oppression and tyranny, from off the necks of this People, and therfore is it that he overturneth, yea, and will overturne all men and Authorities that shall oppose his work, and none shall be able to stand before him, for the presence of my Lord is more dreadfull to a Nation when he shews himself in his wrath, then any multitude of Armed men, and woe is unto you if you be found opposeing of him, and if you seek to stopp his work, you shall not cumber the Earth very long, nor oppresse the Nation many dayes, wherfore consider, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed will you bee if you be unfaithfull in what you have to do

on the Lords behalf, for your houre passeth over that is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you, and will be suddenly expired, never to be recalled, and then you cannot work.</p>
            <p>And whereas there is a great Cry about Ministry, for send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, and maintaining, and encouraging a godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, as you say; now to this, I do answer on my Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I must tell you plainly, as for a true godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry truly called and sent of God, such a Ministry and such Ministers you can never be able to hinder, but the Lord will send them out, maintaining them, and preserve them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will or no, and while you are troubling your selves about such a matter, you are but medling with things above your line, and out of your Jurisdiction, while you act in such a Case, for it belongs to his Government to send out Ministers whom and as he will, and to maintain them and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them according to his own pleasure, and all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you, for such Ministers truly called thereunto, and sent of the Lord, will not seek to you to be sent forth or maintained by you, they will not be beholding to you in such a Case, but even without you and contrary to you, must they be sent out and maintained, so that the Lord will have a Ministry in this Nation purely of his own, and not of man, nor by man, and such a Ministry you shall not be able to hinder.</p>
            <p>And I must tell you plainly, as for these men called Ministers in this Nation, the way of their setting up, and sending forth, and the way of their Maintainance, and the way of their standing and defence, and in every particular of their being such; they are the greatest and most wofull oppression in the Nation, even the most abominable and unjust cruelties and tyrannies is acted through them, as any other thing in the Nation, and they are (as such aforesaid) the woful cause of the Nations groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under mercilesse dealing; and there is upon their account the guilt of blood, injustice, and oppression lying upon this Nation; their iniquities, their iniquities cries for vengeance upon their own heads, for they are full, they are full, and the measure thereof is neer finished, and Gods eternal vengeance is their next reward, from the eternal God; what shall I say of them but this, The Earth is oppressed by them, the Inhabitants

groanes under them, and the righteous God is vexed through them, and they are the very men of high indignation and fierce wrath, and all their practices (as such) are the fewel of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to be consumed by the fire of his jealousie; the Nation is wearie and its Inhabitants; and the Lord is wearie because of these men, and is this the Ministery cried up by you as godly and pious, &amp;c? are these the men that the Nation must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to maintain in their pride and idolatrie? is this the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery that must be encouraged? Well, if these be the men, and this the Ministery which must be established and encouraged by you, in so doing you shall never prosper, but thereby gain the displeasure of the Almighty unto you, to bring a curse upon all your doings even because hereof; for I must tell you, the hand of my Lord is against them, and whosoever shall seek to defend them, shall not prosper in their doings, because their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, cruelties, deceits, and abominations are nigh finished and fulfilled; wherefore take heed unto your selves, for this is my Masters advice unto you; let this Ministery alone, and join not your selves to <hi>Baal,</hi> lest you perish; neither take part with Antichrist any longer, neither be yee fighters against the Lamb and his Kingdom, but free the Nation, and let all its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants be freed from the cruel tasks and yoaks of such men and such a Ministery as aforasaid; uphold it not against the Lord, for if you do, you shall never be established: and this is from the mouth of my Lord unto you.</p>
            <p>And last of all, my Master hath a People in this Nation, even a suffering people, that have born the burthen of the cruelty and injustice and wickednesse both of Rulers and Teachers, who hath as it were trodden them down, and made them a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prey to their devouring mouthes; the very crie of their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings hath reached unto heaven, and the very sound thereof your eares have heard; and this People are greatly beloved, and my Lord will assuredly honour them, and his hand shall be continued to preserve them, and defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all their Enemies whatsoever; and hee doth reserve them to himself, and for a glorious work that hee hath to do by them, and hee hath formed them for himself, and they cannot joyne with any of the hornes of the great
