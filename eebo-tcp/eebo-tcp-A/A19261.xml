         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Worſhipfull, and the reſt, I little
thought when I preached this Sermon,
(the rude and undigeſted meditations
of ſome few houres) that it ever
ſhould haue gone further then where you
found it, God is my witnes, I haue
ever beene ſo conſcious to my ſelfe, of ſo much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
diſabilitie, of making any thing of mine owne pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
<pb facs="tcp:9117:3"/>
that I haue ever held it true, <hi>benè qui latuit, benè
vixit,</hi> he liveth contentedly, that liveth retiredly, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my ſelfe happie enough if I could but giue content to
them by my private labours, by whom I liue and haue my
meanes, and maintenance.</p>
            <p>From the Pulpit it is now come to the Preſſe, and had
not ſome of my good friends at home; and other loving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
abroad, earneſtly preſſed and importuned me for
the publication of it, it had ſeene no Sun: but being vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to denie many a thing ſo reaſonable, and hoping it might
be profitable for many, and eſpecially for him, who that day
was the cauſe of ſo great a concourſe and conflux of people) I
haue adventured to preſent that vnto your hands and eyes,
which at the firſt I, onely intended for your eares; though
mine hopes haue failed me, and the ſucceſſe I expected, giue
me but ſmall incouragement, or comfort in it.</p>
            <p>You haue heard I perſwade my ſelfe, ſince I preached
the Sermon, how vildly and vncivilly I haue beene traduced
by him: the thing that I feared is fallen vpon me, I could
looke no better fruit from ſuch à Crab: Men doe not gather
Grapes of Thornes, nor Figs of Thiſtles: Who can expect
ſweete water, from an vnwholeſome fountaine, or a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Odour from a ſtinking Dunghill? but <hi>regium eſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lè
audire,</hi> and my comfort is the teſtimonie of mine owne
conſcience with mee, and for mee, that what then I did or
ſpake, was intended for his good, both <hi>for his humiliation
and for his comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as the beſt meates, received into a foule ſtomack,
turne rather to corruption, and putrifaction, then vnto good
and wholeſome nutriment: ſo is the word <hi>pabulum ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi>
the food of our ſoules, to feede us, and fit us for the
kingdome of heaven; when it is entertained into a wicked
heart: The Bees ſucke hony out of common and courſe flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
when Spiders, and Toads, gather nothing but payſon
out of the beſt and ſweeteſt. The word of God is <hi>alijs odor
vitae ad vitam, alijs odor mortis ad mortem,</hi> as the Apoſtle
<pb facs="tcp:9117:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tels us, 2. <hi>Cor. 2. 16. unto ſome the ſavour of life unto
life, and unto others the ſavour of death unto death:</hi> I am
heartily ſorry it wrought no kindlier, or no better with him.</p>
            <p>And as for my ſelfe, whatſoever his baſenes and unbefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
behaviour hath ſince beene unto mee, I thanke God,
I can as eaſily contemne it, as he obtrude it, with <hi>Socrates</hi>
anſwer onely, as <hi>Laertius</hi> reports it, who being reviled made
no other anſwer, nor was further moved at it, but with <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nè
loqui non didicit,</hi> he had not yet learned to ſpeake well;
I know his tongue is no ſlander: why then ſhould I be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
or diſcontented at any thing invented, or vented by
ſuch a man? <hi>Philip</hi> being told, that the <hi>Graecians</hi> ſpake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
of him, notwithſtanding the much good hee had done
them, and therefore being ſollicited to puniſh them for it;
mildly replyed, <hi>what would they doe, if I ſhould doe them
any hurt? Ego verò ſic vitam inſtituam ut nemo illis ſit
crediturus:</hi> but I will ſo order my life, that no man ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
them, what ſoever evill they ſhall ſpeake of me: I ſay
no more, for my ſelfe, or of him, but <hi>Father forgiue him,</hi>
and <hi>Lord lay not this ſinne unto his charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What my life and converſation hath beene amongſt you,
for now more then twentie and foure yeares, you beſt know,
in whoſe eyes I haue ever lived: who, I preſume, will eaſily
vindicate my reputation from all malevolent and ſcandalous
aſperſions. I appeale vnto you all, how vniuſtly, and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
he hath defamed me. I comfort my ſelfe with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
anſwer to <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> concerning <hi>Shemies</hi> rayling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling
him: <hi>Let him alone, it may be the Lord will looke
on mine affliction, and that the Lord will doe mee good
for his curſing this day: 2 Sam.</hi> 16. 13. and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of that truth of the wiſe man; <hi>The curſe that is cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
ſhall not come. Pro.</hi> 26. 2.</p>
            <p>We uſe to ſay, <hi>they runne farre that never returne:</hi> all
were not called into the vineyard at the firſt houre of the
day; <hi>Some at the third, ſome at the ninth, and ſome at the
eleventh. Mat. 20. 3. &amp;c.</hi> I hope that this Prodigall may
<pb facs="tcp:9117:4"/>
come home againe into himſelfe, and that by the goodneſſe
and mercie of God unto him in Chriſt, hee may be more
carefull of his owne ſalvation, and conſcionable of my good
name and reputation: which God grant. The Lord knoweth
that I neither thought nor meant him ill, in all I ſaid or did:
If I dealt plainely, and and to purpoſe with him, it was the
good of his ſoule, and the diſcharge of my conſcience to God
and men, that I onely aimed at: and if for this I ſhall
be either evilly thought of, or ſpoken of, blame me not if I
be a little moved, pardon me this paſſion, and pittie my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
and ſaue mee what you can, from the laſh of lewd
and ſlandering tongues, we are both ſufficiently knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you and what our liues haue beene amongſt you; Iudge
and ſpare not, which of us two haue moſt offended.</p>
            <p>I haue thus farre preſumed of your loue and favour,
(my kind and loving neighbours) to dedicate theſe my poore
and plaine labours unto you, and unto none but you: for unto
whom ſhould I, or could I giue both my ſelfe and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that little (that Chriſt enabling me, I ſhall be able in
the worke of my miniſtery) next vnto God, then unto you,
amongſt whom for theſe many yeares I haue lived, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably,
and as contentedly, (I bleſſe God for it) as any poore
Miniſter in this Cittie?</p>
            <p>I preſume you will not deny the Patronage and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this worthleſſe worke of mine: you haue ſomewhat ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
through the ſinne of him that ſuffered that day, that
condigne ſhame and puniſhment. I would it had never beene
told in our <hi>Gath,</hi> nor publiſhed in the ſtreets of our <hi>Aska<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
or that ſo bad a Bird had not defiled ſo ſweete a neſt. I
did my beſt to free you all, from either concealing, or conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing
of the ſinne, and gaue them their due that did
their beſt to haue it puniſhed; whoſe paines to that purpoſe
may iuſtly callenge a thank full remembrance from us all:
Refuſe not to countenance his paines, that did what he could
to maintaine your honour.</p>
            <p>I haue hitherto bleſſed God, and reioyced in your libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
<pb facs="tcp:9117:4"/>
your many favours, from many of you in private, from
moſt of you in publicke, ſhall ever oblige mee unto you all,
in all thankefull loue and obſervancie: Adde I pray unto the
great heape of your former beneficencie, a favourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of theſe few leaues of my weake labours; It is a
Childe that was both begotten and borne in your Pariſh, I
hope it ſhall not find the leſſe favour for the Fathers ſake.</p>
            <p>You haue beene I am ſure, and ſtill are (as I thinke)
at this time alſo, at the care and coſt of keeping ſome poore
mens children: what this may coſt you I cannot tell: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
I perſwade my ſelfe, you will not ſee it ſtarve in
the ſtreetes. <hi>Silver and Gold haue I none,</hi> but ſuch as it is,
it is onely yours; and ſo is hee, that living and dying reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to be an humble petitioner unto the throne of Grace,
for the happines and proſperitie of you all, here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
<hi>Now the very God of peace ſanctifie you wholy,
and I pray God your whole Spirit, and Soule and Body,
be preſerved blameleſſe unto the comming of the
Lord Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo it becommeth him to

I ſuppoſe that happily it might be for
theſe ſeverall cauſes and reaſons. Firſt the church

            </p>
            <p>But the chiefe and principall cauſe as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture,

            </p>
            <p>Two things amongſt many make the wicked

bold and preſumptuous to fal vpon any ſinne with
greedineſſe. Hope that their ſinne ſhall not bee
ſeene, and ſecondly weakeneſſe in authoritie, if
found out and taken with it, It often hapneth that
as other ſinners, ſo <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers,</hi>
are ſo cloſe and cunning in their vncleaneſſe, that
the moſt vigilant and obſervaut eye of authoritie
can take no notice or knowledge of it, it is a
peece of the miſtery of their iniquitie, and a
tricke in that blacke Art, <hi>Si non caſtè tamen cautè,</hi>
if they can be but ſecret they thinke they are ſafe

is weakenes of authority, when either thoſe
that would may not, or thoſe that may, doe not,

over-top authoritie, by being greater or better,
either by their perſons, or places, or purſes, then
the Magiſtrate: for this is not alwaies or alone the

            </p>
            <p>There is a two fold kind of iudging given to God,

a iudgement of abſolution and another of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
the firſt is <hi>gratiae,</hi> the other <hi>irae:</hi> that
comfortable, this other terrible: The iudgement
of abſolution is onely for ſuch which after ſinne
committed, haue heartily repented and humbled
themſelues to God, and through <hi>Chriſt</hi> haue made
their peace with God, for whoſe onely ſake, they
haue their pardon ſealed, and heare no more of
them, but ſome ſweete wordes of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
like that of <hi>Nathan to David,</hi>

               <hi>Dominus tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulit

godly iudged, and none thus but theſe</p>
            <p>The other kind of iudging is a iudgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnatorie,
binding ouer all remorſles and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
ſinners, to all thoſe temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
plagues and puniſhments, which God the
righteous Iudge hath not onely nominated and
threatned, but vndoubtedly ſhalbe inflicted as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
as threatned. And of this kind of iudging
onely is this in the text intended, thus <hi>Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and adulterers God will iudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A terrible ſaying, but a true: A word of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
and amaſement, like that hand writing
which appeared to <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> on the wall, at the
very ſight whereof, before he knew what it might
be or meant,<note n="f" place="margin">Dan. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>his countenance was changed, his

               <hi>they both gaue vp
the Ghoſt and died.</hi> As much amaſement well may
this word cauſe in <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers,</hi> to
deterre them from this ſinne, for God will iudge
them.</p>
            <p>But if God be purpoſed to iudge ſuch beaſtly
livers, where, when, or how, will ſome man aske,
will God effect it? I anſwer for the time, that is
in his owne appointing, and at his owne pleaſure:
ſooner or later or whenſoever he liſteth: onely let
ſuch know that firſt or laſt at one time or an other,
God hath appointed a day in which he will iudge

in that <hi>Honorable</hi> and <hi>Worſhipfull</hi> preſence at

               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, and with
no worſe heart then he, you would haue enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
your tongue, whatſoever you would haue
done with your handes, and promiſed to reſtore
foure-fold as he did.</p>
            <p>But wordes will not carry it. Good trees are
knowen by their fruits and not by their leaues,
and good <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not by their wordes, but by
their liues. I will not wonder to ſee light eares
of corne to prike and peare vp themſelues, aboue
all in the furrowes or field, not to heare an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
caske to make the greateſt noiſe: I ſhould
thinke my ſelfe an happie man, if I might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to take you at your word, in the meane

world or (wiſe men at the leaſt) will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it, till they ſee it, and till then, you ſhall
ſhew ſome wiſdome to ſay leſſe and doe more,
be not verball in your purpoſes and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but reall and royall in your performances.</p>
            <p>Let me tell you plaine, what I thinke, and that
is this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue run your ſelfe mightily in debt
by this your ſin, &amp; vnto divers, which muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
or you muſt lie by it a while, and die for
it at the laſt. I ſpeake not of your purſe or charge
before your filthineſſe was found out, while you
lived cloſely in vncleaneſſe; I haue heard, then
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9117:24"/>
you were baſe and fordid enough, perhaps ſo
provident as to provide ſomething againſt a rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
day: I ſpeake not of your expenſes in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
or other priſons whither you haue beene
moſt iuſtly committed by Authoritie: I know
you are not behind hand for paying theſe ſcores,
theſe you haue cleared.</p>
            <p>But ſome other Creditors haue entred actions
againſt you, and will be paid before you can be
diſcharged.</p>
            <p>What doe you thinke you owe to God, whom
you haue ſo highly diſhonored in the violation
and tranſgreſſion of that ſacred and holy Law of
his, peremptorily forbidding the ſinne of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſſe.
Item to the world, I meane not by the
world, ſuch as your ſelfe, ſuch as loue filthines
as well as your ſelfe: for I know that birdes of a
feather will fly together, thoſe that runne with
you to the ſame exceſſe of riot, will eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
you, and not ſtand with you, if it were a
greater matter then this: but I ſpeake of thoſe
that profeſſe <hi>Religion</hi> in truth and ſinceritie; and
ſo cannot but hate this ſinne whereſoever they
finde it, here you haue drawen bloud, and that
will beare an action, and muſt be anſwered, you
haue wounded <hi>Religion,</hi> given iuſt cauſe to the
ſonnes of<note n="g" place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Cham,</hi> to laugh at your nakedneſſe,
and as <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>David,</hi> by this deed, you
haue given great occaſion to the enemies of God
to blaſpheme. What ſatiſfaction can you ever
make to that ſervant of yours, who by your baſe
and beaſtly fornication with her, came to a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9117:24"/>
ſhamefull and vntimely death? Bleſſed had you
both beene, if you had never ſeene each others
faces, for had ſhee never knowne your face, nor
you her body, you might perhaps (I ſay verely
perhaps) haue proved a better huſband then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and ſhe lived in time to haue beene a wife
for as good a man as your ſelfe: ſhe loſt her life;
and living and dying helpt to ſaue yours, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
not by what meanes, ſhee was wrought &amp;
brought to it: the Law was ſatiſfied and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
            <p>What ſatiſfaction can you make to God or
the world, for the bloud of that ſweete new borne
babe, murthered and made away by her, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it aliue, by ſome ſecret conveyance into the
houſe of office, (an office fit for a whore and no
mother) I do not ſay nor charge you to be privie
to the putting of it into the privie; I ſhall leaue
that to God and your owne conſcience, who (if
you were) will not goe behind your backe, when
time ſhall ſerue to tell you of it; I iudge you not,
you were acquitted from the Law of man, God
grant you may come off as faire with God, that
he may never lay this ſinne vnto your charge.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſt of all, what ſatiſfaction can you make, to
this place and pariſh where you lived of late, and
a little too long? What diſhonour haue you
done vs, in bringing this diſgrace, and caſting
this aſperſion on vs? What favours haue you
had ſucceſſiuely amongſt vs? How often haue
you beene invited to our publicke feaſtings?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9117:25"/>
How vſually called to our counſels &amp; meetings?
How preferred to ſeverall places of offices with
vs? And after all this, to reward vs thus; to caſt
this filth in our faces, to leaue this ſtinke behind
you is baſe ingratitude: it muſt needs be a bad
bird that thus defiles her owne neſt: we can
count you no better, you haue vſed vs ſo badly:
we ſhall be willing to pray for your well doing
elſe-where, but not for your dwelling here, till
you be a little ſweeter.</p>
            <p>Shall I tell you in a word or two, how you
may make all well? I would ſet you this way, if
I were worthy to be your guide. Firſt begin with
God, and make your peace with him: as <hi>Elihu</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And there can be no peace to be had with
God, but by hearty humiliation, and ſincere and
