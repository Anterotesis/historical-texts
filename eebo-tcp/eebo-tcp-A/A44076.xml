            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I May ſay of the Seamens Miſeries as Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were contriv'd to be Ruin'd by wicked, curſed <hi>Haman;</hi> that if they and their Families had been ſold for Bondmen and Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, I might have held my peace, although the Adverſary and Enemy could not have Recompenc'd our Gracious King <hi>William</hi>'s and the Nation's Damage; but to be deſtroyed, die and periſh, in ſuch dreadful Numbers, more than the World ever ſaw, without ſighting; and ſo many of their Families Ruined in their Pay alſo, are two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable miſeries, and I fear doth cry aloud in the Ears of the Lord of Hoſt, who hath ſent ſuch dreadful Loſs of Shipping and Merchandize this laſt Year, ſince I repreſented their Groans before in part, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>England</hi> never groaned under the like; and I am afraid, in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that God will not always let the poor and Miſerable be mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without either helping of them, or conſidering their Caſe; And if there be an Hundred Thouſand Pound or more wickedly gotten out of Ruined, Sick and Dead Seamens Pay, I fear the Publick hath loſt above Three Hundred Thouſand Pound Cuſtom, and the Nation above Three Millions of Riches this year; and Ruining, <hi>alias</hi> Running the Seamen out of their Pay, with the two fatal Letters, <hi>Q.

                  </gap>des of their Families, may not provoke God in Judgment to ſend us ſuch another Year's Loſs as this laſt hath been. The Nation, I fear, will groan under it, if God ſhould ſcourge us ſo again; and then it may be, it will be thought worth while to conſider what ſhould be the Reaſon that the <hi>French,</hi> with ſix or eight Ships, ſhould be ſo wiſe as to meet our <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Ships in three or Four ſeveral places, ſo exactly, to take them home to <hi>France,</hi> as if they had been the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, and waited carefully for them; and many of our Ships, only to receive double Pay, and keep the Seamen on Board Ship all the War, until we have loſt more men than would Man all our Fleet together, if alive;</p>
               <p>And we having about 160 Ships in Pay this Year, it is a little ſtrange, and they not Ten Ships in a Body, and yet they know where to meet our <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Ships, and our <hi>Weſt India</hi> Ships, and our <hi>Gninea</hi> Ships; and this is fatal to <hi>England,</hi> that ſeems to be under the Judgment of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59.10. <hi>We grope for the Wall, like the Blind; we grope as if we had no Eyes; we ſtumble at Noou Doy as in the Night; we are in deſolate places, as dead men.</hi> And God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver theſe Nations from what is mentioned in the Four Verſes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Another dreadful Miſery attending the Two Firſt, is, many Ships having had their Number of Men buried two or three times over before they are paid; and ſome have had their Number of Men, Eight or Ten times over, before they are paid, as I can prove by ſeveral Ship's Books, if occaſion be; for if I know my own Heart, I dare not aſſert any thing but ſuch as my Conſcience will witneſs, to the beſt of my Underſtanding, to be Truth, and what may, the moſt material part, be proved by the King's Books, and the others by the dreadful Experience of multitudes of miſerable people. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Another Miſery is, that there is ten or twenty Thouſand knows not where to find their Relations, (dead, or gone out of ſeveral Ships, as by the Ships Books will appaar.) Who are now looking after their Money, except it may be ſome times thoſe Curſed Plagues of the Seamen, the Cheats, and Ticket-buyers, and Purſers, and Knaves that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together, to have Two or Three Hundred Pounds Raiſed in a Ship, as hath been made appear. But <hi>how ſad is it for the poor Widows, or Relations, of thoſe that carned their Money, to have them preſt from one Ship to another, until they do not know where to find them, or when they died.</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49746:5"/>And it is to be feared there is Ten Thouſand Seamen more dead this War in the King's Service than can be proved by the King'e Books; ſome receiving their money by Letters of Attorney, after they are dead, to ſave Adminiſtring; and as I ſaid, many being never enquired after at all, looks as If they were dead.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is another miſery, by being turned from Ship to Ship, and not paid; and ſo the Captain of the Laſt Ship commands their Tickets from them for the other Ship, and carrieth them away to the <hi>Straits,</hi> or where he pleaſes, that the poor miſerablk Seamen have not liberty to have a Penny of money for their Tickets, to buy themſelves Cloaths, or their Families Bread; And it may be the other Ships they came out of are paid in the mean time, and their Wives or Friends loſe their Payment at <hi>Broadſtreet,</hi> becauſe the Captains are at Sea, and have their Tickets; and whether ever the Seamen groaned under theſe miſeries before, I know not.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When the poor miſerable Wretches come from the <hi>Straits,</hi> as many did lately, and the Captains give them their Tickets again, they have not one Days liberty and freedom from the Preſs, to come up and look after any money for them; and ſome men are paid off in the laſt Ship, and yet have money due in 2 or 3 other Ships, and not one days liberty to ſhew their Heads to get a Penny for the ſame. But if any Curſed Ticket-Buyer meets them, it may be they muſt ſell them their Pay due in a Ship or Two before, at near half loſs: And this War hath been the greateſt Encouragement to Extortioners and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains to Cheat the King, and to Ruin the Seamen, that ever was in the World, if my Underſtanding fail me not. And again,</p>
               <p n="11">11. This Ruining ſo many Thouſands of Seamen, hath been a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Neceſſity to help Ruin the reſt, either in their Pay, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, or by their totally loſing all their Pay, that are made Run, and have no Friends to look after it; For I can ſhew under the Hands and Seals of near Thirty in one Ship, that are made Run in other Ships, or in their own where they are ſtill; and they did deſire to have the Books ſearched, why, or when they were made Run: But that would not be admitted without Petitioning; and the Men cannot have leave to come up to Petition; and ſo their Pay may be loſt until Dooms Day. But whether the Nation will thrive the better, God knows. Indeed we thrived better when we beat the <hi>French:</hi> But after that the Seamens miſeries came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> thick and Threefold, as may be ſeen in the laſt part of my Book: And how we have thrived ſince, let the <hi>Smir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> Fleet, and the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Ruines, and <hi>Weſt India</hi> and <hi>Guinea</hi> Loſſes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49746:6"/>ſpeak; For I believe God would have the Nation conſider what he ſpeaks by them. And,</p>
               <p n="12">12. Another miſery to the Nation is, That as Capt. <hi>St. Lo</hi> hath publiſhed to the Parliament, and to all the World in Print, that it coſt the Nation above Five Hundred Thouſand Pound a Year, the not paving off our great Ships every Year, and yet he faith we might have a Winter Squadron beſides, of fifteen Third Rates, and fourteen Fourth Raſes, beſides all our Fifth and Sixth Rates, and that would be Money ſaved.</p>
               <p n="13">And 13. The ſaid Capt. <hi>St. Lo,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners of the Navy, hath publiſhed, as aforeſaid, That it coſt the Eing, beſides about ſixty thouſand Pound the Year preſſing men; and if there be preſt Ten Thouſand Men in a Year, it coſt the King, by that Rule, fix pound a Man for preſſing of the ſaid Ten Thouſand Men.</p>
               <p n="14">14. He ſaith, That the Colliers give 7 or 8 <hi>l.</hi> a man for Seamen, by Reaſon of the Preſs; which before they did uſe to have for 30 s, and likewiſe do ſometimes give 30 or 40 s, a man for men to bring them up the River; and if ſo, then I ſuppoſe I may modeſtly Judge, that the Collier-Trade, and Coaſting Trade of <hi>England,</hi> is at much more than an Hundred Thouſand Pound the Year extraordinary Charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Preſs. And,</p>
               <p n="15">15. It may be modeſtly ſuppoſed, That if there be Forty Thouſand Seamen more imployed in the Merchants ſervice for other Voyages, and they have about 30 <hi>l.</hi> the Year a peice, which is 50 s. <hi>per</hi> month; and they uſe to fail for 30; then there is 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Year extraordinary charge for every man in the Merchants ſervice; and that is Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Eighty Thouſand Pound the Year extraordinary charges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Ruin and ſcarcity of Seamen, and becauſe of the Preſs. And alſo the Merchant Ships are forced ſtill, for to ſupply the Ruin, Deſtruction, Death and Loſs of the Seamen in the King's Ships.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Whereas had the Seamen in the King's Ships been preſerved, incouraged and increaſed, as it could not have been modeſtly comput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but they ſhould have increaſed 30 or 40000 Men this War, if they had been paid off every Year, as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> do, and their Lives ſaved on ſhoar; and this Million of Money ſaved every Year, would have been an help to <hi>England,</hi> towards our Loſſes. But,</p>
               <p n="17">17. If the <hi>French</hi> ſave Five Millions of Money this War (that we waſt) and have got (as it may be feared) Ten Millions of Shipping and Riches from us, this muſt at Seven Years end be a ſad difference; but in the end of my Book, I have ſhewed, how Purſer <hi>Maidman</hi>

               <p n="19">19. This way of management hath been alſo very fatal to many Tradeſmen and Inhabitants in this City and Suburbs, concerned with Seamen; for the Seamen are not ſafe one Day from the Preſs to ſhew their Heads, after they are Paid, if it were to ſave their Health, and Lives, and Money. And thus in Fifty Thouſand Merchant Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men kept from coming to <hi>London,</hi> and about Forty Thouſand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in Men of War, and Tenders, and paid moſt part on Board, it may be modeſtly computed the Tradeſmen and Inhabitants of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> have loſt ſeveral Years the taking of near a Million of Money a Year, at Ten Pound a Man, for Cloaths and Victuals, and all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences for to ſit them again to <hi>Sea,</hi> to ſerve his Majeſty freely; and many of them from laying out all their Money in Goods, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home to <hi>Scotland</hi> to their Friends.

               </p>
               <p n="20">20. And what a Miſery it is to have our <hi>Seamen</hi> ſo dwindled away as the Government, to be forced at ſeven Years end, to preſs, and hawl, and tear <hi>Seamen</hi> from all Merchant Ships coming home, and all over the City of <hi>London</hi> and Suburbs, and very many Watermen, and the Collier-Trade to boot; and that with more violence now, when they have not Eight of their Enemies in a Body this Year, and yet to be at more trouble to get Men for to fit out half a dozen Ships now, then was to ſit out the whole Fleet, when they were well paid, before they beat the <hi>French;</hi> and yet, though this work of Preſſing hath been almoſt all this Year, yet the ſcarcity of <hi>Searen</hi> hath been ſuch, that we have had Four or Five of our biggeſt Ships lain ſeveral Months not Mann'd enough to go out to <hi>Sea.</hi> And,</p>

And they that can think they will ever come chearfully again into the Service, muſt have a ſtronger Belief than mine; whereas many of them ſaid, had they had but one Month's liberty to have ſpent their Money free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they would have as freely gone into the Service again. But not to have one Fourteen Days liberty, now at 7 Years end, for thoſe poor Souls that eſcape with their Lives, ſeems to me to be miſerable miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, deplorably miſerable: And whereas, had they been paid off yearly, and had liberty on Shoar, and their Lives preſerved, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Seamen we might in reaſon have expected to have had to ſpare, and ſave many hundred thouſand Pound <hi>per</hi> Year, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.

If our Seamen be ſo ſcarce, and ſo deſtroy'd, when our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Fleet is all laid up, it may be inquired what we ſhall want when their Fleet is all out. And if all our Ship's Books be examin'd, what we have now, and what number will be needful to fill them up with Men, it will be found to be near fifteen Thouſand Men, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the extraordinary charge of ſome Millions of Money for time paſt: And if thoſe in the Service now, be never ſuffered to ſee their Families or Relations, it may be conſidered by all thinking Men, how thoſe who do grow up for time to come, will ever be incourag'd to come into the Service of the Nation, ſo freely as others have done formerly; ſeeing thoſe that come into the publick Service, muſt reſolve to renounce Wife and Family.</p>
               <p n="24">24. It may be inquired, if Men are turn'd from Ship to Ship, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they are Sick, and then ſet on Shoar for cure, and there dye, and be then <hi>Qd.</hi> or <hi>Rd.</hi> out of their Pay; how in this caſe it can be ſafe, to be in the Service of the Nation, for time to come, or for any Tradeſmen to truſt them that are therein, if there be not care taken to ſecure the Pay of thoſe who are ſo miſerably turned over from Ship to Ship, until fallen ſick, and ſo ſent on Shoar, and ſo dye, and Runn'd out of their Pay.</p>

               <p n="26">27. If ſome are kept a Year, or more, before they are Relieved, whoſe caſe is juſt, then it may be conſidered, how very unjuſt and cruel it muſt be to delay Juſtice to them. And to prove the many Cruelties and Injuſtices put on Ruined Seamen, thoſe Certificates and Affidavits (laid up in the Navy-Office) of thoſe who are Relieved, will be ſufficient witneſs; beſides the many Thouſands whoſe dreadful caſe is ſuch, that can get no Relief.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And if Sixty Thouſand of the miſerable Seamen are Run out of their Pay, as by the ſeveral Ships Books will appear, this may admit of a double ſerious Conſideration: one of which God in Juſtice will require of the Nation; let it be paſſed over as ſlightly as it will, by thoſe who have all along helped to ruin our Loyal Seamen and their Families; and that is, How many are unjuſtly, and cruelly, and ſhamefully, and unmercifully Run out of their Pay?

               <p>And to be plain, this kind of ſtewing to death in Ships, tho it have been, it may be ten times more fatal to the Seamen than fighting; yet it is not ſuch a Death as the Seamen expect or love; and it is a death of no profit to the Nation; it weakens, and is the way to Ruin our Seamen, but kills not one Enemy. If Forty Thouſand of our Seamen be turn'd from Ship to Ship, until they die, this killeth not one Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but if they loſe their Lives in ſight, they do uſually kill a greater Number of their Enemies, and that is ſomething of Comfort; and their Wives, or Aged Parents, uſe to get Bounty-money, and not be baſely run out of their Pay, after they are dead: And I muſt faithfully declare my Opinion, that they that would hide the dreadful Ruin and Deſtruction of the Ten Times Ten Thouſand Seamen Ruined in their Health, Lives and Pay, and would not let his Majeſty, and the Two moſt Honourable Houſes of Parliament know the Truth of their Miſery and Deſtruction, are Enemies to God, to the King, to the Nation, to common Juſtice and Equity; yea, to common Moral Honeſty and prudent Policy; For the Seamen of <hi>England</hi> muſt be made uſe of as long as <hi>England</hi> is an Iſland, both in Peace and War; and there is not one Soul in <hi>England</hi> ſafe, in Life and Eſtate, if our Seamen were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: And if by our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf, it was declared to be a damnable thing of thoſe who ſhould be bid to depart at the Laſt Day, as accurſed, that did not give meat to the Hungry, and drink to the Thirſty, and Clothes to the Naked and Strangers, and Viſits to the Sick; then I would appeal to all Mankind, how much more a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing it muſt be, inſtead of giving, to take away the Bread from the Hungry, or be ſo unmerciful to the Strangers and Widows, to run them out of their Pay wrongfully, and then make them wait a Year or Eighteen Months for Juſtice, and pawn ſome of thoſe Clothes that ſhould help to cover their Nakedneſs, to help them while they petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and give 5 s. a peice to a Fellow or two ſet to take in their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and get them anſwered, as many have done; I do really declare I have ſometimes thought that <hi>Dives</hi>'s Dogs might be ſeveral Degrees kinder to poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> than ſuch Fellows are to poor Ruined Seamens Wives; for they Kindly licked his Sores; and did not ſnap and ſnarl at him, and tear his Clothes off his back; and beſides, <hi>Lazarus</hi> came to beg mercy, theſe come to ask but Juſtice; and that which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſmart for, I fear, by ſome ſeverer ſtrokes, if they have it not; and in plain honeſt love to our gracious King <hi>William,</hi> and good Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt; and to Honeſty and Policy, I will declare my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion faithfully, That if there be not wiſer, or honeſter Tools to be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49746:9"/>found in <hi>England,</hi> than thoſe who on the one hand help to Ruin, or have helped to Ruin ſo many Scores of Thouſands of Seamen in their Lives or Pay; and on the other hand, have not either Wit enough or Honeſty enough to have our extraordinary Rich Merchant Ships wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for as carefully, with all our many Scores of Men of War, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them home to <hi>England,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> can do with Eight or Ten Ships to ſecure them home to <hi>France.</hi> I ſay, in ſhort, if there be not better Tools, God Almighty knows when there will be better work; For our Caſe is like to be ſad, and I would ſay as Chriſt did to the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> concerning St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Miniſtry (tho in another Caſe), <hi>If our Loſſes be from Heaven, they are dreadful; and if from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>en, they are ſhameful and ſcandalous, and ruining and miſerable:</hi> And if, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>a little Leaven will leaven the whole Lump;</hi> then the Almighty God knoweth in what places or Nations a man or two in half a Score, may poyſon, miſlead and befool all the reſt. And now I think of this, there is a place of Scripture comes into my mind, concerning <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, that God did threaten them to <hi>do a marvellous work, and a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> Iſa. 29.14, 25. <hi>For the wiſdom of the wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the Prudent ſhall be hid: and woe to them that ſeek deep to hide their Counſel from the Lord: and their works are in the dark; and they ſay, who ſeeth us, and who knoweth us.</hi> And indeed, to make no Application (wanting parts) I muſt leave it to the Wiſe and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Judge of the meaning of this place, and that before mentioned, <hi>of groping as the blind that have no eyes.</hi> And indeed in <hi>England</hi> we have a kind of a Proverb, <hi>That there is none ſo blind as they that will not ſee.</hi> And if that be a true ſaying, there's certainly much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the King's being cheated, when they that ſhould ſee to have it puniſhed, do all they can to have it ſmuggled up, as ſome in Offices of the Navy Concerns have been publickly accuſed to do in the buſineſs of ſtealing the King's Stores at <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> and if our Ships that are in the King's Service, cannot ſee the <hi>French</hi> in a great while, when in the mean time a Merchant Ship is not ſafe to go 40 Leagues on our own Coaſt, but is in danger to ſee a <hi>French</hi> Ship, and be taken, which hath been a great Riddle to me all this War; and I have wondred at it, and have conſulted how another Nation might be ſo ſerved; and my Reaſon tells me, they might be ſo ſerved ſeveral ways, as one is by giving Men of War Command to lye in ſuch and ſuch a place, and not to Cruiſe all over the Channel; and in the mean time, if people had a continual Correſpondence with their Enemy from a Sea-Port Town, as <hi>Deip</hi> may be in <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Rye</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> then if the one Nation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49746:9"/>did know the ſtation of the Ships of the other Nation, they might ply up and down in other parts free and ſafe; and if a Ship or two come almoſt into the Harbours, and takes away a <hi>Prize,</hi> and there be a Man of War or two, there ready to go out after them, yetif the Commanders of the Men of War will not go out after them, as a Captain or Two would not lately, either for want of Will or want of Orders, at <hi>Margate</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> then the Enemies Ships may be ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. And indeed, I have many times thought, That when Thieves come ſo near the Houſe, it is very dangerous to have any of their Friends within doors: And it may be ſometimes they have too many, the more the pity. But I wondred at one thing, which is, of all the Intelligence that is carried to and again from <hi>Rye</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> I knew but one Commander that was ſet to catch them, that took any, and that was Capt. <hi>Grantham,</hi> and he took the Owler that carried over that Mournful News to <hi>England,</hi> and Joyful News to <hi>France,</hi> laſt Year, of her moſt gracious Majeſty's Death, before it was publickly known in <hi>England,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Grantham</hi> was preſently turned ont of his Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, as he ſaid, <hi>The Lords of our Admiralty never ſent him word what it was for.</hi> And indeed, if it were to pleaſe the people of <hi>Rye,</hi> or thoſe Sea-Port Towns, they ought in Gratitude and Thankfulneſs to acknowledge their Lordſhips Kindneſs, and endeavour to make them amends. But it ſeems Capt. <hi>Grantham</hi> never was ſent for, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever went to enquire the Cauſe; and he is not a beggarly Fellow to cry <hi>Peccavi,</hi> for taking the Owler, or examining her Men ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (if that were his Crime:) and whether there were another Owler taken before, all this War, I know not, or whether there were Men ſet to watch, that would not, or could not ſee them.</p>
               <p>But for the people of <hi>Rye,</hi> or any other Town or place, if they do correſpond with <hi>France,</hi> and do help to betray us, in my mind, they are worſe than Beaſts, to betray their Native Countrey; for, as the Scripture faith, <hi>The Ox knoweth his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſter's Cribb;</hi> ſo none but worſe than Beaſts would betray ſuch a brave Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as ours is, into the hands of the worſt of mankind, that hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally plagued the Chriſtian World, and deſtroyed more Hundreds of Thouſands of Men, and more Hundreds of Towns and Cities, and more of the Proteſtant Religion, in Twenty Five Years, than the <hi>Turks</hi> have done this Hundred Years. And this may be plainly known by thoſe who are converſant in the Hiſtory of this laſt hundred years, and the Weekly Villany of the <hi>French</hi> for this Twenty Five Years: And I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49746:10"/>cannot with my Eyes and Spectacles, ſee how the biggeſt Traytor and Villain in <hi>England</hi> can ſecure to himſelf Two pence of what he hath, if our Seamen were Ruined, and the <hi>French</hi> prevail over us; For if an <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or a <hi>Popiſh,</hi> or <hi>French Rogue,</hi> or <hi>Jeſuit</hi> comes, he may diſpoſſes thoſe that were their greateſt Friends; and the <hi>French</hi> King cannot be expected to be kinder to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than he was to his own Loving <hi>Proteſtant Subjects,</hi> who did help to keep him in the Throne when his Uncle would have put him by, for being a Baſtard; and yet, like an ungrateful Wretch, he hath Ruined them, in their Religion and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates more effectually than all the bloody butchering <hi>Perſecutors</hi> ever did; and his Dragoons hath out-done all the Heathen Tyrants in the World, for Rooting out Religion effectually: And therefore I do look on his Friends in <hi>England</hi> to be void of Grace and Reaſon, and Honeſty and Policy, and common Senſe. And ſo much for that.</p>
               <p>But I had almoſt forgot the Remainder of our Seamens Groans; for I think I may in the next place,</p>
               <p n="28">28. Repreſent in part the dreadful miſery, in their being turn'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many Hundred times, to the Loſs of their Pay, in their dreadful waiting, till they meet with thoſe fatal plagues of the Seamen, the Ticket Extortioners, who have ſwallowed up a great deal of their pay at half Loſs, to the ſhame of the very Name of Common Moral Heathen Honeſty, and which will certainly cry for Vengeance, if thoſe oppreſſed be not relieved; for by this turning men over, as I ſaid, ſo many Hundred Thouſand times, it cauſeth many Hundred Thouſand of Extraordinary Troubles in their waiting; and many poor and wretched Seamen have been removed into three or four Ships in ſix or eight months time; and it often falls out, that one of thoſe payments due, if it be but for thirty or forty ſhillings, is paid part one year, and part another; ſo that if their poor Wives, or Relations, wait a year or two, as they oft times do, for the firſt payment, then they are liable to wait another year for the ſecond part of the ſaid thirty or forty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings due at the ſame time to the Seamen in the ſaid Ship, as the King's Books will make appear; only it may be Twenty Shillings before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> and Ten Shillings after; or it may be Fifteen Shillings before <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas,</hi> and Sixteen Shillings after; and it is ſo managed, that the Ships having not any ſet days appointed to pay ſuch a Ship, (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it falls out) they expect a Ship will be paid next week, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is a month; or next day, and it is a Week or Fortnight, and all theſe help to plague and torment the poor Ruined Seamens Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49746:10"/>who in Five Hundred Thouſand Turnings over, may be forced to wait, ſuppoſe but Ten Days for each payment, is Five Millions of Trouble; which would be ſaved, if the Seamen were, as formerly, kept to their Ships a Year or two, and then paid. But now another dreadful miſery is, by this turning over: It is common to protend to pay a Ship, and it may be there is left Nine Months in hand; and perhaps not fifty men in that Ship hath money due ſo long: But they that have a year, or two years, or more pay due, are turn'd into other Ships; and when I think of the Seamens miſeries this War, if I were to repreſent them at large, I might write a Volume as big as a Church Bible; therefore what I have written, or can write, is like a painted Fire on a Wall, they and their Families feel the Heat of the devouring Flames, in their Lives and pay; and it may be ſome will, to paliate the buſineſs, ſay, <hi>That it is ſubject to all men to die.</hi> Now to that I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is true; and I have ſuppos'd the dying of people in the Bills of Mortality; wherein ſuppoſe there dieth Twenty Five Thouſand in a year, which is the moſt; and there be a Million of people in all, it is but one in Forty; and many Count the City more ſickly than the Countrey; and if ſo, it is but the whole Number of people dead in Forty Years, which is about a ſixth part every Seven Years. But our Sea-Affairs, by the Ships Books, will prove, that there hath been more buried in Seven Years than the Honourable Houſe of Commons hath reckoned will man the whole Fleet the next Year; and yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not above one in twenty, with ſighting againſt their Enemies: And except thoſe two or three thouſand poor Seamen dead in <hi>France;</hi> the reſt are all dead among thoſe that ſhould be their Friends, and by their Death have not hurt one of their Enemies.</p>
               <p>And now I ſpeak of thoſe who die in <hi>France,</hi> I will mention one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and deplorable miſery more.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Of the moſt dreadful Number of Seamen taken into <hi>France</hi> in men of War and Merchant Ships, loſt this War, thoſe who eſcaped with their Lives, and were brought back to <hi>Plymouth</hi> again, thoſe poor Souls had not one penny of money, nor a Rag of Cloaths, but ſuch Louſie ones as the <hi>French</hi> gave them, were forced to beg or ſtarve to <hi>London;</hi> and if they periſh on the Road, as the Lord knoweth who hath, and who hath not: But beg or ſtarve is generally the Word; and when they come to <hi>London,</hi> here they muſt have no money, nor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49746:11"/>cloaths, but wait Orders what Ship to go into next, naked as they came. And if the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> will truſt them for cloaths, they may; but if they do, they muſt expect to be threatned to be ſhot, or have their Boats ſtaved at the Ships ſides at <hi>Pay-Day,</hi> if they go for their money, or come to bring Cloaths to ſell the Seamen, which is a common practice of late. So that the dreadful miſery of the Seamen, as I ſaid before, begets more miſeries; For if they have not money nor Cloaths before, nor cannot be ſupplied at <hi>Pay-Day,</hi> this is adding miſery to miſery: And another thing I would obſerve by the way, That before the giving about Sixty Thouſand pound a Year to the Double-pay Officers, under whoſe management (it ſeems) the Nation hath loſt near an Hundred Ships: I ſay, before that, the Seamen ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into <hi>France,</hi> had the Forty ſhillings a peice his moſt gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty uſed to allow them, when taken in the men of War, which is now denied, and taken away from them; which makes me wonder what is the real meaning of that ſaying of the Wiſe King <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 22.16. <hi>He that oppreſſeth the Poor to increaſe his Riches, and he that giveth to the Rich, ſhall ſurely come to want.</hi> Now this Text is fit for the Learned to conſider of, whether the Ruining, and Running our Seamen out of their pay, after they have been turn'd from Ship to Ship, until they fall ſick, and then ſent on ſhore, and there die, with ſeveral other miſeries thrown upon them, be the way to increaſe our Riches any more than giving double <hi>Pay</hi> to many that it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw a Gun fired in Anger this whole War.</p>
               <p>And another Miſery on ſome poor <hi>Seamen,</hi> or ſmall Officers is, If a Man be a ſmall Officer, though it be but 30 or 40 Shillings <hi>per</hi> Month, and have ſeveral Lodgers that he hath Fed and Clothed, when they had no Money, if they leave a power for the Friend or Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, to receive their <hi>Pay,</hi> it ſhall not be paid, becauſe he is a ſmall Officer; though by the way, thoſe ſmall Officers that never had an opportunity to Cheat the King, and the <hi>Seamen,</hi> in their Tickets and <hi>Pay;</hi> theſe have no double <hi>Pay,</hi> neither a <hi>Penny</hi> more than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And yet, if any poor Widow in <hi>Scotland</hi> deſires one of theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of 30 or 40 <hi>Shillings</hi> a Month, to receive her dead Husband's Money, it ſhall not be paid, which to me ſeems to be a puniſhing the Righteous with the wicked, which <hi>Abraham</hi> did believe God himſelf would not ſerve the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> And,</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49746:11"/>
               <p n="30">30. Another way of depriving poor, miſerable, ruined <hi>Seamen</hi> of their <hi>Pay</hi> is, though they are diſcharged fairly, by reaſon of Sickneſs or Diſtraction, and ſtand fair in the Ships Book, and have Tickets given them, regularly Signed by all the Officers, to receive their Money, yet if the Commiſſioner will pleaſe but to ask they that have theſe powers and Tickets, where ſuch a Man is, or in what Ship, and they do not know? As who can tell where a Man is a Year or two after he is diſcharged, (when it may be he has been in ſeveral Ships,) then the Commiſſioner will not pay one <hi>Penny</hi> of the poor Man's <hi>Pay;</hi> ſo that if the management of the <hi>Seamens Pay</hi> be examined, I am afraid it will be found to be all Will and Pleaſure, <hi>alias</hi> all Arbitrary: And, indeed, many Thouſands have found it ſo; and that makes me think of the Thouſands of <hi>Prentices</hi> in the <hi>Navy,</hi> if they be poor <hi>Watermens,</hi> or <hi>Widows Prentices, &amp;c.</hi> if the Commiſſioner pleaſeth, he will pay the <hi>Prentice,</hi> notwithſtanding the Indenture. But if it be ſuch as the Commiſſioner pleaſeth to ſtop the Money on board of Ship, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, the <hi>Prentice</hi> ſhall have not a <hi>Penny,</hi> though it may be his Maſter hath not been at Twelve <hi>Pence</hi> Charge in a Year, for the <hi>Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,</hi> ſo that there is no certain Rule, but all left to will and pleaſure, whoever is ruined.</p>
               <p>Now it may be ſome will think, I have met with Difficulties in the <hi>Pay</hi> of the Fleet my ſelf. Now as to that, I never uſed to complain in my own Cauſe; neither did I ever petition the Navy-Board for but one Run, of all that ever I was concerned with, and that was for a poor Widow at <hi>Lynn;</hi> and had it anſwered, but it was 2 or 3 Years paſt.</p>
               <p>And indeed, I have received a Thouſand, or Fifteen Hundred <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> of <hi>Seamens Pay,</hi> my ſelf, as the King's Books will make appear, and I bleſs God, I never had any Complaint againſt me, to be called before them: For I bought moſt part of what I bought, at Two Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or half a Crown profit, and ſome at Three Shillings profit in the <hi>Pound;</hi> and I do not know of one above that profit; for I bleſs God, I always hated Extortion and Oppreſſion; and had I gotten half in half, as ſome curſed Extortioners did, I had, as I received at firſt 2 or 3 Thouſand <hi>Pound per</hi> Year, doubled it, and doubled it, to have made it up above <hi>Twenty Thouſand Pound</hi> by this time, and ſo have had a curſed great Eſtate, as it may be ſome others have, out of the ruines of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and the Cheating of their Country: For there
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49746:12"/>be ſome who have grown up like <hi>Pumpkins,</hi> from a Dunghill, to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious bigneſs, and are like Maggots in the poor Sheeps backs, that the bigger the Maggots grow, the more the poor Sheep is eaten up. But I pray the God of Heaven and Earth, to ſtir up ſome publick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Perſons, to conſider how dreadful a thing it is, that our Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time Sheep ſhould be thus eaten up, and devoured, for want of looking after.</p>
               <p>And now I will return to the poor <hi>Seamen.</hi> I found by ſad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, That ſo ſoon as the Seamen had beaten the <hi>French,</hi> their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries began to be multiplied, as I might ſhew more largely; and I was not eaſie to buy their <hi>Pay</hi> at dearer Rates, than I would ſell, If I had been to ſell and loſe to another: For that is the Rule that Chriſt himſelf ſaith is the Subſtance of the Law and the Prophets, <hi>To do as we would be done unto,</hi> and that is in the Church-Catechiſm; and which Rule, I believe, is planted by God himſelf, in the Law of Nature, and by which all Mankind ſhall be Judged at the great Day: And if theſe Nations will not learn their Catechiſms, I believe God will whip them: I ſaid ſo laſt Year of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>-Company's Concerns, that God did Command all <hi>Mankind,</hi> To do as they would be done unto. And what they learned, God knows; they have, I am ſure, been ſo whipped this Year, that they, nor their Fathers, never knew the like. And God will, I believe, plead the Cauſe of the <hi>Poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It were well now, under this ſearching Rod, ſince it appears God is riſen up in Judgment againſt our Sea-Affairs, that we would oblige our ſelves, as Chriſtians, to ſeek and enquire after all the Cauſes of it, if poſſible, both of Sin, the procuring Cauſe, and Men's Knavery, Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, or Negligence on the other hand. But this, by the way, I ſay, I bleſs God, inſtead of taking advantage of the miſery of ruined Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's <hi>Pay,</hi> to buy it at half loſs, I have left off buying any at all, for near three Years, neither ever will buy any in this World; and for the next, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, there the weary are at reſt, and there the wicked ceaſe from troubling. There Mankind will not cheat and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and plague and oppreſs one the other.</p>
               <p>And now I have ſaid this, it may be ſome will ſay, I am mad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to loſe the getting of ſo many Thouſands of Pounds, and now to trouble my ſelf with the miſery, the knavery, and ruins of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> and get nothing by it, but rather run the hazard (if any will be my Enemies) for telling the truth, to be ruined my ſelf. And in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49746:12"/>anſwer to that, it is true, I do in the preſence of the Eternal Bleſſed <hi>Jehovah</hi> declare, in whoſe proſence I write, That I do not know of one Falſhood or Lye, in whatever I have written, as repreſented by me; and I know that God will bring every work to Judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be Good or Evil; and ſo I would write every Line, as that which may be brought to be known to theſe Nations, for to be conſidered of, and as that which I would have it, all found Truth in the great Day.</p>
               <p>And now, having ſaid this, and conſidered of what I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, of the dreadful Ruins and Deſtruction of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Seamen, and there is not one Soul of them knoweth what I write for them: And indeed, it is a mercy they do not know their miſeries to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and while they know it apart, they groan under it apart. And for thoſe who are dead, they cannot complain; and thoſe who have been ſo far provoked to go away, and ſerve other Nations, they will not come again, I ſuppoſe quickly, to complain: and indeed, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, 6. &amp; 5. <hi>Doth the wild Aſs bray, when he hath Graſs, or loweth the Ox over his Fother.</hi> If the poor miſerable ruined Creatures, loſe the Graſs and Fother at home, with Q's and R's, it may be they will bray; and ſince they beat the <hi>French,</hi> and are ſo dreadfully ruined in their <hi>Pay</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> ſome have Sworn by their Damnation, They would ſerve the <hi>French,</hi> or any Nation, rather than be ruined at home. Who can help their Swearing: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Oppreſſion maketh wiſe Men mad.</hi> And if ſo, who can expect any other from them, that are not over-wiſe. And when I have repreſented a few of their miſeries, if the Lords of the Admiralty were ordered to lay before the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the method of ſome Commanders abuſing the Seamen, or cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or their Families, or the Nation, in the Seamens Tickets and <hi>Pay,</hi> which ſome have been accuſed of publickly: and alſo, the Commiſſioners of the Navy, were to repreſent what number of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions</hi> the poor, and diſtreſſed, and miſerable Seamens Wives, Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, or Relations, have laid before them, for Tickets kept from the Seamen for their <hi>Pay;</hi> and let the Account-Books, and Ship-Books, be alſo ſearched, to ſee how many hundreds of Pounds worth of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Tickets have been received publickly, by, or for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of ſome Ships, while they had liberty to receive them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much trouble as to forge <hi>Powers,</hi> with all that other curſed Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains have forged; and how this miſery hath helped to make the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

               <p>And as I ſaid the Seamens miſeries are fruitful, ſo is their being Cheated of their <hi>Pay</hi> made a help to their miſery.</p>
               <p>For though there be perhaps Forty or Fifty Clerks and Clerks Boys can ſee the Books, and though the Captains Clerks of every Ship, and the <hi>Purſer</hi> of every Ship, hath Books of all the Seamens Names, and can give out Copies of what Names they pleaſe to thoſe that can forge powers to receive Seamens pay, to the value of Two or Three Hundred pound in a Ship, and the Captains and <hi>Purſers</hi> make out Tickets for the ſame, to offer to Sale, without pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to keep men open upon the Ship's Book a whole <hi>Weſt India</hi> Voyage after they are gone: Yet theſe Things, though proved, are not minded to be repreſented to the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if a poor Seaman's Wife, or a poor Seaman in the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, would ſee whether he be run out of his pay, or whether it be received by one or another, they may petition the Navy-board, and give the Clerk of the <hi>Petitions</hi> a ſhilling for the petition, and his Boy ſix pence, to remember his Worſhip, that he may put his <hi>Maſter</hi> in mind, that ſuch a man in ſuch an Hoſpital deſires to Know whether he be not Run out of his <hi>Money</hi> in ſuch and ſuch a Ship's Book, where he was ſick, or turn'd over.</p>
               <p>And, it may be, in this time of extraordinary need of Seamen, the poor Seaman is preſt away again, with the Hoſpital-Certificate in his <hi>Pocket,</hi> and that taken from him, and he ſent on Board of the Ketch, to be carried away before he get the Book ſearched.</p>
               <p>But if he be Old and Craſie, and have not money to buy himſelf off, it may be Shame, or Fear, will make them clear him again; and then he may look after his petition again; and that is a better miſery than ordinary, to be miſerable enough, to be ſent to the Hoſpital in <hi>London,</hi> and have liberty to look after his money due in two other Ships.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49746:13"/>
               <p>whereas, had he not, it may be he would, if Living, and like to come again, have been Run out of it, if gone away, they expecting he would not come again, they then ſet down in the Book, paid the Party.</p>
               <p>And how many of theſe paying the parties there hath been this War, that the party never had a Groat of I know not; neither what a fatal miſery it hath been to poor Seamen's Wives, the not having liberty to be rightly informed how their Husbands ſtood in the Book, without petitioning the Navy-Board; as if the Wives being truly inform'd by one of the Clerks, (tho ſhe never look into the Books) would be the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the whole Book: But if I am not miſtaken, if I had not left off Ticket-buying above three years ago, but had taken all the Advantages of Sea-mens miſeries, this Trick it ſelf might have helped me (with a good Friend) to get the Books ſearched privatly and ſo have bought Seamens miſerable pay at the ſame curſed price, as ſome others have bought it at: But bleſſed be God that my Mother taught me the Catechiſm to defy the Devil and all his Works, the vain pomps and vanities of this wicked World.</p>
               <p>And now I think of the Church Catechiſm, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Devil and all his Works, and teaching us to do to all men as we would they ſhould do to us, makes me think alſo how honeſt men may Buy the Seamens pay, at two or three Shillings in the pound profit, as I did; and ſo long as they do, as they would be done unto, may ſerve the King the Nation, and the Seamen therein: But thoſe that buy at ten or twelve ſhillings in the pound loſs to the poor Seamen, (as many have done ſince the Seamen beat the <hi>French;</hi>) thoſe I do take to be ſuch as the miniſters and people, and whole Church of <hi>England</hi> are bound to curſe every Year; for I find in the Book of Common-prayer, that in the Comination there are theſe ſeveral Curſes.</p>

               <p>Now the proving that the generality of ſeamen have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted out of half their pay, by Ticket-buyers, and been very unmercifully dealt with, will prove to all mankind, that they that have been unmerciful to them, and they that have been Extortioners to them and their Families, are a curſed Generation by the Doctrine of the whole Church, and by the Aſſent and Conſent of near ten Thouſand Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and then again, if this ſo ſolemn a Curſe be dreadful as being the work of the whole Church; and if one Accurſed Act of <hi>Achan</hi> did trouble the whole Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and made them flee before their Enemies until it was Diſcovered, and the Author puniſhed; then who can tell how dangerous it may be to theſe Nations, to let ſuch unmercifulneſs, curſed unmercifulneſs and cruelty go unpuniſhed; for if God Requires the Authors of ſuch horrid miſeries to be found out and puniſhed, he expects it ſhould be done, or this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt ſurely expect to be Corrected, for <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>God is not mocked, for whatſoever a Man ſows, that ſhall he alſo reap.</hi>

               <p>And I am ſure, ſince the running and ruining of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and their Families, our poors Book is riſen to be twenty Seaven months to the Year, and we are alſo in Debt, ſo that I doubt our poors books next year, muſt be about twenty eight, or Thirty months in the Year to get us out of Debt for our poors Tax and ſince we have had ſo miſerable a number of poor ruined ſeamens. Widows or Children, our poors Taxes are ſo exceeding high, and our Trade in the mean time is ſo way-laid, that when his Majeſty ordered the payment of ſeveral Ships, it hath been ſo managed, that tho the men are diſcharged and paid off, the King is put to the charge to pay them off near thirty miles from <hi>London,</hi> and the City and Country way-laid to catch them if they come to <hi>London;</hi> and thoſe poor ſouls who eſcaped with their Lives, where an Hundred or two in a ſhip died, and ſeveral ſcores ſent on ſhore ſick, when they came in to be paid, yet not a ſonl of them ſafe from the Preſs one day for their poor Wives to take care of them, or they to bring their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to their Wives, or to eat freſh proviſion, and get a little ſtrength to Recruit again before they go out, or to lay out their mony at beſt hand in <hi>London,</hi> or to return it home to <hi>Scotland;</hi> but when the King pays them, they are, many of them, preſt away in a day or two very miſerably, and the City of <hi>London</hi> and Subarbs, (who muſt ſupply them with Bread and Cloaths when they come from Captivity, or they may ſtarve,) are diſappointed in taking any of their mony; and I think if we have loſt above a Thouſand merchant ſhips, and near an Hundred men of War, it may be modeſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, that there hath been near twenty Thouſand carried Captives to <hi>France</hi> this War; and yet let the City ſupply them what they will in their diſtreſs, they ſhall be ſure to be paid far enough off from their taking any of their mony, ſo that tho the City of London hath been always Loyal and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to K. <hi>William,</hi> and ready to aſſiſt him with their purſes and perſons, and the ſeamen of <hi>England</hi> always Loyal and Ready to lay down their Lives at any time for His Majeſty and the Nation, if led on to the muzels of their Enemies Guns; and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49746:15"/>yet I will challenge all mankind to ſhew ſuch Examples of the Cities being deprived of the ſeamens Trade, and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens being ſo Ruined in their pay in their Liberty, and in their Lives with ſuch fatal Ruin, and for ſo long continuance, ſince <hi>England</hi> was a Nation.</p>
               <p>And indeed, however it comes to paſs, the providence of God, by my extraordinary Zeal to aſſiſt all Seamen to ſerve his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and theſe Nations, hath enabled me to know more of their Caſes than, it may be any private man in <hi>England;</hi> For as I have aſſiſted Thouſands, and that as cheap as for ready money, to encourage them chearfully in the Service: ſo among their Deaths, and being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, or preſt from Ship to Ship, I ſhall loſe about a Thouſand pound, and that by about Four Hundred men; and of all thoſe Four Hundred men, there are near Three Hundred and Forty Dead, or gone I know not where; and I, bleſs God, that I buy my Experience of the Seamens miſeries, thus dear, for inſtead of Repining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his holy providence, I find he fitteth me with Content, and with an Heart to compaſſionate the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe that I have loſt ſo much by, and all the reſt of their Ruined Companions.</p>
               <p>And I may almoſt admire how ſome that have been Raiſed up in the Ruines of the poor and miſerable Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, can have their Hearts ſo hard and obdurate; yea I ſay, Caſe-hardened: as to help Ruine them more and more, and, in the mean time, ſmother up what they can of his Majeſties and the Nations Loſs in our Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and the King and Nations being cheated of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of money or Stores.</p>
               <p>I had written much more largely, of the miſerableneſs of the Seamen, and the method of the King's being cheated, and the Seamen being cheated, but that I was afraid it was too large to trouble the Two moſt Honourable Houſes with, and ſo haue, in theſe I aſt Four Days, drawn up this ſhort Breviate of what part of their miſeries came readily to my mind, having not time nor patience to look over my other
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49746:15"/>book, conſidering that every miſery that is Repreſented, the Cauſe being found out, the Cure will be quickly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p>It doth ſeem ſtrange to me, that the Nation, which doth all in general agree, ſuch as are men of Senſe, Honeſty and Love to their Countrey, and the true Proteſtant Religion, that they have Cauſe to bleſs and admire at the good, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and gracious providence of God, in Raiſing up our moſt gracious King <hi>William,</hi> to be a means of a Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for us, and a Defence for theſe Nations, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>I ſay it is ſtrange that we ſhould ſee Cauſe to bleſs God for this, and even enjoy our ſelves under our own Vines and Fig-Trees, and yet at the ſame time let the Seamen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> be Ruined and dwindled away ſo many Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them, and not mind them, and yet call them the Walls of the Nation, as if it could be ſafe and ſecure to dwell in any Houſe in the World after the Walls are thrown down: For my part, I do faithfully declare my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion before God and man, That if theſe abide not in the Ships (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Mariners</hi> that were with him in the ſtorm), there is none can be ſafe; and I am ſure our Scamen cannot abide in the Ships, if they are kept until they are ſtifled to Death for want of freſh Air and freſh proviſions, and ſo thrown half of them over Board.</p>
               <p>Neither will they, I fear, abide in the Ships, many of them, if they ſee their ſhips are priſons for ſeven years, without Fourteen Days Releaſe, and eſpecially if they ſee many of their <hi>Priſon-Keepers</hi> beat and abuſe ſome of them like Dogs, and it may be call them Dogs, and eternal damn'd Dogs, into the Bargain; and if, as Purſer <hi>Maidman</hi> ſays, in his book called, <hi>Naval Speculations,</hi> printed by Mr. <hi>Gilliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> That in ſome ſhips the Officers muſt live like ſlaves in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,</hi> if they cannot, like Spaniels, fawn enough on the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. I ſay, if the Officers live ſo, what muſt the poor ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do, that are liable to be beaten by Captains and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Officers alſo.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49746:16"/>
               <p>But however, we have ſome worthy Admirals and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, that will not abuſe the ſeamen, neither ſuffer the Officers to abuſe them; and this I ſpeak to their praiſe.</p>
               <p>And now coming to a Concluſion, I bleſs God, who hath put it into the King's Heart to ſpeak for the ſeamen, and that for their encouragement.</p>
               <p>And thus I have plainly laid down ſome of their miſeries. And I might begin again; for more of their miſeries crowd in upon me. But theſe before-mentioned, if well redreſſed, will remedy moſt of the reſt. But when all is done, if any of the Tools, who have helped to Ruine them already, be left to Ruine them again, I cannot help it; my book is done, and the Lord Jehovah bleſs our Gracious King <hi>William,</hi> the Loyal Lords and Commons, and theſe Nations: ſo prays</p>
