            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A BRIEF ACCOUNT Of the Intended <hi>Bank of England,</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE want of a Bank, or publick Fund, for the convenience and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of great Payments, and the better to facilitate the circulation of Money, in and about this great and oppulent City, hath in our time, among other Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, occaſion'd much unneceſſary Credit, to the loſs of ſeveral Millions, by which Trade hath been exceedingly diſcourag'd and obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: This, together with the height of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or Forbearance of Money, which for ſome time paſt hath born no manner of proportion—to that of our Rival Neighbors, and for which no tolerable Reaſon could ever be given either in Notion or Practiſe, conſidering the Riches
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94279:3"/>
and Trade of <hi>England,</hi> unleſs it were the want of publick Funds; by which the Effects of the Nation, in ſome ſort, might be diſpoſed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Uſe, and do the Office of Money, and become more uſeful to the Trade and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements thereof.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, were the Cauſes that the Nature and Uſe of Banks and Publick Funds; have been the Diſcourſe and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Years; but all this while our more refined <hi>Politicians</hi> aſſured us, that we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of ſetling <hi>Banks</hi> in <hi>England</hi> without a <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> And this Notion became ſo univerſal, that it was a matter of deriſion, for any one to ſeem to be of a contrary opinion. <hi>Thus the modiſh vein, of Farce and Ridicule, ſo prevalent over the Morality, Virtue, and Reaſon of our Times, had like to have deprived us of this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the notion of Banks and Publick Funds were entertained by ſome mercurial Heads, who finding the main Objection againſt them in <hi>England</hi> to be, the danger of Violence from the Prince, they therefore invented certain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Banks and Funds, <hi>which they deſigned to ſettle far enough from the Prince's reach, or any bodies elſe.</hi> The firſt Deſign of this nature
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94279:3"/>
was, to turn a Lumbard into a Bank, and to that end they cried down the uſe of Gold and Silver, and up that of other Materials in lieu thereof; but when they found the World very unwilling to leave their old way without a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reaſon, or ſomething more enticing, they run from their new Miſtake to an old one, which was, <hi>That the Stamp or Denomination gives or adds to the value of Money.</hi> With this they reſolved to run counter to all Mankind; yea, they would anticipate Ages, and attract, or rather imagine, ineſtimable Value from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Years to come; all which was to be crammed down Mens Throats as a Puniſhment of their Infidelity, who could not believe a Lumbard to be a Bank: and here was occaſion for the power of an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> at leaſt, <hi>to conjure every Man's Imagination into the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of theirs.</hi> Thus we ſee the Genius of ſome of our Countrymen are as vaſtly above and beyond, as others are below and beſide, the practice of extraordinary things.</p>
            <p>Thus between the new-acquir'd Maxims of our modern Politicians on the one hand, and the incomprehenſible Notions conceived on the other, it became very ſcandalous to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or; eſpouſe any thing of a Propoſal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94279:4"/>
to a <hi>Bank;</hi> but when this War begun, the Credit of the Nation was low, and the Wits on both ſides, found no better nor honeſter way to ſupply the Neceſſities of the Government, than by enhauncing the Price and Intereſt of Money; the effect of which was, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was obliged to pay from double to treble, or higher Intereſt: The Diſeaſe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily worſe, Men were tempted to draw their Effects from Trade and Improvements, and found the beſt and ſecureſt Gain, in making Merchandiſe of the Government and Nation.</p>
            <p>For remedy of which it was propoſed ſome years ago, That a publick transferrable Fund of Intereſt ſhould be eſtabliſhed by Parliament, and made convenient for the Receipts and Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in and about the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and to conſtitute a Society of Money'd Men for the government thereof, who ſhould be induced by their Intereſt, to exchange for Money, the Aſſignments upon the Fund, at every demand. In this manner it was propoſed, that the conſtitution of this Fund, ſhould in the practiſe anſwer, the End of a publick transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fund of Intereſt, of a <hi>Bank,</hi> and of a publick <hi>Lumbard</hi> at once, and a good part of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94279:4"/>
the Effects of the Nation, might thereby be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd uſeful to the Trade and Buſineſs thereof, which would of courſe, have lower'd the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Money, and prevented the drawing thereof, from the Countries and places remote from Trade. But no ſooner was this Propoſal ſtated by a Society of conſiderable Perſons, but the notion of <hi>Currency</hi> was ſtarted, and carried ſo far before it was well perceived or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by ſome, that it then proved of perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conſequence, to the ſucceſs of this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking: Some underſtood it only as a Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, others, as it ſeems, it was at the bottom intended, a downright Force, the effect of which would have been, to turn the Stomachs of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind againſt it, <hi>Coertion being of ſufficient force, to marr a good thing of this nature,</hi> but never to mend a bad one.</p>
            <p>All this while the very Name of a <hi>Bank</hi> or <hi>Corporation</hi> was avoided, tho' the Nature of both was intended, the Propoſers thinking it prudent, that a Deſign of this nature, ſhould have as eaſie and inſenſible a beginning as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to prevent, or at leaſt gradually to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and remove, the Prejudices and bad Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, commonly conceived in the Minds of Men againſt things of this kind, before they are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94279:5"/>
underſtood: but that ſort of People, who ought, and in whoſe power it was, to encourage this Undertaking, could no ways underſtand it, which put the Propoſers, upon heightning the Propoſal for Intereſt, and upon particular Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, for the Sum propoſed, which at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, and upon divers occaſions, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced certain narrow and ſiniſter Deſigns, no way becoming, ſo noble and univerſal a Work as this.</p>
            <p>As the Propoſers found great diſcouragement from one ſort of Men, who could by no means reconcile this Propoſal with their own Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and the old <hi>Norm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> way of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money; <hi>ſo others ſeem'd to underſtand it too much,</hi> and would only have it propoſed at four, or four and an half <hi>per Cent.</hi> whereof three <hi>per Cent.</hi> to be allowed to the Fund, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder for thoſe who ſhould furniſh Money to circulate the ſame, for otherwiſe, ſay they, it will quite and clean diſcourage Land, for every body will be for diſpoſing their Money upon ſo convenient, clear, and ſecure an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, rather than to expect ſomething more with Trouble and Uncertainties; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was found convenient to put it to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and expoſe ſo much of the nature of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94279:5"/>
thing, and its conſtitution, as was needful to have it eſpouſed in Parliament.</p>
            <p>But though the gilded name of a <hi>Bank,</hi> and the popular one of a <hi>Corporation,</hi> became more formidable to the Senſes of a ſort of People who wanted the Money; yet what by the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a few, from a Principle of Intereſt, and of ſome who are no great Friends to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as from ſome jealous Apprehenſions ariſing from the newneſs and ſtrangeneſs of the thing, divers otherwiſe well-meaning People, became poſſeſt with monſtrous and frightful I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's and Conceptions of the Matter, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got whole Swarms of Objections, which are hardly ever like to be anſwered, unleſs it be with one another, or with the Practice, or at leaſt until the Antagoniſts have reconciled their Poſitions.</p>
            <p>One pretended Patriot comes and tells us, This Deſign will make the King Abſolute, by becoming Maſter thereof, nor is there any way to prevent it; <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Rich and Money'd Men, we find by experience, are naturally timerous and fearful, and are eaſily brought to comply with the Times to ſave what they have.</hi> And the keeping of this Fund being of neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſuch, the proſpect of their Profit, in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94279:6"/>
conjunction with their natural Eaſineſs, will of courſe induce them to joyn with the Prince, who is always beſt able to encourage and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them.</p>
            <p>Another comes Cock-a-hoop, and tells ye, That he, or his Grandſire, Uncle, or ſome of the Race, have been abroad in ſome Country or other, <hi>and in all their Peregrinations they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with</hi> BANKS <hi>nor</hi> STORKS <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where, but only in Republicks.</hi> And if we let them ſet footing in <hi>England,</hi> we ſhall certainly be in danger of a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> Nay, he goes further, and tells ye, That the very eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of a <hi>Bank</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> will of courſe alter the Government, for that is to entruſt the Fund of the Nation in the Hands of Subjects, who naturally are, and will always be ſure to be of the popular ſide, and will inſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the Church and State.</p>
            <p>Some who pretend to ſee further into a Milſtone than others, will undertake to make it plain, that it will raiſe and enhance the price of Land, and utterly diſcourage and ruine Trade; <hi>For by this means,</hi> ſay they, <hi>all Real Securities will become current, or near as good as current, in or by the Bank;</hi> which will very much leſſen, if not put an end to the Credit of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94279:6"/>
Securities, for Uſurers will be content with ſuch an eaſie, ſecure, and convenient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, rather than hazard their Principal, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſe themſelves in Trouble for a greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>Others of the Learned tell us, That this <hi>Bank</hi> or <hi>Fund</hi> will be ſo profitable, eaſie, and ſecure for Receipts and Payments, that all the Money of the Nation will naturally run into Trade, and none will be left to purchaſe Lands, ſince Men may continue their Money in <hi>Bank,</hi> on demand, upon the beſt Security in <hi>Europe,</hi> and yet have a daily Intereſt running upon it, <hi>and thus have Trade and a Real Eſtate at once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to leave the Objectors to confer Notes, reconcile their Notions, and to anſwer one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, it may be to better purpoſe to give ſome brief Account of the Nature of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Bank,</hi> with the good Effects and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which may be expected therefrom; and in the firſt place it is neceſſary to premiſe whatever our <hi>Notioniſts</hi> may imagine to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That all Money or Credit not having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick value, to anſwer the Contents or Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94279:7"/>
               <hi>thereof, is falſe and counterfeit, and the Loſs muſt fall one where or other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Species of Gold and Silver being accepted and choſen by the Commercial World, for the Standard or Meaſure of other Effects; every thing elſe is only counted valuable, as compared with theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Wherefore all Credit not founded on the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Species of Gold and Silver, is impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and can never ſubſiſt neither ſafely nor long; at leaſt till ſome other Species of Credit be found out and choſen by the Trading part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, over and above, or in lieu thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having ſaid what a <hi>Bank</hi> ought to be, it remains to ſhew what this is deſigned, and wherein it will conſiſt. This <hi>Bank</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a Revenue or Income of Eight <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> for and upon the Money ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and what Profits and Improvements can be made from the Buſineſs or Credit of the <hi>Bank,</hi> will be alſo divided among the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Thus this Company or Corporation will exceed all others of that kind known in the Commercial World. For here will be Eight

               <hi>per Cent. per Annum</hi> certain upon the Capital; and as good and great a probability of other Profits as ever any Company had. And as to the Security of the <hi>Bank,</hi> for ſuch as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt their Effects therein, it will be clear and viſible, and every way equal to, if not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> for the other <hi>Funds</hi> or <hi>Banks</hi> in the Chriſtian World, at beſt have only Effects to anſwer, without pretending to have any thing over: Nor are they Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Intereſts, Property and Eſtates of Private Men, that of <hi>Genua</hi> only excepted; but this <hi>Bank</hi> will always have Twelve Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Pounds, or One Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> over and above Effects to anſwer, whatſoever Credit they may have. For the Company will be obliged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to make any Dividend, but out of the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profits ariſing from their capital Stock or Fund; nor will they ever make any Dividend out of their Profits, until after ſome Months notice, that ſuch as apprehend the Security will be weakned thereby, may have oportunity to withdraw their Effects, before the ſame be made. Thus a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Private Men will be obliged by their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Intereſts, to ſtrengthen and corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the publick Security of this Bank.</p>

As to the common Objection of the danger from Alteration or Changes of Government, This Foundation is grounded upon a Revenue that cannot fail, but with the Nation, ſetled by Parliament for the uſes thereby limited and appointed, it will, for many Reaſons both of Right and Intereſt, become the beſt and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Property, grounded upon ſo juſt and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable a Conſideration, as the Value paid to Their Majeſties, for the uſe and ſervice of the Government: And there being no Country in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> where Property hath been more ſacred and ſecure for ſome Ages paſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all our Revolutions, than in <hi>England,</hi> it muſt needs follow, that nothing leſs than a Conqueſt, wherein all Property, Juſtice, and Right muſt fail, can any way affect this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: And in ſuch caſe this would be but in common with every thing elſe.</p>
            <p>Being to ſhew how this Deſign may redound to the Benefit of the Trade and Improvements of <hi>England,</hi> we find our <hi>Politicians</hi> have ſplit the Connexion, the better to underſtand the Text, and diſtinguiſh between the Intereſt of Land and Trade, as they have lately done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that of a King and his People. The Truth on't is, they are poſſeſt with a ſort of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94279:8"/>
factious Reaſon, which runs extreamly upon Diviſions and Separations; for when any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or Poſition proves too heavy for their Heads; they are preſently for dividing it, and as it were of ſpite, becauſe they cannot apprehend themſelves: they employ their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to reduce every thing to ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as not to be underſtood by any body elſe: but until our <hi>Politicians</hi> are pleaſed to ſhew ſome better Reaſons than they have hitherto done, for their ſplitting the Intereſt of Land and Trade, we will leave it as it is, concluding <hi>that they are, and were, and of right ought to be,</hi> in and of one and the ſame Intereſt; and as ſuch we ſhall conſider how this Bank may be beneficial to both.</p>
            <p>It is an infallible ſign that Money abounds and is plentiful, when the Intereſt thereof is low; for Intereſt or Forbearance is the Price of Money, as it is ſuch; and if Money be plentiful, People will thereby be enabled and induced to Trade and Purchaſe, and by the plenty of Money other things muſt in proportion bear the better Price. And if the Proprietors of the <hi>Bank</hi> can circulate their Fundation of <hi>Twelve hundred Thouſand</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94279:9"/>
               <hi>Pounds,</hi> without having more than <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three Hundred Thouſand Pounds</hi> lying dead at one time with another, this <hi>Bank</hi> will be in effect as <hi>Nine Hundred Thouſand Pounds,</hi> or a <hi>Million</hi> of freſh Money brought into the Nation; and <hi>Nine Hundred Thouſand Pounds,</hi> or <hi>a Million,</hi> that muſt have been employed in doing what the <hi>Bank</hi> will ſupply, may be employ'd to other purpoſes. And as the Effects in this <hi>Bank</hi> will be a growing and encreaſing Money, and bring great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Trade, by the ſecure, eaſie, and convenient way of Receipts and Payments therein: It's Safety from Fire, Thieves, and other Diſaſters, which Gold and Silver are ſubject unto: it's giving a Profit upon a great part of the running Caſh of the Nation, the practiſe of which will naturally and gradually lower the Intereſt of Money, as it has done in <hi>Holland, Genoua,</hi> and all other places where <hi>Banks</hi> and Publick Funds are uſed: all which will render it the higheſt Intereſt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and People, to preſerve, maintain, and improve it in all time to come.</p>
            <p>Whatever the groundleſs Jealouſies of Men may be, none can reaſonably apprehend any other Conſequences of this Deſign to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Nation, but that it will make
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94279:9"/>
Money plentiful, Trade eaſie and ſecure, raiſe the Price of Lands, draw the Species of Gold and Silver into the Hands of the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as we ſee it in <hi>Holland, Genoua,</hi> and other places, where theſe Funds are accomodated to Receipts and Payments: It will make the Stock or Fund of the Nation go abundantly further than otherwiſe it could. Thus the Effects of the Nation will, at an eaſie and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable rate, anſwer the End, and command the uſe of Ready Money; that we may be no longer a Prey to conſuming Uſury; that the many Landed Men in <hi>England</hi> may be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the Oppreſſions they too frequently lye under, from the few that have Money: and what ought at all times to command Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney readily and eaſily, will hereby be put in a condition to do it. Nor can it be reaſonably ſuppoſed to make any alteration in our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, unleſs it be to make Property ſtill more fixed and ſecure, and to link the People more firmly to our Engliſh Conſtitution, and inſure them as it were againſt the itch of Change.</p>
            <p>Whatever a ſort of People may pretend, who profeſs themſelves to be greater Friends to borrowing than to lending Parliaments, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94279:10"/>
whoſe Talent lies not ſo much in removing Inconveniencies as in finding them; Men are the beſt, trueſt, and moſt natural Defenders and Guardians of their own Properties and Eſtates, and we have hardly ever found the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Property of <hi>England</hi> wronged, but by ſuch as had no great Share therein, and who for want of Money have often ſold what was none of theirs.</p>
            <p>It's worth any ones Obſervation, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, how much, and what ſort of unuſual Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition this Propoſal has met with; Why not the like Struglings againſt that <hi>Chimera</hi> of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivorſhips? Our Funds for Lives, or the late Lottery, which however they have ſucceeded, the ſame Funds might have raiſed double the Money, and been very near as ſoon paid off; and theſe had been Funds beneficial to Trade and the Induſtry of the Nation; whereas the other are quite contrary, Nurſes of Idleneſs, Baits of Vanity, poſſeſſing the People with a certain ſort of Levity and Giddineſs, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them with fond Expectations, deſtructive to their Welfare and future Improvements. But there are three ſorts of People, how much ſoever otherwiſe their Intereſt and Humours differ, have, notwithſtanding all Civilities
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94279:10"/>
ſhewed them, unanimouſly joined iſſue againſt this Undertaking. The <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it may contribute to leſſen their <hi>Monarch</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and ſome few Uſurers and Brokers of Money, and the third ſort are commonly ſuch as have not wherewith to Trade, unleſs it be like <hi>Haman</hi> of old, for whole Nations or Peoples at once. But, after all, the Happy Effects of this Undertaking, like almoſt all other great things in Trade, will be beſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Practiſe thereof, when Time ſhall convince the Ignorant, and when Men will come to apprehend it as it is; when theſe conceived Hobgoblins, frightful Monſters, and horrid Spectres, with which ſome are poſſeſt about it, ſhall vaniſh, ceaſe, and be no more.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Reproaches and Aſperſions on ſuch a Work as this, is neither new nor ſtrange, as being the common Fate of all good and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Undertakings, that are, or ever were, in the World, the Nature of Men being bent againſt every thing which they fancy <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> ſo well, out of a fond and preſumptuous Principle, that none knows, or at leaſt ought to know more than they, as out of a natural Unbelief and Suſpicion of all they cannot ſee, <hi>which makes them follow Succeſs, or any thing like it, more than Reaſon, and Example more than</hi>

               <hi>Rule.</hi> But the Apprehenſions or Difficulties which were in the way, have not diſcourag'd the Propoſers from doing their utmoſt, to bring the deſigned Work to perfection, <hi>which ſeems to be reſerved for ſuch a time as this,</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enable the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to revive, recover, and tranſmit to <hi>Posterity,</hi> the Virtue, Luſtre, and wonted Glory, of their Renowned <hi>Anceſtors;</hi> and to lay a Foundation of Trade, Security, and Greatneſs within this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> for the preſent and ſucceeding Ages.</p>
