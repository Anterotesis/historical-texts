            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Valour by Sea, in ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions,

our preceding Kings confirmed

by the Sratute of 33 of his
Reign, 'tis there thus inſerted;
becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fiſhermen
dwelling on the Sea Coaſts, did
leave off their Trade of Fiſhing
in our Seas, and went the half
Seas over; and thereupon they
did buy Fiſh of <hi>Pickards, Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,
Normands</hi> and <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi>
by reaſon whereof, many
Incommodities did grow to the

Exerciſing the Feat, and Craft

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The decay of a
great Number of Boats and
Ships.</p>
            <p>And thirdly, the decay of

reaſon thereof, in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

            <p>It was therefore Enacted, That

Neglect: I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine;
and hope it will ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
be taken into the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the moſt Judicious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots
of our Countrey. And
then we ſhall draw back the
Trade from Foreign Nations, and
Employ our own People.</p>
            <p>The Great and Weighty
Queſtion upon this Point of Trade
to be conſidered, is: Whether it
is not the General Intereſt of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110708:10"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> to Revive and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
a <hi>National Fiſhery,</hi> it being
the Main Pillar of the Trade of
this Nation; And humbly offer
my weak Opinion of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of it; For <hi>England</hi> being
Situated in the very Jaws of
Neptune, by her commodious
Harbours, Rivers and Bays, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
muſt be Defended by Shipping;
and ſhe is the beſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
with Sea-Ports of any Place
in Chriſtendom, and ſtands fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to be Lords of the Sea of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
People in the World.</p>
            <p>This Kingdom being an Iſland
comparatively, were it, not for
that Iſthmus or Neck of Land to
the North, that joyns it to <hi>Scotland.</hi>
It muſt be univerſally allow'd,
that her Floating Caſtles muſt
defend her from all Foreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions
or Incurſions.</p>
            <p>And ſince ſhe is obliged to
defend her ſelf by Naval-Force.
It ſhould be conſidered how that
muſt be maintain'd and preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110708:10"/>
For, without thoſe Bul-Warks,
the Kingdom, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the reſt of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
muſt be in a few years,
in a very deplorable Condition.</p>
            <p>And nothing is more certain
than, that it is the Sea enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Land, which is confirmed
by the great Advantages of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Treaſure, by Navigation
both at home and abroad; as is
manifeſted by the Grandeur that
Merchants generally live in, in
<hi>England, Holland, France,</hi> &amp;c.
Hiſtory gives a very Satisfactory
Account of this Truth; How the
<hi>Venetians</hi> have arrived to that
Greatneſs they now live in by
Navigation, and by their Naval
Force, claim a Prerogative of the
Adriatick Sea.</p>
            <p>And alſo, to what Greatneſs
hath the <hi>French</hi> King attained to
by Navigation in a few years,
that he gives Laws in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diteranean</hi>
Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:110708:11"/>
And the <hi>Hollanders</hi> by their
Navigation are grown, as Opulent
(almoſt) if not altogether, as
any People in the World.</p>
            <p>But in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign
of Bleſſed Memory, <hi>England</hi> gave
ſo Fatal an Overthrow to the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armado in <hi>Anno 1588,</hi>
that ſhe was the Terror of the
Whole Univerſe, by being ſo
Potent by Sea; and after Her
Majeſties Succeſs of that Famous
Victory, ſhe was as much Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandized
by Foreign Princes,
for Her Conqueſt, as ſhe would
undoubtedly have been deſpiſed,
had ſhe been overcome.</p>
            <p>But how <hi>England</hi> has decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſince Her Reign, for want of
the <hi>Fiſhery</hi> for Nurſery for Sea-Faring
Men, is obvious to the
whole World.</p>
            <p>Woful Experience tells us, how
much our Neighbours have grown
upon us; by this Neglect of ours,
by the Wealth they have got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this forty or fifty years; and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:110708:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alſo by their daily Increaſe of
of Shipping.</p>
            <p>And for want of true Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope
to ſee clearly how this
<hi>National Fiſhery</hi> may be preſerv'd
and maintain'd, we are and have
been many years, in the dark.</p>
            <p>It is not only the Fiſh that
we looſe, and the impoveriſhing
the Coaſting Towns, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,
the only Loſs that this
Nation ſuſtains; But for want of
a prudent Method to Manage
this <hi>Fiſhery.</hi> We have only the
Colour for a Nurſery for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which will not breed a
tenth part of the Men we have
occaſion for in time War, as we
are an Iſland.</p>
            <p>Further, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and
<hi>French,</hi> finds theſe Advantages
(by Encouraging of the <hi>Fiſhery</hi>'s,
that they do not only get Wealth,
but it inures their Men to the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Sea, and makes them
Skilful in Handling their Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in Pilotage and Navigation.)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110708:12"/>
So that they know our own Coaſts,
Shoals and Harbours, better than

or in our Seas, nor any to Sail

nor would not permit any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner
to View or Sound their
Sea-Coaſts,</p>
            <p>Which was undoubedly a great
Security to them, and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their Pilots; but now,
'tis obſervable, that the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
ſeldom make uſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Pilots, to come into any of our
Harbours; and if they have Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to Man out a Fleet of Men
of War, 'tis but making a Draught
out of the Fiſhery, and they are
put on Board their own Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
            <p>Whereas, to the great Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Nation, and Loſs of
our Men; when we have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to Man the Royal Navy,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:110708:12"/>
we are forc'd to preſs Tag, Rag,
and Bob-Tail, a parcell of Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
Vagrants and Vagabonds, that
have not Proweſs to make them
Soldiers, nor Genius to make
them Mariners; and while they are
in Harbour, Eat up the Nations
Proviſion: And when they come
to be Roll'd and Toſs'd by the
Waves at Sea, they are as ſick
as ſo many Dogs, and infect
great Numbers of Sea-Faring-Men,
<note n="*" place="margin">And many dies.</note> by which great Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniecy,
renders them more fit

the daily Witneſs of this Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>And it cannot be deny'd, but
that it was the <hi>Fiſhery</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
that ſupplied Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi>

That, that one Blow was
ſo Great a Loſs, that they will
never Retrieve it, nor be able to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110708:13"/>
oppoſe us either by Sea or Land.</p>
            <p>And Her Clemency to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi>
in giving them Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

the very firſt Foundation that
they laid, to raiſe themſelves to

the Reverend Mr.</hi> Cambden, <hi>to

it may be a Means to

            <p>But this with Submiſſion, is a

               <hi>For Example:</hi> The Fiſh that

            <p>
               <hi>I Humbly Offer theſe Reaſons;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Our Coaſting Towns,
Bouroughs and Villages Adjacent,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110708:14"/>
that formerly had their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on the <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> are reduced
to ſo great Poverty, for want of
being Employ'd, that they are
now conſtrain'd to feed upon
Coarſe-Bread, Butter, Cheeſe,
Milk, Turnips, Carrots, or on
ſuch Roots and Herbs, as they
can get:</p>
            <p>Whereas if they were Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> they would then
have Money to go to Market, and
buy Fleſh, as their Anceſtors did
before them, for themſelves,
and Families: And I ſuppoſe
there is not any Man, but what
is ſenſible that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loving Fleſh, the meaneſt Man
or Woman in the Kingdom would
have Roaſt and boyl'd Meat for
themſelves and Families, as well
as their Landlords, if their Purſes
would bear it.</p>
            <p>So that then there would be a
greater Conſumption of Fleſh
than there is now, not only in our

that are now ſo miſerable
Poor, that they gradually Starve
for want of having this Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
            <p>And what is worthy your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Notice,<note place="margin">☞</note> it would prevent
abundance of Sea-faring Men
from going into Foreign Service
in times of Peace, for want of
Employment at home; many
of them leaving their Wives
and Children to be maintained
by the Pariſh, which undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
is a great Grievance to the
reſpective Pariſhes, and a Burthen
to the Inhabitants. And this <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery</hi>
would not only preſerve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of Families from Starving,
but then they would wear better
Cloaths, and promote our Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Manufactury; For 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Poverty makes People wear
Rags; and being diſheartned, it
oftentimes prevents their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And it will alſo prevent a great
many Inconveniencies, that now
attend this Nation, for want of
being Employed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For Example:</hi> There would
not be ſo many Vagrants and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds,
nor ſo many People
that take illegal Courſes; as
Thieving, Robbing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the
Ruine of themſelves and others.
Nor ſo many Export our Corn,
nor carry our Wooll unwrought
out of the Kingdom, if they were
employed another way.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Fiſhery</hi> would alſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
abundance at Land, ſo well
as by Sea; as Clerks, Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptants,
Ware-houſe and Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers,
and the like, and great
Numbers of Artiſts and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
So that then there would
be Proviſion for a great many
Men, that go Crawling about the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110708:16"/>
Streets, like ſo many Snails, for
want of Employ, that have been
well Educated.</p>
            <p>Beſides, 'tis an Univerſal Maxim,
<hi>That Idleneſs is the Root of all
Evil;</hi> and a great many People
fear Starving more than Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as is ſeen almoſt every
Seſſion, or Aſſizes; For let the
Judge enquire of the Criminals,
what induced them to take
the lewd Courſes they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
or Arraigned for, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Reply, is Want.</p>
            <p>Further, it is ſuppoſed by all
that have travelled, in the Low-Countries,
that where one Male-factor
is Executed in <hi>Holland</hi> or in
<hi>France,</hi> there is above One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in <hi>England;</hi> and the only
Reaſon that can be given, why
there are ſo few in <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> and ſo many executed in
<hi>England,</hi> is, That they take care
to employ their Subjects; and
thoſe that are uncapable by Age,
or any other Infirmity for Labour,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110708:16"/>
are provided for, by allowing
them a Competent Maintenance
to live on; (but 'tis the <hi>Fiſhery</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> that employs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth
them.) And the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
themſelves will boaſt, that
God bleſſeth them in their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,

<hi>That he that Conſidereth the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
the Lord will remember him

it be to the King and Kingdom,

ſuch miſerable Neceſſity, that in

And this happy Union will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all Inteſtine Commotions;
and bid Defiance to all Foreign
Invaſions, or Incurſions.</p>
            <p>And it cannot be denied, but
that <hi>England</hi> had formerly the
richeſt <hi>Fiſhery</hi> in the World;
when we maintain'd the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas; and
by Computation, had above 800
Fiſhing Ships; and had it been
Encourag'd, by a reaſonable. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
we muſt have had now,
between 2 and 3000 Fiſhing Ships;
And nothing can be more true,
than that the <hi>Fiſhery</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
is the Main Pillar of the Trade
and Defence of this Nation. And
it will not only raiſe the Naval
Force of <hi>England,</hi> but by its
Growth and Flouriſhing, be a
Curb, to keep under the growing
Power of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and bring in Great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to the Kingdom, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>

And further, if this Nurſery
for Seamen were Encouraged, the
Merchants would never want Men
to carry their Ships to Sea, nor
be in danger of having their
Men preſs'd in time of War
(which is a great Detriment to
our Trade, and Loſs to the King
and Kingdom) for then we ſhould
have Sea-faring Men, and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

flowing from the Bounty of the

derive the beginning of all that

Averſion againſt Fiſhing, that
they apply themſelves to it; for
Example, after Harveſt is in, and
the Herring-Seaſon comes on,
the Country Fellows and Boys
do go to the Coaſting Towns,
to be Hired into the <hi>Fiſhery;</hi>
and do Generally take ſuch a
liking to it, that after 2 or 3
Voyages they very rarely return
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:110708:37"/>
to their Rural Employment, but
take to the Sea altogether.</p>
               <p>And further, I cannot imagine
what Hardſhips the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
can undergo in the Fiſhing, more
than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are willing to
do; this is another Objection.</p>
               <p>But this, beyond all diſpute,
is a very Erroneous Notion; for
the Herring Fiſhing in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Seas begins in <hi>June,</hi> and goes
out in <hi>November;</hi> and that for
the firſt four Months, it is the
beſt time for Profit, Pleaſure, and
Fair-Weather; for we ſeldom
look out after the Herring Fiſhing
till <hi>September,</hi> and ſo continue
to the end of <hi>November,</hi> which
is the moſt Tempeſtuous Seaſon
in the Whole Annual; and then in
<hi>January,</hi> we fit out for the <hi>North</hi>
Seas, and ſpend the remaining
part of Winter in all Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Cold and Hardſhip; This
is enough to Satisfie, that we
are able to undergo as much
Hardſhips as the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:110708:38"/>
But however, I'le ſtrain this
point a little further; Suppoſe
that the Winter Fiſhing would
be too Hard for us, what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
can we have for not make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Improvements on the
Summer Fiſhing, which is more
advantageous abundantly;</p>
               <p>Another Objection is, That the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> can fare Harder than
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in their courſe feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Great Streſs is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this; and that an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Man will never be able to live
on ſo ſparing a Diet as they
do.</p>
               <p>Now if it were ſo, and that
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diet could not be
had, and that a <hi>Dutch</hi> Diet
would not ſerve us; but that is
not our Condition: for he that
cannot brook with the one may
have the other; And I am indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to believe that Pork, Peaſe,
and Beef, are much better and
more Strengthening, than Roots
and Cabbage, for the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:110708:38"/>
Victualling is the ſame with ours,
for Beer, Biſcuite, Butter, Cheeſe;
all which we can provide our
ſelves with, much Cheaper than
they: And to make Good the
Defect of their Ordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
they drink a great deal
more Brandy than the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
do; ſo then to take one thing
with another, we Victual with
Good Proviſions, as Cheap or
Cheaper than they do.</p>
               <p>But beſides the very ſuggeſtion
of leaving a Good Diet, to go
to a bad, is a very Great Error;
for the Countrey Men that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelves on board the <hi>Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery,</hi>
fare far better at Sea than
they did at Land; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
their General Victualling,
which they carry with them
to Sea, they feed upon the
Fiſh they Catch, which for Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
being Freſh taken, is a
Treat, to what a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
has at his Table a Shoar;
and of pitiful weak Men at
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:110708:39"/>
Land, in a Voyage or two,
become Stout, Hearty, and Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Men.</p>
               <p>There are two more Wolves
in the way; Firſt, that our
Herrings are in no eſteem abroad,
becauſe we have not the right
way to cure them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſhall never make
nothing on't, for the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
will under-ſell us, for Freight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Cheaper, and conſequently
beat us out of the Trade.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to which; Firſt, there
are two ways of curing the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
the one at Sea, where
they are Gipp'd, immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their taking, and Barrell'd;
the other at Land, where they
are Gipp'd, and Pack'd ſome days
after they are taken; Theſe we
call Shoar-made-Herrings, and
we know very well, that one
Barrel of the other for Goodneſs,
is worth one Hundred of theſe;
and that they will never take
their Pickle kindly, unleſs their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110708:39"/>
Throats be Cut, as ſoon as they
are Caught; ſo that it is a great
Error to take a Shoar-made-Herring,
for a Tryal of Skill in
curing; But for thoſe that are
made at Sea, they are made as
Good, and as much in Eſteem
abroad as any of the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
Herrings, and they have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Sold in the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
for four pounds a Barrel;
and I could wiſh we were no
more to blame, for not taking
them than curing them; But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
we did not know how to
Cure them; I hope 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to learn.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the other Notion is,
That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> will beat us
off of our Trade; this is as Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as the reſt, and of no force
at all againſt the <hi>Fiſhery,</hi> or it
is much more Force againſt the
Merchant, and the <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>
Trade; for this lies under our
Noſes, and more in our conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
than any Body's elſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:110708:40"/>
And to Neglect our Fiſhing
upon this Conſideration, is to
Quit all Navigation, and leave
our ſelves to the Mercy of the
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> or to be made a Prey
to any that will attack us.</p>
               <p>And then to fear we ſhall
want Vent, is to imagine that
the People will leave off Eating,
and a Great part of the Trade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
World is yet unſerv'd with Fiſh,
and it never could be made appear
that our Herrings lay upon our
Hands for want of a Market.</p>
               <p>And ſince all theſe Objections
are ſufficiently anſwer'd, there is
nothing wanting, but aſſuming
our Antient Right, and taking
Poſſeſſion of the Fiſhery.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding it is ſo
apparently made appear, that this
<hi>National Fiſhery</hi> will redound ſo
much to the Glory of the King,
Honour of our Senatours Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in Parliament, and Welfare
of the Kingdom in General.</p>

               <p>But here is the Queſtion to be

               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:110708:41"/>
Again; as he that is Maſter of a

of every Town, when it ſhall
pleaſe him; ſo he that is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Sea, may in ſome ſort,
be ſaid, to be Maſter of every

all the Neighbouring Countries

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:110708:41"/>
And if this Nation is once over

be the moſt miſerable People in the

laſt paſt, Lorded it over the

               <p>But if once the Naval Power

it muſt prove a Fatal overthrow,

                     <hi>BY your Letters, and otherwiſe,
I perceive many Jealouſies
and Diſcourſes are raiſed upon the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:110708:51"/>
Preparations of His Majeſty's Fleet,
which is now in ſuch forwardneſs,
that we doubt not but within this
Month, it will appear at Sea. It
is therefore expedient, both for
your Satisfaction and Direction, to
inform you particularly, what was
the Occaſion, and what is His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Intention in this Affair:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> we hold it a Principle, not
to be denied (as it may be prov'd
from undeniable Record) That the
King of </hi>Great Britain,<hi> is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
at Land and Sea, to the
full extent of His Dominions; and
that it concerneth Him, as much to
maintain His Sovereignty in the</hi>Britiſh<hi> Seas, as within His Three
Kingdoms; becauſe without<note n="*" place="margin">*</note> That,
theſe cannot be kept ſafe; nor He
preſerve His Honour and due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
with other Nations. But
Commanding the Sea, he may cauſe
his Neighbours, and all Countries,
to ſtand upon their Guard, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he thinks fit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:110708:51"/>
And this cannot be doubted,<note place="margin">☞</note>
that whoſoever will encroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him by Sea, will do it alſo by
Land, when they ſee their time.
To ſuch Preſumption, <hi>Mare Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berum,</hi>
gave the firſt Warning-piece,
which muſt be anſwer'd
with a Defence of <hi>Mare Clauſum;</hi>
not ſo much by Diſcourſe, as by
the lowder Language of a Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Navy; To be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
when over-ſtrain'd Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſeeth no hope of preſerving
her Right by other Means.</p>
                  <p>The degrees by which His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Dominion at Sea, hath of
latter Years been impeached, and
then queſtion'd, are as Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as Notorious.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to cheriſh, and as it were,
to nouriſh our unthankful Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
we gave them Leave to
gather Wealth and Strength upon
our Coaſts, in our Ports, by our
Trade, and by our People: Then
they were glad to invite our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Reſidence,
with what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:110708:52"/>
they would deſire. Then
they offer'd us the Sovereignty of
their Eſtates; and then they ſu'd
for Licenſe to Fiſh upon our
Coaſts, and obtained it under the
Great Seal of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which now
they ſuppreſs.</p>
                  <p>And when thus by Leave, or by
Connivance, they had poſſeſs'd
themſelves of our Fiſhings, not
only in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but in <hi>Ireland</hi>
and <hi>England;</hi> and by our Staple,
had raiſed a great Stock of Trade,
by theſe Means they ſo increaſed
their Shipping and Power at Sea,
that now they endure not to be
kept at any diſtance: Nay, they
are grown to that Confidence, to
keep Guards upon our Seas, and
then project an Office and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Aſſurance, for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Trade; and withal
prohibit us free Commerce within
our Seas, and take our Ships and
Goods, if we conform not to their
Placarts. What Inſolences and
Cruelties they have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:110708:52"/>
us heretofore in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in
<hi>Greenland,</hi> and in the <hi>Indies,</hi> is
too well known to all the World.</p>
                  <p>In all which, tho' our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and their Wrongs, may
ſeem forgotten; yet the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of His Majeſty's Honour, is
ſtill the ſame, and will refeſh their
Memories, as there ſhall be Cauſe.
For tho' Charity muſt remit wrongs
done to private Men; yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
upon the Publick may
make it a greater Charity to do
Juſtice on crying Crimes. All
this notwithſtanding, you are to
conceive, that the Work of this
Fleet, is Revenge, or Execution of
Juſtice for theſe great Offences
paſt, but Chiefly for the future,
to ſtop the violent Current of that
Preſumption, whereby the Men of
War, and Free-booters of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(abuſing the Favour of His
Majeſty's peaceable and moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Government) whereby he hath
permitted all his Friends and Allies,
to make uſe of his Sea-ports,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:110708:53"/>
at a reaſonable and free Manner,
according to his Treaties) have
taken upon them the Boldneſs,
not only to come confidently at all
times into all his Ports and Rivers,
but to convey their Merchant
Ships ſo high as his Chief City,
and then to caſt Anchor cloſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Magazines; and to contemn
the Commands of his Officers,
when they have required a further
diſtance.</p>
                  <p>But which is more intolarable,
have aſſaulted and taken one
another within His Majeſties
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Downs.</note> Chamber, and within his Rivers;
to the Scorn and Contempt of
his Dominon and Power; and
this being of late years an Ordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
Practice, which we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
in vain to Reform by
the way of Juſtice and Treaties,
the World, I think, will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
that we have Reaſon to
look about us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:110708:53"/>
And no Wiſe Man will doubt,
but it is high time to put our
ſelves in this Equipage upon the
Seas; and not to ſuffer that Stage
of Action to be taken from us,
for want of our Appearance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So you ſee the General Ground
upon which our Counſel Stands; In
particular, you may take Notice, and
Publiſh as cauſe requires; That
His Majeſty by his Fleet intendeth
not a Rupture with any Prince or
State, nor to Infringe any Point of
his Treaties, but reſolveth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
and Maintain that Happy
Peace wherewith God hath Bleſſed
his Kingdom, and to which all his
Actions and Negotiations have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

muſt be maintain'd by the Arm
of Power, which only keeps down
War by keeping up Dominion;
His Majeſty thus provoked, finds it
Neceſſary for his own Defence and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110708:54"/>
ſafety, to re-aſſume and keep his
Antient and undoubted Right, in
