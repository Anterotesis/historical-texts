            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>At the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the late Warr, they were Masters of the Tower, the Navy; of all considerable Towns, Forts, and Magazines: They had a great part of the Crown, and Church-Revenues under their Command, and <hi>London</hi> at their Beck; beside the Plunder of Malignants, and the bountiful Contributions of the well-affected. <hi>Scotland</hi> was already Confoederate with them, in <hi>One</hi> Rebellion; and they had made sure of <hi>Another</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting, and with-holding the only Person capable to keep them Quiet: the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>) which Broyle they further Assisted, by manifest Opposals of his Majesty's Resolutions to suppress it.

the Acts of a Regular, and Complete Authority. This was the Condition of the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> Power <hi>Formerly,</hi> but (blessed be God) they are not at present so Formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. VII. TOLERATION,</hi> causes Confusion both in Church and State.</head>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
                  <p>GEntlemen, To come quick to the Business; My Exceptions to your Proposal of <hi>Toleration,</hi> shall be Reduc'd to <hi>Four Heads:</hi> My <hi>First</hi> Exception ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from the very Nature of the Thing it self; My <hi>Second,</hi> from this <hi>Iuncture of Time</hi> wherein it is Desired; My <hi>Third,</hi> from the Consideration of the <hi>Partyes</hi> that Desire it; and My <hi>Last</hi> Exception, proceeds from the Reverence I bear to the <hi>Authority</hi> that is to Grant it. Now, if You please, Wee'l begin with the First, and pass to the Rest in Order.</p>
                  <p>My First Argument against <hi>Toleration,</hi> is This: It is (in those that press it) <hi>a Tacit Condemnation of an Establisht Law,</hi> and not without some Reflection upon the Supreme Authority it self. If there was Reason for the Making of it, There is yet More for the Observing of it; by how much an Universal Obedience is more Profitable to the Publique, than any Particular Constitution.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Scrup.</speaker>
                  <p>It would be well, If you would bring all People to the same Mind, before ye force them to the same Rule.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
                  <p>But it would be Ill if you should admit of no
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95357:22"/>
Rule at all, till you had found out One, that all the world should be pleas'd with.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Scrup.</speaker>
                  <p>We do not ask the <hi>Vacating</hi> of a Law, but the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing</hi> of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
                  <p>Why then, You ask a Worse Thing; for it were Much better for the Publique, utterly to vacate a Good Law, then to suffer the Withdrawing of that Reverence which is due even to a Bad one. If the <hi>Reason</hi> of such or such a Law be gone, <hi>Repeal</hi> the <hi>Law;</hi> but to let the <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fall,</hi> and the <hi>Law Stand,</hi> is, not only to Introduce, but to Proclaim a Disorder in the Government. The Law, in fine, is, an Act of Publique, and Impartial Justice, not made for This, or That Particular, but for a Common Good.</p>
                  <p>My Second Exception to <hi>Tolcration,</hi> is, Because it Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a kind of <hi>Assent</hi> (let me not say <hi>Submission</hi>) both to the <hi>Equity</hi> of the <hi>Subjects Complaint,</hi> and to the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Tolerated Opinion,</hi> which, in some Degree, seems to <hi>Authorise a Separation.</hi> Now let it be once admitted, that any <hi>One</hi> Law may be Question'd by the Multitude; the Consequence reaches to all the <hi>Rest:</hi> Let it be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either, that any <hi>One sort of People</hi> may be allowed to challenge any <hi>One Law,</hi> All other Opinions have the same Right of Compleyning.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Scrup.</speaker>
                  <p>But we do not question either the Prudence of the <hi>Law-makers,</hi> or the General Equity of the <hi>Constitution;</hi> only where God has not given us Consciences suitable to the Rule, we do humbly begg of his Majesty to bestow upon us a Rule that may comply with our Consciences.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
                  <p>Would you have a Law made that shall comply with <hi>All Consciences?</hi> Ye demand an Impossibility. God Himself never made a Law that pleased all people. Oh! but the Imposition under a <hi>Penalty</hi> troubles ye. Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away the <hi>Sanction,</hi> and what signifies the <hi>Law?</hi> Well, but You would be exempt I perceive from the general Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; so would every man else, and then there's no Law at all: In short, Ye cannot say what ye would have. Would ye have a particular Indulgence? Where's the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95357:23"/>
Equity of it as to Those that are Excluded? Will ye have it Generall? Where's the Conscience of it, when all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies are entertain'd. You should consider, that Lawes are fram'd with a regard to the Community; and they ought to stand Firm and Inexorable: If once they come to hearken to <hi>Particular Clamours,</hi> and to side with <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interests, the Reverence of Government is shaken.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ze.</speaker>
                  <p>You have speculated here some Airy Inconveniences; but where's the Real hazard of receding from that <hi>Inexorable</hi> strictness? (as you call it.)</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Conf.</speaker>
                  <p>First, the Magistrate makes himself of a Party with Those that he Tolerates, against Those that he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which drawes an envy upon the Government.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Tolerated Party becomes a Sanctuary for all the seditious Persons in the Kingdom. It was well said of one (whom I esteem more for his <hi>Wit</hi> than his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi>) speaking of a Thin House of Commons; <hi>It looks</hi> (says he) <hi>like a Parish Church that borders upon a Conventicle.</hi> And the very Truth of it is, <hi>A Schismatical Lecturer,</hi> is as bad as a <hi>Rosted Dogg</hi> in a <hi>Dove-house,</hi> he tolls away all the Pigeons i'th Countrey. Not that the People throng to him for the Excellency of the <hi>Man,</hi> or of the <hi>Way,</hi> but they Meet to Proclaim Themselves Masters of the Law, and to count how many Thousand souls there are, even in this sinfull Nation, that will not <hi>bow the Knee to Baal.</hi> Let them go on, and within a while, the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps shall sue to <hi>Them,</hi> for the same Toleration They now begg from <hi>Him,</hi> and go without it; that is, unless His Majesty has better luck then his Father (which God send him, for he has several of the very same Persons to deal withall.)</p>
                  <p>Another Objection may be This; If there be any Reason for <hi>Granting</hi> a Toleration, 'tis Probable the Reason will be stronger for <hi>Continuing</hi> it; so that, in Time, the People shall Challenge That as a <hi>Right,</hi> which They now only Demand as a <hi>Favour;</hi> and the next Motion is into a <hi>Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Reformation.</hi> Let me add to what I have said, that a Toleration does not only Evirtuate the Law, but it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95357:23"/>
produces a total Dissolution of Ecclesiastical Order, and consequently begets a Confusion both in Church and State.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Pa. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>of God have thoughtful heads, and trembling hearts. (Or, to put this Doctrine into a Gospel-Dress) When the Gospel is in Danger of losing, when Gospel-Ordinances are in Danger of being lost, and Gospel-Ministers in Danger of losing, then the People of God have trembling heads, and careful and solicitous hearts about it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:95357:31"/>Secondly, <hi>A true Child of God is more troubled, and more</hi>

                     <hi>solicitous what shall become of the Ark, then what shall become of Wife and Children, or Estate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He gives you in the next place, <hi>Four Reasons,</hi> Why the<note place="margin">Pa. 7.</note> People of God are so much Troubled when the Ark of God is in Danger.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>For the great</hi> Love <hi>they bear to the Ordinances of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pa. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>God, and to the Faithfull Ministers of Christ. They cannot be silent; they cannot but Tremble when they see the Ark of God in Danger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>They are Troubled, because of the</hi> Interest <hi>they</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>have in the Ark. The Ordinances of God are the Iewels of a</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pa. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Christian, and the Treasures of a Christian, and the Loss of them cannot but Trouble them. And Iesus Christ is the Ioy of a Christian, and therefore when Christ is departing, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be much afflicted at it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are Troubled because of their</hi> Accessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<note place="margin">Pa. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>to the losing of the Ark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The People of God are Troubled because of the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pa. 8.</note> Mischiefs <hi>that come upon a Nation, when the Ark of God is Lost. The Tongue of man is not able to Express the Misery of That Nation where the Ark of God is Taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> When the Ark of God is taken, then the wayes<note place="margin">Pa. 9.</note> of <hi>Sion</hi> mourn, and none come to the Solemn Assemblies; It was the complaint of the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 4. That is matter of sadness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Ministers of Christ are then driven into Corners. And that is matter of heart-trembling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Souls of Many are then in Danger, when the Gospel is gone, your Souls are in hazard: There is cause of sadness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Enemies of God Blaspheme, and are ready to say, <hi>Where is your God?</hi> Then do the Enemies of God Triumph.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Then is Jesus Christ trampled under foot,<note place="margin">Pa. 10.</note> and the Ordinances of God defiled and trampled on, and then Blasphemy and Atheism comes in like an Armed man.</p>

                  <p>Another thing that makes him fear the Loss of the Ark, is, <hi>The Abundance of Priests, and Iesuits, that are in the midst</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pa. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>of us, and the Preaching of Popery amongst Us, and the Prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of people to run headlong to the Garlick and Onions of</hi> Egypt <hi>again.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here's a direct Arraignment of the <hi>King,</hi> and of his <hi>Ministers.</hi> Where are Our <hi>Moses</hi>'s, &amp;c.—What is This but to say, Beloved, ye see, <hi>Iesus Christ is Departing, Idolatry is breaking In upon us, and Our</hi> Moses'<hi>s, Our</hi> Ely's, <hi>never look after it.</hi> Pray'e lay it a little more to Heart, your <hi>selves.

                     <hi>of Trading; of This Civil Burden, and That Civil Burden: but where's the Man or Woman that Complains of This Misery.</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:95357:32"/>
                     <hi>The Loss of the Ark? Who lays to Heart, Who Regards what shall become of Religion? There is a strange kind of Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, and Lukewarmness upon most Peoples Spirits: so they may have their Trading go on, and Their Civil Burdens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, they care not what becomes of the Ark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is This, but to bring <hi>Authority</hi> to the <hi>Barr,</hi> and set the <hi>Subject</hi> upon the <hi>Bench?</hi> What is it, but in plain Terms, to sollicit the Multitude to a <hi>Tumult?</hi> For Mr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi> knowes very well, that they have no other way in the world to do him a service in This Case, but by <hi>Sedition.</hi> And for fear of Mistakes, Note, I beseech ye, with what Care the Good man leads them to his Meaning: They can complain of <hi>Taxes</hi> he sayes, but Hee would have them Complain for the <hi>Loss</hi> of the <hi>Ark;</hi> That is, in honest <hi>English,</hi> He would have them <hi>Clamour against the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.</hi> The very Truth is, This Gentleman speaks both upon <hi>Experience,</hi> and <hi>Foresight;</hi> for no man knowes better, both what it <hi>has</hi> done, and what it <hi>may</hi> do. First, as to his <hi>Foresight, Rebellion</hi> can never be made <hi>God's Cause,</hi> but by taking the <hi>Ark</hi> into the <hi>Quarrel.</hi> Next, to his <hi>Experience.</hi> This Person was <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Five</hi> that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd the Cause of the <hi>Rabble</hi> against <hi>Bishops,</hi> some Twenty Years agoe. <hi>There</hi> was compleyning for fear of the <hi>Ark</hi> too: and what Ensu'd upon it, but the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> the <hi>Scandal</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Murder</hi> of the <hi>King?</hi> He Blames the People next for their <hi>Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> Pray mark me; They have been once in Arms al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready since the King came in. They make no scruple at all of Affronting the <hi>Law:</hi> They have Enter'd into several Plotts upon the very <hi>Person</hi> of his <hi>Sacred Majesty,</hi> and All This, <hi>for fear of the Ark,</hi> as the poor Wretches miserably Imagine. If <hi>This Zeal</hi> be not <hi>sufficient,</hi> I wonder what Temper it is that our <hi>Religious Salamander</hi> would perswade them to: Now take the whole Matter in Complication, and you have</p>

again, [<hi>When you are derided for hazarding Lives and Estates in This Cause, you must reply,</hi> It is for God, and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

                  <p>We have it now from the same Hand, that <hi>the Ark is in Danger,</hi> and what's that but <hi>The Good Old Cause</hi> over again, only a little vary'd in the Dress?
