         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SERMON
ON
<bibl>2 SAM. XVIII. XXVIII.</bibl>
            </head>
            <epigraph>
               <q type="sub">And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the King,
all is well. And he fell down to the Earth
upon his face before the King, and said,
Blessed be the Lord thy God, which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up the men that lift up their hand against
my Lord the King.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Preacher tells us, that that
which hath been, is now, and
that which is to be, hath already
been, and There is no new thing under the
Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96581:5"/>
We have had, and have still the same
Instances of Danger: what befell <hi>David,</hi>
in the case of his Son <hi>Absalom,</hi> hath befaln
our Sovereign, of a like unnatural Son,
both Righteous Kings afflicted with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Off-spring. And if there be divers
circumstances in either of these hellish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies,
Ours hath been heightned of far
more endearing Kindness. As <hi>Absalom</hi> by
fair Speeches did steal the hearts of <hi>Israel,</hi>
2 Sam. 15. 5, 6. <hi>And it was so, that when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
came nigh to him, to do him Obeysance, he put
forth his hand, and kissed him, And on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
did</hi> Absalom <hi>to all Israel, that came to the
King for Iudgment, so</hi> Absalom <hi>stole the hearts
of the men of Israel.</hi> And our Israel can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
this hath been no new thing, for that
which hath been of old time, was also pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
of our <hi>Absalom.</hi> Again, the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
that was to begin at <hi>Hebron</hi> did happen
under pretence of paying of a Vow unto
the Lord, that is, under the Veil or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
of Religion, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 7. <hi>Absalom
said unto the King, Let me go and pay my Vow,
which I have vowed unto the Lord in Hebron.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96581:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But this pretence of a Vow was only in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
to send Spies through all the Tribes of
<hi>Israel,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>Assoon as ye hear the sound of
the Trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in Hebron.</hi> Nothing more usual than to
give out the Cause of Christ, whilst under
that Vizor, they act Parts quite contrary to
his Holy Doctrine and blessed example, so
true is the Observation of the Preacher, <hi>That
which hath already been, now is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if the Kings Declaration (for this
Days Deliverance) had been the very Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
of the Text. And this is ever obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
in a well-formed Conspiracy (if a
Conspiracy can in any sense be so expressed)
First, To settle it self under some chief Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that especially of Popular Arts, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated
himself into the Multitude, giving
out himself to be some Mighty one, and
what he wants of a just Title, (as that ought
ever to be pretended in an Hereditary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
he will make good, in his Defence,
of the Peoples Religion, Estates, Lives, and
Liberties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96581:6"/>
The business is, to cheat the World with
a pretence of Sanctity and Zeal, and to
blind the Peoples eyes more strongly in
these Mischievous Attempts; they do ever
joyn this Chief Leader with some notable
<hi>Achitophel,</hi> that is, some experienced Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
(if such can be procured) as hath
been formerly eminent or successful in the
overthrow of a State or Kingdom, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
15. 12. <hi>And Absolom sent for Achitophel the
Gilonite, David</hi>'s <hi>Counsellor, from his City, even
from Giloh, while he offered Sacrifices; and the
Conspiracy was strong, for the People encreased
continually with Absalom.</hi> And this was profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
done (as being no new thing under the
Sun) in the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> And to
make it farther appear, that the Church hath
formerly had such Enemies, he is at large
described in <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 2. 3, 4. <hi>He flattereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his own Eyes, until his iniquity be found
to be hateful; the words of his mouth are Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and deceit, he hath left off to be wise, and to
do good; he imagineth Mischief upon his Bed, &amp;c.</hi>
A Character so peculiar to our <hi>Achitophel,</hi>
that instead of describing (as some Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96581:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do hereby) an Enemy (in general) of
the Church of God.) It seems a special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
(for so <hi>David</hi> was a Prophet) that
such a wretch should arise in these days.
Now from this Description, ye may
easily conclude, the Conspiracy in a short
time grew very strong. And to this purpose,
there happens a singular Instance in the story
of <hi>Absalom,</hi> how they did continually increase
in numbers; and that was, by sending
messengers through all the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi>
nor can I deliver in more fitting words what
these Spies did intend, than <hi>Tremellius</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase on
this Passage. <hi>Nunciorum speciem

Praecipuorum Israel, Absalonis Partes seductos:</hi>
that is, These Spies did seemingly carry the
joyful news of this Journey to <hi>Herbron. (Re
tamen explorabante)</hi> But in truth, they were
to underfeel the chief of <hi>Israel,</hi> who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to take part in this intended Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
And is not <hi>Tremeliu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

in our Spies? I Or else, what meant the
Multitudes of Men and Horses in most Parts
of <hi>England?</hi> utterly contrary to Law, unless

on (a Reception of the King himself; only to
evince the King's Son (as they flatteringly
stiled him) that by this mighty strength
they were able to make him a King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <p>And now all things being thus ready for
the fatal Blow, (and yet by an All-seeing
Providence no Blow given) The old Fox
that had never learnt that part of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that it was expedient for one man to die for
the Nation, begins to shift for himself. And
pitching an eye on <hi>Holland,</hi> most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with his Common-wealth Genius. He
chose rather to hazard his Den of Foxes, with
his whole Association, than his own precious
Neck to the stroke of Justice. It was this
Association, together with a Vote of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That if the King fell by an untimely
Death, it should be revenged on the Papists,
which first gave birth to this Hellish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,

never such a Piece of <hi>Machiavilian</hi> Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96581:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did enter on the Christian Stage, as this
<hi>Association;</hi> which however they called The
Solemn Union of all true Protestants, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
under this Union, all sorts of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries,
no matter how Dignified or Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
so they were in their wild Principles,
quite opposite to the Communion of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> by Law Established (the
true Protestant here intended, being a Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Member of the Non-conforming Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>) Is not this then
a meer Jesuitism, and a double-refined Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for any of these Conspirators to pretend
themselves of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> when
the true Test, without tricks or evasions means
only the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by Law Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.
No wonder then, if the Sword
intended by this stratagem to be intrusted
with our deadly Enemies of all sorts; it was
very probable, to have been sheathed in the
Bowels of the best of Princes, and his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Brother, his Royal Highness: for it was
the Suppression of the Crown with Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
which they had resolved the best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
for pulling down of Tyranny, and the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:96581:8"/>
And yet had these Weapons, so craftily
formed, prevailed either against Church or
State, these true Protestants had a Salvo at
hand to have laid it on the Papists, a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
bloody enough! Yet their numbers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very few, comparatively with these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries,
(which have overspread this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
they never could have aimed such an
universal Massacre as was designed of these
true Protestants. It is here observable of what
mischievous consequence any Combination
is, of what kind soever, whether influence of
self-Interest, Pride, Ambition, Spight or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice;
to be led out of the Kings High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of Honesty into any By-Paths of our
own, be it in the smallest matter: only at
first perchance into a Combination of lesser
moment; tho only against your Lawful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister:
for ye know not how soon of these
beginnings of Mischief ye may be led into
the broad Road of Rebellion. What a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
should we have had, if this black Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Cloud had broken over our Heads!
Never was Death figured with so many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
shapes, as were visible in this Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96581:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but God have the Praise that we are
in hopes not to see it not only blow over, but
that the Storm is like to fall upon the heads
that raised it. Some of these Treacherous
dealers, who have dealt so very Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
with us, are already fallen into the pit
which they digged for others, and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared
in the mischievous works of their
own hands. And it is to be hoped for the
rest, that their violent dealing will fall upon
their own heads. (For he who is truth itself,
in whom we trust, whose we are, and whom
we serve hath assured us, that wicked and
blood-thirsty-men shall not live out half their
days) For he who is the God of all mercy
abhors the cruel and deceitful man.</p>
            <p>Thus far the Committee of six did suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in this Enterprize, under many Fears
and Jealousies of a Popish Successor, to hold
correspondence in several parts of <hi>England,</hi>
for a general Insurrection, their Followers
being poisoned with several treasonable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
<hi>(viz.)</hi> that it was agreeable with the
Christian Religion, with the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of this Kingdom, to defend the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96581:9"/>
Profession with open Force and Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
That there is a Liberty in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to acquire to themselves that which they
apprehend to be their Right, by Force, if
they cannot obtain it of the Prince by fair
means. And this was especially instanced in
the case of the Bill of Exclusion (where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
on many violences, that were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for compassing this Bill, no passage did
seem more unnatural than a forcing Sir <hi>Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
Ienkins</hi> to carry it up to the House of
Lords, who had best opposed it by his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Reasoning) on purpose to represent
him (had it been possible) a betrayer of
his Trust and Conscience, grounding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on this <hi>Iulian</hi> Principle, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Preservation was the Supreme Law.
Thus did these subtil Foxes (while their
heads looke several ways) carry these
Firebrands between their Tails to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
this flourishing Empire (once more)
into Dust and Ashes. These Opinions, with
divers of the like stamp, I might reasonably
insist much larger (only bound in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of a Sermon.) They can be only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96581:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to give a fair warning, how under
the most colourable pretences we never be
enticed to combine with any number of men
against a Lawful Power; for however they
sweeten or guild over this Poison, there is no
more real way to introduce Popery than a
vain fear of it; and this was the very thing
the Jesuits aim'd at in the Reign of King
<hi>Iames,</hi> and the late unnatural War, to destroy
each other by these Jealousies, and at last,
either by Force or Policy to bring us back to
the Romish Church: nor can we ever enough
abhor this Pestilence, which in several Kings
Reigns hath struck many Subjects dead, by
a due course of Law, too sadly made appear
in the death of the late Lord <hi>Russel,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by this <hi>Scotch</hi> Doctrine, that it is
lawful to defend a mans Conscience by open
Force against any Authority whatsoever, did
dare adventure his Body, (yea I tremble) his
very Soul on this false Bottom, so his execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Paper seems to import; as if purposely
to embolden such persons as are left behind
of the same Leven; instead of a faithful (I
fear) he met a faithless Confessor. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96581:10"/>
believe but that the whole World will
entertain this Discovery with horror; and
tho the Sectaries will endeavour with the
greatest Impudence to deny or mitigate it,
yet certainly this many headed <hi>Hydra</hi> will
receive the Blow which they intended for
our Religion: for who, that is not resolved
to quit Humanity, will believe that Religion
which is to be maintained with Treasons and
Murders of the most purple dye?</p>
            <p>But here a smile must part from me (which
however is lawful enough on a Thanksgiving
day) that all this was to be done to keep out
Popery, when they made it one main branch
of the Conspiracy to say they did fear it, and
when they were to act that themselves which
they had perswaded the World was ever the
contrivance of the Jesuit, <hi>viz.</hi> to murder the
King. In the case of the Bill of Exclusion,
the Duke was to be made away for preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the King. In this Plot the King was
to be Murdered for sake of the Duke; so
King and Duke taken in this sad Dilemma
were after this new Presbyterian Logick to
be both Sacrificed. Where will these Wretches
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96581:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
appear hereafter? That of these hellish men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
reservations did design nothing Base and
Inhumane, when forsooth relying of much
Gallantry in their vast numbers, they did
resolve to do it with Swords in their hands:
but I would ask them what difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Walcot's</hi> Sword, and <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s Poison?
When the Nation had laid weltring (as at
this day) in its purest Blood; such had been
the life of the best of Princes, his Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Brother <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Bishops, Nobility, the Loyal Clergy,
Gentry, and Commons of this Realm: But
instead of these Fiery Tryals, we are to bless
God for a sudden unexpected Fire at <hi>New-market,</hi>
(which the <hi>Worcester</hi> Address excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
expresseth) was purposely kindled a
Sacrifice from Heaven for his Majesties hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Deliverance.</p>
            <p>The Noon-day Star that appeared at
this Glorious Birth, did doubtless presage our
now Dread Soveraign, the peculiar care of
Heaven, to be attended with Miracles, where
ordinary means should fail his Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
instead then of his Majesties being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96581:11"/>
wounded of their deadly Quills, which in
the Language of these <hi>Ishmaelites</hi> did signifie
several instruments of Death, <hi>God shall sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
shoot at them</hi> (as of this days discovery)
<hi>and wound the hairy scalp of such an one,</hi> that still
persisteth in this kind of wickedness.</p>
            <p>Tho it hath pleased an all-powerful God
to preserve his Majesty in his Royal Person,
through the whole course of his Life, safe
and untouched of the innumerable attempts
and devices of his Fanatick Enemies; yet
(as if it pleased the same God) for an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
punishment of these Treasons hereafter,
he hath given way of his permissive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to set their Tongues (as it were) on Fire
from Hell, to speak evil of Dignities, and
such as are in Authority over them. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. says expresly, <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall advisedly Publish or Affirm the King
to be a Heretick or Papist, or that he endeavours
to introduce Popery, to incite or stir the People to
Hatred or Dislike of the Person of his Majesty,
or the Established Government: Every such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Persons being thereof Legally Convicted
shall be disabled to have or enjoy, and is hereby
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96581:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
disabled and inade incapable of having, holding, or
enjoying any Place, Promotion, Office Ecclesiastical,
Civil or Military.</hi> Tho in other Cases these
grand Reformers do seemingly Reverence an
Act of Parliament more than the Word of
God it self, vvhich hath expresly ordained,
<hi>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers;</hi> yet
in this Case fully assured to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of a popular <hi>Odium</hi> to the Government,
rather than of an Act of Parliament; I do
here appeal daily Experience whether this
be not the <hi>Billinsgate</hi> Language of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Saints? to burthen the King and all
his Loyal Subjects with the hateful name of
Papist: certainly a more senseless piece of
detraction was never invented on this side
<hi>Bedlam,</hi> than to Brand the Church of <hi>England</hi>
by Law Established with the name of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
who are the only Bulwark against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
and Phanaticks. And to deliver a known
Truth, all sorts of Sectaries (how different
soever) in other Opinions and Interests are
here like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> made Friends, for a
Crucifying the true Church of God; an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
to this purpose being first a demure
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96581:12"/>
hatching abominable Scandals in Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,
to belch them afterwards more loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
being heightned with Wine in several Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick
Taverns, for these Shops of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
formerly objected on the Loyal Party,
are become Nurseries of Rebellion, Incest,
Drunkenness, Debauchery of every kind,
becoming the sure marks of these chief
Leaders of Sedition. The Lambs were ever
allowed to skip and play, (but in this age
joyned with Atheists) they may leap over
Mountains; for, if you are for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
Vice shall pass for Virtue, Falshood
for Truth.</p>
            <p>Enough (I trust in God) to discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
wickedness hereafter, and no Loyal
Person ever to be out-stript of his real Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the seeming pretence of it in others:
so of this glib Treason of the Tongue as it
usually happens, they were hastning to
downright Blows.</p>
            <p>Several places appointed of these Traitors
for this purpose, but with all imaginable
Thanksgiving disappointed of an Almighty
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:96581:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Rumbold</hi> a <hi>Malster;</hi> a suitable Leader of
these Sick-brained Wretches, staggering too
and fro like Drunken men, yea, at their wits
ends, of the deep draught which they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
taken in of Sin and Treason.</p>
            <p>These Bulls of <hi>Bashan</hi> far more disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
cruel, than the Bulls in <hi>Red-Lyon Fields,</hi>
where again of Savage minds, they thirsted
after Royal Blood.</p>
            <p>But why all this while no news from
<hi>Scotland?</hi> Such a Train of Mischief to be
hatched in any part of the World and no
<hi>Scotch</hi> Treachery intermingled with it?
Can there be a War at <hi>Hebron,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of paying a Vow to the Lord? Or in
<hi>England</hi> under colour of Religion, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it of the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant?</hi>
The Serpent may want his Sting, or the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Poison; but I fear this People will
never be without an <hi>Argyle</hi> or a <hi>Ferguson,</hi>
yet I must acknowledge, some few of Her
Nobility, with her late Parliaments have
somewhat atton'd past Offences: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
this Correspondence now intended,
was rather to be held with the Field-meeters
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96581:13"/>
than any sober heads of that Nation, for
sure they have been so many years a Passing
mark of Infamy (over the habitable Earth)
for selling the late King of Blessed Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as <hi>Iudas</hi> did his Saviour; that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
delight in a continuance of such Disgrace,
as wants a Parallel.</p>
            <p>Now after a Survey of this Hellish Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
which (being one of the meanest
of my Brethren) I have drawn with a very
weak Pensil; a sudden horror nere seizeth
my trembling heart, at the sad apprehension
what had befaln all of us (had this Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
took effect) from the Palace of the
King himself to the meanest Cottage, for
such was the violence of this Treason, that
it seems they had readily concurred to take
up Arms, to destroy the Government, even
before they had agreed what to set up in
the place of it, so instead of a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which they pretended to have been, of
taking up Arms, it must have hapned as it
did in our late Confusions. First, Divisions
had arisen among themselves, and then, on
what side soever Victory had inclined her self,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96581:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Conquered Party must have been Slaves
to the Tyranny and Dust of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
            <p>Then the proud Waters would have gone
over our Soul, they would have swallowed
us up quick, while they were so wrathfully
displeased at us. The face and voice of an
Angel (which hitherto had been for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Estates, Lives, and Liberties,) would
have been changed into the hands of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
to have rent all these in a thousand
pieces, the bleeding marks and lashes of
these Common-wealth-Protestants scarce out
of our sides had been turned into a very
Shambles: For it is a damnable Maxim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them (if ever they again attain the
Power) to destroy all Loyal Families Root
and Branch, for, say they, the sparing these
<hi>Amalekites,</hi> was the high provocation which
Restored <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> to the Throne; no
better Language to have been allowed our
now Dread Sovereign and all his Loyal
Followers.</p>
            <p>Should we ever trust a Rebellion, though
flattered with Golden Lives and Liberties;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96581:14"/>
never any single Person that had signally
served his King and Church, but he shall be
shackled with Iron Fetters. In one word,
to conceive our selves under the mercy of
a Sword, is no other than <hi>England,</hi> now an
Earthly Paradise, to become an <hi>Akeldama;</hi>
that is, a very Field of Blood.</p>
            <p>Therefore the Thanksgiving in the Text
fitly applieth it self on this days Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>Blessed be the Lord thy God, which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up the men, that lift up their hand against
my Lord the King.</p>
            <p>I can compare the Enemies of this day
(next this of the Text) with no fitter Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
examples, than with <hi>Bigthan</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resh,</hi>
the Chamberlains of <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> the great
<hi>Persian</hi> Monarch, <hi>Esther</hi> 2. 21. <hi>Two of the
Kings Eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh were wroth,
and sought to lay hands on the King.</hi> More than
Heathenish wickedness this, to render evil
for good, because the King had raised them
to be the chief keepers of his Body, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the chief seekers of his Blood. The
Text gives no reason for all this, only they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96581:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were angry; yet being said they were angry
in those days, it is agreed by Interpreters, it
was at the Marriage of Queen <hi>Esther,</hi> she
being a Captive of the <hi>Iews, they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
clamor, we shall now all be <hi>Iews,</hi> for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hasuerus</hi>
must not Marry but where <hi>Bigthan</hi>
and <hi>Teresh</hi> do appoint.</p>
            <p>No reason this at all, to forget an Oath of
Allegiance, to cast behind them all past Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
to betray their Trust, to lift up a
hand against God's Anointed. Yet for a far
less Reason were our Traitors full of wrath,
not for the Kings Marriage with a Captive,
but for his near adherence to his own flesh
and blood, his dearest Brother, <hi>Iames</hi> Duke
of <hi>York,</hi> presently we must be all Papists.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Bigthan</hi> and <hi>Teresh,</hi> so our Traitors,
once men of great Wealth and Renown,
some Guardians of the Kings Person, others
of his Council-board, are on a sudden en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapp'd
in the Devices of their own hands.</p>
            <p>This must needs be the Lords doing, and it is
Marvellous in our eyes, O that men would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Praise the Lord for his Goodness, and declare
the Wonders that he doth for the Childen of men!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:96581:15"/>
Sure there are, the better they be dealt
with, the worse still ye shall find them, and
of these <hi>David</hi> was in most danger. Alas!
nothing but a Vow at <hi>Hebron,</hi> when this Vow
was to have deprived him of Life and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
This is the way of them all; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be seen it may do the Mischief that is
meant. What Dangers are they in that are
in this Case? How neer being lost, only the
Kings Enemies being the Enemies of God?
They are preserved of <hi>Ishbenot,</hi> an open Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 16. as well as of <hi>Achitophel,</hi>
a wicked Counsellor. No way (it seems)
to prevail against a Righteous King, except
they can keep back an All-seeing Eye. And
shall it please God to find a watchful Eye to
save us, and shall not we find Lips to Bless
and Magnifie him for it?</p>
            <p>O that men would therefore praise the Lord for
his Goodness, and declare the wonders that he doth
for the Children of Men!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> and <hi>Cushi</hi> strive very hard which
might out-run the other, to bring an earthly
King the defeat of a Rebel-Army. Theirs
was an open Rebellion, opposed of a like open
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96581:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Force, and so in some sence to be ascribed to
the help of men, ours was a close Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
carried on in dark corners, impossible
ever to have seen the Light, so as to have been
prevented, except of an All-mighty God.</p>
            <p>How infinite more Reason then, for each
of us to hasten, which may exceed each other
in our Joys, Praise, and Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p>O that Men would therefore Praise the Lord
for his Goodness, and declare the Wonders that he
doth for the Children of Men.</p>
