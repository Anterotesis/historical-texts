            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS I had the honour to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>you in your Travels to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo I had the oppotunity of making ſome Remarks in our way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from thence to <hi>Naples;</hi> where the Antiquities are not leſs curious than what you ſaw in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; which I here humbly preſent

you with a review of in a piece of proſpective: Which, though it be done by an ill hand, yet it may help to Commemorate to you most of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Things you took notice of when you was there. I had not room in this ſmall Tract to mention any thing of Politicks, or Conſtitution of Governments in any of theſe Princes Courts or Republicks that we paſſed through, having no deſign at preſent but to point out to you the way you Travelled, and the Distance from Place to Place, with Obſervations made of the Antiquities of <hi>Rome, Naples,</hi> and other Places; together with the Strength, Beauty and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of ſome other Towns and Forts in <hi>Italy;</hi> the beſt Painting, Carving, and Limning, and ſome other both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Artificial Curioſities, which you your ſelf took ſuch particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, that they cannot but remain ſtill freſh in your Memory: However I have made bold to preſent you with this Poor Aſſiſtance, which may

ſerve inſtead of a Lame Antiquary, if peradventure you ſhould meet with any private Inducement, or Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Publick Trust, to carry you again into thoſe Parts.

A <hi>New JO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RNAL</hi> FROM GENEVE TO ROME And from thence to NAPLES.</head>
            <p>SIR, You may well remember when you left <hi>England</hi> and went to <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> there to carry on that Noble Education you Commenced at home, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred your ſelf in one of the beſt Academies, and there continued near Two Years and an Half;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44934:5"/>
from whence, after a more than ordinary Improvement in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Arts and Sciences, and other the Studies and Exerciſes of that Place; your Genius led you to make a farther Progreſs in your Travels; And then you left <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſet forward by the way of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> for <hi>Geneve,</hi> where after you had paſſed ſome time you reſolved to go for <hi>Italy;</hi> ſo that taking your leave of <hi>Geneve,</hi> you came to a little Town called <hi>Remille</hi> in <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſeven Leagues from <hi>Geneve,</hi> where we lay the firſt night; within three Leagues of this Town lies the Lake of <hi>Anſi</hi> and Town ſo called. The 18<hi>th.</hi> we came to <hi>Chambery,</hi> five leagues from <hi>Romillie;</hi> it is the Principal Town in <hi>Savoy,</hi> and where the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> formerly kept his Court, where we ſtaid Dinner, and the ſame night lay at <hi>Montmillian,</hi> two leagues from <hi>Chambery,</hi> where we took notice of the Fortreſs or Caſtle of <hi>Montmillian,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44934:5"/>
It is partly built upon, and partly hewed out of a Rock, eſteemed the ſtrongeſt that belongs to the Duke of <hi>Savoy. Lewis</hi> the 13<hi>th,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> lay 13 months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, in which time (from three Batteries, whereof one was on the further ſide of the River <hi>Iſere,</hi> the other two on this ſide) he ſhot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fort above Ten Thouſand Cannon Bullets, and ſprang Two Mines, all which not anſwering his Expectations, and finding himſelf unable to take it, although he had taken the Town that joyns to the Fort, concludes a Peace and raiſes the Seige. From <hi>Montmillian</hi> we came to St. <hi>Michel,</hi> thirteen leagues all along upon the River <hi>Iſere,</hi> or rather <hi>Arche,</hi> becauſe it only bears the name of <hi>Iſere</hi> near to <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millian,</hi> where we lay the 29<hi>th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Thirtieth we came to dinner to <hi>Breamant,</hi> five Leagues more, and from thence to <hi>Landbourg,</hi> where we lay that night, being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44934:6"/>
two leagues from <hi>Bramont,</hi> ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the River <hi>Are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oct.</hi> 1. we hired Mules to carry us up the <hi>Alps</hi> by the way of Mount <hi>Senis,</hi> and came to <hi>Ramaſſe</hi> being one league, from thence to the great Croſs two leagues more, which is the higheſt part of the Mountain that you go over, from whence we came to <hi>Boſſoline</hi> to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which is about 12 miles more, from thence to <hi>Villiane</hi> eight miles, where we lay that night. And the 2d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Oct.</hi> we came to <hi>Turin,</hi> being about ten or twelve miles from <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Turin</hi> we ſaw the Duke and Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Princeſs his Siſter, that ſhoots flying ſo well; we took a view of the Dukes Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the fine Gallery of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, the black marble Chappel that had been ſo many years a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not finiſhed when we ſaw it, is one of the fineſt things in <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin;</hi> we ſaw the Church where they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44934:6"/>
ſay is kept the winding Sheet of our Saviour Chriſt, beſides ſeveral other fine Churches: Eſpecially that of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> in which there is a moſt noble Altar. One of the ſeven days we ſtayed here, I hapned, in my ramble about the Town to go into a Church, where I heard a great deal of good ſinging by Eunuchs, and very good muſick; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, I found by the Peoples gazing and ſtaring, earneſtly to one part of the Church, that there was ſomething more to come, which was as follows; from a corner of the Church, out of ſome Chappel, or Veſtry, there came a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people with great wax lights in their hands, after them followed one of the religious men of that place, with a great ſilver Croſs, then followed all the reſt of the religious men ſinging, after them came four Trumpets ſounding, then the Image of the V. <hi>Mary</hi> followed, being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upon a frame by four luſty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44934:7"/>
like Porters, in blue Frocks: The figure was about the bigneſs of an ordinary woman, carved out of wood, and very richly dreſſed, painted and curled; wearing upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a long Robe of Cloth of Silver, with a Crown on her head; in her arms ſhe carried a little Image, well carved and finely dreſſed, like a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boy, which repreſented the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, holding between his hands a pair of Beads; as this Image paſſed through the middle alley of the Church, all the people that could come near it touched it with their Beads, and thoſe that could not come near, by reaſon of the preſs, handed their Beads from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they might touch her Garment, from whence undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did believe, proceeded great Virtue: After they came out of the Church it was carried in Proceſſion through part of the City, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounding before, and all people meeting it, or going with it, by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44934:7"/>
kneeling, bowing and croſſing themſelves, paid an adoration to it; to my great Aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>About five miles from <hi>Turin</hi> there is a houſe of the Duke of <hi>Savoys,</hi> called the <hi>Venere,</hi> very curious for Painting, Pictures and Waterworks; in the Gardens there is ſeveral ſort of Fowl, worth taking notice of.</p>
            <p>About a mile from <hi>Turin,</hi> upon the ſide of a Hill, there is a fine Convent of <hi>Capuſin</hi> Friers; and a fine houſe called the <hi>Valentine,</hi> about half a mile from <hi>Turin,</hi> upon the River <hi>Po:</hi> It was built by Madam <hi>Royall,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Mother, and Siſter to <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new Fortifications that the Duke is making about <hi>Turin,</hi> being all of Brick, conſiſting only of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and Curtains, are worth your obſervation.</p>
            <p>The 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Oct.</hi> we left <hi>Turin,</hi> and went to <hi>Villeneufe,</hi> a little Garriſon of Fourſcore men, ten miles from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44934:8"/>
               <hi>Turin,</hi> where we dined. The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon obſerving us to be ten or twelve Horſemen in company, would not let above two at a time come into the Town. From this town we went to <hi>Aſte</hi> ten miles more, it being the laſt town that way belonging to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> it is indifferently well fortified, and hath four Regiments of Souldiers in it.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Aſte</hi> we came the 11<hi>th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of <hi>Oct.</hi> to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a great Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Milo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſe,</hi> twenty miles from <hi>Aſte,</hi> from whence the ſame night we arrived at <hi>Voltaggio,</hi> two and twenty miles more, where we were forced by tempeſtuous weather, of Rain, Wind, Thunder and Hail; which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable damage in thoſe parts, to ſtay till the 13<hi>th,</hi> and then ſet out for <hi>Genoua,</hi> where we arrived that night, being twenty miles from <hi>Voltaggio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Genoua</hi> we ſaw a great many Churches, very rich, and their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44934:8"/>
ſtructures very noble, being moſt of them within ſide cruſted with Marble, and Marble Pillars; we ſaw ſeveral Noblemens Pallaces, but in particular, that of Seignior <hi>Dalbi,</hi> where amongſt other fine things, there is a Looking-glaſs valued at ſixty thouſand Crowns; we ſaw the Doge, and his Pallace, with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and what elſe was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 16<hi>th.</hi> we went from <hi>Genoua</hi> by Sea, in Barks, ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſo called, that row with four Oars; and lay the firſt night at a place on the Sea ſhore called <hi>Ceſte,</hi> being thirty miles. The 17<hi>th.</hi> we took our Barks again, and went by Sea to <hi>Leriſh,</hi> thirty Miles more, where we lay the next day, the weather being bad at Sea we quitted our Veſſels, and hired Horſes; and the firſt night lay at <hi>Santa Pietra,</hi> twenty Miles, and thence to <hi>Luca</hi> ſixteen Miles, where we lay <hi>Friday</hi> the 19<hi>th.</hi> and ſaw ſeveral fine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44934:9"/>
Churches, in particular, that of St. <hi>Frediano,</hi> where we ſaw the Coffin that <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, King of <hi>England</hi> was buried in as he went a Pilgrim to <hi>Rome.</hi> In St. <hi>Auguſtins</hi> Church they ſhewed us a place, where a fellow having loſt all his money at Cards, and afterwards ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving play'd away all the Cloaths he had from his back, in a great rage began to curſe and to ſwear, and taking up a Stone, in that mad fit threw it againſt the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> from whence imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the blood guſhed out, upon which the ground opened and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him up alive. This ſtory they report to you for a great truth. In another Church they pretend to ſhew you the firſt Croſs or Crucifix that ever was made after the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion of our Saviour, and tell you the Story thus, that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken the buſineſs, and ſhaping his work in figure like to a man, had finiſhed the Crucifix save
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44934:9"/>
only the Head, which ſo puzzled him, that he was not able to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with it: In the mean time, being wearied with contriving that part of it, but without ſucceſs, fell aſleep, and after ſome time being awakened from ſleep, he found a Head by him ſent from Heaven, which he fixed to the reſt of his work, and ſo finiſhed the Crucifix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is all beſet with Pearls, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and other Precious Stones, wonderful rich: We ſaw the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, where they ſay is Arms ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for twenty five thouſand men. The fortifications of the Town, which is very ſtrong, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of eleven Baſtions, a Lorillion or ear-faſhion, with Half-moons upon the Curtins: there is planted upon every Baſtion ſixteen pieces of Cannon.</p>
            <p>The 20th of <hi>October</hi> we went from <hi>Luca</hi> to <hi>Piſa,</hi> ten miles, where we dined: We ſaw there the Dome or Cathedral Church, of which the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44934:10"/>
four great doors are all of Copper, containing the Hiſtory of the four Evangeliſts, repreſented by Figures; hard by this Church, we ſaw in a kind of Tower, or ſuch like place, where all the Children are baptized, and where there is the fineſt Echo that ever was heard, and in it a Pulpit of Marble that came from <hi>Armenia,</hi> ſo finely carved that the value of it is ineſtimable. Hard by this you ſee the Leaning Tower, ſo built, to the admiration of all that ſee it, for it hangs over ſo much, that one would think it muſt needs ſall, and yet it is believed to ſtand as ſtrong as if it had been built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; ſo great was the Ingenuity of the Architect. Near the great Church are the Cloyſters to be ſeen, where upon the walls is painted the Hiſtory of the Bible: And in the middle of the Cloyſters, upon the right and left hand, there are two little ſquare Courts, all of holy Earth, they ſay brought from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:44934:10"/>
wherein if you interr a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, all ſhall conſume to the Bones in four and twenty hours time.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Piſa</hi> the ſame day we went to <hi>Leghorne,</hi> where the only thing worth taking notice of is the Mould, where the Shipping rides ſafe: The Town is fortified with Baſtions and large Ditches. We went out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity and ſaw the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogue in the time of their Devotions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 23d of <hi>October</hi> we went from <hi>Leghorne</hi> and came again to <hi>Piſa,</hi> where we dined, and after dinner went and ſaw the Phyſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden of the Great Duke of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> in which there is a Gallery furniſhed with abundance of Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; whereof one that I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of was the Scull of a Man or Woman, with a great piece of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral growing to it; and alſo a ſmall Anchor with ſeveral pieces of Coral naturally fixed to it; both which things were ſo found in the Sea. We went the ſame night to <hi>la Scala,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44934:11"/>
a great Inn ſo called, where we lay, being thirty ſix miles from <hi>Leghorne,</hi> and half way between <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day being the 24th of <hi>October,</hi> we arriv'd at <hi>Florence,</hi> 20 miles from <hi>la Scala,</hi> where we ſaw the Chappel of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fineſt of the whole World, for the inſide of it is all Precious Stones, and the Arms of every City belonging to the Great Duke are all of Precious ſtone inlaid, round about the Chappel; within ſide there is likewiſe the Statues of all the great Dukes cut out in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Firſt <hi>Francis,</hi> then <hi>Coſmus</hi> the I. and <hi>Ferdinandus</hi> I. <hi>Coſmus</hi> II. <hi>Ferdinandus</hi> II. and <hi>Coſmus</hi> at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, Third of the name, and Sixth great Duke. From this Chappel we went to the Dome or Cathedral Church, with the Tower by it, whereof all the outſide is finely wrought with Marble of divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; we ſaw the great Dukes Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44934:11"/>
and Gardens, in which there is a great many fine Waterworks: The fineſt thing in <hi>Florence</hi> is the Gallery of rich Cabinets, and the Chamber where there is all ſort of curious Arms; there is a long barrel of a Gun all of maſſy Gold, and ſeveral other great curioſities; we ſaw the Dukes Armory, the wild Beaſts, and ſome fine houſes out of Town, where there is fine Painting and Waterworks, chiefly in that of the great Dukes, called <hi>Pratilin,</hi> ſix Miles from <hi>Florence,</hi> we ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides abundance of fine Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> the Firſt we went from <hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>Pongebouce</hi> 22 miles where we lay. The next day we came to Dinner to <hi>Siena,</hi> 16 miles: It is a Town belonging to the Great Duke, almoſt as big as <hi>Florence,</hi> where we ſaw the Great Church, whereof the Pavement is the fineſt in Chriſtendom; and the Library with its Pavement, deſerves to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of: From hence we went
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44934:12"/>
to <hi>Torriniere</hi> 18 miles where we lay. The next day, being the 3<hi>d</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> we lay at <hi>Aquapendente</hi> 29 miles, from whence we came, and dined, the next day being <hi>Sunday</hi> at <hi>Montefiatſco,</hi> Fifteen miles, where in a little old Church, under ground, we ſaw the Tomb of a <hi>German</hi> Biſhop, who, they ſay, killed himſelf with drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to exceſs the Wine of that place: The ſtory runs thus, That the Biſhop travelling with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants before upon the Road to find out the beſt Wine, with a ſtrict Command to write <hi>EST</hi> upon the Sign, where the Wine was beſt; which accordingly he did, and at the firſt place where he found the Wine to be good writ <hi>EST,</hi> which, when the Biſhop ſaw, concluding the Wine to be very good he ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and with all his Company went in and remained there till he had had his fill of the Wine; then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44934:12"/>
he went forward, his Servant the Purveyor, being ſtill before to find out the next place of good Wine, which appeared to the Biſhop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had travelled much farther, by a double aſſurance of <hi>EST, EST,</hi> which the Servant had marked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sign; There the Biſhop ſtayed longer than he had done at the firſt place of <hi>EST,</hi> finding the Wine to be much better. But at length, in hopes to gratifie his Appetite with a more delicious Wine than what he had met with, goes forward on his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> his Servant going ſtill before with the ſame Command of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtill the beſt Wine with the Old Signal of <hi>EST;</hi> But before he had travelled far he comes to this fatal place of <hi>Montefiaſco,</hi> where the Wine was ſo much better than any he had yet met with in his way to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he thought it deſerved the triple ſignal of <hi>EST, EST, EST,</hi> which accordingly was put upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44934:13"/>
the Sign. The Biſhop being not far behind, ſoon arrived at this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Caſtle of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> where eſpying the Signal, immediately made an halt, and with all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany entred the place, where he found the entertainment ſo ſweet, and the Wine ſo bewitching, that he was not able to leave the place till his life had left him, and then was carried out dead to his Grave, which was hard by in the Vault of a little Church, with a large Stone upon it, and this Epitaph or Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption writ by the Purvoyer his man, in honour of his Maſter.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Eſt, Eſt, Eſt, propter eſt,</l>
               <l>Herus meus mortuus eſt.</l>
            </q>
            <p>From this place we went to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbo,</hi> eight miles more, where we lay; it is a very pretty town, and in moſt of the ſtreets thereof there is fine Fountains. From hence we went the next day to <hi>Capreole,</hi> twelve
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44934:13"/>
miles more, where there is a fine houſe of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> but going to ruine, here we dined and after Dinner went to <hi>Monte Roſſa,</hi> ten miles, where we lay; from whence the next day being <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 6th. of <hi>November,</hi> we came to <hi>Rome,</hi> two and twenty miles more.</p>
            <p>The Eighth of <hi>November</hi> we took our Jonrney for <hi>Naples,</hi> and came the firſt night to <hi>Veletre,</hi> twenty miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> where we ſaw the fine Pallace and Garden of Cardinal <hi>Ginetto.</hi> From thence the next day we went to <hi>Piperno</hi> thirty miles. The next day being <hi>Saturday<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the 10th. of <hi>November</hi> we came to <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> which is the better half way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples.</hi> From this place we came the next day, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> to <hi>Mola:</hi> Where in a great Orange Garden we ſaw the Tomb and Grotto of <hi>Cicero,</hi> that famous Orator. Hard by <hi>Mola</hi> lies <hi>Caeta,</hi> where there is to be ſeen a Rock, which they ſay cleft aſunder at the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44934:14"/>
time of the Crucifixion of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour. From <hi>Mola</hi> we came to <hi>St. Agothas;</hi> and from thence on <hi>Monday</hi> night, the 12th inſtant, we arrived at <hi>Naples,</hi> which is ſome 32 miles from <hi>St. Agothas,</hi> where we ſaw ſeveral fine Churches; but in that of <hi>St. Claires</hi> there is four fine Pillars, which they do aſſert were brought from the Temple of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> At another Church we ſaw the Buſto's, or pieces of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, being the remainder of two Idols called by the names of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> they were formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and worſhipped as Gods by the Heatheniſh people, but St. <hi>Paul</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by that way as he was carried a priſoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> it is ſaid that theſe Idols fell down and broke to pieces, and in their fall the Devil was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to go from them; who whilſt they were whole, ſerved them for a voice, and did uſually ſpeak to thoſe that worſhipped them. The Heads of theſe Idols
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44934:14"/>
they ſay ſome certain Prince has in keeping, for a great curioſity. From hence we went to the <hi>Charter-houſe,</hi> a Convent of Religious men; the building is very fine, ſeated upon a high hill, near the City, cloſe to the Caſtle of St. <hi>Elmo,</hi> from whence you have the beſt ſight of <hi>Naples,</hi> and a proſpect of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, which is believed to be the beſt in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> we hired Horſes and rid out of Town, paſſing through the Grotto of <hi>Pauſilinus,</hi> which <hi>Laſſel</hi> in his Voyage of <hi>Italy</hi> makes mention of. It is near a mile in length, cut, or rather bored through a great Rocky hill, by the Emperour <hi>Lucullus.</hi> It is now uſed as a great high way leading into <hi>Naples;</hi> wherein two Coaches or Carts may meet and paſs by each other eaſily, though the paſſage for near three parts of the way be very dark, without any light at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the light of a ſmall Lamp that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44934:15"/>
hangs in a little Chappel dedicated to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in the middle of the paſſage, upon the right hand, going into the City. And becauſe there may be danger in meeting and running againſt one another in the dark, part of the way, when you hear any noiſe of Horſe or Coach, or the like, which you may eaſily do at a great diſtance, (for the leaſt thing in that Concavity makes a great noiſe) then you uſe theſe words, ſpeaking out aloud, <hi>(a la Montagna, &amp; a la Marina)</hi> which ſignifies, Which way are you to go, either to that ſide which is next the Mountain, or to that next the Sea? by which one avoids the diſaſters that might happen by meeting in the dark. From this Grotto, or high way, we came to the place called <hi>Grotto delcane,</hi> or the Dogs Grotto: It is a little place concaved or hollowed in the ſide of a little hill, hard by a Lake, or great pond of water; in which place a man
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44934:15"/>
may ſtand upright, and go three or four ſteps in length and breadth; here we had a Dog brought us, by a man that lives hard by, and that makes it his buſineſs for gain to ſhew the experiment to ſtrangers; he takes his Dog, and holds down his head within a Foot of the ground, for higher it is believed the Sulphurous Vapours do not mount, as one may obſerve by a kind of green colour that ſtains the ſides of the place, about a foot high from the Surface of the ground, and not higher; and before you can count a hundred, if you count not too faſt, the Dog begins to ſtagger and reel, (the man then letting him looſe) he ſoon falls down, and ſtruggling for life, dies away immediately; then the man ſpeedily takes him out, and waſhing him a little in the water of the Lake hard by, he preſently recovers; we tryed, for our better ſatisfaction, the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon one of our own Dogs,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44934:16"/>
and kept him in the ſaid Grotto it may be half a minute, or ſome ſuch ſmall matter of time longer than the firſt Dog, but too long to recover him, for all our waſhing, and whatever elſe we could do, could not bring him to life again.</p>
            <p>About a mile from this venemous Grotto is the burning Mountains called by the name of <hi>Sulpha terra,</hi> the principal matter that burns is Brimſtone, mixed with other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals: We were as near the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of it as we durſt go, for the ſmoke and fire was ſometimes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to choak us. But which was moſt to be admired, was to ſee fire and ſmoke come furiouſly out, if you thruſt but a ſtick into that levelled part of the Mountain on which we walked, the hilly part thereof being blown up and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with burning ſome time before.</p>
            <p>From hence we went to <hi>Puzzeolo,</hi> a little Town near the Sea-ſide, where we ſaw the Academy or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44934:16"/>
School of <hi>Virgil:</hi> and by this the Temple of <hi>Neptune:</hi> but there is nothing remaining of either but old Walls, and the ruins thereof. From hence we took a Boat and went by Sea to ſee the <hi>Sybillas</hi> Grotto, but by the way they gave us an account of a Mountain we ſaw hard by, called <hi>Monta Nova,</hi> that about 134 years ago there was a curious Plain where the Mountain now ſtands, and in it a little Town, whereof the people were grown to that exceſs of debauchery and looſeneſs of life, that in one nights time they were all covered with this Mountain, which they believe to be the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon the wickedneſs of the place. Others there are that ſay this Mountain was by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſorder of combuſtible matter burning under ground, blown up from <hi>Sulpha terra</hi> before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and carried to that place where it now ſtands, which is two miles or thereabouts. Within half a mile
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44934:17"/>
of this Mountain you ſee the Grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of <hi>Sybilla,</hi> and the Lake <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or Lake of Hell; at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of which is the Temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi> About half a mile from the <hi>Grotto Sybilla</hi> are the Hot Baths: and very near to this place we ſaw the Tomb of <hi>Agripina,</hi> the mother of <hi>Nero;</hi> by which ſtands the Ruins of the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Diana:</hi> And from hence you may ſee that place where <hi>Nero</hi> cauſed his Mother to be opened, whereof nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but the ruins, like unto a Rock in the Sea, ſome fourſcore or a hundred paces from the ſhore. We had not gone far from the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, but going over a little Hill we came into the ruins of what had been formerly a very fine ſtreet, in which was kept the <hi>Saturdays</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of that great and antient Town called by the name of <hi>Baiae:</hi> Near the end of which ſtreet, in a Vault or Cave there are ſeveral hollows or niches in the Walls, where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44934:17"/>
in Urues they uſed to keep the Aſhes of the dead. Hard by this place you ſee the <hi>Elyſian</hi> Fields, and the Dead Sea, where <hi>Charon</hi> the Ferry-man uſed to ply; and where formerly <hi>Nero</hi>'s Army lay imbarqued. And not far from hence we ſaw what ſome call <hi>Piſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na mirabilis,</hi> which undoubtedly had been built for ſome great end. It is a very lofty building under ground, ſupported by forty huge Pillars of Stone, or thereabouts; the plaiſtering of the Walls laid on about as thick as a Crown-piece, of ſo excellent a compoſition, (whereof they ſay whites of Eggs, which I refer to the Reader, was part of the Compound) is ſo very hard, that the Rock it ſelf cannot be harder. Here it is they ſay <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> kept freſh water for the uſe of his Navy, that lay then in the Dead Sea. From this place we went and ſaw the <hi>Cento Camarelle,</hi> or little rooms, very ſtrangely contrived to keep Slaves and Priſoners in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:44934:18"/>
From hence we took our Boat again, and returned to <hi>Puzzeolo,</hi> where one may ſee the beginning of a Bridge, carried on at leaſt a mile or two into the Sea; it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be the unadviſed enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of the Emperour <hi>Caligula,</hi> who thought to have made it over an arm of the Sea three or four miles long. The ſame night we return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Naples,</hi> and the next day being <hi>Thurſday,</hi> we ſaw the Sepulchres of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and of <hi>Sanazzaro.</hi> Upon <hi>Friday</hi> we took Horſes and went to the burning Mountain of <hi>Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> ſome ſeven miles from <hi>Naples</hi> Eaſtward. The Heart or Subſtance of the Mountain is conſumed by conſtant burnings, and frequent Eruptions; ſo that it may be more properly called the Shell of a Mountain, whoſe Subſtance is loſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or not unlike unto a Cup, whoſe brim or brink, being near half a mile in circumference, one may in any place lean over, and look down
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44934:18"/>
into the Concavity thereof, which is very deep, and at the bottom perceive very well a young Hill growing up, or rather forced up by ſome Combuſtible Matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath: This little Hill or Heap, which ſwells from the bottom, grows every year bigger and bigger, and yet one may perceive it ſmoak conſtantly, which 'tis believed it would not do if it did not burn. All the way up and down this Mountain, you cannot avoid going up to the Knees in Aſhes. There is a Bed or Channel that lies dry from the top of the Mountain down to the Sea-ſide, which, they ſay, was made by a burning liquid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which the Mountain ſpued up ſo faſt, and with that violence, that it forced its way there, and like an impetuous River run burning down a great way into the Sea, whereof nothing remains now but that Bed or Channel, which has ever ſince continued dry: four or five
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44934:19"/>
miles round<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Mountain you ſee a hard rocky Cinder, which in Eruptions are thrown ſo far at leaſt, up and down the Country to the great damage of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. In the year 1631. was the laſt great Eruption, in which they ſay there was no leſs than two thouſand people killed and hurt.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> we took a view of <hi>Naples</hi> again, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left that place, in order to our return again to <hi>Rome,</hi> where we arrived the 22<hi>d</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> but took <hi>Freſcata</hi> in our way, which is about 12 miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> where we ſaw the Palace of <hi>Monte Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,</hi> and <hi>Aldobrandina,</hi> in theſe we ſaw many fine Waterworks, among which the moſt conſiderable was that of the Organs. The <hi>Caſcade</hi> or fall of Water was ſo great and ſo violent, that in the very fall it brought wind enough with it to fill the Organ Pipes, which were very artificially placed in a little Houſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44934:19"/>
cloſe to the <hi>Caſcade</hi> for that purpoſe, and a Wheel which the Water turned round, having ſtops ſo conveniently placed on it as to touch the Keys in going about, which cauſed it to play any tune as they ſhould think fit who had the ordering of it, and as loud almoſt as you hear in any Church; we ſaw likewiſe the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a <hi>Centaur</hi> with his Horn, which by the help of the water he wound ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loud; there was likewiſe a <hi>Satyr</hi> playing upon Pipes, and the chirping and ſinging of Birds very delightful, and all performed by the help of the Water; but which was more aſtoniſhing than all this, was the great Grotto, or great Waterwork in form of a Grotto, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced directly againſt the back part of the Houſe: The coming forth of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is like unto Thunder, and then falls to the ground like Hail, Rain and Miſt; Before we took our leaves of this place, we ſaw a fine Room, in which were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Figures, playing upon divers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, repreſenting the Muſes, and underneath it was the Wind Treaſury, which we diſcovered by their opening to us two or three holes about two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches diameter made in the Floor of the ſaid Room, from whence the wind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44934:20"/>
with ſo much ſtrength, as to bear up a Ball of Copper or Braſs hovering very high over the hole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> being returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> we went and ſaw St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church and the Pope's Lodgings, where we took notice of three or four Rooms finely painted by <hi>Michael Angelo;</hi> the Gallery, Gardens, and Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works are worth taking notice of.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 1<hi>ſt</hi> of <hi>December</hi> we went to the <hi>Villa Burgheſe,</hi> belonging to a Prince that bears the ſame name, where we ſaw abundance of fine Statues, whereof the Gladiator and <hi>Apollo</hi> taking hold of <hi>Daphne</hi> are moſt worth remark: Theſe two laſt Figures being one intire piece of White Marble, repreſenting <hi>Apollo</hi>'s purſuit of <hi>Daphne</hi> to raviſh her, when ſhe changes into a Tree, was done by <hi>Seignior Bernin;</hi> the Painting is very good; the fine Gardens and the variety of Waterworks is worth ſeeing: There is a Sea-Horſe-Head, and an Elephants Head worth taking notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday,</hi> the 20 of <hi>December,</hi> we went to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, about a mile and an half out of <hi>Rome,</hi> where we ſaw the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix, that, they ſay, ſpoke to St. <hi>Briget.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Munday</hi> we ſaw Prince <hi>Pamphilio</hi> his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44934:20"/>
Palace, one of the Popes Nephews, about a mile out of Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> we went from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church to the Inquiſition, whoſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſaw, but they would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to go into the Priſons: From hence we went to the Church of St. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtrio,</hi> where the body of <hi>Torquatus Taſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> the Italian Poet lies Interred; we ſaw his Study, ſome of his own Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, the Cup he uſually drunk out of, and the Room he died in, in which there is now a fine Library.</p>
            <p>From this place we went to the Queen of <hi>Swedens</hi> Palace, where there is moſt excellent pieces of Painting done by the beſt hands, as <hi>Titio, Bonoretta, Carrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>From thence we went to <hi>Farneſi</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, where we ſaw that Incomparable Maſterpiece that was brought from <hi>Rhodes,</hi> conſiſting of Seven Figures, to wit, <hi>a Bull, a Dog, Three Men and Two Women;</hi> all theſe Seven Figures as big as the Life, are cut out of one intire piece of Marble, and do all naturally joyn in ſome part or other. The Figures do repreſent the Hiſtory of <hi>Licus,</hi> King of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who took to Wife <hi>Anthiops,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Nycteus,</hi> King of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:44934:21"/>
whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> defiled, putting on the form of a Satyr, whereupon <hi>Licus</hi> put her away and married <hi>Dirce,</hi> who perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the King to keep <hi>Antiope</hi> cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, leſt ſhe ſhould return into his favour again, which accordingly was done; but <hi>Jupiter,</hi> out of compaſſion, ſoon releaſed her, and then ſhe fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mountains, where ſhe was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to two Sons, <hi>Amphion</hi> and <hi>Zetus,</hi> who after they came to underſtand the injury done to their Mother by <hi>Licus</hi> and <hi>Dirce,</hi> they took <hi>Dirce</hi> and by the Hair of the Head tyed her to the Horns of a mad Bull, from which cruelty, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had ſuffered a long time, by the clemency of the Gods ſhe was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but <hi>Licus</hi> they killed: Whereupon <hi>Appolonius</hi> and <hi>Lauriſcus,</hi> two of the moſt famous Sculptures of that age, willing to tranſmit this Tragical Story to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, made this piece, as it is likewiſe reported by <hi>Pliny</hi> in his 36<hi>th</hi> Book and Chap. 5. which afterwards amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Antiquities was brought from <hi>Rhodes</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Aſſinios Pollion,</hi> moſt famous in the time of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and kept in the Baths of <hi>Antonius, Pius, Caracallus,</hi> the Emperour, under Mount <hi>Aventin,</hi> and in the reign of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44934:21"/>
named <hi>Farneſe,</hi> was found in the Ruins of thoſe Baths, and by him put into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and placed where you now ſee it.</p>
            <p>Over againſt this in a Little Palace of Seignior <hi>Pighinis,</hi> there is two of the fineſt Statues of Marble that is to be ſeen in <hi>Rome,</hi> the one is <hi>Meleagre,</hi> or as ſome ſay <hi>Adonis,</hi> the other is a <hi>Venus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> we ſaw the Palace of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto,</hi> where there are a great many fine Statues and curious Waterworks, in a moſt ſpacious and fine Garden. From hence we went to <hi>Ludoviſio</hi>'s great Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where in one Apartment we ſaw a Bed of ineſtimable value; it was all beſet with Precious Stones, and by this Bed, in a large Box, we ſaw a <hi>petrified</hi> man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> we ſaw the Palace of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Spada,</hi> and the Hoſpital where all the Pilgrims that come to <hi>Rome</hi> are enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for three days.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturdry</hi> we ſaw Prince <hi>Pallaſtrino</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and upon <hi>Sunday</hi> we went to <hi>Santa Croce</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> one of the ſeven Churches, where they pretend to have a great many Relicks, as the <hi>Sponge</hi> that they offered to our Saviour when he was upon the Croſs, ſome of the <hi>Thorns</hi> that he was Crowned with, one of the <hi>Nails</hi> that faſtned him to the Croſs, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44934:22"/>
many other reliques. Afterwards we went to the Church of St. <hi>John Latteran,</hi> which is eſteemed the fineſt in <hi>Rome,</hi> next to St. <hi>Peters,</hi> and where they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have the moſt reliques; hard by this is the Church of St. <hi>John in fonte,</hi> where Infidels and others that turn to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 10th. we ſaw Cardinal <hi>Ghiſi</hi>'s Pallace, where there is a moſt admirable collection of Pictures, and the richeſt Portiers or Door hangings that are in <hi>Rome,</hi> there was a very rich bed of wh te Sattin, painted they ſay, with the Juice of Flowers, ſo curiouſly that it took up five years time to do it in:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday,</hi> we ſaw the Effigies of the King of <hi>France</hi> on Horſeback, cut out of one intire piece of pure white marble, by <hi>Cavalier Beruin;</hi> it was not then quite finiſhed, yet it ſeemed to challenge the fineſt thing of that nature that ever was made: It was to be ſent into <hi>France,</hi> ſo ſoon as it ſhould be finiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> we ſaw the Cupola of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> and went into the Ball which is near ſeven Foot Diameter, and will hold ten or twelve men at a time completely.</p>
            <p>The Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> with the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tico and thickneſs of the walls is one
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44934:22"/>
Thouſand and Fifty eight Palmes in Length.</p>
            <p>The breadth of the Church in that part that makes the Croſs is ſix hundred and ſeventy Palmes.</p>
            <p>From the Pavement to the twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles is two hundred and twelve Palmes high.</p>
            <p>The Cupola is one hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Palms diameter, and ſix hundred and fifty two from the Pavement to the Croſs, that is fixed upon the top of the Cupola.</p>
            <p>The Lanthorn of the Cupola, and the great Altar in the middle of the Croſs of the Church do meaſure alike, in height one hundred twenty ſix Palms and a half.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Thurſday</hi> following, we went and ſaw the little Pallace of Cardinal <hi>Ghiſi,</hi> where there is a very pretty Armory, and many natural Curioſities, amongſt the reſt the Cockatrices were worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark: His fine Garden, and thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Artifices by water, from which it is almoſt impoſſible to avoid being wet, unleſs the Gardiner be your Friend, were all very well worth our ſight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 14th. we were introduced by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, and admitted
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44934:23"/>
to the honour of kiſſing the Popes toe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday,</hi> we ſaw the Prince <hi>Burgeſe</hi>'s Pallace which is eſteemed the fineſt in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday,</hi> we went to the Church of St. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> about three miles out of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it is one of the ſeven Churches, and where they tell you our Saviour met St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and converſed with him, and left his Foot-ſteps for a mark thereof, if you can believe as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes; This rencounter of our Saviour with St. <hi>Paul</hi> was when he made his eſcape from <hi>Rome;</hi> beſides the Footſteps of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, they ſhow you under the Church, where in the times of Perſecution they uſed to hide the Chriſtians, and bury thoſe that they found dead, and where the bodies of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> are reported to be firſt interred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> 17th. we began with the new Church of St. <hi>Nichola Tolentino,</hi> which is well adorned with good Painting and a fine Altar.</p>
            <p>From hence we went to <hi>Porta Salaire,</hi> or <hi>Collina,</hi> through which <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Bremus</hi> King of the <hi>Galls</hi> entered, when they came to <hi>Rome;</hi> a little within this Gate you ſee the place where they uſed to inter the Veſtal Nymphs. We went
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44934:23"/>
forward and came to <hi>Porta Pia,</hi> ſo called, from <hi>Pius Quartus</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> in whoſe time it was built, the workmanſhip was <hi>Michael Angelo Boneretta</hi>'s, the pretty <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> that were raviſhed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> came in at this Gate.</p>
            <p>From this Gate we went to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Sta. Agneſe,</hi> it is about a mile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Walls of the City, where there is a great many fine Marble Pillars very antique, and Candleſticks taken from the Temple of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> but the four Porphery Pillars that bore up the great Altar are moſt worth remark.</p>
            <p>Near to this you ſee the place they call <hi>Roma Subterranea,</hi> you go under ground and are conducted into ſeveral narrow paſſages on the right and left hand, you may ſee ſeveral niches and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities in which were Skulls, and other Bones of Saints and Martyrs which in the times of Perſecution fled thither and died there, and were buried, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor reported.</p>
            <p>Near to this place is the Church of St. <hi>Conſtanza,</hi> heretofore the Temple of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> in which you may ſee that Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phery Sepulcher either of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> or of <hi>Conſtanza,</hi> as is believed; it may challenge the whole world for a Curioſity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44934:24"/>
From hence we went to the Church of St. <hi>Victoire,</hi> where you may ſee the fine Statue of St. <hi>Terraiſe,</hi> made by Cavalier <hi>Beruin,</hi> near to this is that of St. <hi>Suſanna,</hi> where the Painting is not much amiſs.</p>
            <p>From hence you may ſee the Tower or Church of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> their Garden was heretofore a Theatre, oppoſite to which are the Baths of the Emperour <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocleſian,</hi> by which you may take notice of eight great Marble Pillars which bore up the Ruines of a moſt noble arched Fabrick now partly converted to a Church.</p>
            <p>Not far from hence there is a little Church called <hi>Pudantiene,</hi> where you may ſee that lovely Chappel of <hi>Cajeton,</hi> and in it admire that incomparable Altar-piece, which repreſents the birth of our Saviour and the three Kings coming to worſhip him, made by <hi>Petrus Oliverus Romanus;</hi> the <hi>Moſaick</hi> work is worth taking notice of, beſides the fine Statutes.</p>
            <p>Hard by this little Church you may take notice of the Bath of <hi>Agripina,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Nero,</hi> now in the Ruins.</p>
            <p>From hence we went and ſaw the pretty Church of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> upon Mount <hi>Eſquelyn,</hi> built upon the ruined Baths of <hi>Titus Veſpaſius:</hi> At the end of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44934:24"/>
this Church was the Tower of <hi>Nero,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he ſat playing on a Harp whilſt the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was all in a flame of Fire.</p>
            <p>From hence we went to the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Vincoli,</hi> where there is a very fine Statue of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and they ſay the laſt thing that was done by <hi>Michael Angelo.</hi> I ſhould have told you that it was between <hi>Porta Salaire</hi> and <hi>Porta Pia,</hi> about three miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour killed himſelf, to prevent a moſt ſhameful death that was prepared for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> we went about three miles out of <hi>Rome</hi> to a place called the <hi>Three Fountains,</hi> where there is three little Churches, one of them called <hi>St. Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> another <hi>St. Bernard;</hi> where they ſay lies abundance of the Saints bones: and the third is called the <hi>Three Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> where they report St. <hi>Paul</hi> was beheaded; and at the cutting of it off, they ſay the Head gave three leaps, at each of which there broke out imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately a Fountain of Water: And which was more wonderful, that the Water of each Fountain ſhould have a different taſte from the other; the firſt to taſte like Wine, the ſecond like
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44934:25"/>
Milk, and the third ſomething near the taſte of common Water; but I found no difference in them but that they all taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like other waters, but it may be it was becauſe there was wanting in me a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith. You may likewiſe ſee the Marble Pillar, to which he was bound, as they ſay, when he was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. In returning to <hi>Rome</hi> we ſaw St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church again, and the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix that they ſay ſpoke to St. <hi>Brigid,</hi> where in the Sacriſtie there are very fine Pictures done by <hi>Lanfranck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the wall of the City you may ſee the fine Piramid, or, as ſome ſay, the Sepulchre of <hi>Caius Ceſtius;</hi> others ſay it is the Sepulchre of <hi>Remus.</hi> It was finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 330 days, which was but a very ſhort time for ſo great a work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> after dinner we ſaw the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of Prince <hi>Juſtiniano,</hi> where there is fine Statues and Painting. Then we went and ſaw the Popes gardens at <hi>Monte Cavallo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday,</hi> near the Church of St. <hi>Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> which is ſome three or four miles out of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſaw the Ruins of the Pretorial Camp, or the place of Guard to the Emperour <hi>Diocleſian:</hi> Near to this you may ſee the little Heatheniſh
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44934:25"/>
Temple, that was erected in deriſion of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> for being forced to retreat without taking <hi>Rome.</hi> You ſee alſo not far from hence the Circle of <hi>Caracallo</hi> from whence was taken the oblique that now ſtands in the middle of the Piazza <hi>Navona;</hi> from this place we went to the Fountain of the Nymph <hi>Aegeria,</hi> which they ſay was built 800 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviours time: Returning to <hi>Rome</hi> again, we went through the <hi>Porto Lattin,</hi> juſt by which we ſaw a little Chappel, where they ſay St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt was put to death, by being put into a Cauldron of boyling Oyl. I ſhould have taken notice of <hi>Capo di Bove,</hi> at the beginning of this days Journey, it lying in the way, the remains of it is a great Tower partly demoliſhed, where the Sepulchre of <hi>Matella</hi> wife to rich <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> daughter to Q. <hi>Metalla,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Cretico,</hi> taken for having ſubdued the <hi>Cretes,</hi> now remains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday,</hi> we went to <hi>Campidoglio,</hi> where you may ſee erected the Trophies of the Emperour <hi>Trajan</hi> when he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> victorious over the <hi>Tranſilvanians.</hi> In the middle Court you ſee the copper Horſe, vulgarly called the Horſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> the Emperour: In the Court call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44934:26"/>
               <hi>Conſervatori,</hi> you may take notice of the Head of the Emperour <hi>Domitian,</hi> the Head and an Arm of the Emperour <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus,</hi> the Tomb of <hi>Mamea</hi> the Mother of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> with many other fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures very ancient. The Apartments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Stairs are full of old Statues and fine Painting, the Idol of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the figure of a Wolf, with <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> hanging at the Dugs of it, are very antique and worth remark, they are of Copper.</p>
            <p>From hence we went to Mount <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolin,</hi> hard by which you may ſee three fine Pillars that remain of the Temple of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> on the top of which Pillars you may take notice of a Stone with fine old carving on it, of thoſe things which do denote the uſe and intent of the ſtructure; for by the Bullocks Head and Horns dreſſed with Flowers, the Ax, the Sacrificers Knife, and Baſon to receive the Blood, and other things of this nature, one may eaſily believe the report, that it is the remains of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> where they uſed to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to that Deity. Near to this you ſee the Temple of <hi>Concord:</hi> And not far from hence that fine ancient Pillar, upon which was ſet the Statue of <hi>Domitian</hi> the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44934:26"/>
Emperour; a little farther we ſaw the Dungeon where the <hi>Romans</hi> formerly uſed to impriſon the moſt notorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, amongſt the reſt St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> are ſaid to have been kept here; they ſhewed us a Pillar to which their Chains were faſtned, and cloſe by it a little Fountain wherein, they ſay, the Goaler and his Family were baptized after they were converted to the Chriſtian Faith. In this place ſtands now a little Church dedicated to St. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> it is at the foot of that great deſcent of Marble Steps where the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed formerly to throw down the Criminals that were condemned to die: By this you may ſee the Triumphal Arch of the Emperour <hi>Septimus Severus,</hi> erected againſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Conqueſt of the <hi>Partheans,</hi> near to this is the Church of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> where you may ſee his ſtately Sepulchre in a Vault, and his fine Image of Marble upon the great Altar; they likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſhew you where his Body was found. A little way from hence is the Church of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and in it that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sepulchre, erected to his memory by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the tenth, and another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable piece of <hi>Petrus Oliverus,</hi> which repreſents the entry of Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Church of St. <hi>Maria Maggiore,</hi> which ſtands upon Mount <hi>Eſquilino,</hi> and came to the little Church of St. <hi>Bibian,</hi> where you may ſee her fine Statue, made by Cavalier <hi>Bernin;</hi> there is good Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Freſco,</hi> done by <hi>Dietio Cortone;</hi> they ſhew you a little Pillar of <hi>Porphery,</hi> to which they ſay St. <hi>Bibian</hi> was tied when ſhe was martyrized.</p>
            <p>Near to <hi>Porta Paleſtina</hi> is the Temple of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> built by <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> to the honour of his two Nephews, <hi>Cajus</hi> and <hi>Liſius;</hi> it is now vulgarly called <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſia.</hi> From hence we went and ſaw <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> which is one of the Seven Churches, the Pillars thereof were taken out of the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which Temple was ruined by the

            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> we went again to the <hi>Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doglio,</hi> where in a little Court going up Stairs, one may take notice of four ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pieces Carved in Stone, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the coming of <hi>Marc.

Near to the Triumphal Arch of <hi>Septimus Severus</hi> there remains three Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Temple that <hi>Romulus</hi> built to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> occaſioned by a Vow <hi>Romulus</hi> had made when his Army was routed by the <hi>Sabins,</hi> that if he ſhould be able to rally his Army, and defeat the Enemy, he would build a Temple and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which accordingly was done, and his Vow performed.</p>
            <p>Not far from hence is the Temple of <hi>Anthonin</hi> and <hi>Fauſtin,</hi> now called the Church of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> where there is a fine Altar-piece, done by <hi>Pietro Cortono:</hi> Hard by this is the Temple of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> now the Church of St. <hi>Come</hi> and <hi>Damian.</hi> And not far from hence we ſaw the Triumphal Arch of <hi>Titus Veſpaſian,</hi> erected upon the taking of <hi>Rome:</hi> Not far from this you may ſee the Triumphal Arch of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> by ſome called that of <hi>Trajans,</hi> becauſe moſt of the beſt Figures carved in Stone, and what elſe is there moſt worth your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was brought from the Triumphal

We went afterwards a little farther, and ſaw the nine Vaults where the water for the uſe of the Amphitheatre, as alſo for the Baths of <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> was preſerved; ſome ſay they were firſt made to keep water in for the uſe of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Gardens. From hence we went to the little Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal Arch of <hi>Septimus Severus</hi> in <hi>Foro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauno,</hi> erected by the Merchants and Goldſmiths, upon Stones where one may ſee carved the Ax, the head of the Victim, and ſeveral other things that were made uſe of in their Sacrifices to the Heatheniſh Gods.

            <p>From hence we went to <hi>Mont.

Near to this is the Church of St. <hi>Alexis,</hi> heretofore the Temple of <hi>Diana.</hi> From hence we went to the Iſle of <hi>Tiber,</hi> which lies between the Bridge of Four Heads, and the other Bridge called—where the Church of St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> now ſtands, it was heretofore the Temple of <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> the God of Phyſick. We went from hence to the Church of St. <hi>Cicile,</hi> where we ſaw the fine Statue of Marble, made in the ſame manner, lying as when her Body was found: Near to this there is another Church, where in a little Chappel you may ſee a fine Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, painted by <hi>Hanibal Caraſco,</hi> and a fine Antick Tomb. From hence we went to the Church of St. <hi>Chryſogorio,</hi> which is built upon the Ruins of an Hoſpital that <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> had made for the uſe of his maim'd Soldiers. Near to this there is another Church called <hi>Sancta Tranſlaverie,</hi> heretofore an Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal for the uſe before-mentioned.

               <hi>Tueſday</hi> following we went to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, and obſerved the four Statues of Copper, which ſupport St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair; in which Chair the Popes are uſually ſeated when the ſolemnity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation paſſes on them; the two out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward figures repreſent St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and the two inward St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> on the Right Hand of the Altar you ſee that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable fine Statue of Marble made by <hi>Gulielmus Dellaporta;</hi> we went afterwards underneath the Church into the Vaults where we ſaw <hi>Otto</hi> the eleventh Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Germany</hi> as he was there intomb'd, with the Sepulchre of <hi>Carola</hi> Queen of <hi>Jeruſalem, Cypre,</hi> and <hi>Armenia;</hi> from hence we went into the Pope's Armory, where they ſay are Arms ſufficient for 65000 Men.</p>
            <p>We afterwards went to the Chappel, where we ſaw that excellent piece of Painting, which repreſents the Day of Judgment, done by <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> who amongſt other things that he had figured to be in Hell, puts in a Cardinal in his <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> which was drawn ſo near to the life, that whoever ſaw it knew it to be the very picture of ſuch a Cardinal, an eminent Man then living in <hi>Rome,</hi> who

they report came to ſee the Painting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was finiſhed, and haſtily ruſhing in at the door, over which <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi> hapned to be then at work upon a Ladder, chanced to throw him down, which to be revenged of, he paints the Cardinal in Hell, whereupon the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal complians to the Pope, who was then <hi>Leo</hi> X. of the great indignity done him by <hi>Michael Angelo,</hi> who had placed him amongſt the Devils in Hell; to which the Pope returned this Anſwer, That he indeed was heartily ſorry for it, and could have wiſhed that he had placed him in Purgatory, for there he could have fetched him out; but being once in Hell, there was no redemption. So that the Cardinal remains there to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday,</hi> we went to the Baths of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio Caracallo,</hi> Son to <hi>Septimus Severus,</hi> from whence were taken all the Pillars that are now in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, and the Bull of <hi>Farneſe</hi> before mentioned, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the two great Marble Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that ſtand in the <hi>Piazza Farneſe;</hi> theſe Baths, they ſay, had 1500 Rooms in them.

From hence we went to the Church of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> being one of the Seven where there is abundance of fine Marble Pillars with other Stones finely Carved, relating to Sacrifices; from whence one may conclude that it had formerly been ſome Heatheniſh Temple: Upon the right and left hand going into the Church, you may ſee two Ancient Tombs of Marble.</p>
            <p>We afterwards ſaw the Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> were the Popes Triple Crown is kept, in which there is planted a great many Braſs Guns, whereof 'tis believed the major part was made of the Braſs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> and one of them made out of the Braſs Nails only that were imployed in the Brazen Work of that Temple, ſo vaſt was the quantity of Braſs found there.</p>
            <p>From hence we went to the Pallace of <hi>Medicis,</hi> where we ſaw theſe principal Statues, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Rotatore,</hi> being a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Fellow that diſcovered the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of <hi>Cataline</hi> againſt the Republick of <hi>Rome.</hi> A <hi>Venus</hi> made by <hi>Cleomenes</hi> the Son of <hi>Appolodorus</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſay was an Idol worſhipped in the <hi>Rotonda.</hi> The Statue of <hi>Marſias,</hi> who was flaid alive for preſuming to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

            <p>From hence we went again to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Church, where we ſaw the head of the Spear that, they ſay, pierced our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Side, and a piece of the Croſs, with a Handkerchief that, they ſay, St. <hi>Veronnica</hi> gave him to wipe the Sweat from his Face, when he was going to Mount <hi>Calvar</hi> loaded with the Croſs; whereon is to be ſeen plainly the print of a Face which, they ſay, affixed it ſelf ſo to the Handkercief as ſoon as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our had made uſe of it.</p>

               <hi>Monday</hi> the 21<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> we left <hi>Rome</hi> in order to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> and lay the firſt night at <hi>Rigneava</hi> twenty three miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> the next night we lay at <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit,</hi> twenty eight miles, and upon <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> we arrived at <hi>Foligne</hi> thirty miles more; from whence on <hi>Thurſday</hi> wecame to <hi>Valcemare</hi> twenty eight miles, and the

next day to <hi>Lauretta</hi> thirty two miles, where we ſaw the Holy Houſe, now ſo called, it being formerly (they told us) the proper Manſion Houſe, or Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> when the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſaluted her with the joyful news of her Conception of our Saviour Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It was firſt miraculouſly brought from <hi>Nazareth</hi> into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and from thence by the Angels carried over the Gulf of <hi>Venice,</hi> and ſet down in <hi>Italy,</hi> where it now remains to the great aſtoniſhment of all that ſee it, if they believe the report: All that you ſee of this Holy Houſe is no more than four Walls very unartifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially built, of an ordinary ſort of Stone, much like unto our Brick, which four Walls compoſe the four ſides of a little ground Room, almoſt ſquare, which they call the Holy Houſe; but ſome time ſince they have built over it a very fine Church, and have very richly caſed and adorned this Irregular Room with pure fine Marble, curiouſly wrought and carved, much more to be admired than the Holy Houſe it ſelf. In the Holy Houſe there is a Wooden Diſh, which, they told us, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did uſe to eat or drink in; and the Image of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44934:32"/>
carved in Wood, with a Child in her Arms, which they take to be the Effigies of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: They ſhewed us likewiſe an old Red Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>From hence they conducted us to the Treaſury of the Order of this Holy Houſe, which without doubt is the richeſt in Chriſtendom, for that innumerable quantity of Precious Stones, as Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Pearls, Rubies, &amp;c. too many to be particularly mentioned, that they have there amaſſed together, likewiſe Veſſels of Gold and Silver in abundance: There is alſo one fine piece of Painting, done by <hi>Hannibal Caratio;</hi> after this they ſhewed us the Apothecaries Shop, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Pots were all Painted by <hi>Raphael <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin.</hi> From <hi>Lauretta</hi> we went on <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> to <hi>Ancona</hi> fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles, where the most remarkable thing is the Triumphal Arch of <hi>Trojan</hi> upon the Mould, and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s

Church, where there is ſome good paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, done by <hi>Pomerancia.</hi> It is a great Town well fortified, with Cannon plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well againſt the Sea, as againſt the Land. From hence we went twenty miles upon the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea ſhore, and lay at <hi>Senegaglia,</hi> a Town fortified almoſt in a ſquare; heretofore it did belong to the Duke of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> but now it is in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Pope. The next day we went twenty miles more to Dinner at <hi>Peſaro,</hi> within five miles of this place we went through a Town called <hi>Fano,</hi> where there is a Triumphal Arch erected to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when he returned victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious over the <hi>French.</hi> From <hi>Peſaro</hi> we went 25 miles more, and lay at <hi>Rimini,</hi> ſtill all along upon the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea ſide. It is a great Town, but very much ruined by an Earthquake, that two years before ſhook down a Spacious Market-place, with the greateſt part of the Buildings about it, which were very ſumptuous; and the beſt part of the Town was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deſtroyed, to the terrible amazement of all the Inhabitants, whereof the greateſt part made their eſcape when they firſt perceived the Earth to tremble, and the Streets begin to rock, and by the violence of the concuſſion ready to

meet and touch a top, though ſome more careful than prudent, to ſave their goods, were buried with them in the ruine of their Houſes; the greateſt part of which ſtill lies in heaps. The Chappel of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> which <hi>Laſſel</hi> in his Voyage of <hi>Italy</hi> doth ſay, proved miraculouſly the real preſence in the Sacrament, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe without any difference ſhaken down with the reſt; ſo that the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal painting, which ſhould have inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us concerning the Miracle, fell with the Chappel Walls. Near to this there is a large Stone fixed, where they ſay <hi>Caeſar</hi> made a Speech to his Army. From <hi>Rimini,</hi> upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 29<hi>th.</hi> we came to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> 35 miles, where we ſpent the morning to ſee the Town, and firſt went to the fine Convent of <hi>Sancta Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talle,</hi> where we ſaw the Chappel of <hi>Galla Placidia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Great, and Siſter to <hi>Arcadia</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius,</hi> Wife of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> and Mother to <hi>Valentinianus</hi> the Third, all Emperours.

               <hi>Arcadius,</hi> and the Nurſe of <hi>Valentinianus,</hi> for their being there erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: After we had ſeen this, we went to the Church, where in going in, we took notice of a Marble Stone in the wall, whereon were ſeveral very Antique Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, curiouſly engraven, repreſenting a Bull led to the Sacrifice, with the Heatheniſh Prieſts attending: There is likewiſe the Tomb of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and over againſt that <hi>John</hi> the Ninth, Archbiſhop of <hi>Ravenna</hi> lies: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one of the Altars you ſee the Tomb of St. <hi>Vitalle:</hi> Near the Church Door, and in ſeveral places of the Town, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral old Sepulchres are remaining: From hence we went to the Church of St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Maggiore,</hi> where there is abundance of fine ancient Marble Pillars, and the Chappel of St. <hi>Orcicero,</hi> who after he was beheaded, they ſay, carryed his Head from the place of Execution, two hundred paces: We went from this Church to the <hi>Rotonda,</hi> one of the greateſt pieces of Curioſity in all <hi>Italy;</hi> it was deſigned by <hi>Amalaſunta,</hi> only Daughter to <hi>Theodoric,</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> for a Tomb for her Father, and in the Year 526, was accordingly built; a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death he cauſed a Pope and two

famous Councellors to be put to death: The building is round, but the Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in the Roof, which is one intire Stone, near four foot thick, and thirty five foot over, or in the Diameter that covers the whole Building, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cav'd like unto a Buckle; it is to the the admiration of all that ſee it queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, how ſuch a Stone could be got out of a Quarry, brought thither, and placed as it is. The <hi>Vaſs</hi> that this King was put in, is of Porphyry, and was placed upon the top of this great Stone in the middle, having round about the ſides twelve Statues, repreſenting the Twelve Apoſtles; but at the ſiege of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> it was ſhot down, and is now to be ſeen in the Convent of the <hi>Zocollanties,</hi> fixed in a Wall, conveyed thither by ſome of the Town in the Year of our Lord 1564. We went next to the Church of the <hi>Polonaries,</hi> ſupported by four and twenty fine Marble Pillars very Antique; and in the <hi>Piazza</hi> or Market-place, there are two more, whereon the Statues of St. <hi>Vitelle</hi> and St. <hi>Apollinare,</hi> Protectors of the City, do now ſtand.</p>

               <hi>Monday,</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> we went from <hi>Bologne</hi> to <hi>Modene</hi> 20 miles, where within four miles of that Town, near to the Great Road, is ſcituated a ſtrong place called <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> we went from <hi>Modene,</hi> and lay eighteen miles off at a little Town, called <hi>Cento,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Ferrara</hi> eighteen miles, where coming into Town you may take notice of a Fort, which ſeem'd to me to be a Pentagone very well fortified; in the Town is the <hi>Caſtello,</hi> ſurrounded with deep Ditches of Water; here the Popes Legate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides: They ſhewed us a fine Colomn not finiſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereon is to be placed the Statue of the Pope, that at preſent ſtands hard by the <hi>Domo,</hi> which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old Church.

               <hi>Thurſday</hi> following we went to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>Ravigo,</hi> the firſt Town in that Road that belongs to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> 22 miles from <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where we paſſed the River <hi>Poe,</hi> and the White Channel; after Dinner we went 15 miles more, to a Town called Mont <hi>Selevie;</hi> not far from hence we paſſed the River <hi>Adige;</hi> and a <hi>Friday</hi> morning we came to <hi>Padoue,</hi> ten miles, from whence the ſame day we took Bark, and arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> the eighth day of <hi>February,</hi> where we ſtaid three weeks to ſee the Town; and the moſt remarkable thing there is, the <hi>Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> in which there is Arms for four hundred thouſand men; there is a very great ſtore of Cannon and other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of War: Their Ports do abound in Gallies, Galliots, and Men of War: We went into the <hi>Bucentore,</hi> a certain Veſſel that the Doge or Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> goes in when he performs the Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Ceremony betwixt Himſelf and the Sea, by throwing in a Gold Ring: We ſaw the private Armory, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,

which indeed is not to be admired after having ſeen the Treaſure of <hi>Lauret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:</hi> We went afterwards to the Doge's Pallace and the Councel Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where there is good Painting; the Piazza or Place of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> is very well worth ones particular notice, as alſo St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church, where you ſee the four fine Horſes of Braſs, brought from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and the two great Pillars of Marble near the Water-ſide: The Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relief, upon the ſide of a little Building joyning to the Steeple of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church is very well worth the taking notice of; then we went up to the top of the Steeple, from whence we had a fair proſpect over all <hi>Venice,</hi> which, I believe, contains more buildings than <hi>Rome;</hi> but that which is chiefly to be admired, is its Scituation and Building in the Sea, ſo that one may go by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and by Land almoſt through every Street of this vaſt City. There is two Canals or Ports, by which the biggeſt Ships may go in and out; the one is called <hi>Porto Lydo,</hi> the other <hi>Malomoca:</hi> After we had gone round the City by Sea, and viewed it after that manner, we took our leaves of it, and went again to <hi>Padoue,</hi> where we arrived the

firſt of <hi>March;</hi> we ſaw the Schools of Phyſick, Divinity and Law, &amp;c. called the <hi>Bo,</hi> and the Tomb of <hi>Antinor,</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Padoue,</hi> who lived fifteen hundred years before our Saviour Chriſt, upon Earth, it is erected at the Corner of a Street; then we went to the Church of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> where we ſaw the fine Tomb of <hi>Alexander Contarini,</hi> General of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the Tomb of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> which is adorned with ſeveral fine Marble Figures, repreſenting the Miracles wrought by him in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time and about twenty ſeven great Silver Lamps. In the Quoire of the ſame Church there is about twelve pieces of Caſt Braſs, ſo curiouſly wrought with all ſorts of Figures, and other things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the deſign, that it gives you an Hiſtorical Account of ſeveral paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the Old Teſtament, and ſo much to the Life, that I cannot forbear to make mention of one, which is the Story of <hi>Sampſon</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> when he deſtroyed ſo many of them by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying away the Pillars of the Houſe, and letting the Houſe fall wherein they were; it is ſo artificially done, that you will hardly believe your eyes, but take the whole Fabrick to be effectually fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

down. In the Cloyſters to the ſame Church, there is a little Black Marble Stone that covers the Bowels of the Old Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> Father to the ſuppoſed Mad Duke that we ſaw confined at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doue:</hi> Right before this Church ſtands the Statue of <hi>Gatta Mela,</hi> General of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in Braſs. From hence we went to the Church of St. <hi>Juſtin,</hi> where we ſaw the Tomb of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> much like unto an old wooden Cheſt, incha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Iron; the Tomb of S. <hi>Matthias,</hi> over againſt it on the other ſide of the Church, and under the great Altar, the Tomb of St. <hi>Juſtin;</hi> at the upper end of the Quire there is a fine piece of Painting, done by <hi>Paul Veroneſe.</hi> To this Church belongs a Convent, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fineſt in <hi>Italy.</hi> Near to the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Great Captain, we ſaw the great Hall, called <hi>Pallagio di Regione,</hi> and that remarkable Stone in it, called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis opprobrii,</hi> whereon if any one comes and claps down his Breech, three times together, he ſhall never be troubled, whilſt he lives, for debt, but then he is for ever after defamed, and himſelf and Family more ruined in their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Honour, than if they had died in Priſon for Debt. We went from
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44934:38"/>
hence to the place where they Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize and Diſſect the Bodys of Men and Women, which is ſo conveniently built, that although it is much leſs than an ordinary Chamber, yet there is room enough with Seats for two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Spectators.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday,</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> we went from <hi>Padoue</hi> to <hi>Vicenze</hi> 18 miles, where about a mile out of Town we ſaw a pretty Pallace, called the <hi>Roton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da;</hi> it is a very fine Proſpect and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Marqueſs <hi>Martio Capra;</hi> we alſo ſaw the Garden and Labyrinth of <hi>Conte Valinerana,</hi> the Amphitheatre and Triumphal Arch of <hi>Poladio,</hi> with what elſe was conſiderable. <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 5<hi>th</hi> we went thirty miles more, and came to Dinner at <hi>Verona,</hi> where the fineſt Tombs, and the richeſt that ever I ſaw of Marble, are there erected to the honour of the Family of the <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geres,</hi> who were formerly Maſters of this Town; then we went to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre, which is much like to that in <hi>Rome,</hi> but a more intire thing within, for the Spectators Seats or Places which are the Circular Degrees or Steps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſide remain all whole, the outſide is much more ruined than that in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:44934:38"/>
From hence we went to <hi>Conte Juſte</hi>'s Garden, where you have a proſpect of the whole Town; I took notice of the Pine Trees in the Garden, which are the fineſt I ever ſaw. From this Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den we went to St. <hi>George</hi>'s Church, where we ſaw two pieces of Painting, very much eſteemed, done by <hi>Paul Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roncſe:</hi> It is thought that this Town is the biggeſt (except <hi>Venice)</hi> that belongs to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> its ſcituation is upon the River <hi>Adige.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> we left this place and went to <hi>Mamoue</hi> 24 miles, the Duke thereof and Dutcheſs his Wife, are both of the Family of <hi>Gonzaga:</hi> We ſaw the Town and the Dukes Pallace, but nothing worth remark in either<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for about forty years ago it was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the <hi>Germans,</hi> yet ſomething remains in the Cloſet of Natural Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities worth taking notice of, to wit, two or three Children Mummies, one of them like to a <hi>Satyr,</hi> the other two very Monſtrous, there being but two Bodys, but to each Body Members for two Children; one of theſe Children was a Male, the other a Female very diſcernable: There was likewiſe a Man Mummy, he being about 360 years ago,

a very Tyrannick Governour of this place, was killed, and thus preſerved for a deteſtable ſpectacle to after Ages. Of ſeveral Cockatrices I had ſeen in our Travels, the biggeſt was in this place. The little Hall painted by <hi>Gulio Romano</hi> of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Hiſtory is worth taking notice of. The Town of <hi>Mantoue</hi> is well fortified by Nature as well as by Art. <hi>Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

About five miles from <hi>Mantoue,</hi> in the road to <hi>Breſcia,</hi> there is a fine Palace, belonging to this Duke, called <hi>La Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talla.</hi> The ſame day being the ſeventh, we arrived at <hi>Breſcia</hi> 40 miles, riding all the way through a very delightful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Town of <hi>Breſcia</hi> is ſtrong, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good Walls and Ditches. The Caſtle that ſtands upon a little Hill has a great many good Cannon in it, and commands the Town. About 160 years ago the <hi>French</hi> were Maſters of it, who with the aſſiſtance of ſome forces from <hi>Bologn</hi> made a ſtrong ſally upon the Town, plundering, and putting all to the Sword; ever ſince which time they have remained in Peace. The Town-Houſe was one of the fineſt buildings in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44934:39"/>
all theſe parts, but by an accident burnt the remains of it is worth one's regard. The ninth we went from hence to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo</hi> 30 miles, where we lay that night, the next morning, being <hi>Sunday</hi> the 10<hi>th</hi> we went into the Town, which is ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on a Hill, and well fortified: This is one of the fineſt proſpects of <hi>Italy,</hi> we ſaw the <hi>Domo,</hi> and in it the Sepulchre of <hi>Bartholomew Collione,</hi> late Patron of the Town; there are four fine pieces kept lockt up, ſome call it Painting, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affirm it to be all but Wood In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid, which makes the Pieces the more Curious.</p>
            <p>After Dinner, the ſame day, we went to <hi>Le Fournaiſe</hi> 16 miles, where we lay that night; it is but a Village, and lies upon the River <hi>Adda.</hi> The next day we rode 14 miles upon the ſame River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and came to <hi>Millan</hi> the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March;</hi> and firſt of all we went to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, and to that of St. <hi>Ceiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Church is the fineſt Fabrick in <hi>Millan,</hi> and if one had a month to ſpend there, one might ſee it every day, and yet find ſomething to pleaſe ones Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, that one had not ſeen, or atleaſt taken notice of before, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is not finiſhed, nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ever will be. There is about ſix hundred Marble Pillars belonging to the Church, and each Pillar they ſay coſt at leaſt One Thouſand Crowns; all the Walls of the Church are likewiſe of Marble: In a little Chappel, under ground, we ſaw the body of St. <hi>Charles</hi> covered with Cryſtal, very tranſparent, lying in his Robes, the ſame he wore when he was Archbiſhop of that place, his Face, which looked black and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, had no covering, but lies always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to view; the Cryſtal Caſe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it from Cobwebs, duſt and other filth. From the top of the Church we took a view of the Town, which is near as big as <hi>London</hi> within the Walls; we ſaw the great Hoſpital, the Lazaretto or Peſthouſe, both well worth taking notice of. In the Cabinet of <hi>Settali,</hi> one of their their Canons there is a great many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities both Natural and Artificial; what I moſt admired was three large
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44934:41"/>
Unicorns Horns, which I never ſaw in any place before, nor till then did I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there could be any ſuch thing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the Maſter of the Cabinet was ſtrongly of the opinion that they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to, and were taken from Fiſh, and that there was never any ſuch Beaſt ſeen to have ſuch a Horn, but that it was a vulgar error; each Horn was about ſix foot long, twiſting regularly from the root upwards, but falling from the Twiſt gradually as it drew up to the ſpear or point, which was very ſharp: The lower part or root of the Horn being about ten or twelve inches circumference, which declining gradually till it comes to a ſpear a top, renders it a very ſtrong and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable weapon. The Horn is all very white; the whole Cabinet is full of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things, yet I think that Cabinet we ſaw at <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France</hi> does far excel it. From hence we went to the Caſtle, it is a very regular <hi>Exagon,</hi> with half moons; it is eſteemed one of the compleateſt pieces of fortification in all <hi>Italy,</hi> and of great ſtrength, upon every one of the Baſtions is planted twelve pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; there is a Garriſon in it of about 500 Soldiers with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After we had ſeen the Caſtle, we

went to a Palace of the Counteſs of <hi>Smione,</hi> about a mile and a half out of <hi>Millan,</hi> where amongſt other remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, you may take notice of the Echo, which was the beſt I ever heard.

The 15<hi>th</hi> we came to Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>Ciliana</hi> or <hi>Sian</hi> 17 miles; and from thence to <hi>Chivas</hi> 10 miles, where we lay that night at the Poſthouſe, from

whence the next day, being <hi>Saturday</hi> the 16<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> we came to <hi>Turin</hi> 12 miles. The next day, <hi>Sunday,</hi> we went to <hi>Pignerol</hi> 16 miles; it is a ſtrong Town, which the French King about 45 years ago took from the Doke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel wherein Monſieur <hi>Fouket,</hi> thatgreat Miniſter is confined, is a very ſtrong place, and like to be much ſtronger if they continue to carry on the work of their fortifications. The Town it ſelf is likewiſe very well fortified, where at the Gate going in they obliged us to leave our Arms, and to take a Soldier to wait upon us to the Governour for leave to ſee the Town and Cittadel, which was ſoon granted us. This place has a very great awe upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> being able by means thereof at their pleaſure to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road upon that Dukedom.</p>
