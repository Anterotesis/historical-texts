            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The continued Loyalty of (that
eminent Sufferer for the Good Old
Cause of his Majesty)
Captain GEORGE WHARTON.</head>
                  <p>FRom the year 1642, untill the surrender of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
this Loyal-minded Person was actually
in the Service of his late Royal Majesty of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Memory: being sometimes Comptroller
of his Majesties Train of Artillery, and Captain of a
Troop of Horse, which he raised at his own costs and
charges. And then, there being nothing more to be
done (the unhappy Wars now brought to a period)
he came to <hi>London</hi> upon the benefit of the <hi>Oxford</hi>-Articles;
where long he had not been, but he was
necessitated to drink deep of the Cup of sorrow, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
had provided for the Royal Party; <hi>being</hi> (as
himself in <hi>Hemer.</hi> 1651. saith) <hi>constantly at the pleasure
of the then power, subject to be turn'd out of Town, to
graze upon the Common, clap't up in Prisons to study
the generation of Nits and Lice; or necessitated to such
a Hellish kind of living, as nothing but Bats and Owls
and Cavaliers could possibly endure.</hi> And he (as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
more enemies, and those more mischievons then
many other Persons of that Party) was more narrowly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99962:3"/>
searcht after; and at the last, <hi>viz.</hi> in 1648. (by ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune)
discovered; and when once in hold, the famous
Jayls of <hi>Newgate, the Gatehouse, and Windsour-Castle,</hi>
began to be as commonly known to him, as if a Prison
had been all the Portion he (in this world) could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
expect. However, once it was his good hap to
escape; and being at liberty, he writ his <hi>Bellum Hiber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicale,
Merlini Anglici Errata,</hi> &amp;c. wherein he round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fearlesly corrected the errors of some that were
the Parliaments hirelings to abuse the King and his
Party, under pretence of Astrology: But Liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thing too precious for him long to enjoy, in those
cloudy and Tyrannical times, he was at length retaken:
and for ten or twelve yeers together, was seldom half
a year from being under restraint, until this time <hi>of
the happy Restoration of his glorious Majesty King
CHARLS the Second, unto his three Kingdoms of</hi>
England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding his constant sufferings, and
their frequent imprisoning of his body, his more noble
part was always free: and, as he had opportunity, he
did signifie to the world his Loyal affections to His
Sacred Majesty and his Cause, in several Books of his,
which (that the world may see, there have been some
men like sturdy Oaks, that could never be shaken or
brib'd to perjury) I shall (with other curious pieces of
his wit) present unto the Reader. That the lively
Copy of a truly Loyal subject may not be buryed in
Oblivion, but be brought to light afresh, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of others to persevere according to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
in Loyalty, Duty and Obedience.</p>

                     <l>Slightly pass over ne'er-returning years:</l>
                     <l>Thus States and Kingdoms to a Period draw;</l>
                     <l>Their Politicks must yeild to Natures Law.</l>
                     <l>Thus Kings and Beggars are Companions made,</l>
                     <l>Shake hands, and knock the Scepter 'gainst the Spade:</l>
                     <l>Thus Courts and Cottages become one Roof,</l>
                     <l>And Carts and Chariots meet without reproof:</l>

And since that all can preach, none now would pay</l>

                  <head>Vpon the Death of DENNIS BOND,
who died on that stormy Day, the same
Week the PROTECTOR died, who
lived four Days after him.</head>
                  <l>A Zealot for the Cause, liv'd always grac'd,</l>
                  <l>To right and left, to front and rear he fac'd;</l>
                  <l>And as times chang'd, he turn'd still: thus his stake</l>
                  <l>He sav'd, and did of Honour still partake.</l>
                  <l>To the Kings Murther (<hi>post</hi>) consent he gave;</l>
                  <l>And then admir'd proud <hi>Hops and Grains</hi> (that Slave!)</l>
                  <l>Own'd him a Saint, saw much of God in's face,</l>
                  <l>Only his Copper-Nose did much disgrace</l>
                  <l>The Divine Image: yet there's reason why</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Dennis</hi> with <hi>Oliver</hi> should thus comply.</l>
                  <l>Both Saints alike, and Rebels, th' one in grain,</l>
                  <l>Most stain'd with blood, but Traytors both remain.</l>

                  <l>Their Soveraigns Life, the Touchstone both to try.</l>
                  <l>He owns the Murther, th' other cries <hi>Amen;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>It is a Query which was worst: for when</l>
                  <l>He pawn'd his soul, this laid his <hi>Bond</hi> at stake,</l>
                  <l>A praise-deserving Action this to make</l>
                  <l>Clear as the Sun, and do appoint their day,</l>
                  <l>Ten years (bating few months) this game to play.</l>

Thus <hi>Noll</hi> went formost, nor did <hi>Bond</hi> disclaim</l>

                  <l>And firmly is resolv'd to justifie</l>
                  <l>That Law and Court which iudg'd King <hi>Charles</hi> to die.</l>

                  <l>To give a gloss to villany, but asks</l>

                  <l>This notwithstanding, both make sure of Heaven.</l>
                  <l>The time's elaps'd, the wager lost: what now?</l>
                  <l>Both would forget their Lay, but 'twill not do:</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Pluto</hi> boldly comes, and makes demand,</l>
                  <l>Th' affrighted Gamesters both amazed stand.</l>
                  <l>Fain would they finde Evasions; but he brings</l>
                  <l>Clear Evidence 'gainst Murther black of Kings:</l>

                  <l>In the remembrance of whose birth, each year</l>
                  <l>This solemn show is celebrated here:</l>

                     <hi>Pluto</hi> this day observes a Festival,</l>

In celebration of thy famous birth,</l>
                  <l>That their loud shouts do thus resound on earth;</l>
                  <l>Let no man marvel, if I take some pain,</l>
                  <l>A little knowledge thereof to obtain.</l>
                  <l>I view'd it carefully as it did pass;</l>
                  <l>I saw its shape, though knew not what it was.</l>
                  <l>But now, on second thoughts, I shall pourtray</l>
                  <l>This famous Bugbear, so far as I may.</l>
                  <l>'Tis like the dreadful <hi>Polyphemus</hi> Den,</l>
                  <l>That fearful one-ey'd Monster, who on Men</l>
                  <l>Gorgeth himself; his Guests who doth devour,</l>
                  <l>Not sparing any that's within his power;</l>
                  <l>And 'tis the mildest fate which doth befal</l>
                  <l>His friends, he them devours last of all.</l>
                  <l>This is the <hi>[tertium quid]</hi> which reconciles</l>
                  <l>Prodigious differing Sects; though each reviles</l>
                  <l>And hates the other; herein all agree;</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Solemn League</hi> brings them to Unitie.</l>
                  <l>The true Distinction is the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Betwixt the Sectary and Protestant.</l>
                  <l>This is the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> to know them; one</l>
                  <l>Makes conscience of an Oath, the other none:</l>
                  <l>One having sworn, religiously stands ti'd;</l>
                  <l>The other twenty Oaths can take beside;</l>
                  <l>Allegiance and Supremacie can swear,</l>
                  <l>Yet take the <hi>Cov'nant</hi> without any fear.</l>
                  <l>This Dance was led by the Presbytery,</l>
                  <l>And closely follow'd by the Sectary.</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Solemn League</hi> seems like that brand of fire</l>
                  <l>Betwixt two Foxes tayls, who can conspire</l>
                  <l>In mischief, though their heads look several ways:</l>
                  <l>Thus Sects unite, when each the Devil plays.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> quickly were made Friends,</l>
                  <l>While Christ with scorn one to the other sends.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:99962:42"/>
It doth resemble theevish <hi>Cacus</hi> Cave,</l>
                  <l>To which he drew his Oxen; or the grave</l>
                  <l>Of snakie-headed <hi>Typhon,</hi> whose last breath</l>
                  <l>Fired the Mountain <hi>Aetna</hi> at his death:</l>
                  <l>It's like the Lions all-devouring Den,</l>
                  <l>To which all footsteps led; but back agen</l>
                  <l>None could be found returning. But pronounce</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Covenant,</hi> 'tis not the <hi>Libyan</hi> Ounce,</l>
                  <l>Nor the <hi>Arabian</hi> Panther's half so fierce;</l>
                  <l>This through the Body to the Soul can pierce;</l>
                  <l>And like th' inchaunted Bulls, which none can tame,</l>
                  <l>Doth at its nostrils break forth smoak and flame.</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse, enclosing armed Men;</l>
                  <l>Or roaring Lion new rouz'd from his Den,</l>
                  <l>Could not the object prove of so great fear:</l>
                  <l>Better to meet the fiercest Northern Bear</l>
                  <l>Rob'd of her VVhelps, then in the claws to fall</l>
                  <l>O'th' Solemn League, which far surpasseth all.</l>
                  <l>This is the <hi>Babel</hi> of the Sectaries,</l>
                  <l>VVhich they intend shall over-top the Skies:</l>
                  <l>But as the number, so their Sects increase,</l>
                  <l>Untill Confusion cause that work to cease:</l>
                  <l>Turn the Sectarians over, and you'll find</l>
                  <l>Scarce any four, concurring in one mind;</l>
                  <l>This doth resemble that Gygantick VVar,</l>
                  <l>VVag'd against Heaven, when men rag'd so far,</l>
                  <l>The Gods themselves most proudly to defie,</l>

                     <hi>Pelion</hi> on <hi>Ossa</hi> heap't, t' approach the Skie.</l>
                  <l>Till <hi>Typhon</hi> burnt with lightning from above,</l>
                  <l>And strook with Thunder from Vindictive <hi>Jove,</hi>
                  </l>

To think what first he was, to what he grew,</l>
                  <l>Would startle Faith, and non-plus Reason too.</l>
                  <l>No doubt but future Ages will suspect</l>
                  <l>His Story; yea, had we not seen th' effect,</l>

                  <l>Nay we might doubt our eyes did us deceive,</l>
                  <l>But that we also felt, as well as saw</l>
                  <l>The weighty load of his imperious Law.</l>

                  <l>Such trembling horrour and amazement bring,</l>
                  <l>As that Vile Monster, who destroy'd his King.</l>
                  <l>What, is he dead? No, no; it cannot be:</l>

                  <l>Rather the time expir'd he here should dwell,</l>
                  <l>And hence he went to play his pranks in hell.</l>
                  <l>Who can imagine him of mortal breed?</l>
                  <l>Hell's Off-spring onely durst act such a Deed.</l>
                  <l>His Nose betray'd his Lin'age, and did show</l>
