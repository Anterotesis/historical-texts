            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE Use and Continuance of Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
since the Reformation, hath been
much inveighed against ever since
the rise of Puritanism, and represented as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51911:3"/>
injurious to Religion, and subservient on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Avarice and Ambition of the
Clergy. That the Puritans should with
so much heat oppose it, is not much to be
wondered; because it was allowed by the
Church, and the opposition carried with it
an apparent shew of religious Zeal. To that
waspish Generation it was a sufficient
ground of opposing any thing, if it were
practised or permitted by the Church,
however lawful and indifferent, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
decent and necessary; and no Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sice
was thought unlawful, which might
create to them an opinion of Sanctity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the People. But that an Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
raised against the Church by her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Enemies, should be continued and
prosecuted by her own Members, we should
have just cause to wonder; if we did not
know by frequent Examples to what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancies
Mankind may be betrayed
by the use of false Principles. None can
be ignorant, what Clamours have in late
years been raised and carried on against
Pluralities, what Accusatious have been
formed against them in the Writings and
Discourse of many, otherwise deservedly
eminent: how they are represented as the
great Scandal of the Reformation, and the
most pernicious Relique of Popery; that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51911:3"/>
they are traduced as the Cause of many
Evils and Inconveniencies in the Church;
affirmed to be sinful in the nature of them,
or little less than such, obstructing the
good of Souls, and destroying the honour
and welfare of the Church. And to lay
the greater load upon them, all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Exclamations, brought formerly by
good and zealous men against those enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Pluralities, which obtained in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are applied to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
permission and practice of them in
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> as if the same
thing were practised among us without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
restraint or limitation.</p>
               <p>The Clergy in the mean while, assured
of the justice of their Cause, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence
of these Exclamations, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
silent, expecting that this unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Accusation should cease with time,
or at least make no impression upon those,
whom the solly of Puritanism hath not yet
infected. But when many Persons of our
own Communion engage themselves in
the same quarrel, and publickly desame
the Church upon this account; it is not fit
the injured Clergy should any longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
their silence, lest it should be thought
to imply a Confession of Guilt, or give
way to all those Inconveniencies, which a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51911:4"/>
hasty and imprudent change in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
might probably produce to the
Church.</p>
               <p>I am not insensible, what a difficult
Province I have undertaken: what Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
and Censures will attend it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
will esteem it a Paradox; and most
will conclude it a rash Undertaking, to
oppose Reason to a Popular Cry, and to
endeavour to defend, what almost all men
by hearing only one side, have been long
since induced to condemn. Many good
men, really zealous and concerned for the
honour of Religion, will perhaps suppose
it to be a Scandal to apologize for what
they have hitherto believed to be no less
than Evil. To these I doubt not to give
intire satisfaction; if they will judge with
Candour and Indifferency. Others, who
are farr the most violent Adversaries, only
zealous in pretence, affecting to gain the
Reputation of Extraordinary Piety; not
really concerned for the Honour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but endeavouring to recommend
themselves by the pretence of it; will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
the Author of this Apology as an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to Religion and Purity, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Pluralist, who prefers his Interest
to the honour of God and the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
nor will perhaps stop here the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51911:4"/>
of their Anger, if he be so unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
as to be discovered.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is so easy, and withal so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
a Subject, to expose the Faults
of others, and especially the supposed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of a National Church; that the
Inclination of Ambitious men to oppose
this innocent practice of the Church, may
easily be accounted for. It seems to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
persons to be an evident Argument
of exalted Sanctity, to oppugn the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Discipline of any Communion; since
this insinuates as if they were more reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and knowing than a whole Nation.
To such men nothing is more grievous
than to be tied down to the ordinary
Rules of Religion and Government; since
to be religious in the common way, would
never distinguish them from other men.
Somewhat must be continually attempted
by them, which may make the credulous
part of Mankind cry out, <hi>See a man more
religious than all the Clergy, who went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or are contemporary with him! They all
practised, or at least allowed, a scandalous
Custom; This man's Piety is extraordinary,
and qualifieth him beyond others to be a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Church.</hi> It is lamentable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to consider, that the credulity of
Mankind should be so easily wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51911:5"/>
by designing men, and that Impostors
of this kind should seldom want success.
Such Exclamations against the received
Order and Discipline of the Church, have
ever since the first Foundation of it, been
the Common-place to all ambitious Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men
desiring to appear zealous. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more easy, than to discover vices
in another, or corruptions in a Society.
This is a Subject, which will afford con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
matter to publick Harangues, and
can never be exhausted. At the same
time nothing is more popular, in that it
qualisteth the perverse nature of men, who
generally love to hear things and persons
of publick esteem decried; and secureth
to the pretended Zealot the reputation of
a more elevated Piety, than that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in any of those whom he opposeth.
With this Artifice a man may not only
create Authority to himself, but cover his
own Faults however gross and numerous,
by diverting and fixing the eyes of men
upon the Faults of others; or if his own
Crimes be too notorious to be dissembled,
compensating for them by a wonderful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Zeal. He that will vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
exclaim against Pluralities, and
the other supposed Imperfections of the
Church, may safely neglect all the parts
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51911:5"/>
of his own duty; may be Non-resident,
may <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ordidly enrich himself and his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
may injure his Equals, oppress his
Inferiours: and all this shall be easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
in consideration of his Zeal. If I
would recommend my self to a Lecture
in the City, I could take no more success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
method, than to inveigh against Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,
to accuse the Clergy of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and covetousness. The name of a
zealous Reformer would set me beyond all
competition of real Worth and Learning.
If I desired to excuse any scandalous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities,
which cannot be dissembled;
I would arraign all the Corruptions of the
Church, exclaim powerfully against her
Governours, and cry up the necessity of
Reformation. To so warm a zeal for
publick good, private sins would easily be
permitted. Those who know the Town,
have seen Examples of both kinds within
this year.</p>
               <p>This Air of Popularity hath been the
great pest of the Church in all Ages; when
Church-men employ their Designs not so
much to preserve the Honour of Religion,
as to acquire to themselves a Name and
Interest among the Multitude; when they
apply themselves to obtain the favour of
the professed Enemies of the Church; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51911:6"/>
for that end stick not to betray her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
and to be instrumental in her
disgrace. Doubtless in the ancient Church
it would not have been thought any great
recommendation of a Catholick Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
to have sought the favour of the
<hi>Donatists,</hi> to admit and second those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
Imputations, which they cast upon the
Catholicks; to call them Brethren, and
treat the sincere Members of the Church
as Enemies. How can it ever be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Laity should conscientiously
obey the Constitutions of the Church, and
retain their duty to her; when the Clergy
make light of her Authority, vilifie her
Constitution, court the friendship of those
who have divided themselves from her
Communion, and seek her Ruine? when
for their sake they will slight her Sacred
Offices, mutilate or disuse her Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
prostitute her Honour, and betray
her Cause?</p>
               <p>It is undeniable, that this great Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Pluralities was raised by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Church, the Puritans, in the
last Age. Before the Reformation the
same Clamours were raised against Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
by the <hi>Mendicant</hi> Orders. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
and Hypocrisy of both are so like,
that they ought not to be passed by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51911:6"/>
some reflection. These <hi>Mendicant</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
arose and chiefly infested the Church
in the Thirteenth Age. They pretended
an extraordinary Call from God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the World, and correct the Faults
of the Secular Clergy. To this end they
put on a mighty shew of Zeal for the good
of mens Souls, and of contempt of the
World; accused the Secular Clergy of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing
the Souls of Men, called them <hi>dumb
Dogs</hi> and <hi>cursed Hirelings;</hi> maintained that
Evangelical Poverty became the Ministers
of the Gospel; that it was unlawful for
them to possess any thing, or to retain
propriety in any worldly Goods. As for
the Publick Orders of the Church, they
would not be tied to them, alledging,
that themselves being wholly Spiritual,
could not be obliged to any Carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
They broke in every where up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Parochial Clergy; usurped their
Office; in all populous and rich Places set
up Altars of their own; withdrew the
People from the Communion of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-Priest;
would scarce allow the hopes
of Salvation to any but their own Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
whom they bewitched with great
pretences of Sanctity, and assiduity in
Preaching. These Artifices had raised their
Reputation and Interest so high in a few
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51911:7"/>
years, that they wanted very little to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
the Secular Clergy, and therewith the
Church. But in less than an Age the
cheat of these Impostors became manifest
to all men. They procured to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
incredible Riches, built to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
stately Palaces; infinitely surpassed
that viciousness of which themselves had
(perhaps unjustly) accused the Secular
Clergy; and long before the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
became the most infamous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
part of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
After the decay of their Reputation the
<hi>Jesuites</hi> arose, that last and greatest Scourge
of the Christian Church; who upon the
same Principles and Pretences, carried on
the same Design, and still prosecute it in
opposition to the Clergy, where ever they
are planted; altho the World is no less
convinced of their Fraud than of their
Predecessours, whom, after all their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to Evangelical Poverty and Simplicity,
they have far exceeded in Riches and
worldly Interest. After all this it may be
easily judged, how little Authority their
Opinion in this matter ought to bear; and
how unfair it is to alledge the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the Regulars against the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Clergy. To cite the Opinions of them
in this Case of Pluralities, is no other than
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51911:7"/>
to produce the Authority of <hi>Baxter</hi> or
<hi>Owen</hi> against Episcopacy, or of <hi>Milton</hi> and
<hi>Ferguson</hi> against Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Such were the Opposers of Pluralities
in our Church before the Reformation (I
mean, the Opposers of the simple use of
them, as for the Opposers of the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
of them, many of them were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
men, of which I shall speak hereafter)
Since the Reformation, (altho the Abuse of
them was not continued) they have been
vehemently decried by the Puritans,
whose agreement with the <hi>Mendicants</hi> in
the same Principles and Designs, is so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from the precedent account of the
latter, that I need not make any minute
comparison. Every one knows, what were
the first Pretences and Principles of our
Dissenters, and what is their modern Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
how they inveighed against our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Clergy; maintained the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Possessions; set up Altar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Altar; withdrew the Laity from
their Communion; put on a specious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Mortification and unusual San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity;
have long since quitted their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
strictness, but still retain the pretence,
and their quarrel to the Clergy. Thus an
hardned Hypocrisy will obstinately persist,
altho it be notorious that the Cheat has
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51911:8"/>
been long since discovered, by the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of a more licentious practice of those
things, which themselves have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in others. Particularly in this Case of
Pluralities, it is well known, that when the
Dissenters had by a successful Rebellion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
all the Clergy of the Kingdom, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their lawful King, and usurped
the Authority and Revenues of both; their
Leaders and Favourites seized on, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to themselves, more Benefices, than
have been lately united in any Clergy-man
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And at
this day, many of the Heads of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
hold Plurality of Conventicles, as
the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland</hi> do of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</p>
               <p>To these open and professed Enemies
of the Church, I might add those secret
ones. those unfaithful Clergy-men, those
<hi>Traditores,</hi> who seek to oblige the Enemies
of the Church by betraying her Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards
to them. Altho I would not lay
the imputation of Infidelity upon all;
Some, it may be hoped, acted upon a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
Zeal and false Prejudices. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whatever Principle they proceeded,
it was long since observed of them,<note place="margin">

with insatiable greediness they heaped up

Mortal Sin. Among all our Bishops since

of our Communion, whom the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Cry against Pluralities may have
deceived; I would desire them to judge
of the Reasons which this Apology shall
offer, without prejudice; and in the mean
while to cast their Eyes upon those real
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51911:9"/>
Pests of the Church, Mental Simony, and
Bonds of Resignation; which in time will
become her ruine. The removal of these
Evils will far more become their Zeal; and

               <p>Notwithstanding the seeming difficulty
of maintaining what in the opinion of
most men is a Paradox; notwithstanding
the opposition which may be expected
from good men prepossessed herein, and
bad men who by such a Defence may be
deprived of one of their Common-places
of Declaiming; I thought it my duty to
undertake this Province, being assured,
that therein I should defend the Honour
and the Interest of the Church of Christ,
which ever since the first Institution of
Parishes, hath permitted Pluralities, and
cannot now be well supported without
them; the wisdom of the Parliaments
and the Laws of this Kingdom, which have
allowed them; of the Kings and Queens
of this Nation, who have confirmed, and
continue them; of the Honourable Peers
and Universities of this Realm, who have
qualified Persons to obtain them; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of many excellent Persons both
alive and dead, who have granted and
enjoyed them; of many eminent Divines
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51911:9"/>
and Lawyers, who have justified them:
and that I shall hereby free the most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops residing near the Court for the
Service of their Majesties and of the
Church, from the Imputation of that
mortal sin, which all who maintain the
unlawfulness of Pluralities, fix upon Non-residence.
To the defence of all these
Things and Persons I am bound either by
respect or duty; and if therewith the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
practice of some present Oppugners
of Pluralities be defended; I shall not be
sorry, altho I should receive no thanks from
them.</p>
               <p>The Enemies of Pluralities proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these Heads: either, that to hold more
Benefices than one with Cure of Souls is
<hi>Jure Divino</hi> unlawful; or that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the first design of Parochial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments;
or that it is highly inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient

                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <p>THAT Pluralities are unlawful by
the Law of God, some Casuists of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (chiefly those of the
<hi>Mendicant</hi> or <hi>Jesuit</hi> Orders) have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and many Zealous Oppugners of
Pluralities among the Reformers have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up their Opinion; or at least exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the guilt of Pluralities so far, as that
it can searce otherwise be interpreted. If
we enquire the Reasons of this heinous
Charge; it is certain, that nothing can be
<hi>Jure Divino</hi> unlawful, but either by the
Law of Nature, or by the Positive Law
of God. For the first, none have been
so ridiculous, as to pretend, that the Law
of Nature bath determined any thing in
this place: That directs no more of Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Priests, than of Parochial Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
There remains then only the Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Law of God, expressed in Scripture,
which can fix this guilt upon Pluralities.
But if we peruse the Bible from one end to
the other, we shall find no Directions
herein; no mention being made therein,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51911:10"/>
either of Parochial Priests or Parochial
Cures; nor indeed could be, since the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of them was first made long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the writing of those sacred Oracles, as
we shall prove hereafter. As for Texts
which may be supposed to allude thereto,
which our Reformed Adversaries some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alledge, they are of no moment in
this cause; since it is a received Principle
among all Protestants, that nothing is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
to be believed unlawful, which is
not declared to be such, either by the Law
of Nature, or by the express words of
Scripture. Yet in this case our Adversaries
are not ashamed to betray the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Principle of the Reformed Church, and
arraign that as <hi>malum in se,</hi> of which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Scripture are wholly silent. In
our Dissenters this Opinion is yet much
more unpardonable, who maintain, that
nothing ought to be introduced in the
Worship of God, or in Ecclesiastical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
which is not warranted by express
words of Scripture. For things indifferent
in their own nature, may still remain so
notwithstanding the silence of Scripture;
but the nature of any thing can never be
changed from indifferent to unlawful with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
express words of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>When Scripture cannot be produced, our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51911:11"/>
Adversaries fly to Metaphors, making
great use of a Metaphor frequent in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Canons, wherein the discharge of the
Episcopal or Parochial care is compared
to Marriage; that as a man cannot have
two Wives, so neither can he have two
Benefices. But, alas! shall Metaphors and
tropes and similies condemn a man! Hath
the Scripture any where said that all the
circumstances of Marriage shall be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the case of Benefices with Cure of
Souls? Doth not every one know, that
nothing is more ordinary, than to stretch
Similitudes too far, or more fallacious,
than to argue from them? Will these men
be concluded by the Similitude which
themselves bring? If so, it will be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to be translated from one Bishoprick
to another, or from one Benefice to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as it is to change one Wife for
another. But against this the early and
universal practice of the Church hath
prevailed, as to the Lawfulness of it.
(The too common practice of it was
afterwards restrained by Canons) And,
as I suppose, none of our Adversaries
will maintain such Translations to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:51911:11"/>
But the chief foundation of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is the Necessity of Residence, which
they suppose to be of Divine Right; and
since Residence cannot be maintained in
two different places at the same time, that
therefore Plurality of Benefices is unlawful.
If we demand their warrant for this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion,
as in the former case, we shall
find them very destitute. The Law of
Nature they do not pretend to herein:
The Texts of Scripture which they urge
are very remote, and scarce applicable to
our case. Such are, that reproof of the
Shepherds of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">XXXIV. 2, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Wo to the
Shepherds of</hi> Israel, <hi>that feed themselves.
Sould not the Shepherds feed the flocks? Ye
eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wooll.
The diseased have ye not strengthned, neither
have ye healed that which was sick—but
with force and with cruelty have ye ruled
them,</hi> &amp;c. or that description of them in
<hi>Isaiah, His watchmen are blind,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">LVI. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>they are
all dumb dogs, they cannot bark, sleeping,
lying down, loving to slumber,</hi> &amp;c. He must
be very acute, that can convict Pluralists
out of these Texts: what is there in all
this, which may not as well be applied
to Priests possessing one Benefice as two?
Nay what doth this at all concern Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Priests as such; being directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51911:12"/>
the Prophets of <hi>Israel,</hi> many of
whom were not Priests, and those who
were Priests, not fixed in distinct Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes?
Not to say that he must be blind
who sees not, that the first passage is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
against the oppression and tyranny
of Temporal Governours; the second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
the cowardice and neglect of the
Prophets, who did not couragiously op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Idolatry, nor warn the People against
it, as they ought to have done, when
wicked Princes endeavoured to introduce
it. Such dumb dogs were the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
and other Dissenters in the Reign of
the late King; who formerly made a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
outcry against Popery in the Reign of
other Kings, when there was little or no
danger of it; but when the danger became
real, and Popery in earnest began tobe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced,
were then wholly silent, feared
to oppose it; but rather assisted to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it, by encouraging that unhappy Prince
in the Usurpation of his Dispensing Power.</p>
                  <p>I should be thought to trifle, if I should
give a serious answer to some other Texts,
which are in this case produced by our
Adversaries to no better purpose. That
Text of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> alledged by the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
Conventicler,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Abraham begat Isaac</hi>
(whence he observed, that Residence was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51911:12"/>
of Divine Right, for if <hi>Abraham</hi> had not
resided, he could not have begat <hi>Isaac</hi>) is
as material as any of them; not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the irrefragable Testimony said to be
produced by the Assembly of Divines who
in their Annotations on the first Chapter
of <hi>Genesis,</hi> having taken notice of all these
parts of the World, which God is there
said to have created, subjoyned this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
note, <hi>Here is no mention made of Arch-Bishops,
Bishops, Arch-Deacons, Officials,
Pluralists,</hi> &amp;c. Ergo, <hi>God did not create
them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Opinion of the necessity of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is chiefly taken from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and Divines in the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist. Conc. Trid.</hi> p. 217. &amp;c.</note>
who often and strongly endeavoured to
get Residence to be declared to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Right, and consequently indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Their Authority in this case never
fails to be urged by our Adversaries; as if
they would represent the Clergy of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be worse than those
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> However it is
somewhat absurd to urge against us the
Authority of the minor part of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
when themselves will not be bound
by the Decrees of the major part of it.
We believe the whole Council to be falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
much more the lesser part. They
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51911:13"/>
pretend indeed this to have been the more
Learned and Honest part of the Council.
This is spoken <hi>gratis,</hi> and may as easily
be denied by us. If it were worth the
while, it could be proved, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Bishops were not free from sinister and
corrupt designs herein, and the Divines
who disputed on their side were all <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican
Friers,</hi> and consequently no impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Judges of the duty of the Secular
Clergy. But to make the most of their
Authority, it respecteth not the Case of
Parochial Priests, but only of Bishops. The
Pope had usurped to himself the Title of
Universal Bishop, not only in Name, but
Office; upon pretence of which his Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
maintained, that all the Pastoral
power of the Church was committed ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
by Christ to him alone, and from
him derived to other Bishops, who were
no other than his Delegates and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners.
To overthrow this Doctrine, and
assert their own Authority, the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Bishops laboured in the Council to obtain
a Declaration of the Divine Right of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
since if that were allowed, it would
necessarily follow, that their Order also
was of Divine Right, and not only by
Papal permission and Delegation. Of this
the Pope and his Dependants in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51911:13"/>
being aware, quashed their undertaking.
Now all this relates only to Bishops; So
that to apply the Opinion of the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Bishops herein to the Case of Parish Priests,
may be allowed indeed in our Dissenters,
who make no distinction between the two
Orders; but is unpardonable in a Writer
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who cannot
but know, that, altho the Pope hath not
original Jurisdiction <hi>in toto &amp; in solido</hi>
in any Diocese beside his own, yet a Bishop
hath in all the Parishes of his Diocese;
and that, altho Episcopacy is of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
yet Parochial Cures are not
so.</p>
                  <p>But to clear this matter beyond all
doubt, I will examine the Case of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
more strictly, and first by such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,
as shall equally concern the Case
of Bishops and of Parish Priests; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I will prove, that the Residence of
Bishops is not of Divine Right; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew, that although the Residence of
Bishops were of Divine Right, yet it would
not thence follow, that the Residence of
Parish Priests is of the same kind.</p>
                  <p>Of the general Considerations which
concern the Cause of both, the first shall
be, that it will be impossible to settle the
limits and term of this <hi>jure divino</hi> Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51911:14"/>
Things of this nature appear very
plausible in the theory, and while they
are carried no further, seem desirable and
excellent; but when they are reduced to
practice, the folly of the speculation will
soon appear. If therefore the <hi>Spanish</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
had been asked in the Council, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Residence which they asserted to
be of Divine Right, included the whole
Year, or only part of it; they could not
have agreed in it. If Residence of the
whole Year were required by the Law of
God, by what warrant did they appear
in that place out of their Diocesses, or at
any time attend their Prince or his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
or Officers upon the weighty Affairs
of Church or State? If only partial Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
were required, who should define,
how much God would accept, or how
much might lawfully be spent out of their
Diocesses? It might have been alledged
against them, that it was rash and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
for any man to define the limits
of the time required; or rather, that
since God himself had revealed nothing as
to this matter, it was an evident argument
that he intended no such obligation. That
if Residence were indeed <hi>jure divino</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
no Authority upon earth could
dispence with one days absence; but if so,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51911:14"/>
the interest, and necessities and emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Church could not be managed
successfully or supplied. Or if 40 or 60
days were allowed for such occasions,
why not as well 70 or 80, since here was
no fixed rule to determine the number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the occasions and necessities of the
Church, which might sometimes as well
require an absence of the whole 365 days
as of sixty? And when such cases happen,
such a total absence would be lawful for
the same reasons, for which they supposed
a partial absence to be so. The <hi>Spanish</hi>
Bishops therefore in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist. Conc. Trid.</hi> p. 255.</note>
at the same time that they desired Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Bishops to be declared to be <hi>jure divino,</hi>
required it to be decreed, That Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
are bound to reside in their Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
six months in the Year at least. By
the same reason that they allowed six
months of Non-residence, others might
have allowed eight; since the same au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
or reasons, which could dispense
with the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Residence for one
half of the Year, might dispense with it
for two thirds; and if for so much, why
not for the whole? This uncertainty of
opinion, and impossibility of fixing any
certainty herein, manifests the whole sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to want all foundation. Yet it is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51911:15"/>
not unfit to be considered, that if the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Bishops should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
a Dualist might easily observe the
conditions of their <hi>jure divino</hi> Residence,
residing six months at one Benefice, and
six months at the other. So that their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is not only false, but also imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to our purpose, who defend the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
which allows no more than two Benefices
to one person.</p>
                  <p>Now to dismiss the <hi>Spanish</hi> Bishops, and
consider the intrinsick merits of the Cause,
let us enquire upon what grounds Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
can be thus supposed to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Certainly the Nature of the thing
doth not absolutely direct it. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an Incumbents house seated in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
limits of his Parish, as is the case of
many; the Incumbent living herein will
be allowed to observe Residence. Now
suppose the Incumbent dwelleth not here,
but an hundred yards further in another
contiguous Parish; shall this Residence
cease to be such as is required <hi>jure divino,</hi>
meerly for the difference of the distance
of an hundred yards, altho he may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be much nearer to his own Church,
than many thousand other Incambents
who live within the bounds of their own
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51911:15"/>
Parishes? I know it is forbidden by our
Civil Laws: But that alters not the state
of the Question, when we enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of this Residence.
Let us again put the Case of two conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
Parishes, united in the person of one
Priest, who resides in one of them, and
of some other Parish, which besides the
Mother-Church, hath a Chappel of case
annexed to it. I challenge the most acute
man in the whole World, to discover any
difference as to matter of Conscience or
Divine Institution between these two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
For altho our Law maketh a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
yet the Law of God and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing make none. However
none ever doubted the lawfulness of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Chappel of case with the Mother-Parish.
Nay altho the Mother Parish may
contain five or seven, or s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>metimes ten
Chappels of ease, no difference is made in
the case. Some of these Chappels may be
ten miles distant from the Mother-Church;
yet here the judgments of men alter not
because of such distance. And if ten miles
distance be allowed, why not fifteen, or
twenty, or thirty which the Canon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows

whether the Chappel or distinct Church
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51911:16"/>
be ten or thirty miles distant from the
Mother Church or the other distinct
Church, at which the Rector of both doth
reside; it is certain, that the Sacred Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of each must be supplied by a Curate;
And then the exclamations of the Anti-Pluralists
will lye equally against both ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
That here the Sacred trust is hired
out to Mercenaries; That one feeds the
Flock, and another receives the Fleece. It
would be inexcusable folly to alledge, that
in one case the two Parishes are distinct,
in the other case but one. For do we think
that God will regard this nicety, when
in the nature of the thing there is no real
difference? Not to say that Plurality of
Benefices is in our Church confined to the
number of two; whereas Chappels of ease
belonging to one Mother-Church are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to be held without number; altho
<hi>in foro conscientiae,</hi> one Mother-Church
with three Chappels of ease doth as really
constitute four distinct Benefices, as one
distinct Benefice personally united to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do constitute two Benefices. Yet no
scruple is made of the lawfulness of one
case, altho the crime of it, if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
is really double to the other.</p>
                  <p>Yet after all, our Adversaries will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
and without regard to the merit or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51911:16"/>
reason of things, will maintain that Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
are unlawful. That they are not
unlawful in their nature we have proved;
That Non-residence also in the nature of
it is not unlawful, is evinced. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
therefore to the Sacred Office annexed
to the Benefice, and contend that it ought
to be executed by personal attendance;
that the Incumbents ought not to receive
the fee, and commit the work to the care
of some inferior or raw Practitioner, but
personally watch over the Cure of Souls
committed to their charge. Now in the
Case of Chappels of ease Curates are and
must be imployed, yet they condemn not
the practice. So that it is not simply evil
to discharge this imposed trust by Curates.
But to dismiss this Case of Chappels of
ease, so grievous to our Anti-Pluralists;
it is well known, that the Terms of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations
of Pluralities require every
Pluralist to reside upon each Benefice some
considerable time every year. So that he
cannot be said, wholly to commit to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries
the trust imposed on him; since
himself doth in each Benefice successively
discharge it. To this our Adversaries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn,
that by the Law of God he is bound
to discharge the whole trust in his own
person, and not commit any part of it to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51911:17"/>
Mercenaries. Now see the unhappiness
of airy Projects. If this be admitted, all
the inconveniencies before mentioned in
the Case of necessity of perpetual Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
will return. Or if, to avoid them,
they will allow that the Incumbent may
sometimes be absent, suppose for two
months in every year; then during that
time his Office must be supplied by a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute.
So that for two months time, it
will be lawful for any Incumbent to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his Office by a Proxy; And if for
two months, why not for three, or four,
or more? Who shall determine the utmost
limit of the allowed time? If it be said,
that the Laws of the Country shall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it, as it hath in our Nation, by the
space of two months; I answer, that I
enquire not now what may be done <hi>jure
humano,</hi> but <hi>divino;</hi> besides that this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Law hath been dispensed with and
relaxed by other Laws, in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Cases; and especially in the Case of
Pluralities.</p>
                  <p>But to forgive all the absurdities, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and inconveniencies, to which the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of our Adversaries necessarily doth
betry them, and proceed to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of their remaining arguments: It
is generally alledged by them, That the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51911:17"/>
care of Souls, being so great a concern,
ought to be managed with the utmost di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence;
that it ought not to be delegated
to a more unworthy person; that the
common good of the Church and of the
Souls of men, require this Office should
be discharged by the proper and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Officer. These things sound very
well at the first hearing; but when redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to practice, are found to be insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.
for it oft-times happens, That the
Curate is a better Physician of Souls than
the Rector; in which case it conduceth to
the Spiritual good of such a Parish, that
the cure thereof be supplyed rather by the
Curate, than by the Rector in person. I
know our Adversaries will presently cry
out, Remove the Rector, and let the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
take his place. But soft and fair; It
would scarce be thought just, that a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
should be dispossessed, and his Estate
given to another upon no other Title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than
the greater worth of the latter. It is not
enough to distinguish our case by reason of
the Spiritual concern of it; for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in both cases is alike. In the next
place, the Rector, tho in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eriour to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in this respect, may in other respects
be farr superiour in merit to him. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if this were admitted, no quiet or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51911:18"/>
peace in the Church could ever be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
as upon the least reflection will be
evident beyond contradiction. Further,
if we should suppose the Rector to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the farr more worthy person, more
skilful to direct the Souls of men, and more
diligent in applying such direction; yet
would not the opinion of our Adversaries
be thence evinced. Rather it would be
for the common good of the Church, and
the Souls of men, that such a person should
be entrusted with the care of two Parishes.
For altho he ordinarily supplies one Parish
by a Curate; yet he is bound to reside at
that some considerable time every year,
and at all times to inspect and direct his
Curate. By which means two Parishes
enjoy the benefit of this excellent Guide,
which without the permission of Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
would have been afforded but to one;
the number of such excellent persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the judgment of all men far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to the number of Parochial Cures in
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last effort of our Adversaries is,
That the Ministers of every Parish are
bound to give an account to God of the
Souls of the persons committed to their
charge; that God will not accept this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
by any Proxy, but will expect that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51911:18"/>
every Parish Priest should render it in his
own person, and according to his own
knowledge: That it is not enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Divine Offices, and repeat Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
once a week; but they must visit the
sick, reprove the scandalous, reconcile dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
teach their flock by constant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
as well as doctrine. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is plausible, and easie to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by an ordinary understanding, that I
need not add any more, to give to it its
full force. Yet withal it will be found to
include nothing of Substance, if it be nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
examined. As much of it as infers,
that God will exact from every Parish
Priest a particular account of every single
Soul committed to his care, or that he
will in no case accept the discharge of this
care by a Substitute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is false. For no more
can be required, than that the Priest should
render a general account of his charge,
that he hath been diligent in preaching,
in administring the Holy Offices, ready to
apply this general care to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as opportunity should offer, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
in his Conversation. And then as
to a Proxy, if the Priest alledgeth, that
the same authority of the Bishop, which
committed the care of the Parish to him,
did disburden him of that care, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51911:19"/>
it in whole or in part upon a Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
there is no reason to believe, that God
will not accept this plea. We readily
grant that the Cure of Souls is a weighty
concern, that great diligence ought to be
used in the discharge of it; that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to whom it is committed, whether
Incumbent or Curate, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
among his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lock, and, acquainting
himself with the necessities of it, make
constant provision for them. The Church
had considered this long since; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
our Anti-pluralists be puffed up with
an Opinion of their own singular wisdom,
had weighed the force of this argument
long before them. For this reason, by the
constant practice of the Governours of the
Church, it hath been provided, that two
populous Parishes have not been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the care of one person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if one
be far more populous than the other, he
should make his more constant Residence
in the former. These Rules the Arch-Bishops
never <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ail to observe in granting
Dispensations of Pluralities, and these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
obviate all the force of the
Objection. For in two contiguous Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
(which is the most ordinary case of
Pluralities) the Incumbent of both, altho
residing constantly in one of them, may
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51911:19"/>
easily minister to the necessities of them
both; may inform himself of the behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of his flocks; may administer spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
advice to them; may be exemplary
in his life and conversation to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ach Parish;
may be enabled of his own knowledge to
give an account of them to the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
of Souls. The case of two remote
Benefices, committed to the care of one
Priest is more rare: Yet even in this case
the Church hath made sufficient provision
for the same advantages, by directing the
Pluralist, to reside upon the one the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
part of the year, and upon the other at
least three months in the year; and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him a Dispensation upon these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
That this three months Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon that Benefice which is less
frequented, added to the constant residence
of an able Curate upon it, will fully supply
the ends above-mentioned, will easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
No man doubts that a Parish Priest
in the City of <hi>London,</hi> holding one Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
there, and residing continually upon
it, may be able fully and conscientiously
to discharge his duty. Now the number
of Souls in the Parishes of <hi>London,</hi> one
with another, may be reasonably compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be about 5000. Scarce any Parish
in <hi>England,</hi> possest by a Pluralist, upon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51911:20"/>
which he is not bound by the Canon to
bestow his more constant Residence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
500 Souls: However, suppose that
to be the number, in this Parish including
500 Souls, he is obliged to reside three
months every year. It is manifest, that
in a particular application of the labour
and care of the Incumbent to his Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
and a particular enquiry into the
state and behaviour of them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
the influence of a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to all of them, three months will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as much in relation to 500 as thirty
months, and much more than twelve
months will do in relation to these 5000.
So that if we grant the people of <hi>London</hi>
to be sufficiently provided for in their
spiritual concerns, by the constant Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their Parish Priests; much more
will the three months Residence of any
Rector, added to the constant attendance
of his Curate, supply the necessities of any
such Country Parish.</p>
                  <p>These considerations are in some sort
applicable to the case of Bishops; And
however I have chosen all along to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the case of Parochial Pluralities
or Non residences; because the examples
of them are more frequent, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of them the more immediate design
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51911:20"/>
of this Apology: yet all which hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
said of Parish Priests, I conceive may
in some measure be true, applied to Bishops.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to examine the case of
Bishops separately. In the first place,
strictly speaking, Residence cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be enjoyned even to them <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi>
if it be permitted to one Bishop to
hold two Bishopricks together: Yet for
this we have the example and authority
of the Primitive Church. For whereas
the ordinary discipline of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a Bishop to be placed in every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to govern it and the circumjacent
Territory; wherever we find that one
Bishop presided over two Cities, we must
conclude, that he did in effect govern two
Dioceses. Now examples of this kind are
frequent in the ancient Church. Thus in
the middle of the third Age, the Cities of
<hi>Leon</hi> and <hi>Asturia</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> had<note place="margin">Chron. Hisp. <hi>p</hi>

                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:51911:21"/>
had but one Bishop; so also <hi>Bizya</hi> and
<hi>Arcadiopolis, Coele</hi> and <hi>Callipolis, Subsadia</hi>
and <hi>Aphrodisias.</hi> And the Bishops of this
Province affirmed in the Council, that this
was <hi>an ancient custom, which had obtained
of old, and from the beginning in the Provinces
of</hi> Europa, <hi>that those Cities never had distinct
Bishops. Vetus mos viget in Provinciis Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae
—olim &amp; ab initio—nunquam praedictae
Civitates proprios Episcopos acceperunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such was the Practice of the ancient u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Church. In the particular Church
of <hi>England,</hi> examples of this kind have
been frequent for above a thousand years,
and are to this day continued. For such
I account to be all those cases, in which
two distirct Dioceses have been united
and incorporated into one, and thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
subjected to the government of one
Bishop. I know that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rom that time they
became but one Bishoprick in the eye of
the Law, and the common account of the
world; but in reality, in truth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
they do still constitute two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Bishopricks, since no humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
can alter the nature of things, and
dispense with the positive Laws of God,
such as are supposed by our Adversaries to
intervene in the case of Episcopal Residence.
It is manifest, that here is no real change
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51911:21"/>
made by this union in the nature of the
thing it self. All the Souls which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
committed to the care of two Bishops,
are now subjected to one: All the Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which was before placed in two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
is now invested in one. So that, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Legal union it was <hi>malum in se</hi> for
one Bishop to govern these two Diocesses,
it will continue so to the end of the world
notwithstanding ten thousand Laws, and
ten thousand years prescription. No hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Authority can make that lawful,
which God or the nature of the thing hath
made unlawful; no length of time will
prescribe against either of these reasons.
It is therefore vain to imagine, that a real
union of two Diocesses or Parishes, doth
any more exempt a man from the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
guilt of Pluralities, than a personal u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
For it is no more lawful to dispense
with the Laws of God concerning Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or against Plurality for ever, than
for a certain time; and if unlawful to do
it for a certain time, much more to do it
for ever. Now the only difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a real and a personal union is, that
whereas in the latter Plurality of Diocesses
or Benefices, and consequently Non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon one of them, is dispensed with
during the life or possession of some one
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51911:22"/>
Incumbent; in the former they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed
with for ever. It therefore unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
follows, that wherever two Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
are perpetually united, altho by the
greatest Authority of the Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and submitted for ever to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of one Bishop; the Bishops of
that double Diocess will be for ever as
much guilty of the Sins of Plurality and
Non-residence, as if no such union had
been made. In this Nation, the present
Diocess of <hi>Salisbury</hi> is made up of the two
Diocesses of <hi>Sherburn</hi> and <hi>Ramsbury</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned;
the Bishoprick of <hi>Exeter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the two ancient Bishopricks of <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and S. <hi>Germans;</hi> the Bishoprick of
<hi>Norwich</hi> those of <hi>Dunwich</hi> and <hi>Elmham;</hi>
the Bishoprick of <hi>Lincoln</hi> those of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,
Sidnacester,</hi> and <hi>Leicester;</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
of <hi>Durham</hi> those of <hi>Li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>disfarn</hi>
and <hi>Hexham.</hi> So that the present Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of <hi>Salisbury, Exeter, Norwich, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi>
and <hi>Durham,</hi> do as truly hold Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Bishopricks, as any Priest in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
doth Plurality of Benefices.</p>
                  <p>In the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
almost every Bishop admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
two Bishopricks, yet no Scruple was
ever raised of the lawfulness of this practice.
If our Adversaries alledge that this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51911:22"/>
is done by Authority of the Church and
Parliament of that Nation; that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
excuse the intrinsick evil of Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Non-residence, if any such there be.
Besides that in our case in <hi>England,</hi> Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities
are held by the same Authority
of the National Church and Parliament.
If they alledge that these <hi>Irish</hi> Bishopricks
are thus united because of the smalness of
the Revenues, not sufficient to maintain
a Bishop singly; I would know, why the
same reason shall not be allowed in the
case of two Benefices united in the person
of one Priest? Altho, if Plurality and
Non-residence be in their nature sinful, as
they pretend, this reason ought not to be
allowed in either case, and both Bishop and
Priest ought rather to starve than commit
the sin.</p>
                  <p>Further, upon the Principles of these
Anti-Pluralists it would be absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
for any Bishop to hold another
Bishoprick in Commendam, or by way of
Administration, either for life or for a
certain time limited or unlimited. Yet
such Commendams or Administrations
have been always allowed in the Church,
either because of the poverty of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick
held in Commendam, or to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the defect of the proper Bishop, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51911:23"/>
from performing his Office by age,
infirmity, suspension or deprivation. And
very lately we had examples of this kind
in our Church; when the Administration
of the Diocess of <hi>Wells</hi> was committed
to the present Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that
of <hi>Norwich</hi> to the present Bishop of S. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph,</hi>
&amp;c. Yet none of our Anti-Pluralists
blamed these Reverend Bishops for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
the Administration of them; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
upon their Principles they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
guilty of Plurality therein, in presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
over two Bishopricks at the same
time. If it be answered, that this was
only for a short time; I reply, that a
sinful act ought no more to be continued
one year, than fifty. If it be alledged
that they enjoyed not the Temporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
but only the Spiritual Jurisdiction
of these Diocesses; I answer, that this is
all which properly belongs to the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Function, and constitutes the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a Bishop: The Temporalties are
no essential part of him. If it be said,
that this was done for the good of the
Church; I answer, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:51911:23"/>
It appears then plainly, how false and
pernicious the Principles are of these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-pluralists;
That they make it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to continue the Government or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Church without inevitable sin,
or to secure the reputation of so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Prelates from partaking in this sin.
It is much more easie, safe and charitable
to suppose, that in all these cases of Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Non-residence,
the principle by
which every man ought to direct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
is the general good of the Church.
And this is the true resolution of the Case.
Bishops and Priests were not ordained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to serve this Diocess or that Parish in
particular, but the Church of Christ in
general. Good Order and Discipline in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
require, that the exercise of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
be confined to some certain limits and
place; but he still remains a Bishop or
Priest, not of that place only, but of the
whole Catholick Church; and may exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his Office in any part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church out of his own limits, if the
greater good of the Church shall so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
Whether any mans private case be
such, he ought to judge by rules of right
reason, taking especial care, that he do
not flatter and deceive himself herein by
a false judgment: And after the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51911:24"/>
and direction of his own Conscience,
ought to be directed herein by his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours;
the Priests by their Bishop, and
the Bishops by their Metropolitan. And
when such Cases happen, the rules of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and the Laws of the Church allow
Bishops and Priests, either to be Non-resident,
or to retain the administration
of more than one Diocess or Parish. Thus
in times of Persecution, it was always
thought lawful for Bishops or Priests to be
Non-resident, and to execute their Office
in any part of the Catholick Church,
where-ever they should come. In times
of Infection, I will not say it was always
thought lawful to be Non-resident; but I
am sure it was always thought lawful, for
any Parish Priest in that case to take upon
him the care of any neighbour Parish, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
by the proper Pri<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t. Upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of General, Patriarchal or Provincial
Councils, it was always accounted lawful
for Bishops to absent themselves from
their Diocesses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and attend the Council,
altho it should last for many months, or
years together. All these Cases became
lawful for the same reason; because the
greater good of the Church did so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                  <p>Upon the same account it is lawful for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51911:24"/>
the Prelates of our Church to attend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
their Majesties in Council or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
or any weighty offices, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
wherein they shall please to employ
them; and in all these cases to be Non-resident;
because it is the interest of the
Church in general. It is more for the
advantage of this National Church, that
the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
near the Court, and be always ready
to advise their Majesties in matters of
Religion, and defend the cause of the
Church upon all occasions; and more
readily receive Appeals, and give dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to his whole Province; than that
he should be tied down in constant Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his own Diocess. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
all the Archbishops of <hi>Canterbury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
since the Reformation, have for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of the year; and all for these six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years last past, during the whole year,
resided at <hi>Lambeth.</hi> For this reason all
the Bishops of the Church are w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt to give
attendance in Parliament, altho some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
their Sessions continue a whole year
together; because the Church reapeth
greater benefit by their presence there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
than it suffers detriment by a temporary
absence from their Diocesses. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
many excellent Prelates have attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51911:25"/>
whole years together at Court; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is always of greater advantage to
the Church in general, to secure the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Prince to it, and direct his
conscience, than continually to attend
to the care of any particular Diocess.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, if this Principle of
these Anti-pluralists be allowed; if Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
be always sinful, and in its nature;
if Residence be of Divine Right, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
in all cases indispensable; it will
follow, That all those holy and learned
Bishops, who in all Ages have appeared
in Councils; That all who have absented
themselves in time of Persecution, or, in
that and like cases, have taken upon them
the care of other Diocesses or Parishes;
That all the Bishops of our Church, who
have attended Parliaments since the first
institution of them; That all the Kings,
Lords and Commons of this Nation, who
have by publick Laws required their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
therein; That all the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and other excellent Prelates alive
and dead, who have absented themselves
from their Diocesses, to attend the publick
Service of the Church at Court; have
committed mortal sin, and do still continue
in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:51911:25"/>That what hath been laid down in the
case of Bishops, may not be mistaken, I
will subjoyn, That the obligation of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
to all the parts and consequences of
their duty, and particularly as to Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
is far greater than that of Parochial
Priests; in as much as the right discharge
of their Office, is of greater concern to
the good of the Church, and is also impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on them by Divine Institution. If
therefore a Priest ought not to neglect his
charge, much less a Bishop: and if the
absence of a Parochial Priest ought to be
supplied by a Curate; much more doth
it seem reasonable, that the absence of a
Bishop, if it be long or frequent, should
be supplied by a Suffragan Bishop. It is a fatal
mistake to imagine, that the care of the Souls
of the Laity belongs only to the inferiour
Clergy; and that the Bishop hath no more
to do but only to govern the Clergy; or
that a Diocess doth not more want the
constant presence of a Bishop, than any
private Parish the presence of a Priest.
And therefore in the Church of <hi>England</hi>
before the Reformation, even in the most
corrupt times of Popery, the Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and all other Bi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hops attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Court, or employed by the King
in publick Service, constantly maintained
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51911:26"/>
Suffragan Bishops in their Diocesses. This
practice was confirmed and intirely setled
by an Act of Parliament in the Reign of
<hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and from that time Suffragan
Bishops were without interruption conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the Diocess of <hi>Canterbury</hi> till the
end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and in
some Diocesses till the middle of King
<hi>James.</hi> It were much to be wished, that
their Majesties and the Reverend Prelates
of the Church would revive the Order, to
supply the want of the Episcopal Function
in those Diocesses, which are deprived of
the benefit of their proper Bishops, either
through necessary absence, or through age
and infirmities; And for this there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no new Law or Canon.</p>
                  <p>I have passed through those Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which do particularly relate to the
Case of Bishops; altho from these an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
argument for the lawfulness of
Plurality and Non-residence in Parish
Priests may be raised. For if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for a Bishop to obtain Pluralities and
use Non-residence; much more will it be
lawful to a Priest, whose duty is not so
strict, nor his office of so great concern
to the Church. But I proceed to prove
what I before proposed, That altho Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
and Non-residence were <hi>Jure Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:51911:26"/>
forbid to Bishops, yet it would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that it is in like manner forbid to
Priests.</p>
                  <p>They who maintain the Residence of
Bishops to be of Divine Right, proceed
upon this Principle, That the Order of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
is of Divine Institution; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Bishops are <hi>Jure Divino</hi> obliged to
perform their office in their Diocesses,
which office they suppose cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
without residence. Upon this
Principle the <hi>Spanish</hi> Bishops proceeded,
when they contended for the Divine Right
of Residence in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> This
Principle, we of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
do allow; yet it hath been already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that the Divine Right of Residence
in Bishops doth not follow from it. But
suppose it should necessarily follow from
it; yet would not this involve Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Priests in the same obligation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
their Parochial office also were of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
right, which we do not allow. I
know the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do contend for
this, as making no distinction in Order
or Office between a Bishop and a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
But for a Church of <hi>England</hi> Divine
to a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gue the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Parish Priests
Residence, from the <hi>jus divinum</hi> of Bishops
Residence, is no other than to betray
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51911:27"/>
the cause of the Church and of Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> Bishops in the
very institution of them were designed by
God to preside over the Church in certain
Cities, and the Territories of them to be
assigned to every one of them: So that
not only the Order, but the designation
of them to some certain place is of Divine
institution. The extent of the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of that place, and consequently the
greatness or smalness of his Diocess, doth
indeed depend upon human Laws, and no
more. The Office and Order of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is indeed also of Divine institution;
but not their designation to any certain
place. They were appointed and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to assist the Bishop in governing and
instructing his flock; not necessarily to
preside in any one part of the Bishops
Diocess, or to take care of any certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the faithful, but to assist in such a
manner and method, as the Bishop and
the Church should direct. So that altho
the division of the whole Catholick Church
into many Diocesses be of Divine institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet the division of any Diocess into
many Parishes is not so. All this will be
sufficiently evident, if it be proved, that
the Division of Diocesses into Parishes,
and assigning those Parishes to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51911:27"/>
care of so many Priests, was made by
meer humane Authority; and that in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
methods, and gradually, and not
began till some Ages after the time of the
Apostles and the Institution of Bishops.
The proof of this will evince all that hath
been laid down by us, and not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the argument of our Adversaries,
drawn from the supposed <hi>jus divinum</hi> of
Bishops residence, but also demonstrate,
that neither Plurality of Parochial Cures,
nor Non-residence upon such Cures can be
<hi>jure divino</hi> unlawful to a Presbyter; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absurd, that the circumstances of any
matter should be of Divine right, when
the substance of the matter it self is not
so. And upon this ground Judge <hi>Hobart</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reports, 149.</note>
well maintained the lawfulness of Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
however another great Lawyer, Lord
Chief Justice <hi>Coke</hi> was so far mistaken, as
to be of a contrary opinion.</p>
                  <p>I proceed therefore to prove, That the
division of Diocesses into Parishes, and
subjection of every Parish to a peculiar
Priest, was made by humane Authority,
long after the Institution of Bishops and
foundation of Churches, gradually and
not uniformly. When the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was first propagated in the Cities of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire (for it was very late
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51911:28"/>
before it extended to the country villages)
we may suppose that for some time at
least, one Church supplied the necessities
of all the Christians of that City. That
the Bishop presided in that one Church,
none will doubt. All this while it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
there could be no appropriation of
certain Presbyters to certain Churches.
When the number of the Christians in any
City, or in the neighbouring Country,
multiplied so far, that one Church could
not contain them; others were erected in
the City or Country; and the number of
these encreased proportionably with the
number of Christians of any Diocess. These
auxiliary Churches were no other, than
Chappels of ease to the Mother-Church,
at which the Bishop resided; and were
accounted as such, until at least the middle
of the fifth Century. The Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
resided at the Mother-Church, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Presbyters. The auxiliary
Churches were served by the Presbyters,
at the appointment of the Bishop, either
in common, or by turns, or in any other
method, which the Bishop in his prudence
should direct. If any Bishop thought <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it
to appoint certain Presbyters to attend
constantly, and without change upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Churches; it was meerly because it
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51911:28"/>
was his pleasure. Other Bishops took
different methods, as themselves judged
best; and might either appoint two Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
(either co-ordinate or subal<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ern) to
serve one Church, or one Presbyter to
serve two Churches, or all Presbyters
to take their turns in every Church. There
was no fixed or determinate rule herein. The
truth of all this is attested by <hi>Sozomen,</hi>

only add in this place, that even in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
the whole discharge of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Office was not yet entrusted to the
Parochial Clergy, but great part of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to be executed only in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
Church. For <hi>Socrates</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">Hist. Eccl. L. 5. c. 22.</note> that

It is not improbable, that about this
time the duty of the Presbyters began at
<hi>Rome</hi> to be fixed to certain Churches;
But then, far from being fixed in that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and order which now generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;
two Presbyters were appointed to
attend the service of every auxiliary or
Parish Church in the City; and for this
purpose, a co-ordinate power was given by
the Bishop to them both. This was first
observed by the learned <hi>Dr. Maurice,</hi>

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:51911:29"/>
After all, these Parochial Churches were
no other than Chappels of ease to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
-Church, and the Presbyters officiating
in them no other than Curates to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
employed by him, and removable
at his pleasure. To these the right of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring
Baptism, and consecrating the
Sacred Elements of the Eucharist was not
permitted. That was reserved solely to
the Bishop, and the Cathedral Church,
and not communicated to the auxiliary
Churches till after some Ages. This was
the occasion of that expression so frequent
among the ancient Catholicks, <hi>One Altar,
one Baptism, one Bishop.</hi> All the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of the Diocess were baptized at the
Cathedral Church, and there only the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Elements of the other Sacrament were
consecrated by the Bishop, and from thence
sent to the Parochial Churches of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
to be communicated to all those, who
could not come to the Mother-Church.
This practice continued in the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> till after the beginning of the fifth
Century; as appears from the Epistle of
Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> to <hi>Decentius:</hi> Altho in this
Popes time the Presbyters of the remoter
Parochial Churches in the Country, had
leave given them to consecrate the Sacred
Elements, this permission was not yet
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51911:30"/>
granted to the City Presbyters, So slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and gradually did the present institution
of Parochial Cures or perpetual incardina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of certain Presbyters to certain Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
with full power to administer all the
Offices of Religion, take place in the
Church: When it was first intirely finisht,
is not here material to enquire; nor indeed
can any certain time be fixed to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
introduction of it; since in some
Churches it was introduced much sooner,
or later than in others, A particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the introduction of it in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church, belongs to the second head
of this Discourse.</p>
                  <p>I have now dispatched my first design,
which was to shew, that Plurality is not
<hi>jure divino</hi> unlawful. To effect this, I
have proved, That Plurality is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the Law of Nature, or by the
revealed Law of God. I have fully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the Authorities and Reasons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
for the Divine right of Residence,
upon account of which the enemies to Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
maintain it to be unlawful; and have
manifested both to be inconclusive. That
it is impossible to reduce this <hi>jure divino</hi>
Residence into practice; that it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with other practices generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51911:30"/>
and not disallowed even by our
Adversaries: That such a perpetual Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is neither required by the nature
of the thing, nor upon account of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
annexed to the Benefice: That even
Bishops in all cases are not bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
such perpetual Residence in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Diocess: That in the ancient Church
Bishops have been allowed to preside over
two Diocesses; and the same practice hath
been all along retained, and is still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in our Church, without any contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
That other Cases and Practices of
like nature, have been all along, and still
are allowed; and that otherwise the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church cannot be well
maintained: And lastly, that altho Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Non-residence were by Divine
right unlawful to Bishops, yet it would
not be so to Parochial Priests; since the
Institution or designation of them to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Parish was introduced by humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and not uniformly, and but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in many places, and altogether accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>IN the second place I am obliged to shew,
That Plurality of Benefices held by one
Presbyter is not contrary to the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
or indowment of Parishes. This
will easily appear from what hath been
premised. Before the institution of Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Churches, it is manifest there could
be no indowment of them; but it was
long before they were instituted, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their institution much longer before
any particular indowment of them was
made. All the Oblations made to them,
were still transmitted to the Mother-Church,
and le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t to the disposition of the
Bishop; who generally divided it into four
parts, took one for his own maintenance,
assigned another to the Presbyters, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
and inferiour Clergy, a third part to
maintain and repair the Edisices of the
Church, a fourth to the Poor and the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of Strangers. All this is so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
from the Writings of the Ancients,
that it would be lost time to endeavour to
prove it. So that at first in all Churches,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51911:31"/>
there was no other than a general indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole Diocess; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
as well in Lands and Possessions, as
in voluntary Oblations of the Laity. Of
this indowment the first and general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was, that a competent number of
Clergy might be maintained, who under
the Bishop should supply the service of the
whole Diocess in Sacred matters; that is,
to provide for the general Service of the
Diocess. The secondary design was, to
provide for the convenience of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Parish. The first of these was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be unalterable; the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the direction of the Bishop,
to be managed or altered at his dis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>That Plurality is not contrary to the
first design is evident. For notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the permission of Pluralities, a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
number of Clergy to supply the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Diocess <hi>in Sacris</hi> is maintained
out of the Revenue of the Church. The
only seeming Objection is, That hereby
great inequality is observed in the Stipends
of Presbyters, which in the first general
indowment of the Church may be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to have been equal. But after all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there is as great inequality in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
indowments of single Benefices; and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51911:32"/>
besides this the supposition is not true.
For the Bishop might, if he thought fit,
give a double share to some Presbyters
more than he did to others, upon account
of greater worth; and this both justice
and prudence would direct him to do And
to this,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>.</note>
that direction of S. <hi>Paul to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
Let the Presbyters, that rule well, be
counted worthy of double honour,</hi> doth not
obscurely relate. So that the continuance
of Pluralities is rather consonant to the
first design; That as, while the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Revenue of the whole Diocess was
possessed in common by the Bishop and
his Clergy, a double share was allowed
to Presbyters of eminent merit: So, after
the Revenues became divided and fixed to
those several places in which the Sacred
Office was to be performed, a Plurality
of those places should be allowed to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
of extraordinary Worth and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The second design is no more hindred
by Pluralities than the first. For that was
only to provide for the convenience and
service of every individual Parish; and
this is still effected notwithstanding Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
At the first division of Parishes and
incardination of Presbyters, if the Bishop
had thought fit to set one Presbyter over
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51911:32"/>
two Parishes, as the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> did
two Presbyters over one Parish; here had
been no immorality in the thing. And
what Bishops might then do, if they had
thought convenient; their Successours may
now do, if they shall judge it expedient
for the good of their Diocess in general.
For that is the rule by which they are to
direct themselves. The secondary design
is but subservient to the first, and ought
always to give place to it. So that, if it
be more for the general good of that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
or of the whole Church, that any
Presbyter of it should retain Plurality of
Benefices, or be Non-resident at one or
both of them; then it is more consonant
to the first design of endowment, that such
Plurality should be allowed, and Non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
dispensed with, than otherwise: And
the good of any one or two Parishes is not
so much to be considered, as the good of
the whole Diocess or Church. Now such
cases often happen, as will herea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
when we shall speak of the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
or Inconvenience of Plurality and
Non-residence.</p>
                  <p>If it seem somewhat harsh to a<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>irm,
That to allow Non-residence in any case
can be agreeable to the second design of
the endowment of the Clergy, which was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51911:33"/>
the Convenience and Service of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
Parish; let it be considered, that
always in case of Non-residence, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Service of every individual Parish is
to be supplied by a Curate, to be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or allowed by the Bishop. So that the
design is still maintained; every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Parish being provided for and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at least by Vicarial Residence. At
the first division of Parishes, the Bishops
might, if they had pleased, have appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an inferiour Presbyter to supply the
cure of every Parish, residing constantly
thereon, and a Superiour Presbyter to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versee
him, not obliged to any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Residence. And what Bishops might
then do, their Successours may with equal
Authority do now if they please (the Laws
of the Church so permitting) as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
said. Besides upon some accounts the
supplying of Benefices by Curates, is more
agreeable to this second design. For the
first incardination of Presbyters in Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Churches, was not for life; they
were always nominated by the Bishop,
and might be removed by him. All this
the Bishop still doth, or may do, in the
case of Curates; whereas at this time Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Priests retain their Benefices for
life, cannot be displaced by the Bishop at
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51911:33"/>
pleasure, and are most of them nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by other Patrons, by whom if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
persons be presented, the Bishop
shall be compelled to admit them by the
Severity of the Laws of the Land; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he can never be forced to admit an
unworthy Curate, the Law having left the
nomination or approbation of him entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his pleasure. So that for a Bishop
to name a Curate to a Pluralist, looks
much more like the first institution and
design.</p>
                  <p>A particular account of the foundation
and endowment of Parochial Churches,

                     </gap>s of our Nation yet

of the Church and Kings of <hi>France.</hi> For
it is certain, that our Church was formed
after the example and model of the <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
Church; it being easie to observe
that the greater part of the Canons and
Constitutions of our Church, made before
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51911:34"/>
the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, are taken out of the
<hi>French</hi> Capitulars.</p>
                  <p>What the practice of the Ancient <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
Church was in this matter, is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
to determine, through distance of time,
and want of Records. Before the coming
of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the whole Nation on this
side the <hi>Picts</hi> wall seems to have professed
Christianity; and consequently many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliary
Churches must be supposed to have
been erected in every Diocess, for the use
of Christians living remote from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But whether these Churches
were served by certain Priests perpetually
affixed to that service, or by itinerant
Priests sent by turns from the Colledge of
Priests residing with the Bishop at the
Cathedral Church, or by any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
is uncertain. No Decree of any
General Council had yet appointed any
rule herein; and as for the Decrees of the
Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> they were of no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>Britain,</hi> being no part of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Patriarchate. Or if the <hi>British</hi> Clergy
had been disposed to have followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
altho not to obey the Decrees of
the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet would not this
Example have directed them to supply the
cure of the auxiliary Churches by so many

It is not improbable, that the Country

and therein instruct as many of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

speaketh according to the phrase and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of his own time; which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
as to the description of the dota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Churches given to <hi>Dubricius;</hi>
but the rest I doubt not to be literally
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51911:36"/>
true: yet from thence cannot conclude
any division of Diocesses into certain Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
or affixing of certain Priests to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Parishes, to have been then instituted
or received; but only that the Province
of <hi>South Wales</hi> was then divided into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Diocesses, and Bishops ordained to
every one of them: the word <hi>Parochia</hi>
being the ancient Ecclesiastical name of a
Diocess. As for the supply of Country-Churches,
this Testimony seems rather
to imply, that it was performed by itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Priests, whom <hi>Dubricius</hi> sent in their
turns out of his own College. And if any
credit is to be given to the ancient <hi>Lives</hi>
and <hi>Legends</hi> of the <hi>British</hi> Bishops and
Saints; this was the practice at that time
in the <hi>British</hi> Church: That the Bishops

should edu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From the uncertain Practice of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>British</hi> Church, I pass to give a
more certain account of the institution
and division of Parishes in the ancient <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or <hi>English</hi> Church, upon which their
modern division, laws, and customs are
founded. When <hi>Augustin</hi> the first Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi>
attended with several inferiour Clergy, to
preach the Gospel, King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> gave
to him ample possessions for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of himself and his Clergy, not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
any Laws to the direction or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution
of it, but leaving that entirely
to the discretion of the Archbishop. A
Church was built for him at <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
wherein he might fix his Chair, and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
appointed, wherein himself and Clergy
might dwell in common. Afterwards,
when the same pious King, by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Archbishop founded Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
Churches at <hi>Rochester</hi> and <hi>London;</hi> he
endowed both with large possessions, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the Honour of God, and general
good of the Diocesses, without giving any
further direction. The application of these
possessions to the use intended, was wholly
left to the several Bishops. In the same
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51911:37"/>
manner other Princes proceeded in the
foundation and endowment of Cathedral
Churches in other parts of the Nation.
All this is so manifest from <hi>Bede</hi> and the
several <hi>Histories</hi> of the foundation and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Cathedral Churches of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

Answer it appears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That the Bishop and his Clergy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
together at the Cathedral Church.
This was not only done by the <hi>Roman</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
and their Disciples and Converts in
<hi>England,</hi> according to the direction of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51911:38"/>
Pope <hi>Gregory;</hi> but also by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and their disciples in <hi>England,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
by <hi>Aidan</hi> Bishop of the <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
(as <hi>Bede</hi> often relates) whose Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
converted the larger part of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That there were at this time several
Churches erected in divers parts of the
Diocesses; which the Converts remote
from the Cathedral Church frequented,
and made their Oblations in them. For
both the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Clergy applied
themselves with great assiduity to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the Faith; and finding great zeal
and devotion in their Converts, were soon
enabled by them to erect auxiliary Churches
in several parts of the Diocesses. Thus
<hi>Bede</hi> relates of <hi>Birinus</hi> first Bishop of the
<hi>West Saxons,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

thirty years after <hi>Augustin;</hi> that <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

in his Diocess of</hi> Dorchester, <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
much People, he made a pious
end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That as well the Oblations made in
these auxiliary Churches, as the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the Church belonged entirely
to the disposition of the Bishop; who set
apart a certain portion of it to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Clergy, and divided that among
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51911:38"/>
them in such proportion as himself plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
the Clergy being obliged to bring
with them all the Oblations made in the
auxiliary Churches, at their return to the
Cathedral Church and College, after their
finishing their course of preaching and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in these Churches. For as yet there
were no other than Itinerant Preachers or
Priests, sent by the Bishop from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Church at certain times to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
and preach in the Rural Churches
of such a division; which being done,
they returned to the Bishop, who sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
again to perform the same duty,
when himself thought convenient. That
this was the constant received discipline
of the <hi>English</hi> Church about the year 664,
<hi>Bede</hi> expresly witnesseth in these words.<note place="margin">L. 3. c. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to the same purpose in another place,<note place="margin">Beda Hist. Eccl. <hi>L.</hi> 4. c. 27. circa med.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>And that the same method was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
practiced, at least in the Northern
Diocesses of <hi>England,</hi> when <hi>Bede</hi> finished
his History in the year 731. is evident
from several places. So that, at that time
there were no other than Pluralist Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
if they may be so called, who had
not the care of any particular Parish or
Parishes committed to them; but execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Office in this, or that, or all the
Churches of the Diocess as the Bishop should
direct them.</p>
                  <p>It must not be imagined that those Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Churches, which were so early erected,
had any certain bounds yet assigned to
them, or were made Parochial properly
so called; but only served to receive as
many of the neighbouring Converts from
whatever distance, as pleased to frequent
them; that so they might with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
receive the benefit of the holy Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Sacraments, without being obliged
to come to the Cathedral Church. So that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51911:39"/>
these Rural Churches, were in a strict and
proper sense, no other than Chappels of
ease to the Mother or Cathedral Church.
It is indeed a common errour among our
Historians, that the division of Diocesses
into Parishes in <hi>England,</hi> was made in the
time of Archbishop <hi>Honorius,</hi> who presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
about thirty years after the death of
<hi>Augustin.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Antiq. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. p. 52.</note> For this they are wont to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Ministros ordinavit.</hi> This that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Archbishop seems to have transcribed
from some more ancient Historian; who
did not so aptly express what he intended
to relate. The truth is, that in the time
of <hi>Honorius,</hi> there was made a second di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> into
Diocesses, and Bishops setled in these new
Diocesses. For in his time the Episcopal
Sees of <hi>Dorchester</hi> and <hi>Dunwich</hi> were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
which were the only Sees founded
since the time of <hi>Augustin.</hi> This division
gave occasion to those words of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian;
But as for the division of Dioces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
into Parishes, that was not yet thought of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:51911:40"/>
In this manner then Cathedral Churches
were founded and endowed by the Kings
of the several parts of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Heptar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
for the general good of the several
Diocesses, that is, of their several King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
For it is to be observed, that in
the first foundation of Bishopricks among
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the Diocesses had the same li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
with the Kingdoms; and so continue
at this day, as many of them as have not
been yet subdivided. The first subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was made in the Diocess of <hi>York</hi> by
Archbishop <hi>Theodore.</hi> Now as Kings first
founded Cathedrals for the good of their
whole Kingdoms; so great men first found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Parochial Churches, for the particular
good of themselves, their families and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.
For at that time the great men
possessed ample Territories within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
wherein all the Inhabitants were
no other than their Servants, tilling their
lands, and doing other services to them.
When therefore Christianity began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
apace, many Laymen of great Estates
would desire the constant residence of
some Priest among them; who might be
always ready to instruct themselves, their
families, and adjoyning Tenants; either
incited by their own devotion, or because
it was not easie without it to keep their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51911:40"/>
Tenants together. Oratories and Churches
were for this end erected by them; which
being consecrated by the Bishop, were by
the Founders or Patrons endowed with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Maintenance for the Incumbent,
which should there reside, and execute
the holy Function within the limits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Patron; which were no
other, than the bounds or territory of his
own demesnes, tenancies, or neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
possessions. Some foundations of this
kind are mentioned by <hi>Bede,</hi> made about
the year 700. as of <hi>Puch</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> Count,
who invited <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hexham,</hi>

but his consent also and approbation

                  <p>The Bishops power and propriety in
these new Foundations extended yet much
farther, namely to the revenues, tithes and
oblations wherewith they were endowed.
For the sole power of receiving and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Ecclesiastical Revenues of the
whole Diocess being originally lodged in
the Bishops; they would not for some
time diminish it in favour of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
foundation; but reserved to themselves
all the profits and possessions of it, of
which they allowed to the Priest there of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating
as much as they thought fit. And
when some Great Laymen would have
appropriated these particular Revenues to
the sole use of the Churches founded by
them; the joynt authority of Church and
State interposed, and remitted them to
the disposition of the Bishop; For so one
of the ancient Capitulars directs. <hi>Multi

were not at liberty to make them any
part of the endowment: until Cathedral
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51911:43"/>
Churches being abundantly endowed in
Lands and Mannors by the Munificence
of pious Princes, the Bishops neglected to
claim the Tithes of their Diocess to the
use of the common treasure of it; or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them to the several Parochial
Churches, to encourage the erection of
them. After which they were always
made part of the endowment of such
Churches. And all these endowments
both of Cathedral and Parochial Churches,
were made <hi>in puram &amp; perpetuam eleemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synam,</hi>
as the phrase then was: not in the
nature of Alms in the ordinary and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
sense of that word, (as some ignorant
persons have pretended) but in free and
irrevocable tenure, (if I may so speak)
without any tye, burden, claim of service,
or reserved rent, upon them: whereby
they were distinguished from all grants
made to Laymen, either by the King, or
by any Great Lords. For to these they
never granted any Lands or Possessions
without reserving some service, military or
base, to be performed for ever by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
or possessors in lieu of them; or
at least some mark and acknowledgment
of their dependance on them <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to them: from all which the Lands

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51911:43"/>
As Christianity prevailed very fast,
so these Foundations of private Oratories
became very numerous; almost every
Great Man, as soon as he was converted
to the Christian Religion, building one for
the convenience of himself, his tenants and
dependants. Before the year 800 they
seem to have founded in all parts of the
Nation; not indeed in the same number,
as now obtains (for of their Subdivision
we shall speak afterwards) but so as to
supply in some measure the necessities of
every Diocess: every part of it having at
least some one Church within its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
to which the People might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to pay their Devotions, and receive
instruction. Many Canons therefore made
about that time insinuate the establishment
of Parochial Cures every where, and the
division of Diocesses into them. Thus in
the Constitutions of <hi>Egbert</hi> Archbishop
of <hi>York,</hi> the first is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conc. Angl.</hi> T. 1. p. 258.</note> 
                     <hi>Vnusquisque Sacerdos

For in many places the Patrons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
the Churches, but built not the
Edifice, leaving that to be done by the
Priest out of the Oblations and contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Christians of the vicinage:
which was easily effected in those times,
when devotion and piety were very great
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51911:44"/>
in all Orders of men. The second Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
directs <hi>all Priests to sound the
Bells of their Churches at the usual hours of
day and night,</hi> to give notice of the time
of prayer, and of the several Offices of
Religion, which were then daily perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

my former conjecture, that before
the year 800. the Parochial division of
Diocesses was generally received; and
that the ordinary instruction of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was then wholly left to the Parish-Priests.</p>
                  <p>For before this time, those two reasons,
which chiefly discouraged the erection and
endowment of Parochial Churches, had
been taken away. Of these the first was,
That all the Lands, Tithes, Oblations, and
Ecclesiastical Revenues of the whole Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
belonged to the disposition of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop;
so that the particular endowment
of any Parish Church, did only add so
much to the common Treasure of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
This being no small cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51911:45"/>
the devotion of Lay-founders,
the Bishops at last condescended, that the
whole revenue of the endowment, with
all other Ecclesiastical profits, which should
come to the hands of the Priest officiating
at such a Church; should be taken from
the common Treasury of the Diocess, and
be perpetually annexed to the Church of
that Clerk who received it: So that the
Bishop should not any longer receive those
profits, nor the Incumbent expect his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
from the Bishop. This the Bishops
willingly did, as soon as by the erection
of many Parish-Priests, the necessity of
maintaining so many itinerant Priests cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and their Cathedrals were sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endowed for the maintenance of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their Colledge of Clergy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>antly
attending the service of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
Church. Yet however they parted
with the propriety and immediate dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of that part of the Ecclesiastical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of their Diocesses; they still limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and appointed the uses, in which they
should be imployed by the Parochial
Clergy. This appears from several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
before cited upon other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and from others which may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to the same purpose: as the <hi>French</hi>

Which was consonant to the first limitation
of their use, made when they were first
taken from the common Treasure of the
Diocess; save only, that the Bishops had
now long since remitted their fourth part,
which at first they did reserve.</p>
                  <p>The other discouragement of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Parochial Churches was, That
the Incumbents of them would often, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through levity, or the hope of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
other Churches better endowed, or
for any other reason; quit their Churches,

                     <hi>viz.</hi> the constant presence of a Priest
for their instruction, and the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance

was soon remedied, and the Parish Priests

                  <p>While the Foundation of Parochial
Churches was thus far advanced by Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and the profits of such as were
founded by them, were limited to their
Incumbents; the Bishops also in their
Mannors, and Demesnes, and Advowsons
both in City and Country, built, or gave
leave to build, Parochial Churches; and
restrained the profits of every one of them
to the several Incumbents. The same was
done by the Kings in their Mannors:
and the practice being received generally,
at last an uniformity obtained in this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Parochial right.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Bishops with their
Canons resided at the Cathedral Church,
and attended the daily service of it. The
Bishops indeed not so constantly, being
obliged to frequent the great Councils of
the Nation, and often employed by the
King in Embassies, and great Offices; but
the Canons were bound to perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence:
and both Bishop and Canons pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
the Revenues of the Church in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
which were received by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and by him such a portion was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to the maintenance of the Canons,
as he thought fit. This community of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51911:47"/>
possession in Cathedral Churches obtained
for a long time. For I do not find that in
any Churches, the portion or estate of the
Bishops was divided from that of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
or Monks till after the <hi>Norman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.
Till that time the first endowment
of the Bishoprick remained in the joint
possession of the Bishop and his Canons;
and not only those possessions wherewith
the Bishop and all his Clergy were endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the first foundation of the Episcopal
See; but also those, which after the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and particular dotation of Parochial
Churches, were added to the Cathedral
Church, by the liberality of following
Princes, to increase the honour and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Bishop, that he might be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to live in a quality equal to the Great
men of the Nation. For it must not be
imagined, that the endowments of the
Bishopricks were made all at once. But
in every Age accessions were made to the
original endowment of them, by the gift
of Princes and pious persons, even till the
end of the 13th Age: that so, as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Nation, and therewith the
state of Great men, did gradually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;
the possessions and riches of the
Bishops might arise in proportion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them to maintain a port equal to the
other Peers of the Realm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:51911:48"/>The Parishes, into which Diocesses were
at first divided, were but few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the present number of them. For
it may be supposed, that altho the Kings,
or great Lords, might possess very large
Territories in any country, yet they built
but one Church for the use of one single
Territory. Afterwards themselves found
it convenient or necessary, to build seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Churches in several parts of it, one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in every Mannor; or these large
possessions being in time cantoned out,
and divided into several lesser possessions;
every one of the new possessors erected
Churches or Chappels within their own
limits. Thus every Parish was divided
into many subordinate Parishes, and these
in proc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ss of time became distinct Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes;
and so by degrees that Parochial
division was setled, which we now find
in <hi>England.</hi> The difference of our present
Parishes in quantity and extent, arising
originally from the difference of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
circuits of the Demesnes or Territories
possessed by the Founders.</p>
                  <p>For some time these Churches of the
second foundation, were but Chappels of
ease to those of the first foundation. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

and still reserved the sole right of baptism

the possession of all the Tithes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
which were due to her before the

                  <p>But (to return to the former times) the
convenience and good of the Church in
general requiring such subdivision of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
to be made, and the Lands and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries,
wherewith the new Patrons had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
the Churches of the second foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
being not sufficient to maintain
their Incumbents without the Tithes, and
hereby all persons being discouraged from
proceeding in such new foundations; the
Bishops found it necessary to bestow paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
right on many of these Chappels al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
founded, or afterwards to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
which they did by conferring on
them the right of burial, and hallowing
Cemiteries near to them for that purpose.
By this means they were made distinct
Parishes, and freed from any dependance
upon the Churches of the first foundation.
Yet that the latter might not suffer any
great diminution of their former Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51911:49"/>
no more than a third part of the
Tithes were allowed to the Incumbents of
any Churches of the new foundation. But
if the Bishop did not grant the right of
burial to them; they still continued in
their former condition, and paid their
whole Tithe to the Incumbent of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Church.
So the Laws of King <hi>Edgar</hi>
made in the year 967. appoint; That if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lord would build a Church in his own
Lands, within the limits of any Parish, he
might pay a third part of his Tithes to it.

method of making any new Church to be

on it the right of burial, was observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time in <hi>Wales,</hi> as appears from

                  </p>
                  <p>By this encouragement new Churches
and chappels began to be erected so fast,
as in many places to become inconvenient,
by impoverishing too much the ancient
Revenue of the Churches of the first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
So that it was found necessary, to
dissolve or demolish some of them: and
the execution of this was left to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the Bishops. Before this no
new Church could be erected without the
Bishops leave, much less the right of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
and burial be given to it, by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than by him. So the 7th Canon of the

Parochial Churches and Cures, was much
later than in <hi>France;</hi> so also the subdivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them, and all the benefits or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of it. The first complaint
which I find to have been made in our
Nation, of the too great multiplication of
Churches of the new foundation, is in the
Additaments of the Laws of <hi>Edward</hi> the
<hi>Confessor;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conc. Angl.</hi> Tom. 1. p 621.</note> wherein it is said, that there were
now three or four Churches in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where anciently was but one, to the
great diminution of the Revenues of the
ancient Clergy. <hi>Multis in locis modò sunt

                  </p>
                  <p>Long before the time of the <hi>Confessor,</hi>
the Parochial division of <hi>England</hi> was
brought to so great per<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ection, that it was
known and fixed to which Parish every
man did belong.<note place="margin">Ibid Tom. 1. p. 448. Can. 6, 9, 15.</note> So the Ecclesiastical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
published in the time of King <hi>Edgar,</hi>
require that every Priest should present
to the Synod the names of such in his
Parish, as were contumacious or guilty
of any heinous sin; that he should
admonish every one of his Parish, <hi>quos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
per Paraeciam suam,</hi> to bring
their Children to be baptized: that no
Priest intermeddle in the business of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51911:51"/>
Priest, <hi>nec in suâ Ecclesiâ, nec in suâ
Parochiâ.</hi> And the Laws of King <hi>Canutus</hi>
command,<note place="margin">Lex. 13. Ibid. p. 545.</note> that if any one be buried out
of the limits of his Parish, <hi>extra suae Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiae
fines,</hi> yet that the fees of his burial
should be paid to that Church, to which
he did of right belong. But before the
time of the <hi>Confessor</hi> that very division of
Parishes was generally fixed, which now
obtains in <hi>England;</hi> as appears from <hi>Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
Book; in which the Towns and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
do very near agree to the present
division. Some Churches indeed were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and obtained Parochial right after
the Conquest, but the number of them
was not great.</p>
                  <p>Before or about the time of the same
King, most of the Churches of the second
foundation seem to have become wholly
independent of the Churches of the first
foundation; and to have received not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a third part, but the whole of the
Tithe of their several districts: whether
that happened through the negligence of
the Incumbents of the Mother-Churches,
or by the appointment of the Bishops, to
settle at last a sufficient maintenance on
the Priests of these new Churches, or by
publick Law, is uncertain. In <hi>France</hi> it
was first began by the Constitution of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51911:52"/>
Pius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Capitular</hi> T. 1. p. 565.</note> made in the year 816. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.
which directed the whole Tithes to be
paid to the new erected Churches. <hi>Sanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
est de villis novis, &amp; Ecclesiis in il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis

In <hi>England</hi> I rather suppose the depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the new upon the old Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to have worn off by degrees, or to
have been taken away by particular
compositions between the Patrons or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents
of the several Churches, made
with the leave of the Bishop; and the whole
to have been effected before the Conquest,
or shortly after. Yet many marks and
acknowledgments of the ancient depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
might remain for some Ages, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
now forgotten. Particularly I know
a Parish-Church in this Nation (the name
of which for private reasons I conceal)
which being founded above a thousand
years since, did then include all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Country within its limits. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
yet before the time of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
several new Churches were erected
within her bounds, which at first might
pay the whole, and then two third parts
of the Tithes to her, as was done in other
places in like cases. But in a short time a
composition was made between the several
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51911:52"/>
Patrons and Incumbents, confirmed by the
Bishop; That the Incumbents of the new
Churches should pay only the tenth part
of all their real profits to the Incumbent
of the Mother-Church: which Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I find to have been duly observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the year 1370, altho at this time,
no such pensions, or any other mark
of superiority remain to the Mother-Church.</p>
                  <p>For some while after the foundation of
Parochial Churches, and appropriation of
the Tithes to them, no other limits were
set to them than those of the possessions
of the Founders, who obliged themselves
and all their Tenants and dependants to
make their Oblations and to pay their
Tithes to the Churches founded by them.</p>
                  <p>But if any persons lived near to them,
who were independent from the Patro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;
they were at liberty to frequent any other
neighbour Church, and to pay their
Tithes to it. Particularly great numbers
of Christians were induced by the seeming
devotion of the Monasteries, to frequent
them rather than Parochial Churches, and
to make their Oblations, and pay their
Tithes to them, and to be buried in their
Cemiteries; at which time the Oblations
made, or Legacies left to any Church upon
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51911:53"/>
account of burial were very great. To
prevent this disorder, it was at last enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the limits of every Parish should
be certainly fixed, and all persons obliged
to pay their Tithes, Oblations and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries

In <hi>Wales</hi> the matter was not yet so
fully setled; but the Great men paid their
Tithes to what Religious persons or use
themselves pleased; yet ever believing
themselves obliged to pay them to God,
and to consecrate them to some religious
use.</p>
                  <p>To compleat this History of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Parishes and Parochial rights in
<hi>England,</hi> it will be necessary to add some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
concerning the beginning and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Vicarages, which make up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
one half of the Parishes in <hi>England,</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:51911:54"/>
to the great detriment of Religion, and
impoverishment of the Church. In the
eighth, ninth, and tenth Ages, the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Princes and great persons was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
employed in building and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Monasteries, to which they gave ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
large possessions, and therewith the
Advowson of the several Parochial Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
or where no such were, the Monks
themselves founded and endowed Parochial
Churches, within their Mannors, and in
right of the foundation became Patrons of
them. These Churches, or at least as
many of them as were near to the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
the Monks supplied by themselves,
either by turns or by lot, according to
the direction of the Abbot; and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the whole Tithes and profits of them to
the use of the Monastery. I suppose the
number of these not to have been very
great. As to the great number of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

Abbey of <hi>Croyland</hi> between the years 800
and 950, in the Charters recorded by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulphus,</hi>

the ancient Monasteries also then received
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51911:54"/>
their chief endowment; and both, as well
as those which were founded after, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to themselves great number of Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
But these Churches they could not
now personally supply as formerly, since
the Reformation of the Monastick Order
began by <hi>Dunstan</hi> about the year 944,
and after much difficulty completed by
him, with the assistance of <hi>Edgar, Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wold</hi>
and <hi>Oswald</hi> before the year 980.
The strict observation of the Rule of
St. <hi>Benedict</hi> being then introduced, the
Monks could no longer supply any Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Cures, being not permitted to be
absent from their Cloisters so long, and so
often, as that employment would require.
They were therefore forced to quit that
office entirely to the Secular Clergy,
whom they presented to the Bishop, in
the same manner as Lay-Patrons did, with
this only difference, that they generally
reserved to themselves some small pension,
to be paid annually by the Incumbent,
and were allowed to do it. These pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
were not very grievous during the
times of the <hi>Saxons:</hi> and the Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
found no great inconvenience before
the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:51911:55"/>After the Conquest, the <hi>Norman</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
generally bestowed the Bishopricks
and Abbies of <hi>England</hi> to those of their
own Nation; who according to the Spirit
of that time, oppressed without mercy
the poor inferiour <hi>English</hi> Clergy, as the
<hi>Norman</hi> Noblemen did the <hi>English</hi> Laity.
The Abbots then began to exact larger
Pensions from the Incumbents possessing
the Benefices of their donation: And what
the <hi>Norman</hi> Abbots began, even the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Abbots were forced to follow, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
themselves at that time, when the
<hi>Norman</hi> Kings continually exacted great
Sums of money from them; and scarce
nominated any, but in virtue of a Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal
bargain. Both these reasons indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Abbots to increase from time to
time, the Pensions of their Clerks; and
to procure to themselves more Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
that they might increase the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
as well as the value of their Pensions.
Against these innovations it was decreed
in the Council of <hi>London,</hi> in the year
1102.<note place="margin">

Churches by exorbitant Pensions. <hi>Can. 20.

                  <p>In the mean time, most of the Prebends
were founded in Cathedral Churches of
the old Foundation, as we now distinguish
them, <hi>viz.</hi> in those which were then held
by Secular Canons. Of these many were
endowed with Tithes or portion of the
Tithes of some Benefice, the Advowson of
which belonged to the Bishop, or some
other Founder of the Prebends. In this
case it was lawful to such a Prebendary
to serve the cure of the Benefice perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
if it could consist with his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
required at the Cathedral Church;
or to supply it by a Curate, who in time
became a Vicar; or which was the most
ordinary way, to reserve to himself a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Pension appointed by the Bishop, and
not to be altered without his leave; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the remaining profits to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent.
In all which cases, such pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and moderation was used; that I
find no complaints of this kind made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Secular Canons.</p>

                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:51911:56"/>But the oppression and covetousness of
the Monks became intolerable; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the Decrees made against
them, they continued their corrupt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
herein; and used several artifices to
impoverish their Churches, and draw the
profits of them to themselves. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they would treat with mercenary
Priests, and hire them from year to year

that so none, being in real posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

directed, That if a Clerk were

                  <p>At other times they obliged the Clerks

                  <p>The Monks being driven from all these
artifices, at last sell upon that mischievous
design of Appropriation, which gave the
greatest blow to the Secular Clergy they
ever received since the first dotation of
the Church. By the power of money,
they obtained of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that
the profits of certain Churches, whose Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowson
belonged to them, should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to themselves and their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
for ever. Herein they first began
with a few; then, finding their money to
prevail in that corrupt Court, proceeded
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51911:57"/>
further; and at last put no bounds to their
covetousness. When they first gained
these Bulls of Appropriation, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Discipline of their Order to be
so far relaxed in virtue of them, that they
might personally serve the cure of their
appropriated Churches: and this, for some
while, they took upon them to do, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
thereby the entire profits of them
to their own use. But here the Bishops
interposed, and, since they could do no
more, applied themselves to reduce the
Monks within the bounds of their Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
and by several Constitutions forbad
them to serve their Churches personally.
One of these Constitutions made by an
unknown Bishop, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III.<note place="margin">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51911:58"/>
Vicarium.</hi> Nor was there any difference
in their Office, until the Vicars or Curates
of the Benefices appropriated to the
Monks, being instead of annual stipends,
endowed with certain portions of the
Tithes (which they still retain) began to
receive Institution from the Bishop, and
Induction into the profits of their Cures,
in the same manner as Rectors did into
their Benefices.</p>
                  <p>The way of appropriating Churches
being once opened by the Monks, and
the method fixed; they multiplied daily,
and were easily obtained. It was enough
to pretend their Treasure exhausted, or
their Houses dilapidated, or their Abbot
put to great expences in a journey to
<hi>Rome,</hi> to procure the appropriation of a
Church. The example was afterwards
followed by Nunneries, Hospitals, Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Orders, Confraternities, Gilds, and
even by the Seculars themselves, who
sometimes procured Churches to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to Prebends, Colledges and
Chantries. By this means, within the
space of 300 years, above a third part,
and those generally the richest Benefices
in <hi>England</hi> became appropriated. Yet
that the Secular Clergy may not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
censured herein, we must not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51911:59"/>
that all the Appropriations which
they now possess, were at first procured
by them; but rather almost all of them
were made originally to the Monks, and
others; and after their dissolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to the Seculars by exchange, gift,
or purchase.</p>
                  <p>From this History which I have given
of the Foundation and endowment of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Churches in <hi>England;</hi> it may suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
appear, how grosly they mistake,
who imagine that the first design of these
Foundations, require the constant residence
of a Beneficiary perpetually tied down to
that one place and Benefice. From the
beginning to the end of it, it appears, that
no more was ever designed, than that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Parish should be provided for <hi>in Sacris</hi>
either by alternate, or by perpetual Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.
Whether those bare the title of
Parson, Vicar, or Curate; whether they
executed their Office there in their own
right, or in right of another; whether
the care of that Parish was solemnly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
or only delegated for a time to the
Priest officiating; doth in no wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the design of the foundation: which
only required, that the service of it should
be perpetually supplied, in all the Offices
of Religion, by Priests authorized by the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51911:59"/>
Bishop. That this was the sole design,
may be easily collected from almost every
part of this History. I will not here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulate
the whole, and form the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
deductions which may be made;
lest I should seem to question or injure
the judgment of the Reader, who may
with equal exactness make the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and draw the consequences for his
own satisfaction. But some things, which
have not yet been touched, and which
manifest the same design, it will not be
unfit to add.</p>
                  <p>Of these the first is, concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
required of Vicars, the Obligation

                     <hi>Edmund</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> made in the
Synod of <hi>London,</hi> in the year 1237. <hi>Ad
Vicariam statuimus nullum admittendum,
nisi qui renuncians Beneficiis aliis, si quae ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet
curam animarum habentia, juret resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiam

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:51911:60"/>
the Legatine Constitutions of <hi>Othobon.</hi> The
reason of this is expressed in the 12th Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the same Council, that so some
Priest may be resident at every Church,
to discharge the cure of Souls. <hi>Provideant
Diocesani, ut semper apud Ecclesiam resideat
aliquis, qui de animarum cura sit sollicitus.</hi>
At this time the Stipend of a Vicar was
taxed at five marks, and the Stipend of a
Curate at as much; as was before shewn.
So that it was supposed a Vicar could not
maintain a Curate; for if he allowed five
marks to him, as the Canon required, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would remain to sustain himself.
Hence, if the Vicar did not make personal
residence, it was taken for granted, that
the service of that Church could not be
supplied; and for this reason residence was
enjoyed to them. The Canon made no
provision for Vicars able to maintain a
Curate, because there were none such at
that time. But afterwards, when Vicara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
exchanged their Stipends for certain
portions of Tithes, many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
of considerable value; and to the
Incumbents of such, the design of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
doth no less permit substitution of
Curates, than to the Incumbents of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages:
and since every Law is best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
by the known design of it, those
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51911:60"/>
Vicars cannot in conscience be impleaded
of perjury against their Oath of residence
exacted in vertue of this Canon; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Non-resident, maintain a Curate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
residing; since they fully satisfie
the design of the Canon, which was, that
no Parochial Church should be destitute
of the presence of a Priest. To justifie
this assertion, it may be observed, that the
obligation of personal residence was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
at the same time to all Incumbents
of Parsonages, not exceeding the value of
Vicarages, that is, of five marks; and
that for the same reason, because they
were supposed unable to maintain a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
Thus in the Council of <hi>Oxford</hi> in
the year 1222, it was decreed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conc. Angl.</hi> T. 2. p. 183.</note>

none but a Priest could be admitted to
such a Benefice, because none other was
capable of executing intirely the minist<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ice would
not permit the substitution of a Curate-Priest.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51911:61"/>
To this purpose (as a friend of
mine hath informed me from a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script)
<hi>William de Bleis</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
published a Canon about the year
1230. <hi>Nullus nisi Sacerdos admittatur ad
Ecclesiam, cujus aestimatio non excedit quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
marcas; sed admissus residentiam faciat
in eâdem Ecclesiâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further in consequence of this general
design of supplying the religious occasions
of every Parish by some means or other,
it was thought no less unlawful, for one
Priest alone to manage the cure of too
great a Parish, than to hold two Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and therefore in Parishes of very
great extent, two Priests or more were
ordained to the cure of one Church, or
at least, required to attend the constant
service of one Church. So little did the
first design of these foundations favour
that Presbyterian notion of the reciprocal
necessity of one Presbyter and one Church.
At first such large Parishes had two or
more Priests ordained to them, with equal
title and authority; but afterwards, this
being found in many respects inconve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nient,
was discontinued in <hi>England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ib. p. 272.</note> and
at last wholly forbid, in the Legatine
Constitutions of <hi>Othobon</hi> (in <hi>Wales</hi> the
practice continued much longer.) Yet the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51911:61"/>
same number of Priests was still directed
to be maintained; one being Superiour,
and retaining the Title, the others being
Curates or assistants to him. For this the
Constitution of <hi>Walter de Kirkham</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ib. p. 297.</note> Bishop
of <hi>Durham,</hi> made in the year 1255, is

                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:51911:62"/>
The design of Parochial Foundations,
and all the Ecclesiastical Constitutions hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
mentioned do as well permit two
Churches to be held or supplied by one
man, as one Church by two men: if the
general design before mentioned be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
that is, the service of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Parish in religious Offices. If then
two Parishes lye so near, that one person
may supply the cure of them both; this
design is as much answered, as if the same
were done by two persons. He cannot
indeed reside in both in a Law-sense; but
in truth and in an Ecclesiastical-sense he
resideth at both, who constantly supplieth
the ordinary duty, and is always at hand
within convenient distance, to supply the
extraordinary duty of them both. If the
greater distance of the two Parishes will
not permit this; the general design is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
if either of them be supplied by a
Curate; And this ever was, and still is
provided for in all cases of Plurality.</p>
                  <p>After an Historical account of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
concerns the institution, endowment
and rights of Parishes, it will be fit to add
an account of the Constitutions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Church in r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The ancient Canons forbid a Priest
to quit the service of that Church or Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51911:62"/>
wherein he first received Orders;
which made it unlawful to him to execute
his Office in two several Diocesses. To
this I suppose that Capitular to refer;
<hi>Non liceat Clericum in duabus Civitatibus
ministrare, nec Abbatibus plura Monasteria
aut Cellas habere.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

however forbids Plurality of Abbies to be
held by one Abbot; which was indeed
consonant to the first institution and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of their Order. Some Abbots at this
time in <hi>France</hi> held an enormous Plurality
of Abbies; and if the same licentiousness
were then permitted to the Secular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
it was but convenient to restrain
them by a prohibition.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Capitul.</hi> L. 6. c. 73. T. 1. p. 934.</note> Such a prohibition
was made in the sixth Council of <hi>Paris.

The same may be found in the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Herardus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Tours,</hi>

Canons are all expressed in general terms;
as provisions made against any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51911:63"/>
are wont to be: Yet no more is
intended to be forbidden, than what is in
truth unlawful or inconvenient. All these
Canons are best explained by <hi>Regino,</hi> who
about 100 years after, collected the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Church, and Capitular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
then received and practised. In
him this prohibition of Plurality is thus
related:<note place="margin">L. 1. c. 254.</note> 
                     <hi>Sicut Episcopus non plus potest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere

                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> nullus Presbyter praesumat plures
habere Ecclesias, nisi forte alios Presbyteros
sub se in unaquaque illarum habeat. As a
Bishop cannot have more than one City, and
an Husband no more than one Wife; so a
Priest no more than one Church. Let no
Priest therefore presume to hold more
Churches; unless he hath other Priests</hi> (or
Curates) <hi>under him in every one of those
Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chief design then of the former
prohibitions was to provide, lest the Cure
of any Parish should be neglected. This
being satisfied by substitution of Curates,
the original power which the Bishops had
of dispensing in this case, was continued to
them. In the first Institution of Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Churches, the Bishops might, if they
had pleased, have committed the care of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51911:63"/>
two Churches to every Presbyter, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in this matter, have continued to
act, as their own prudence and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
good of the Church directed them;
till their whole power herein was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Pope by the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
Before that Council the care of this
whole matter was committed to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,

the Canon Law are those accounted, which
require residence; as all are, having cure

allowed no more than was always practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and thought reasonable; only the
power of Dispensation was now lodged
wholly in the Pope, which was before
common to all Bishops. This turned to
the great injury of the Church; For at
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> Dispensations were
promiscuously granted, without any other
design than that of getting money; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Bishops were not wont to grant them,
but for the general good of their Diocess,
to entertain persons of eminent worth
therein: or if they had done otherwise,
would not have been able to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their reputation in their Diocesses.
All that was left to the Bishops, was the
power of forcing Clergymen, who enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Pluralities by the Papal Dispensation,
to reside successively in every one of their
Parishes, and to maintain Curates, when
and where they did not personally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
To this purpose a Constitution was
made by <hi>Richard</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> in

                  <p>From what I have said, it will be easie
to answer a scruple, which some have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<hi>viz.</hi> That neither a Papal Dispensation
before the Statute 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. nor an Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
Dispensation since, could satisfie
any Pluralist or Non-resident in point of
conscience, where there is not a just and
sufficient cause: Because such a Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51911:66"/>
is against the chief design of the
Laws made against them before that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and now against the chief design of
that Statute also. It hath been already
proved, that both Plurality and Non-residence
are made unlawful only <hi>jure hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano;</hi>
so that if they be dispensed with by
the same authority, the Conscience is fully
satisfied. The Division and Setling of
Parishes was first formed, by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the several Diocesans; and from them
alone proceeded the Obligation to Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Singularity of Benefices: So
that to them <hi>de jure communi</hi> belonged
the power of dispensing with both, till it
was appropriated to the Pope in the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
Council, and in <hi>England</hi> to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops
by the Statute 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. In the
case therefore of a Dispensation granted,
by the Ordinary before the <hi>Lateran</hi>
Council, by the Pope after it, and by the
Archbishops since the Statute, the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
as to such particular persons, is
relaxed and annulled, by the same Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
by which it was imposed. As for the
opposition of Dispensations to the chief
design of the Canons and Laws made
against Plurality and Non-residence; the
design of a Law is no more to be taken
from the former, than from the latter part
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51911:66"/>
of it. It can never be said, that any
Law did either chiefly or secondarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to oblige those whom it doth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
except from its obligation. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Law should be made to oblige all
adult persons, except Clergymen, to take
up arms upon some urgent occasion:
Should the Clergy notwithstanding this
exemption, esteem themselves obliged in
conscience by the Law, to take up arms,
only because the general design of the Law
was, that all adult persons should enter
into arms? Certainly in no Law, was the
former part ever known to annul the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
altho the latter may restrain and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
the former.</p>
                  <p>It is to be observed, that in all the
Constitutions and Decrees made against
Pluralities, which have been already reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
no difference is made between Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Bishopricks, Prebends, Archdeacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or any other Ecclesiastical prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Plurality of Benefices with cure
of Souls; the same Prohibition lieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
both. So the third Council of

<hi>Wolsey;</hi> Yet since the Reformation we
have seen several examples of it. In the
Legatine Constitutions of <hi>Othobon</hi> all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Commendams</hi> are strictly forbidden;
yet nothing is now more ordinary.<note place="margin">Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 281.</note> In
the 12th Canon of the Council of <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
held in the year 1126.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 34.</note> it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden:
<hi>Ne uni personae in Ecclesia diversi
tribuantur honores,</hi> that different Dignities
in the Church be not given to one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Yet now one Person is sometimes a
Bishop, an Archdeacon and a Parish Priest.
Nay (which formerly would have been
accounted monstrous) a Parish Priest in the
Diocess of another Bishop: In other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
we see the Dignities of a Dean, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon,
Prebendary and Parish Priest uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
In the eighth Canon of the Council
of <hi>Westminster</hi> held in the year 1127.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 36</note> it
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51911:67"/>
was forbid under an <hi>anathema</hi> to hold plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality

in diversis Episcopatibus diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos
Archidiaconatus teneat, sub anathemate

many examples of the contrary, and no
censure put upon them. In the Council of
<hi>Lateran</hi> it is forbid to the Canons of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
or Collegiate Churches, to hold
the cure of a Parish-Church together with
their Canonry. Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> III. first
allowed them to augment their Prebends,
with the perpetual annexation of Parochial
Churches, reserving a competent stipend
to the Curates. All these Canons are
securely broken, and no exclamation
made; only because in the Statute 21 <hi>H.</hi>
8. concerning Pluralities, no mention is
made of Bishopricks, and Preferments
without cure of Souls; altho that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
doth not in the least annul the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the ancient Canons concerning
them, which still remain in their full

                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:51911:68"/>
As the prohibition of Plurality was
extended equally to all Ecclesiastical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments;
so also the obligation to Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was, both by the design of the
several foundations, and by the Decrees
of the Church, no more required of one
than of the other; nay required much
more strictly of Bishops, Archdeacons, and
Prebendaries, than of Parochial Priests.
The necessity of Episcopal residence for
the benefit and convenience of the Diocess,
and the conformity of it to the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the institution of their Order,
cannot be called in question. In the Church
of <hi>England</hi> they were commanded to reside
and celebrate personally at their Cathedral
Churches, by the Provincial Constitutions
of <hi>Edmund</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conc Angl.</hi> T. 2. p 227.</note> made

said to be obliged to personal residence
both by Divine and by Ecclesiastical right.

Forty years after this Archbishop
<hi>Peckham</hi> renewed the injunction, and to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51911:68"/>
some Bishops, who would not reside, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Coadjutors. For Archdeacons,
the design of their institution was, that
they should be the eye of the Bishop;
that they should personally visit all the
Clergy of the Diocess every year; that
they should diligently enquire into the
behaviour of them, examine the state of
all the Parochial Churches, and signifie
the faults or defects of both to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
An institution, which, if duly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and executed, as the Canons direct,
would contribute more to the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of good Order and Discipline in the
Church and Clergy, than all the little
projects of private persons. For the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of this Duty, Archdeacons were
<hi>jure communi</hi> obliged to perpetual residence;
and when that was slighted, the obligation
was enforced by many Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions;
and at last it was forbidden to
them to exact or receive Procurations
from any Churches which they did not
personally visit. So the Constitutions of
<hi>Peter Quivil</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> cap. 40.
(and to the same purpose are the Decrees
of several Provincial Councils in <hi>England)

If we may believe <hi>Father Paul</hi> (an Author
much admired by the enemies of Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
Canons of Churches were first requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Papal Constitutions to reside, when
other beneficed Clerks were left at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Certainly it conduceth more to the
interest, honour and support of Religion
in general; and the good of the whole
Diocess in particular, that according to
the design of those Foundations, ten or
more Pre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>endaries, persons of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
merit and knowledge (as they are
supposed, and ought to be) should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
attend at the Cathedral Church,
seated in the chief City of the Diocess; to
see the publick Worship of God performed
with decent solemnity, to instruct the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of a populous City, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
the Bishop upon all occasions: than
that ten little Country Villages should be
supplied by the constant personal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of the Incumbents of their Churches.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51911:69"/>
Formerly therefore, no doubt was made
that they were more strictly obliged to
attend the service of the Cathedral, than
any Incumbents were to attend the cure
of Parochial Churches: insomuch as when
they had so far relaxed the obligation of
their duty in the tenth Age, as to pretend
to execute it sometimes by Substitutes or
Curates, the Kings and great Persons of
<hi>England</hi> would not endure it: which the
Monks taking advantage of in the time
of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> supplanted the Secular
Canons, and caused them to be ejected
out of many Cathedral and Collegiate
Churches. The crime alledged by <hi>Edgar</hi>
and the Monks against them, as a reason
of their ejection, was that they did not
execute their duty personally, but <hi>per vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carios.</hi>
For some time after this, it was
thought the indispensable duty of all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendaries
to give constant attendance upon
the Cathedral Church, either <hi>per se</hi> or <hi>per
alium;</hi> which obligation continued very
long in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> insomuch
as frequent examples can be given of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutors
assigned to Prebendaries,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>str Peck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> sol. 159.</note> when
by old age, sickness, or any infirmity they
were disabled from personal attendance
upon the service of the Church to which
they belonged. Which custom continued
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51911:70"/>
at least until the year 1300. All the
abovementioned Canons, Constitutions,
and <hi>jus commune</hi> of the Church, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Residence of Bishops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons,
remain still in their full force.
(The Case of Prebendaries is altred, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Local Statutes, and by later Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Constitutions.) And to the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Archdeacons and Prebendaries a
new obligation is added by the Statute
21 <hi>H.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Cap. 13.</note> concerning Residence, which
includes <hi>every spiritual person promoted to
any Archdeaconry, Deanery or Dignity in
any Monastery or Cathedral, or other Church
Conventual or Collegiate, as well as Beneficed
with any Parsonage or Vicarage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To manifest yet more fully, that it was
never the design of the Church, in the
first institution of Parochial Cures, that
they should in all cases be supplied by
the Incumbent in person, I will add this
observation, That from the first beginning
of Parechial cures, Deacons were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to possess them, al<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ho it were notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that they could not execute the Office
personally, since they could neither absolve
penitents, nor celebrate the Sacrament of
the Eucharist. For if we look upon the
ancient Church of <hi>France</hi> (by the example
of which we have often observed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51911:70"/>

In truth, if men would judge without
prejudice, it must be acknowledged, That
it is more for the interest of the Church
and of Religion in general, that men of
eminent learning and prudence should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
in the Courts of Princes and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to admonish, instruct, and advise
them, their relations and dependants, in
matters of Religion and publick concern;
than that the same persons should be
obliged to attend personally upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of a few rusticks; who may
learn as much as they are capable of, from
the meanest Curate. As for Archbishops
and Bishops, Chaplains are yet more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to them, to be subservient to them
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51911:72"/>
in the government of the Church. And
this the Commons of <hi>England</hi> were so
sensible of, that in the Petition made in
Parliament 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. against Pluralities and
Non-residence, they excepted the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
of Archbishops and Bishops, as was
before said. And for the Kings of our
Nation, their design in the munificent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment
of Churches, was as well to
provide fit rewards for able persons em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in their own service, as to provide
persons for the service of those Churches.
Formerly therefore, while the Laity were
either wholly unlettered, or given to a
Military life, the King made use of the
Service of Clergymen in all the Offices of
the Chancery, Privy-Seal, Secretary, in
all Courts of Justice, and in Embassies:
And if Clergymen had not then been
permitted to serve the King herein, none
of these Offices could have been duly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.
The service of these Clergymen
the King rewarded with Benefices and
Ecclesiastical Preferments; and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the Masters and Clerks in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
fixed many Advowsons in the gift
of the Lord Chancellour or Keeper for the
time being; which still continue, altho the

To return to the History of Pluralities,
after the power of dispensing with them
was taken from the Bishops, and fixed
wholly in the Pope by the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil:
no further care or decency was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
therein, but within 60 years they
grew so enormous, as not to be defended.
This the Mendicant Friers, who in the
intermediate time arose and multiplied,
made great use of in their exclamations
against the Secular Clergy, and by it
made them odious. One of this Order,
<hi>John Peckham</hi> being promoted to the
Archbishoprick of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> applied
himself with great zeal to overthrow
these Pluralities. For which end he made
a Canon in the Council of <hi>Reading</hi> in the
year 1279.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conc. Angl.</hi> T. 2. p. 320.</note> that all Benefices, held by one
Clergyman without a Papal Dispensation,
should be void except the last: and that
all Clergymen who should hereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more Benefices than one, without a
Papal Dispensation, <hi>Seu titulo institutionis,
seu commendationis, seu custodiae,</hi> should be
<hi>ipso facto</hi> deprived of all, and incur the
sentence of Excommunication. Afterwards
in the heat of opposition, he proceeded so
far, as to inveigh against all Plurality of
Benefices as a mortal sin; and in the
Council of <hi>Lambeth</hi> in the year 1281.<note place="margin">Ib. p. 340<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

a long invection against the sin of
Plurality, admonished <hi>Primò, secundo &amp;
tertiò omnes hujusmodi pluralitatem damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliter
occupantes,</hi> that they should within
six months, freely and absolutely resign
all their Benefices, except one, into the
hands of their Diocesan. For disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to this injunction or admonition, he
refused to confirm <hi>John de la More</hi> elected
to the Bishoprick of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>John
de Kirkby</hi> elected to the Bishoprick of
<hi>Rochester;</hi> and notwithstanding all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
and opposition, annulled their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
<hi>ob crimen pluralitatis;</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the one to renounce the right of his
Election, and the other to be rejected
in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which he had
appealed. The principle indeed, upon
which he did proceed, was false; but the
enormity of Pluralities was at that time
so great, that it became the care of an
Archbishop to oppose and reform it. I
will produce the example of a score of
Pluralists, who all died while he sat Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop;
that from thence it may be
judged, how different the case then was,
from that which now obtains in the Church

a long invection against Pluralities, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the names of all the Pluralists in
<hi>England</hi> to be transmitted to him (not
that he intended to reform the abuse, but
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51911:74"/>
only to squeeze money from them) the
Plurality of those times was found to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
not so much in Benefices with cure
of Souls, as in Prebends of Cathedral and
Collegiate Churches, of which there was
then a far greater number than remains
now in <hi>England.</hi> Yet the Pope in his
Bull makes no difference between Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Spiritual Promotions with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cure of Souls, but taxeth both alike.
I have seen the return made to the Pope,
of all the Pluralists residing at that time
in or about <hi>London;</hi> wherein (if my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
fails me not) I observed no great
number of Benefices with cure of Souls
held by one man; but many examples of
great number of Prebends held by one
person. Among whom is <hi>William de Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
who held thirteen Prebends and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
in so many several Churches, and
but one Benefice with cure of Souls, in
the Province of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> For by this
time almost all the Prebends and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconries
of <hi>England,</hi> were got into the
hands of Canonists, who quickly found
out subtle distinctions, quirks and devices,
whereby to evade the obligation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
constant residence upon their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
As for Benefices with cure of Souls,
more were then held by several men, than
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51911:75"/>
is now allowed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
Whether Pluralities continued in the same
state till the Reformation; whether in the
intermediate time they increased or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
I cannot certainly affirm; but
suppose it not unlikely, that as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> granting
Dispensations grew daily more exorbitant,
so less shame or modesty was observed by
her, in giving enormous Dispensations of
this kind; and just before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
flourished in <hi>England</hi> a more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Pluralist, than was ever known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that is, Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> who with
the Archbishoprick of <hi>York,</hi> held two
Bishopricks and the best Abbey of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the Reformation in
<hi>England,</hi> the Papal Power being abolished
by Act of Parliament; it was found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to invest the power of granting
Dispensation of Plurality in some person.
For this purpose the Statute 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was
made, which restored to the Prelates of
the Church their original power of dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
herein, long since taken from them
by Papal usurpation; only restored it not
to every Ordinary to be executed in his
own Diocess, as was formerly; but fixed
it wholly in the Archbishop of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51911:75"/>
In this Act, the 29th Canon of
the fourth <hi>Lateran</hi> Council is confirmed
in relation to Benefices with cure of Souls;
<hi>viz.</hi> That if such a second Benefice be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
without Dispensation, it shall void the
first. Then the power and manner of
Dispensation is declared and appointed;
and the persons named who shall be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving such a Dispensation:
that is, all Chaplains of the King, Queen
and Royal Family; eight Chaplains of
every Archbishop, six of a Duke or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
five of a Marquess or Earl, four of
a Vicount, three of a Baron, Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
and Knight of the Garter, two
of a Dutchess, Marchioness, Countess or
Baroness being Widows; one of the Chief
Justice of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and Warden of
the <hi>Cinque-ports:</hi> all Brothers and Sons of
Temporal Lords and Knights; all Doctors
and Batchelors of Divinity or of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law, who shall be admitted to any
of those Degrees by either of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.
These are the only persons ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving Dispensation, but as yet
they have no right to claim it: that is to
be acquired by their particular merit, of
which the Archbishop is made the sole
Judge. After all, no more than two Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
are allowed to be dispensed with,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51911:76"/>
except only in one case; that is, when any
of the Kings Chaplains are sworn of the
Kings Council; such being made capable
of receiving a Dispensation for three Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices;
a case which perhaps never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to any except Dr. <hi>Wotton:</hi> and I
am not assured whether he took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it. As for Secretary <hi>Boxall</hi>
and some others in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time,
when the Popes dispensing power was
revived, they are not to be accounted
for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When such a Dispensation is, in virtue
of this Act, granted to any one, both the
Grant if self and the C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nons of the Church
limit the use of it; that so neither of the
Benefices therein personally united, may
receive any de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>riment, either in spiritual
or mixt matters. The 41th Canon of
the Synod held at</hi> London <hi>in the year
1603. directs. That</hi> no Dispensation for
keeping more Benefices with cure than one,
shall be granted to any, but such only as
shall be thought very well worthy for his
learning, and very well able and sufficient
to discharge his duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Provided always,
that he be by a good and sufficient caution
bound, to make his personal Residence in each
his said Benefices, for some reasonable time
in every year; and that the said Benefices be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51911:76"/>
no more than 30 miles distant asunder; and
lastly, that he have under him, in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
where he doth not reside, a Preacher
lawfully allowed, that is able sufficiently to
teach and instruct the people. <hi>The form
of the Dispensation, which hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
used since the Reformation, begins
with a supposal of the great merits of
the person to whom it is granted, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
adds these Conditions.</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
alway, that in each of the aforesaid
Churches, as well that from which you shall
be absent for the greater part, as the other,
in which you shall make perpetual and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
residence, you preach thirteen Sermons
every year, according to the Constitutions
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in that case set
forth, and therein handle the holy Word of
God sincerely, religiously and reverently:
and that in the same Benefice from which
you shall be chiefly absent, you keep hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for two months every year, and in that
time entertain and relieve the inhabitants
of the same Parish, especially the poor and
needy, in proportion to the profits and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the Benefice. Provided also always,
that the cure of that Church from which you
shall be chiefly absent, be in the mean time
well supplied in all things by some fit Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
able to explain and interpret the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51911:77"/>
of the Christian Religion, and to preach
the Word of God to the people, if the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of the said Church can coveniently
maintain such a Curate; and that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
and sufficient Salary, to be limited
and appointed by the Bishop of that place
according to his discretion, or by us or our
Successours, in case the Diocesan Bishop shall
not do his duty herein, be given and paid
<hi>bonâ side</hi> to the said Curate. <hi>Herein it is
to be observed, That altho no more than
two months Residence, upon the Benefice
less frequented, be expressed, yet thirteen
Sermons are injoyned to be preached
yearly at it; which being not ordinarily
to be performed in distant Parishes (as for
contiguous Parishes the Pluralist may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
constantly upon both in an Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
sense) without the residence of as
many weeks, I have for that reason often
said in this Discourse, that a Pluralist is
bound to reside three months in every year
upon that Benefice which he less frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have now finished the History of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Foundations and Pluralities in this
Nation; and now dare to appeal to the
judgment of the Reader, whether the
granting of such Pluralities, as are now
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51911:77"/>
allowed, be against the first design of the
foundation and endowment of Parochial
Churches. I fear the same judgment will
not be passed concerning some other Cases,
which have been incidentally mention<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d;
as, of the Residence of Bishops at their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Churches, which for the greater
good of their Diocesses, the Council of
<hi>London</hi> held under Archbishop <hi>Lanfranc</hi>
commanded to be translated to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Cities of their Diocesses; of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Prebendaries and Archdeacons
to constant Residence; of the incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of two such Dignities; of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness
of holding <hi>Commendams</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diocess, or being translated from one
Diocess to another. All these cases were
manifested to be consonant to the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Foundation and Endowments
of Cathedral Churches; yet contrary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
are introduced, and no exclamation
made against them. Other like cases
might be named; as,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Extr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Testam. cap.</hi> Cumin off.</note> as, that formerly Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen,
if they had proper possessions
sufficient to maintain them, should receive
no allowance from the Church; that they
were bound to spend all in hospitality and
alms, or bequeath what remained to the
Church, whence they got their money
or possessions. Many of these old customs
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51911:78"/>
may be agreeable to the first design of the
endowment of the Church; yet not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and some of them not fit to be
continued. If any of them do deserve
to be revived; they are such as may
be effected by the old Laws still in
force; and want no new Laws, but only
the pleasure of Superiours, to put them in
execution.</p>
                  <p>But supposing Plurality to have been
against the first design of Parochial insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and endowment; what wonder is
it, that Ecclesiastical Ordinances of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
institution, should in the compass
of 1100 years change and deviate from
their first design; when Civil Ordinances
do so often change, and therewith some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
force a change of Ecclesiastical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
as must necessarily happen in all
mixt cases. It is notorious, that in the
first design of Parochial Cures, no <hi>Quare
impedit</hi> could be brought against a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop;
that formerly the persons and goods
of Clergymen were not subject to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
or cognisance of Laymen; that
all Estates and Possessions granted by the
Crown to Laymen were in consideration
of Military or other Service to be paid
by them; that no Taxes could be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on the Clergy but by themselves in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51911:78"/>
Convocation; that all Tithes were given,
and appropriations of them made for the
maintenance of Clergymen, or at least
for religious uses; that no place was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the Jurisdiction of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
by the first institution (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
intire till the end of the eleventh
Age) that the direction of the Kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in deciding Matters of Equity,
that is, the execution of the Office of
Chancellour, belonged wholly to the
Clergy. In all these and many other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which might be produced, the first
design is wholly changed; and yet no
such vehement accusation is brought against
the innovations. Perhaps some of these
old Institutions may, by the change of
circumstances of times, deserve to have
been changed; and the change to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.
For altho it be in many things a
good rule to reduce matters to their first
institution, yet it is not always so. In
the first Institution all things were adapted
to such circumstances of other things as
then obtained; and if in length of time
the latter change, reason will direct the
former to be changed with them. But it
is enough to shew that derivation from
the first design is not always blamable,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51911:79"/>
and that the charge of it lyeth equally
against many other cases, which yet are
not blamed. I need not add any more
concerning this head; since I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the permission of Pluralities is not
contrary to the first design of the division
and endowment of Parishes.</p>

are abuses, that even the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>

us blush: <hi>that</hi> all the honest Prelates at

better number of the Prelates and Fathers
in that Council, endeavoured to suppress
it: <hi>that</hi> the Pope formerly gave frequent
Dispensations to take Pluralities without

this Kingdom many Bishopricks, Abbies,
Priories, <hi>&amp;c</hi> were enjoyed <hi>(viz.</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51911:81"/>
of them) by Foreigners, who never
saw them, or took any care of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<hi>that</hi> it is not much better now:
<hi>nay, that</hi> the grievance is now become as
great as ever, and deserves a new and
stricter Reformation: <hi>that</hi> we are now in a
far worse condition than before the making
this Act <hi>(21 H. 8.)</hi> for that Dispensations
from <hi>Rome</hi> were costly, came slowly, being
far to fetch: <hi>that</hi> there is ten Dispensations
for Pluralities now, for one then; and few
of those dispensed with were Non-resident
upon both Livings as now they be: <hi>that it
is scandalous for Clergymen to appear
worldly minded or greedy of riches,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In these Objections the Author first
mentioned hath affirmed many things,
which are downright false; in other things
hath betrayed a gross ignorance. The
other Author is a person of too great
worth and learning, to be guilty either of
fraud or ignorance; but only hath suffered
himself to be herein transported, with too
much heat and zeal, before he well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the Case. So that wheresoever in
the following Answers I shall charge fraud
or ignorance upon the Objections, I desire
it may be referred to the first Objector
only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:51911:81"/>
For a general Answer to these Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
it may be observed, that neither
a neglect of the Cure of Souls, of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Hospitality, nor Dilapidations,
nor the Scandal consequent to any of
these faults, are a necessary consequence
of Plurality. If no Clergymen posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
one Benefice were Non-resident, and
in that sense neglected the cure of Souls;
if none of them were guilty of Dilapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
Inhospitality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and upon that
account scandalous: or if all Pluralists
were guilty of these disorders; then all
such faults might be justly charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Plurality. But if many Clergymen
possessing but one Benefice, are Non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
uncharitable and dilapidators; and
if many Pluralists do reside at one Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for the greater part, and at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for some considerable part of the
year; and do neither dilapidate, nor
neglect alms or hospitality; it must be
acknowledged, that such faults are not
the necessary consequences of Plurality,
but of the vicious and depraved nature
of some men, which would continue
and exert it self, as well in the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of one Benefice, as of two: As a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51911:82"/>
bad man will be so, whether he liveth at
<hi>London</hi> or at <hi>York,</hi> or at both places.
Such therefore are meerly personal faults,
and cannot without fraud be charged upon
Plurality.</p>
                  <p>For a particular Answer to the first
Objection, I affirm, That the Cure of
Souls is not neglected by Plurality. For
in all cases of Plurality, the Pluralist ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
personally supplies the cure of both
Livings, and in an Ecclesiastical sense re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideth
upon both, being so near to either
as to be personally conversant among
them, and always at hand to satisfie
extraordinary occasions; or if the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
distance of the Livings will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this, one of them is supplied by a
Curate. If he be Non-resident from
both, that is a case for which I am no
more obliged to answer, than such are,
who possessing but one Benefice reside not
at it. And of this sort there are a much
greater number, than of those who pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
two Benefices, reside at neither.
Where two Benefices not contiguous are
possest by one man, we acknowledge
that one of them must be supplied by
a Curate; and that to supply a Benefice
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51911:82"/>
by a Curate is not unlawful, was before
largely proved. Besides the Pluralist him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is obliged to reside at that Benefice,
which he less frequenteth, at least three
months every year; and if he doth not
perform this obligation, his Superiour is
to be blamed, who permits it. All this
while, it must be remembred, that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
not for such cases, where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
is absolutely Non-resident, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for his health, or because he is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by the King, or in any publick
Station, or liveth in the Family of his
Lord, or attendeth the Service of the
Church, in general by prosecuting his
studies elsewhere, or the service of any
Cathedral of which he is a member. All
these Cases are incident as well to Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
as Pluralists, and more frequent in
them; so that it concerns the one as well
as the other to defend them; it being
unreasonable that the Pluralist should be
obliged alone to defend the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both, if it be indeed a fault.
This Caution will throw off all those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
against Pluralists, of neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
poor souls; of serving the best Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
by mean Curates; of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
taking the Fleece, and feasting it
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51911:83"/>
out elsewhere; of hiring out the Sacred
Trust to Mercenaries; of committing it
to raw Practitioners, to Boys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
all this let them answer, who supply
their one Benefice by a Curate; and
what they shall alledge for themselves,
a Pluralist may much better apply to
his Case, who resides nine months at
one Living, and three at the other, as
the Canon requireth. But yet, not to
dismiss the Objectors thus; why must all
Curates be esteemed <hi>pitiful Mercenaries?</hi>
If because they supply the Cure for a
certain sum of money; that name may
be as well fixed upon all Incumbents
themselves, who receive Titles to be
converted into money; but especially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the Clergy of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
whose Stipends are fixed by Act of
Parliament, and paid in money. The
way of making Curates odious, by fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such a name upon them, may pass
with unthinking men; but by the same
reason, the Enemies of the Church may
call all Clergymen, and even the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
themselves, Mercenaries. Further,
why must all Curates be accounted <hi>piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Mercenaries, <hi>Boys, fitter to be kept
still at School, and raw Practitioners?</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51911:83"/>
persons now of great rank and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in the Church, have been Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates;
nay far the greater part of the
present Incumbents were once Curates;
and of the present Curates, many are
persons of great worth and learning, most
of them very well fitted to direct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
such Country-Parishes, as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their care: And if all be not
such, it is not the fault of the Pluralist,
but of the Bishop who ordains them, or
allows them. Not a few of them are
older and better Practitioners than the
Incumbent himself; and then, instead of
an <hi>high Scandal,</hi> it is an high benefit to
the Church, for one to receive the Fees
and another to supply the Cure. If it
be asked, with what conscience in that
case the Incumbent can receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits;
it may be as well asked, with what
conscience a Landlord can receive rent
from any husbandman, who bears the
whole labour and charge of tilling the
ground; or with what conscience a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
can receive the profits of his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprick,
who committeth the exercise
of almost all his Jurisdiction to Lay-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours
and Officials; or with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
an Incumbent can receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51911:84"/>
of his Chappels of ease, which are
necessarily served by Curates; or with
what concience either B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>shop or Layman
can receive the profits of an Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which were originally given for the
discharge of the cure of that Church.
I do not hereby in<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inuate, that any of
these cases are unlawful; but maintain,
that if it be unlawful for an Incumbent
to receive the profits, because the Cure
is discharged by another, it will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to defend these and such other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
                  <p>As for the charge of <hi>hiring out this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Trust to Mercenaries at the cheapest
rate:</hi> I am sorry to see a mistake of that
nature. The allowance generally made to
Curates is very large and plentiful; and
if it be not so, it is the fault of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
in whose power it is to fix the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
And for expecting <hi>dues from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners</hi>
without performing personal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
a <hi>Parsons Counsellour</hi> ought to know,
that these dues are not the gift of the
present Parishioners, but of the ancient
Princes and Great Men of our Nation;
and are held by as good a Title as any
Lands or Estates in <hi>England,</hi> which all
proceeded from the gift of the Crown at
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51911:84"/>
sometime or other. If it be said, that the
former were given for personal Sacred
Service; so were the latter given for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Military Service, which yet hath
long since ceased to be paid: But after
all, it is the effect of pure ignorance to
imagine, that the endowments of the
Clergy, were given for the personal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
only of Sacred Service by the
proper Incumbents at those particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where the endowments are made; as
was above sufficiently proved in the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
part of this Treatise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly, That</hi> almost all the greatest and
best Livings of <hi>England</hi> are now held by
Pluralists (who hardly see either of their
Livings in a year) and served by mean
Curates; <hi>is no better than a calumny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the second Article, touching Dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidations,
I only answer, That Dilapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is no more incident to a Pluralist,
than to an Unalist; and for this I appeal
to Experience, as well as the Objector:
and add, that where ever it is found,
it is the fault of the Bishop and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon,
if it be not corrected and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:51911:85"/>
The third Objection is drawn from the
neglect of Alms and Hospitality; and to
this the former Answer might suffice,
That Pluralists are no more guilty of this
neglect, than Unalists. But because the
Objection is popular, I will consider it
somewhat further. It is said, that the
Clergy are obliged by the design of the
Act 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to maintain Hospitality:
so were the Laity possessing the Lands of
dissolved Abbies, not only by the design,
but by the express words of the Act
31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. yet no such thing was ever
done by them, nor required of them. It
is added, that the Decree of Pope <hi>Sylve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
directeth a fourth part of the goods
of the Church to be given to the poor;
but it is somewhat shameful for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor
of the Law, to cite the Decrees of
Pope <hi>Sylvester,</hi> as genuine, which were
forged almost 500 years after his death.
As to the Law of King <hi>Alfred;</hi> why are
not those Laws as well produced, which
direct a community of possessions in the
Bishop and his Clergy, as in the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment
of the Church? May that Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman
be accursed, who doth not give
Alms of that he hath, and maintain Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitality
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51911:85"/>
among his Neighbours and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners
according to his circumstances
and ability: yet no man can, without
great ignorance of the change of times,
imagine the same obligation of alms and
hospitality to continue in the Clergy,
which was formerly. Before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
it was the humour of all orders
of men in the Nation, to maintain an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
Hospitality (to which they were the
more induced, by the great cheapness of
all things consumable); and without it
no Great man could keep up his Interest
or Reputation. Now the Lay-Nobility
and Gentry have wholly laid it aside, and
if it could be continued by the Clergy, it
would be accounted no other than Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Prodigality. Then it was a real
Charity to make constant Feasts for the
inferiour people, who lived very mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and hardly. Now they generally live
so well, that a good entertainment would
very little oblige them, and would scarce
be a work of Charity. Then the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
of the Clergy were very great;
no Taxes were imposed on them, but by
themselves; the recovery of their rights
and dues was easie, being left wholly to
the decision of their own Courts; their
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51911:86"/>
Title for life was secure; what ever change
in Government happened, they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed;
they were not obliged to
make any provision for Posterity; and
lastly little Learning was then required
or expected of them, and consequently
few Books necessary to them. On the
contrary, since the Reformation, the far
greater part of their Revenues have been
taken away from them, and even of that
little which remains, a great part is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished
by prevailing <hi>modi decimandi;</hi>
and after all it is often not to be obtained
but by course of Law, and that taken
out o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the hands of Ecclesiastical Judges
in most cases of moment, and put into a
long, costly, and difficult method; they
are burdened with constant ordinary Taxes
unknown to Laymen; in extraordinary
Taxes they are generally forced to pay a
much greater proportion than other men,
who in some places oppress them as they
please herein, without any remedy: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the insecurity of their Title, it is
not necessary to say any thing, and the
Law hath allowed them to bring up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
for the service of the publick, and
consequently to make a competent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for them; and lastly, a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51911:86"/>
of Learning and Knowledge being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
necessary to them, a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
number and variety of Books is now
requisite, than was formerly to them.
These considerations may perswade any
reasonable man, that it is not just to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
equal Alms and Hospitality, in the
present as in the ancient Clergy. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, Plurality is so far from obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that it increaseth both Charity and
Hospitality in the Clergy; enabling them
to perform both more freely and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
than otherwise they could do; and
that may be as well performed in the
Benefice less frequented, as in the other.
For there is no Benefice so rich, which a
man may not, if he so pleaseth, expend
wholly in Alms and Hospitality, in that
three months residence, which the Canon
requireth. As to matter of fact, that no
such Residence is made, if it were true, it
would be the fault of the Bishop, who
doth not enforce the Pluralist to observe
the terms of his Dispensation. But when
it is generally affirmed, it is no more
true, than that other charge, that no
Hospitality is kept by Pluralists.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:51911:87"/>
For the fourth Accusation, raised from
the Scandals consequent to Plurality, there
need no other answer, than that since
all the disorders and inconveniencies, from
which the supposed Scandal doth arise,
are proved to be unjustly charged upon
Plurality, the imputation of Scandal must
fall to the ground.</p>
                  <p>If Plurality be neither unlawful in it
self, nor contrary to the design of the
endowment of Churches, nor the cause
of any notable inconveniencies, as hath
been largely proved; it cannot be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of any Scandal to those who right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judge. It will indeed still be occasion
of Scandal to such as have been deceived
by the unjust exclamations, which have
been made against it, and refuse to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived:
but then the fault lyes wholly,
not in the nature of the thing, but in the
Authours of the Scandal, who represent
an innocent practice of the Church as an
inexcusable Scandal. If the Surplice and
Cross be scandalous to any; those men
only are to be blamed, who have perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the simple people, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
or superstitious. If the Confession
of the Trinity be matter of Scandal to a
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51911:87"/>
                     <hi>Socinian,</hi> he must lay the whole blame
upon his own understanding. The Church
is not obliged to account for these things,
nor to change her Doctrines, Ceremonies
and received Practices, to please the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of brainsick men. However some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
must be particularly answered to
that violent exclamation, whereby they
pretend the practice of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> herein, to be more corrupt and
enormous, than it ever was before the
Reformation, or now is in the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> It is alledged, that <hi>the Church of</hi>
Rome, <hi>after all her impudence, is ashamed
of these abuses:</hi> yet it is well known, that
the practice is continued and defended by
her. The Example of <hi>France</hi> is produced
against us; but I would fain know what
abuse our Church hath in this kind, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to their Commendatory Abbots?
The opinion of <hi>the greater and better num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Prelates in the Council of</hi> Trent,
is produced with ostentation against Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities;
yet I make use of the same Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of that Council,<note place="margin">Pag. 252.</note> and therein I find
these words: <hi>The wiser sort of Prelates
agreed uniformly to inhibit all, of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
soever, to have more than three Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi>
It is acknowledged, that the Pope
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51911:88"/>
formerly gave Dispensations for <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>without number or measure:</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
added, that <hi>it is not much better
now,</hi> nay <hi>far worse.</hi> Of the truth of this
let every man judge. Our Church hath
confined her Dispensations to the number
of two Benefices, and the measure to the
distance of 30 miles. The number is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
exceeded; the distance very rarely,
and that only when the Archbishops are
over-ruled by an express command from
Court, which hath not been done in late
years.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist. Counc. Trent,</hi> p. 251, 252.</note> Father <hi>Paul</hi> could have told the
Author of this Objection, that in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> 30 or 40 Benefices in
divers places of Christendom were often
united in favour of some one person; that
Bishopricks were often given to men not
having the Episcopal Order; and that
Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII. did in the year 1534
grant to this Nephew the Cardinal <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi>
all the Benefices and Spiritual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
of the whole Christian World,
Secular and Regular, with and without
cure, being vacant, for six months toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Or if these Examples will not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie,
let the Practice of Plurality in Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Peckham</hi>'s time (as it was before
set down) be remembred. Will any one
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51911:88"/>
now say, that such exorbitancy of Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
is now practised in our Church? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the conviction of this principal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of accusation, it will not be necessary
to pass on to the consutation of lesser mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes;
as that formerly <hi>in this Kingdom
many Bishopricks and Abbies were injoyed by
Foreigners, who never saw them:</hi> Whereas
there never were in <hi>England</hi> above four
such Bishops, and not one Abbot that I
could ever find. That <hi>Dispensations were
then few, because they must be had from</hi>
Rome, <hi>came slowly,</hi> &amp;c. whereas their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
and Procurators here resident were
wont to grant them. That <hi>there are ten
Dispensations for Pluralities now for one
then;</hi> which is affirmed without any proof
or ground: and that <hi>few of those dispensed
with, were Non-resident upon both their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,
as now;</hi> whereas then Bishops and
Noblemen were wont to retain in their
Families five times as many Chaplains and
Clergymen, as they do now.</p>
                  <p>The last occasion of Scandal pretended
to be administred by Pluralities, is that it
causeth the Clergy to appear worldly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded;
whereas they ought rather in
imitation of the first Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
to affect, or at least sit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51911:89"/>
with Poverty; that they ought
only to propose to themselves the glory
of God, and not their own interest; and
that it is unevangelical to desire increase
of possession. These Topicks appear very
plausible indeed, and were therefore em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
against the Secular Clergy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
by the <hi>Mendicant Friers,</hi> and lately
by their successours in hypocrisie the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi>
Yet it was always observed of them,
that they were more greedy of riches,
and at the same time more sordid, than
any other generation of men. Whether
the Observation be not true of these also,
let the world judge. But to come to the
merits of the cause; it is a very fallacious
argument, to infer from the Poverty and
Simplicity of the first planters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
that their Successours ought to be
so. It may with as much reason be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the community of possessions,
which obtained among all Christians in
the Apostolick times, that the goods of
all Christians ought to be common now.
In the beginning of Christianity, the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as well as Clergy were generally poor:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 26.</note>
                     <hi>For not many wise, not many mighty, not
many noble were called.</hi> Yet no man thinks
it reasonable, that the Laity should be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51911:89"/>
now concluded by this example. To the
first Preachers of the Gospel, the Miracles
wrought by them created a sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
and reverence; but after the ceasing
of Miracles, that was to be obtained to
the Clergy by their Learning and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
neither of which can be got or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without competent riches. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
God best understood what was fit
to be done herein, when he founded the
Church and State of the <hi>Jews:</hi> Yet he
commanded the Clergy to be endowed
far in proportion above the Laity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
now, all that the Clergy desire, is that
the small remaining part of what was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
given to them, by the munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of our Princes; and which after all
raiseth them not equal level with ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
persons of the Laity; should not be
taken from them. The envy and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
wherewith almost all sorts of men
look upon the possessions of the Clergy,
is indeed unaccountable. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that they are <hi>Englishmen</hi> and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Subjects as well as others, that they
have the same Rights and Priviledges
with others; that what they possess was
given to them by the same Authority (if
not greater) by which any Laymen hold
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51911:90"/>
their Estates; that out of their possessions
they contribute as much as any others to
the support of the publick, nay far more
than any others in proportion; that they
live as soberly and inoffensively (to say
no more) as others do; yet a competent
Estate invested in them, shall be envied
and maligned, which in the most vicious
Layman of the Nation would have escaped
without envy or murmur. As if a man
must be made incapable of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and blessings of life, only because he
peculiarly attends the publick Service of
God, and instructs other men in piety
and virtue. But it is pretended, that they
are obliged by their profession to seek on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the glory of God, and to despise the
riches of this World. All this other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are obliged to do as well as they;
to seek the glory of God in the first place,
and to despise Riches, when they are not
consistent with the preservation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
But to imagine, that a Clergyman
ought in no wise to seek his own tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
good, or the encrease of possession, is
Fanatical Non-sense; which no man, that
ever pretended to it, would abide by in
his own concern. It is not contrary to
the Gospel nor the design of the Sacred
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51911:90"/>
Office, simply to desire riches or encrease
of possessions; but only by sinister me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to procure, or to make an ill use
of them. Now Pluralists are no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
by the nature of Plurality, to
make an ill use of their revenues or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
than Unalists are by the nature
of one Benefice to do the same. Any one
may perform the duties of a good Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and a good conscience, or he may
neglect them, in either case. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ill use, not the being, of riches,
which ought to be blamed in Clergymen.
But I hope the Clergy are not yet so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
that it can be justly said, that they
make not generally as good use of their
revenues, as other men.</p>
                  <p>I have answered all the pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
of Pluralities, and shewn,
that many of the things objected are false,
some of them, not really inconvenient;
and that as many as are really so, are not
the consequents of Plurality, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
as well to Clergymen holding one
Benefice as two; and such as may, and
ought to be remedied by the Bishops, and
other Ecclesiastical Superiours, only by
executing the Laws and Canons of the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51911:91"/>
Church still in force, without any neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of calling in the assistance of new Laws.
But supposing that some slight inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
did attend Plurality, if still it
carries far greater conveniencies along with
it, it must be acknowledged, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
aud continuance is not really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
to the Church. And that it
doth include such conveniencies, upon a
short view will easily be discovered.</p>
                  <p>First then, Plurality is not only conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
but even necessary to the Church
in its present condition, by reason of the
great number of Benefices of little value,
which are found in <hi>England;</hi> the cure of
which can no way be provided for but
by Plurality. In this Nation are some
Benefices not exceeding the value of five
pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> many hundreds not
exceeding twenty pounds, and some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
not exceeding thirty pounds. Now
in almost all these the Cure of Souls must
utterly be neglected, if it be not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Clergymen to hold two of them
together, since one will not afford a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence.
None of the oppugners of Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities
can deny the reasonableness of this
case: Yet if those who maintain the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of them, would reason consistent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51911:91"/>
such a Pluralist ought no more to be
allowed, than of the two greatest Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
in <hi>England.</hi> For if Plurality be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in its own nature, and Residence due
<hi>jure divino;</hi> it would be equally unlawful
to hold two Benefices of 20, as of 200
pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> But it is too ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
a thing for men in their heat, not
to see the consequences of their own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
                  <p>Thus Plurality is in many cases neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to provide to the Clergy even a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
as to the necessaries of life; and
in other cases is necessary to provide for
them such a competency of subsistence, as
is agreeable to their character and order
in the world. <hi>For</hi> (as an excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of our Church hath observed) <hi>those
seem to have very little regard to the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
condition of a Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bishop of <hi>Worcesters</hi> Charge. p. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>who would
confine the sufficiency of a subsistence meerly
to the necessaries of life.</hi> There ought to
be sufficient provision made, to encourage
ingenuous persons to enter into the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
to free them from anxious cares
when initiated, and purchase to them
such necessaries, as the manner of the
service they undertake doth require; and
to reward such, as by extraordinary
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51911:92"/>
Worth and Learning, shall merit more
than others. All these provisions are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary, to the well being of
any Church; but none of them, in the
present circumstances of things, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
of the revenues of the Church, can
be fully obtained, without the permission
of Plurality.</p>
                  <p>The number of Benefices in <hi>England,</hi>
which may singly answer any of the ends
above mentioned, is very small. Did not
the hopes of obtaining somewhat more
than a bare competence, influence Parents
and Youth; none of good condition, or
sit for any other imployment, would be
bred up to the Clergy, or enter into holy
Orders. For here, all the Topicks of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
poverty, and how a Clergy-man
ought not to seek the things of the
world, or to desire riches, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
very little: Parents would not
breed up their sons to the Clergy upon
such conditions. It is certain, that the
most frugal person, cannot breed his son
to the Clergy in the University under the
expence of 200 pounds. If Pluralities
were taken away, it would be little less
than madness to imagine, that any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
will bring up his son carefully at
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51911:92"/>
School, and afterwards bestow 200 pounds
upon his education in the University, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to purchase poverty for him. Or if
any Parents should be so good natured or
zealous as to do it, yet it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to perswade Young men well
educated, who are naturally aspiring, and
led by their hopes, to enter into a Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
life, in which they can expect no more
than a bare competence; and not rather
take up other professions, which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to them infinitely more profit with
less labour. It would be vain in this case
to urge to a Young man, that in a Clerical
life he must be contented with a bare
competence; that the riches of this World
ought to be despised, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
answer, that if things be so, he will
never enter into that State of life, which
shall lay such an obligation of self-denial
upon him. For upon whatever principles,
men already initiated into the Sacred
Office, do proceed to execute their duty,
and continue in it notwithstanding pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or any other discouragement; it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable,
that it is the hopes of advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which perswadeth almost all to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Orders: and it must be great
want of understanding, to imagine that it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51911:93"/>
can or will be otherwise. Young men
will never be brought to it, when they
shall see, that others of no better birth,
parts or education than themselves, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
plentiful Estates by taking up other
Professions. If Pluralities, which encrease
the subsistence of the Clergy beyond a
bare competence, were abolished; it would
infallibly follow, that no Parents of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
would breed up their sons to the
Clergy; that no Young man of good
parts and pregnant hopes would enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Clergy; that there would remain
none for the service of the Church, but
of the lowest and meanest sort of the
people, and of those only such, as through
insuperable dulness could not hope to
make their Fortunes in any other Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>Further, a bare Competence as to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
of Life, will not suffice to purchase
to the Clergy such other advantages, as
are absolutely necessary to them in the
service of the Church: these are Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Ability to exercise Charity, and
helps of Learning. None of these can
be obtained in such a Provision, as only
supplieth the necessities of Life. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with the last, every Man, who knows
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51911:93"/>
the World and the business of Learning,
must confess, that the Study of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and those other Sciences, which are
necessary to a compleat Divine, is so
vast and diffuse; and the number of Books,
wherewith he ought to be acquainted, so
very great; that a small Estate can never
enable him to obtain such as are even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
to make him useful or consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in his Profession. It is well known,
that there are ten times more Books re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
to the Study of Divinity, than
to any other Profession; altho the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and temporal Advantages of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Professions are far Superiour to those
of the first, and yet no Man murmers at
them. In the purchase of such Books,
as are absolutely necessary to a learned
Divine, a Revenue of six score Pounds
<hi>per annum</hi> (which the late Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seem to suppose a sufficient Revenue
for a Clergy-Man, imposing a Tax in the
nature of a mulct upon Pluralists posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
more) would contribute very little.
And if the necessary helps to Learning be
denied to the Clergy, they cannot main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Honour and Well-being of the
Church; nor defend the cause of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
in general, or of the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51911:94"/>
in particular, as it ought to be.
What can be expected from a Clergy-man,
however Learned and Industrious,
when through want of a proportionable
Estate, he shall not be able to obtain the
Instruments of doing good, of performing
eminent Service to the Church or to the
World; when his Library must be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to a <hi>Concordance,</hi> a <hi>Postil,</hi> and a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyanthea,</hi>
and his Purse will reach no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?<note place="margin">Preface to <hi>Hist.</hi> of Tithes.</note> Of these indeed Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> hath
said the Library of a Clergy-man doth
consist, and from thence taketh occasion
to upbraid them of Ignorance. The
Charge indeed then was false; for the
Clergy were then in a flourishing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and had arrived to as great an
height of Learning, as was ever known in
the Christian Church. But if by the
diminution of the encouragements and
revenues of the Clergy, their Libraries
should be indeed reduced to such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
they would soon give just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Enemies of the Church, to
upbraid them of Ignorance, and to make
their advantage of it. If we call to
mind all the famous Writings of our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
published since the Reformation, to
the increase and support of Religion, the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51911:94"/>
advancement of Knowledge, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Nation: We shall find, that
they were almost all written by those
who were well preferred in the Church.
A Soul oppressed with Poverty, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
raise itself to attempt any great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in this Nature; or if it should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it, in a condition unable to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
the necessary helps of Learning, the
attempt would be but vain. I know that
the Case of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> will be objected
against this Assertion: But it is a vulgar
Errour, which the Author of his <hi>Life</hi>
hath also taken up, that he was but
meanly preferred. For to my certain
knowledge, at the time when he wrote
his celebrated Books of <hi>Ecclesiastical
Polity,</hi> he had very great prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
of which he died posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                  <p>It is no less necessary to the support of
Religion, that a Clergy-man be able to
give Alms liberally, and to maintain
some sort of Hospitality in the place where
he liveth: as well to give Example to the
Laity, as to oblige the Poorer sort to
the Practice of their Duty, by that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
which the Application of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to them shall obtain. The necessity
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51911:95"/>
of this is not indeed so obvious in great
Cities; But whoever knows the state of
Country Parishes, and the Conditions
and Humours of the Poorer sort there;
will confess, that a sense of Religion can
hardly be kept up among them, unless
it be in the Power of the Parish-Priest
to oblige them by Charity and Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p>Above all it is necessary to the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Religion, that the Clergy do
not want those helps, which will give to
them Respect and Authority among the
People; which a bare Competence can
never do, unless they be able to maintain
themselves in a condition above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Rank of Men. It is certain, that
it is not so much the force of Reason, or
the sense of Duty, which maintains Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
among many of the meaner and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
sort; as the Opinion which they
have of their Pastors, and the deference
which they are taught to pay to their
Judgment and Direction. If the Clergy
should be reduced to a bare Subsistence;
all this authority would fall to the Ground;
and their Persons thereby becoming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
to the People, Religion would
be despised with them. Even among Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51911:95"/>
of greater Knowledge and better Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Piety and Vertue in that case
could scarce be maintained; when such
would scorn to converse with those, whose
Poverty made them far Inferiour to their
Quality. Men may frame to themselves
what Systems they please in their Closets,
and in Speculation, and imagine that the
Clergy however poor, will still be honoured
<hi>for their Works sake;</hi> that Vertue and a
conscientious Discharge of their Duty will
procure to them everlasting respect and
Authority. But when these Systems are
reduced to practice, Experience demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
the Folly of them. If an Angel
should descend from Heaven, and take
upon him the Ministerial Office; if he
abstained from working Miracles, he
would never be able to procure any great
Respect to himself, or do eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the Church and to Religion; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he might converse with the Gentry
upon equal ground, and were raised a
degree above the Commonalty. Let any
Gentleman fancy himself stript of his
large Possessions, and reduced to a bare
subsistence; and then let him imagine,
if he can, that his Vertue will secure that
Authority among his Neighbours, which
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51911:96"/>
a large Estate, and Power delegated to him
for the sake of it, did before procure to him.</p>
                  <p>In the last place, it is necessary, that
additional Provisions be made for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of those Clergy-men, who by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Learning and Industry, shall
deserve more than others. For without
this the Church would be deprived of the
benefit of almost all the extraordinary
Labours of her Clergy; since scarce any
would be found willing to undertake any
unnecessary pains, if after all there were
no hopes of being distinguished from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who labour not so much, as well
by their Preferment as by their Merit. It
is commonly said indeed, that Prebends
and other Dignities in Cathedral Churches,
were intended for Rewards of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Merit, and are sufficient to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
But it is to be considered, that
those are given promiscuously, as Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
are, to Men of ordinary as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
worth, and that it never did or
can happen otherwise; that the Persons
of extraordinary worth to whom they
are given, are generally those who ply
next at Court, that Rewards of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Merit, ought to be provided for
the Clergy of other Diocesses, as well as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51911:96"/>
for them; that many Bishops have not
the gift of one Prebend, wherewith to
Reward their Chaplains and deserving
Clergy; and the Arch-Bishop himself of
no more than three: and consequently
that no constant Provision can be made
for extraordinary Merit, otherwise than
by Pluralities.</p>
                  <p>Other great inconveniencies, which
would arise from confining the Revenues
of the Clergy to a bare Subsistence, might
be urged; as, that it would reflect dishonour
upon Religion; that it would soon intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a general Ignorance; that it would
induce them to follow a Secular Life; that
it would tempt them to prevaricate, to
flatter Vice in Rich Men, and to betray
the Cause of Religion in times of Tryal,
such as we lately saw. These and the
above-mentioned Considerations make it
absolutely necessary, that the Clergy
should be endowed with, and permitted
to enjoy ample Possessions and Revenues.
God therefore foretold it as the great
Blessing of his Church, which should be
founded among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that <hi>Kings
should be her Nursing-Fathers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 49. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>and Queens
her Nursing-Mothers.</hi> Which Prophecy
may well be expounded, to denote (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51911:97"/>
other things) the Favour and large
Rewards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Secular Princes, when
converted to the Faith, should bestow
upon the Ministers of the Church, for
the increase and continuance of the Faith.
This was abundantly performed in our
Church, by the Kings and Queens and
Noble Personages of <hi>England,</hi> whose Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
is for ever blessed; and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment
made by them, confirmed by
innumerable subsequent Laws. Then the
Endowment was so large, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of extraordinary Provisions in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventual,
Cathedral, and Collegiate
Churches, and from Chauntries and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
so very great; that the assistance
of Pluralities was not so very necessary
to uphold the Honour of Religion, and
of the Clergy. But when by Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at first, and afterwards by the Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Abbey and other Church-lands,
almost all the extraordinary Provisions
were taken away, and the ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
reduced to less than half; it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to maintain the design of those
Endowments, that is, the flourishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Church, without the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Pluralities. In the continuance
of this benefit to the Church, we doubt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51911:97"/>
not, but their present Majesties will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Piety and Devotion of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors;
and as they once preserved this
Church from eminent danger of Ruin,
by their Wisdom and Valour, will also
maintain the well-being and the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
estate of it by countenancing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
all those Institutions, Customs,
and Practises, which are necessary to that
end.</p>
                  <p>I might insist upon many other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
and Benefits, which accrue to
the Church from the use of Pluralities;
as, that hereby young Clergy-men are
trained up in Curacies under others more
grave and experienced, and fitted for the
Service of any Parochial Church in their
own Right; who, if at their first admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
into Holy Orders, the Cure of Souls
and Government of Parochial Churches
had been committed to them, would be
apt to commit many indiscreet acts, and
execute their Trust unskilfully. Yet the
present circumstances of things make it
necessary to admit those, who are educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Clergy, into Orders as soon as
their Age permits, otherwise the Church
would soon want a competent number
of Candidates to supply her Service;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51911:98"/>
since Fellowships in Colledges do not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
for the tenth part of them; And
from the finishing of their Studies, to
their Presentation to a Benefice, there is
no other Provision made for them than
by Curacies. That by the same benefit
Provision is made for Deacons, who are
incapable of possessing a Benefice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
That hereby the Cure of Souls
in many Parishes is executed by two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
which is a great advantage to those
Parishes, and to Religion in general. For
it may happen, that the Incumbent of
any one Parish be negligent in his Duty,
or unlearned: but it can scarce happen,
that in a Parish held by a Pluralist, and
served alternately by the Incumbent and
his Curate, that both Incumbent and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
should be alike negligent or unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
That hereby Provision is made for
Chaplains, attending and assisting Bishops
in the execution of their Office, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of their Diocesses; or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and preserving Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in the Families of Noblemen.</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>I Have now finished what I had to say
in defence of Pluralities, and submit
the whole to the Consideration of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Judges. Having done this, I hope
I may be allowed to speak to the Pluralist
Clergy (whose Cause I have all this
while defended) with all freedom. Them
I must conjure by the Honour of God,
and (which to ingenuous Persons ought
also to be an irresistable Argument) by
the sense of their Duty, to make such
use of the favour of Plurality granted to
them, that Religion and the Church may
receive no inconvenience thereby, and no
just occasion of Scandal may be given by
them. I have proved indeed, that Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
doth not in its own Nature beget
any Inconveniencies or Scandals. But if
it be not rightly used, if the terms of the
Dispensation be not fulfilled, if they so
behave themselves, as if they cared not
for the Souls of either Parish; or if they
live wholly at one, and seldom visit the
other; if they think themselves wholly
disburthen'd of the Cure of Souls, by the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51911:99"/>
delegation of it to a Curate; if they put
no bounds to their desire of Pluralities,
hold two by Union, a third by Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
and perhaps a fourth under the
Name of another Man by Simoniacal
Contract; if they neglect to give Alms
and to use Hospitality in both their
Benefices according to their Abilities; if
they suffer their Houses to be dilapidated,
and have no regard to the good of their
Successors: much more, if without any
reasonable Excuse, they are continually or
frequently absent from both their Cures,
either to hun<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> after better Preferment
elsewhere, or to follow their Pleasure and
live more at ease in great Cities and
Towns: If they are not excused by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Attendance in the Families of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
or Great Men, or by prosecution of
their Studies in the Universities, or by
designs of publick Service to the Church,
more advantageous to Religion in general,
than the Personal supplying any two
Country Cures would be; or by indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Body, real and not pretended:
If without any of these Lawful Excuses,
they absent themselves from the Cure of
Souls committed to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
betake themselves to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51911:99"/>
execution of it: When any of these
Reasons cease, which did before excuse
them; in all these cases Plurality will in
them be the occasion of great Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
to the Church, and Scandal to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
It was never my design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
such Practises, nor can they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
by any Principles laid down in this
Treatise.</p>
            <p>But because all Men will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to do their Duty, I beg leave in
the next place, to address my self, with
all Reverence to the Arch-bishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of our Church, and entreat them
to force such Pluralists to do their Duty.
This they are empowered to do by the
Canons and Laws of our Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
still in force: By the due execution
of which they may regulate all such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
and all other corruptions, which
have crept into the Church. It is not
the fault of her Constitution, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
any of these Inconveniencies, but
the neglect of her Orders, and non-exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of her established Discipline. If
these were vigorously revived; if their
Lordships would please diligently to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and inspect their D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ocesses, force their
Arch-deacons to do their Duty, the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51911:100"/>
of their Cathedral Churches to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their Statutes, the Pluralist Clergy
to fulfil the terms of their Dispensations,
and all their Clergy to obey the Canons,
and to do their known Duty: all that
Benefit and Reformation would follow,
which some (not knowing the excellence
of the present Constitution) propose to
obtain by such new Laws and Projects, as
would perhaps shake and endanger the
whole Fabrick of the Church. What
the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> observed concerning Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philosophy, that a superficial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it makes Men Atheists, but a
perfect knowledge of it reduceth them to
Religion; is fully as true in Ecclesiastical
Polity. An imperfect view and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Constitution and State of our
Church, makes Men desirous of a Change
or Reformation; but a thorough know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it, makes them not only be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
but pleased with her present Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
only desirous that her excellent
Laws and Institutions may be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
This case of Pluralities was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
esteemed the most scandalous and
inexcusable of all her supposed Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
yet upon a strict examination of
it, it doth now (as I hope) appear to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51911:100"/>
be neither scandalous nor inconvenient;
but lawful, necessary, and advantageous
to the Church. All the real inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
of it, proceed wholly from the ill
use of it, and from the faults of private
persons, to which the best Institutions are
equally subject; and which it is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
their Lordships the Bishops, will in
time remedy, by the due application of
that Authority, which the Laws of this
Church and Nation have already invested
in them.</p>
