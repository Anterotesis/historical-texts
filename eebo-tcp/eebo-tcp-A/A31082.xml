            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall ſee them?</hi> That for preventing the blow threatned by this deſign, (whereof he had ſome glimpſe, or ſome preſumption, grounded upon the knowledge of their implacable and active malice) he doth implore Divine protection: <hi>Hide me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>from the ſecret counſel of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> 
               <hi>the wicked, from the inſurrection of the workers of iniquity.</hi> That he did confide in God's Mercy and Juſtice for the ſeaſonable defeating, for the fit avenging their machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall ſhoot at them with an arrow; ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhall they be wounded.</hi> That they ſhould themſelves <note place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note> become the detectours of their crime, and the inſtruments of the exemplary puniſhment due thereunto: <hi>They</hi> (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he) <hi>ſhall make their own tongue to fall upon themſelves:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Such was the Caſe; the which unto what paſſage in the hiſtory it doth relate, or whether it belongeth to any we have recorded, it may not be eaſie to determine. Expoſitours commonly do refer it to the deſigns of <hi>Saul</hi> upon <hi>David</hi>'s life. But this ſeeming purely conjecture, not founded upon any expreſs words, or pregnant inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations in the text, I ſhall leave that inquiry in its own uncertainty. It ſufficeth to make good its pertinency, that there was ſuch a miſchievous Conſpiracy, deeply projected againſt <hi>David;</hi> (a very great perſonage, in whoſe ſafety the publick ſtate of God's people was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concerned; he being then King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> at leaſt in deſignation, and therefore in the precedent Pſalm, endited in <hi>Saul</hi>'s time, is ſo ſtyled;) from the peril where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 11.</note>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:105063:3"/>
he by the ſpecial Providence of God was reſcued, with the notable diſappointment and grievous confuſion of thoſe who managed it. The which Caſe (at leaſt in kind, if not in degree) beareth a plain reſemblance to that which lieth before us.</p>
            <p>And the Duties which upon that occaſion are ſignified to concern people then, do no leſs now ſort to us; the which, as they lie couched in our Text, are theſe: 1. <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to <hi>conſider God's doing;</hi> 2. to <hi>fear;</hi> 3. to <hi>declare God's work;</hi> 4. to <hi>be glad in the Lord;</hi> 5. to <hi>truſt in God;</hi> 6. to <hi>glory.</hi> Of which the Firſt Three are repreſented as more generally concerning men; the others as appertaining more peculiarly to righteous and upright perſons.</p>
            <p>Theſe Duties it ſhall be my endeavour ſomewhat to explain and preſs, in a manner applicable to the preſent caſe. I call them Duties; and to warrant the doing ſo, it is requiſite to conſider, that all theſe particulars may be underſtood in a double manner, either as declarative of event, or as directive of practice upon ſuch emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
            <p>When God doth ſo interpoſe his hand, as ſignally to check and confound miſchievous enterpriſes; it will be apt to ſtir up in the minds of men an apprehenſion of God's ſpecial Providence, to ſtrike into their hearts a dread of his Power and Juſtice, to wring from their mouths ſutable declarations and acknowledgments; and particularly then good men will be affected with pious joy, they will be incouraged to confide in God, they will be moved to glory, or to expreſs a triumphant ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in God's proceedings. Theſe events naturally do reſult from ſuch providential occurrences; for producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe events, ſuch occurrences are purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; and accordingly (where men are not by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105063:4"/>
opinions or affections much indiſpoſed) they do commonly follow.</p>
            <p>But yet they are not propoſed ſimply as Events, but alſo as matters of Duty: for men are obliged readily to admit ſuch impreſſions upon their minds, hearts, and lives, from the ſpecial works of Providence: they are bound, not to croſs thoſe natural tendencies, not to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate thoſe wiſe intents of God, aiming at the production of ſuch good diſpoſitions and good practices: whence if thoſe effects do not ariſe, as often notoriouſly they do not in ſome perſons, men thereby do incurre much guilt and blame.</p>
            <p>It is indeed ordinary to repreſent matter of duty in this way, expreſſing thoſe practices conſequent in effect, which in obligation ſhould follow, according to God's purpoſe, and the nature of cauſes ordered by him. As when, for inſtance, God in the Law had preſcribed Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and threatned ſore puniſhment on the diſobedient, it is ſubjoyned, <hi>And all the people ſhall hear, and fear, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 13. &amp; 13. 11. &amp; 19. 20.</note> 
               <hi>do no more preſumptuouſly:</hi> the meaning is, that ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary puniſhment is in its nature apt, and its deſign tendeth to produce ſuch effects, although not ever, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs with due ſucceſs, ſo as to prevent all tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe Laws. So alſo, <hi>When</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>thy judgments are in the land, the inhabitants of the world</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 9.</note> 
               <hi>will learn righteouſneſs:</hi> the ſenſe is, that Divine judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in themſelves are inſtructive of Duty, it is their drift to inform men therein, and men ought to learn that leſſon from them; although in effect divers there be, whom no judgments can make wiſer or better; ſuch as thoſe of whom in the ſame Prophet it is ſaid, <hi>The</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 9. 13. Jer. 2. 30. &amp; 5. 3. Neh. 9. 29.</note>

               <hi>correction.</hi> As therefore frequently otherwhere, ſo alſo here, this kind of expreſſion may be taken chiefly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Duty. To begin then with the Firſt of theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

               <hi>doing.</hi> This I put in the firſt place, as previous in nature, and influential upon the reſt: whence (although in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it be knit to the reſt, as they all are to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the conjunctive parcicle <hi>ve, and,</hi> yet) we do tranſlate it cauſally, <hi>for they ſhall wiſely conſider, for they ſhall perceive;</hi> becauſe indeed without duly conſidering, and rightly underſtanding ſuch occurrences to proceed from God, none of the other acts can, or will be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: attentive conſideration is needful to beget know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and perſuaſion, theſe to breed affection and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
            <p>There are many who, in ſuch caſes, are no-wiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of God's ſpecial Providence, or affected with it; becauſe they do not conſider, or do not conſider wiſely and intelligently.</p>
            <p>Some are very inobſervant and careleſs in regard to things of this nature; ſo drowzy and heedleſs, as not to attend to what-ever paſſeth, or to mind what God acteth in the world: ſuch as thoſe of whom the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The Harp and the Viol, the Tabret and Pipe, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Wine are in their feaſts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands:</hi> that is, their minds <note place="margin">Pſal. 28. 5. &amp; 10. 4.</note> are ſo amuſed by wanton divertiſements, their hearts are ſo immerſed in ſenſual enjoyments, as no-wiſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the moſt notable occurrences of Providence.</p>
            <p>Others, (although they do ken and regard what is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105063:5"/>
done, as matter of news, or ſtory, entertaining curioſity and talk; yet) out of ſloth or ſtupidity, do little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, or ſtudy whence it ſpringeth; contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with none, or with any ſuperficial account, which fancy or appearance ſuggeſteth: like beaſts, they do take in things obvious to their ſenſe, and perhaps ſtand gazing on them; but do not make any careful reflexion, or inquiry into their original cauſes and reaſons; taking (as a dog, when he biteth the ſtone flung at him, or as a child that is angry with the log he falleth on) what-ever appeareth next, to be the principal cauſe: ſuch as the Pſalmiſt again toucheth, when he ſaith, <hi>A brutiſh man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 92. 6.</note>

               <hi>So fooliſh was I, and ignorant; I was as a beaſt before thee.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>The ſpecial Providence of God in events here effected or ordered by him, is indeed commonly not diſcernible without good judgment and great care; it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly impreſſed upon events in characters ſo big and clear, as to be legible to every eye, or to any eye not endued with a ſharp perſpicacy, not applying an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious heedfulneſs: the tracts thereof are too fine and ſubtil to be deſcried by a dimme ſight, with a tranſient glance, or upon a groſs view: it is ſeldome ſo very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, that perſons incredulous, or any-wiſe indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to admit it, can eaſily be convinced thereof, or conſtrained to acknowledg it: it is often (upon many accounts, from many cauſes) very obſcure, and not eaſily diſcernible to the moſt ſagacious, moſt watchful, moſt willing obſervers. For, the inſtruments of Providence being free agents, acting with unaccountable variety,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105063:6"/>
nothing can happen, which may not be imputed to them, with ſome colourable pretence. Divine and humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences are ſo twiſted and knit together, that it is hard to ſever them. The manner of Divine efficacy is ſo very ſoft and gentle, that we cannot eaſily trace its footſteps. God deſigneth not commonly to exert his hand in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious way, but often purpoſely doth conceal it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as alſo it is not fit to charge upon God's ſpecial hand of Providence any event, wherein ſpecial ends of wiſedom or goodneſs do not ſhine; it is often hard to diſcover ſuch ends, which uſually are wrap'd in perplexities; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God acteth variouſly, (according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things, and the diſpoſition, capacity, or ſtate of objects) ſo as to doe the ſame thing for different ends, and different things for the ſame end: becauſe there are different ends, unto which Providence in various order and meaſure hath regard, which our ſhort and narrow proſpect cannot reach: becauſe God, in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his ends, is not wont to proceed in the moſt direct and compendious way; but windeth about in a large circuit, enfolding many concurrent and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſigns: becauſe the expediency of things to be permitted or performed, doth not conſiſt in ſingle acts or events, but in many conſpiring to one common end: becauſe we cannot apprehend the conſequences, nor bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the conveniencies of things in order to good ends: becauſe we are apt to meaſure things by their congruity to our opinions, expectations, and affections: becauſe many proceedings of God depend upon grounds inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to our apprehenſion; ſuch as his own ſecret Decrees, the knowledge of mens thoughts, cloſe purpoſes, clandeſtine deſignes, true qualifications and merits; his preſcience of contingent events and what the reſult will
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105063:6"/>
be from the combination of numberleſs cauſes: becauſe ſometimes he doth act in methods of Wiſdom, and by rules of Juſtice, ſurpaſſing our capacity to know either from the finiteneſs of our nature, or the feebleneſs of our reaſon, or the meanneſs of our ſtate, and circumſtances here: becauſe alſo the Divine adminiſtration of affairs hath no compleat determination or final iſſue here; that being reſerved to the great day of reckoning and judgment. It is further alſo expedient, that many occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſhould be puzzling to us, to quaſh our preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to exerciſe our faith, to quicken our induſtry, to engage us upon adoring that Wiſedom which we cannot comprehend. Upon ſuch accounts, for ſuch cauſes, (which time will not give me leave to explain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie) the ſpecial Providence of God is often cloudy, is ſeldom ſo clear, that without great heed and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we can perceive it. But however to do ſo is plainly our duty; and therefore poſſible.</p>
            <p>For our Reaſon was not given us to be idle upon ſo important occaſions; or that we ſhould be as brute Spectatours of what God doeth. He, ſurely, in the Governance of his nobleſt creature here diſcovereth his Being, and diſplayeth his Attributes, we therefore care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhould obſerve it. He thereby (and no otherwiſe in a publick way) doth continually <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and ſignifie <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 1. &amp; 60. 6. &amp; 62. 11.</note> to us his mind: and fit it is, that we his ſubjects ſhould hear, ſhould attend to the leaſt intimations of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. To him thence glory ſhould accrue, the which who but we can render? and that we may render it, we muſt know the grounds of it. In fine, for the ſupport of God's Kingdom, for upholding the reverence due to his adminiſtration of Juſtice among us, it is requiſite, that by apparent diſpenſation of recompences, Duty ſhould
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105063:7"/>
be encouraged, and Diſobedience checked: very fooliſh therefore we muſt be, if we regard not ſuch diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>So Reaſon dictateth, and Holy Scripture more plainly declareth our obligation to conſider, and perceive God's doings. To doe ſo is recommended to us as a ſingular point of wiſedom: <hi>whoſo is wiſe, and will obſerve theſe things, they ſhall underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord.</hi>

So alſo that a malicious Traitour ſhould conceive kindneſs toward any, that he ſhould be miſtaken in the object of his favour, that he ſhould expreſs his mind in a way ſubject to deliberate examination, in terms apt to breed ſuſpicion where the Plot was laid; that the Counſellours ſhould deſpiſe it, and yet not ſmother it; that the King inſtantly, by a light darted into his mind, ſhould deſcry it: theſe things ſo happily meeting, may argue God (who mouldeth the hearts, who guideth the hands, who enlightneth the minds of men) to have been engaged in the detection of this day's black Conſpiracy.</p>
