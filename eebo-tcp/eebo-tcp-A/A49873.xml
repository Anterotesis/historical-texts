         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Wisdom of God is exceedingly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in the Choice which he makes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
<pb facs="tcp:32808:3"/>
to Manifest himself by; that os That may not be attributed to the Creature, which only belongs to him. He takes up a Meek and Fearful Vessel, to make the most haughty Powers to Tremble; the Youngest and most Despised Son of a Shepherd, to make him a glorious Conquer our over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Potent Princes, and to leave a Kingdom to his Posterity in Peace; an ordinary Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to make him mighty, to Command both Heaven and Earth, even to teach him to destroy his Enemies, by an Invisible Power, and to raise up again the Dead to Life; a Woman to be a Mother, and a Saviour in <hi>Israel,</hi> when no Man was found; and a few Fisherman to stand up against, and triumph over all the Strength and Policy of the World. So that it must be said, this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the Lord's doing, and it is wonderful in our Eyes.</p>
            <p>There is certainly so far from being any thing of the Art of Man, in whatever has pass'd through this Blessed Instrument, and such an Incapacity in the Subject to make use of it; that as it cannot but give great effence to all that seek for it; so to those who seek more for the Wisdom that is Above, than that which is Below, there is a clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration from whence it must have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
<pb facs="tcp:32808:4"/>
And I have here leave to say, that whoever in the Meek and Sober Spirit shall desire further Satisfaction in this Subject, here Treated on, the Author will readily Answer to such Inquiring Minds, and Orally confer with them, while remaining in this Outward Principle.</p>
            <p>Thus much is Undeniable, that, however some may perhaps, think that there may be somewhat here advanc'd, which will serve to render Souls more careless, as to the Great Concern of their Future State, and to Adjourn their Provision for it; there is yet not so much as any Possibility of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, even into the Lowest Heavens, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the New Birth, according to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon which all this stands. Wherefore is Highly behoves every one to secure that, and to press forward with the greatest ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness, hat they get entirely out of the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Source, and the evil Nature, raising themselves up above wha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ever is Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that at their leaving this visible World, they may be found cloathed upon with the Holy One Element.</p>
            <p>This that is here Reveal'd; might not have gone further, than among a few Confiding Friends; but that the same Spirit who Revealed it, was pleased to raise up in a
<pb facs="tcp:32808:4"/>
wonderful manner, a Great and Princely Defender, and Protector of these Divine Truths, and of the High Mystery of Faith, whose Name Shines Gloriously in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scal'd Book of Life, to do all that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Promulgation of the Glad Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Everlasting Covenant, and Kingdom of God with Man, and for the Building of the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the raising the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> that is fallen. The Effect of which will be more abundantly Manifested, by what shall be hereafter Published, through the Assistance and Direction of the Great Master-Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the LORD Blessed for ever.</p>

            <head>A MANIFESTATION Concerning the Eight VVORLDS, OR REGIONS, Allotted to Human Souls; According to their several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Ascent or Descent.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Revelation of Jesus Christ now Glorified, who sends greeting by his Spirit, to the Good-willers and Waiters for his Appearance.</head>
            <p n="1">§. 1. WHEREAS it hath been sounded in my Ears, that no New spring of Revelatino
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32808:6"/>
from him who is ascended into the Heavens, doth come down, Behold I JESUS the Lord have given and raised up, and will yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently give and raise up Witnesses to contradict the Unbelieving: Who while they continue so, will be excluded from this great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable Priviledge of taking from me; and thereby of knowing the hidden secrets that lye in God the Fountain of Eternity. Now then to thee, who hast already born a true Witness for me, I do give a further Commission to go sorth, from a Book within Unsealed; wherein thou shalt meet with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable Deep of Revelation, to publish for the Universal Enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ignorant and Blind in Mind. For from this the Spirits Day shall break up apace, that so it may be known, that God in his Christ, hath not forgotten to reveal himself to the Inhabitants of this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32808:6"/>
lower World in truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness: But together with this, there will be that which will take up a false Covering of the Spirit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my LORD did say to me, that pure and right Revelation should not go forth Naked, or only Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but clothed with Power in the Number Seven, where the Strength of an Almightiness shall be a guard upon its Testimony of Truth and Verity.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. Now then I am to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of some particulars revealed by the Spirit of CHRIST: Of which the First was this, That the time was very near approaching, in the which the Earth should cast forth the Dead, that have been buried in the Body of Sin. For this end a terrible Blow and Stroke upon the Nations of the Earth will fuddenly come. God saith, he is wearied out with the Sinful Abomination, of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32808:7"/>
this World, to which he purposeth shortly to put an end. For it hath accordingly been sounded in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ear, that the Ends of all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Worlds, are by the great Creator of them now determined. Upon which saying, I queried in Spirit with my LORD, in what other Worlds besides this Visible and known World, the Evil of Sin did yet remain? Whereupon it was replied, that such as go out of this World in their gross and unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Earthly Life, without Clarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, obtained through the Water of Regeneration, and the Blood of Christ shed in them, and so Attoning for Sin and Trespasses; (which not being entirely done away before they go out of this Life, will still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with them in their nature and quality after Death;) do pass into such Worlds, Stations or Centres, which are most agreeable and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to them, and do accordingly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32808:7"/>
bear great varieties, and sundry degrees of Punishments, proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Impurity that is left in them. For as much as Sin dieth not totally with the Body, except while in it there hath been a Dying to it, by the Spirit of Righteousness spreading over it. So that from hence a Cry doth go forth to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Peoples and Languages, to Purge out the corrupt Leaven of Sin, that it may not go with them into that World, or Worlds, where their Lot may be.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. For it hath been revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that there are several Regions or Worlds that do receive the Souls of all Degrees and Ranks, to the Number Eight. The First of these is this <hi>Mortal Visible</hi> World: The Second is the <hi>Astral</hi> or <hi>Aerial</hi> World: The Third is the <hi>Waterish Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> World: And the Fourth is the <hi>Fiery Dark</hi> World. These are all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32808:8"/>
the Worlds where Sinful Lustings may be, with Punishments answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, till Sin shall expire therein, through the Meditorship and Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatian of CHRIST the Almighty Redeemer. For into the next Four Worlds nothing of Evil or Sin can enter, or in the Inhabitants of them dwell. The First of these is the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radisical</hi> World, being all Coelestial, and a very pleasant State, where there is a growing up to higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Perfection; to compleat us for the Kingdom of <hi>Mount Sion:</hi> Where Christ's the Lord's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is in great Magnificence, with all the Angelical Principalities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and with the Elders, as Patriarchs, Prophets, and Apostles. The Third Heavenly World is the Royal and Principal Seat of God the Father, with the Eternal Virgin Wisdom, and the Seven Spirits. This bears the Title of the Great City, called the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:32808:8"/>
where the Glassy Sea doth encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass about. Then above this is that World called the <hi>Still Eternity:</hi> Out of which were generated all of these Worlds above-mentioned. Of all which I must give an account, according as I have had them shewed and opened, from the deep Centre, and Original Being of them. I did not know when I published my two last Treatises, that of the <hi>Enochian Life,</hi> and the other of the <hi>Paradisical Laws,</hi> that my God would ever have had made use of me any more in this kind; the Day of my Life being so far spent, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its evening Rest. But my LORD doth still follow me with fresh Revelations, and Inkindlings from his own immense Deep, which run as a Fiery Stream through me, so that I find there is no resisting this all-driving Power; by which hidden and unknown Worlds must
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32808:9"/>
be made manifest in this last Age of Times.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. But before I go upon this large and copious Matter, it will be proper to Answer a grand Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is expected to be cast in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reading hereof; Namely, Since the Holy Scripture maketh no mention of such Variety of Worlds, how shall we give credit hereunto? In Answer to this, it is given from him, who Was, and Is, and Will be the true Inspirer, to open new Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of his Mind, which are not to be less reputed and credited than the foregoing Scriptures: The Old Testament having been appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Ministration of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the New to the Son; now the Third Day is come, in which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost will have His, which will Excel all before it, to Unseal and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal what yet never was known or understood, that will be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32808:9"/>
to, and by such as are in an extraordinary manner sanctified and set a part for this holy Function. For from this Spirits Day, must go forth a New Spring of things yet to be revealed, both as to the Present and Future State, that hath lain hid within these mentioned Worlds. The Account of which I am more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to give, according as it hath been shown to me from the Spirit of Inspiration. For I write here from no other Ground, than what the Spirit of CHRIST, in the Glass of Wisdom, hath presented to mine Inward Eye, which pierceth into the Deep of God's Mind. And which is no longer to be concealed; for the Holy Unction is given for this end; to drop his golden Oil, which will dissolve all those Seals, that have stood so long for an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and shutting up of those My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Truths, that a Commission is now given to bring forth; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:32808:10"/>
to their being proclaimed, and inscribed upon the Pillars and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God's House. Whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, or not, it must stand as the Engraving of God's Hand.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. The First in Order is this Corporeal Visible World, in which we now live: Where good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Births have been produced from <hi>Adam,</hi> and so still shall go on to be procreated, till the Numbers shall be finished and filled up, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as to us numberless, but num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by God. Here is laid a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his manifold Wisdom, in a wonderful way and manner, to be made manifest from this first ground of Natural Generation. Which Births after a limited time must pass through the Death of the Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body, to such Regions as their Lot will fall to.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:32808:10"/>§. 6. As for such Ranks of Souls that do dye Unregenerated, these, having no part in CHRIST, and having lived ignorant, and as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in this present World, do go to their own direful Place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Circumference of the Evil Worlds; where they will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and tried, till the general Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all Lapsed Worlds, by the Mighty God and Saviour shall come to be effected. But of this we will not further now insist, having else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where more largely declared it.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. Now therefore beginning from below, I proceed to make known to the true Simplified Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, what the First and Lowest of these Worlds or Elements is: This is entitled the Dark Hellish World, and by the only Supream Creator and Judge, is allotted a Receptacle for <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized Angels of that Hierarchy.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32808:11"/>
It may be also called the Direful and Black Kingdom, over the which <hi>Lucifer</hi> is King, ruling there in the Pride of his Might in the Wrathful Fire. Now from hence it is given given us to understand, that such Souls as in the time of this Life are Infected, and deeply Essenced in this Satanical Principle, being stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all that is Diabolical, going hence without being Renewed and Transformed in some degree, by the Love &amp; Light Principle, must when they die out of the Body, expect this Hellish World to be their Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Portion; with all those Punishments that the Evil Angels will delight to inflict upon them. O that this dreadful Place and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, could warn and terrify all that of this Diabolical Spirit are! For who would ever endure, were it but for a Year, or a few Years, such intolerable Sufferings, if they might by any means be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32808:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Which may be done, if in holy Fear they do eschew all those Evils that do lead hereto. So ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more to say to this Dark Kingdom, we must leave it to the Fiery Purgation, until the Venom of Sin in every Evil Property, shall by the means of it expire, both as to Angels of the Hellish source, and to such Souls as have been deceived and captivated by them. For the Creating <hi>Fiat</hi> will move the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yet once again, for the making of all things New. Then shall the old things of Hell, Death, Sorrow and Pain come no more into remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. God is said to be Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting and Unchangable in Love, but not so to be in Anger and Wrath: For Love must drown and swallow that up.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. But now the Elementary Worlds, with their Peculiar Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Inhabitants severally allotted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32808:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to them, are next to be searched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Be it then known, that each E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement hath a Spirit of another kind than what is known, or can be seen amongst Mortals. The Fiery Region hath a Spirit proper to it; that is, of the only nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Fire: The Water likewise, and the Air each hath its proper Spirit to inhabit therein: Which are to fill up the Wonders of Gods Creation, having their several Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces known to the Creator, the which are not yet manifest to Mortals. Only thus much is revealed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth to be known, that these E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary Spirits do Cooperate and Qualify with the Elementory Nature of Man, both for Good and Evil, according as the Propensity of the Mind doth either way incline. But we shall leave this Mystery till the One Everlasting Element shall stand open, for unvailing these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; and so proceed to let you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32808:12"/>
know the State of such as depart out of this Body: Which I am to order according to their several Ranks and Degrees. The First I have already mentioned, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of the Body in the Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Spirit. The Second Sort is such as are Ignorant of God, and of their own Eternal Being, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no further than to an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Animal, and Rational Life, in which they are swallowed up; yet do darkly see something beyond, Believing in God and Christ Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, and are convinced by the Light of Nature that they stand in need of a Saviour, and so falsly do take hold of him. These when they dye, pass no higher than the Airy Region, where they are to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide till they receive power and strength to mount higher: For in these Elements, the Proper rest is not Found. Now for the Third Degree of Souls, they are those
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32808:13"/>
that are more knowing and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in GOD, and CHRIST, who being truly Convinced of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity and lost Estate, and of the necessity of Redemption, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come off clearly from the World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Principle, sticking in the outward Birth, so as they cannot pass through the strait Gate of the New Birth of Regeneration; and yet do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing entertain hopes of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through CHRIST, that at Death they may presently enter without more a do into the Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. In which Millions of Souls are deceived: For they that are of this Rank and Sort, have but some what an Higher Degree in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Regions, where their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle and Mansion must be, till time shall wear out all of the gross matter of the Impure Elements. And as they feel not much Pain, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony, or Sorrow, so but little Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or Joy; because they cannot
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32808:13"/>
reach the Vision of God. But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption will operate in these, and and work through great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction, and Reflection, for the lost time and opportunity which hath been missed to gain an higher State.</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. But here a Query may be put concerning the Fiery Soul that is Eternal, and breathed forth from God, and found to lye hidden in the Unregenerated Persons: For it may be asked, where this Divine and Pure Spirit doth go upon their Decease? In answer to this we give you to understand, according to what hath been in the Divine Magia made known, that the Supream Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to God, that introduced it into the Elementary Body. So that God takes that which is his own to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For this is an high graduated Spirit that doth belong to the Soul, and that being smothered and stifled
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32808:14"/>
by the contrary Principle, never came into any Dominion to suppress and reign over the opposite Nature. And so with relation to this God said of the old wicked World, that his Spirit should no longer strive with Man. So that the Soul, which never was renewed and Born again, may go into Deprivation and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, together with the Astral and Elementary Part, for a known and limited time; till that which is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary shall be Refined and Transmuted. When therefore the set time shall come, for God to move and Open the One Element, that shall transmute all Elements into it self, then the New Creation of pure Coelestial Bodies in every Region will be made manifest. But here I must stop my Pen, for the Mystery of both Living and Dead is so hidden, and deep, that the Holy Ghost bringeth to light a new Record, which this present Age
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32808:14"/>
cannot well bear, or understand. Nor will it be, until there come a breaking off from the old Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Knowledge, and a weaning from the Breasts of a strange Mother; that so they, as new born Spirits, may draw from the Eternal Word of Wisdom, fresh Unction, that giveth light unto the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by which the Counsel of the Most High is made known, and all the secrets that can be desired are manifested. Which leadeth on to the Four Heavenly Worlds.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. The first of these is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radisical World, the Inhabitants of which are such as have attained to a good degree of Regeneration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Born of the Spirit, and as have been partakers of the Baptism of Water, Blood, and Spirit for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation; that so thereby the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Paradisical World hath been opened in them, before they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32808:15"/>
depart out of the Body of Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which giveth them a swift passage to enter Paradise. Where as Plants they do spring and grow for an higher Transplanting into the Kingdom of <hi>Mount Sion.</hi> For it is very rare that any Souls do come up to be with CHRIST the Lord, immediately upon the departing from the Body. Though I do not say but some may reach to such a perfect degree of <hi>Christ likeness,</hi> as that when they Die, this Angelical World may stand open to receive them; and so being admitted into that high Glorification, may from Glory to Glory still be ascending, till at length they arrive to the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> State. And beyond this, there remains no more to pass into, but the inmost Place of Purity, which bears the Title of the <hi>Still Eternity;</hi> for that nothing but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Rest, Stilness, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is to be perceived here. Of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32808:15"/>
each of which Worlds there are some Particulars to be at this time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, from the Faithful Witness, that it may be discerned who they are that are made meet to inhabit them.</p>
            <p n="11">§ 11. It ought then to be known, how that those Souls that are Born of God, and so Renewed in every part, the whole Man being changed into a Deified Nature, must needs enjoy, and know beforehand the Joys and Pleasures of these Worlds to which they do belong, according to that degree which any in this Life-time do reach to. Such as are allotted for the Paradisical World when they Decease, will have it at some time or other open, while in the Body. For the Spiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty will qualifie most interiourly; so as the true Mystical Paradise puts forth its flowing Glory in the inward ground of a Renewed Mind.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32808:16"/>
So that this outward Principle, and evil World, preventeth not in the Holy and Heaven-born Souls, those pleasant Golden Springs from running, to Circle and Water every Plant, which by the Spirit of CHRIST hath been renewed. Therefore the Holy Trinity do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light often to manifest themselves in the Souls Paradisical Heart and Mind, as well Now as Hereafter.</p>
            <p n="12">§. 12. From hence it was given me to understand, that as the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Paradise, so also the Mystical <hi>Sion</hi> doth therewith also stand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the ground of this pure Heart, gradually shooting forth, and revealing it self in it. And concerning this more than Glorious World, the Kingdom of Christ, in which he with his Perfected Saints doth Reign, it is shewn me how the same Light and Pure Principle doth open it self in those Souls,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32808:16"/>
where the Paradisical, or Angelical Life doth spring Spiritually. For every World, or Principle, doth attract to it self its own, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto it: And the Powers and Influences of each are sensibly felt, according to the Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that any one is under. The vile and wicked sort are pulled and drawn by the Magick of the Dark World: But the Heaven-born Souls are inspired and qualified by these Upper Worlds, as by some is well known; so that <hi>Paradise,</hi> and the <hi>Mount Sion</hi> World, are manifested in their own Original Light in the Centre of the Soul. From which I do give a Description of these Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Worlds, as they were first o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened within; from whence Love, Power, Joy and Peace do spring, which maketh Heaven to be the Souls present dwelling with Christ, and all the Angelical Train, though not visibly seen, yet essentially enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32808:17"/>
But this is only to be known by Spirits that are deeply introver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and carried out and beyond a Creaturely Life: And when any worthy ones in this Light Principle shall be fixed, then expect we may, that the Eternal Powers will move and work through such, to whom the Dominion of Christ's Kingdom here below will be intrusted: For which we have many Scripture Prophesies, as in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> that do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly declare how it must, and will be given to the Saints of the Most High, to possess the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; of which there is also a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation by a Renewed Spirit of Prophesie, that doth assure us, that this Day is very nigh, and that it will be upon the World before they are aware of it. For as the Man of the Earth hath had his Ruling Day Universally, so shall the Lord from Heaven descend in such a manner
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32808:17"/>
into his own prepared Vessels here Below, in his Kingly and Priestly Power, as shall overturn and bear down all Earthly Powers, but of this we shall speak farther in the next Advance, or Remove up to the Third Court, or Principality of God the Father's Majesty: That is,</p>
            <p n="13">§ 13. The <hi>Jerusalem</hi> City, which is more Glorious and Magnificent than what hath yet been made mention of, far surpassing the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Two lower Blessed Worlds. As to the Walls and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of it, with the Gates that open into it, they are all so Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and full of Splendorous Light, that it is altogether impossible to make it out, even in any degree, according as it hath been exhibited and seen in the Spirit, in the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Figure of it, which yet represents it very much short of the

not only for Pleasure to my self, but for such as do love, and put on their Lord CHRIST in Deiformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and so as Conquerors pass through the Glassy Sea, to enter through the Gates, having this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty written upon their Foreheads.</p>
            <p n="14">§ 14. Now it remains to open the more Mystical Sense of the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Eternity of this Mother City, the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> that from the Father in Union with his Virgin Wisdom doth multiply, and so fill up that Principle with Virgin Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that are most perfectly Pure and Immaculate; whence it is that nothing beyond this, can any of the Redeemed ever arrive unto. Mount <hi>Sion</hi> Kingdom is most Great and Glorious, but yet inferior to this; because that is in the Mediatorship of Christ, but in this World all is compleated and finished. So that when this <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32808:19"/>
it will soon put this old, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and impure World to an end. But being able to give no more than a short and finite Description of this Infinite, Eternal and All-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious World, I am led on further to open the Mystery of it, so far as it relateth to this present Age, and to the Saints, who are to make up this City, and to bring their Glory to shine in it.</p>
            <p n="15">§ 15. Here now it may be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, <hi>Whether any Spirit or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in this Mortal World, can possibly be so clarified, as to become a part of that High Court of Eternity; seeing none must come there, but what have passed through those two Principles, namely</hi> Paradise <hi>and</hi> Mount Sion's <hi>Kingdom?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Answer.</hi> This is granted that it must be so, yet this is no Impossibility to the good-willing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32808:19"/>
and obedient, into whom these Heavenly Worlds will come down, and open, and diffuse their qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers, to make them meet to be partakers of this Jerusalem-world, as to its Spiritual Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality; which will enter Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a present most happy and blissful Fruition of GOD. This is not spoken only by a Revealed Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from the Heavens, which is witness great enough to confirm the Truth of it; but there is yet a more Evidence Where, and in Whom this City is already come down in its Purity and Brightness, though vailed to the Mortals here below. The Splendorous Deity may for a time under a shade of contemptible Humanity lye obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but Virgin Wisdom's Day will, by her bright <hi>Star,</hi> through the dark Pitcher of this Earthly Form shine forth; so as in this time of our Evening-tide her Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Light shall upon the Earth spread.</p>
            <p n="16">§ 16. But, methinks; this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meets me by the way, <hi>What is it that I mean by this Virgin Wisdom, that is the true Mother of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of this</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and who is the Princess of this Kingdom?</hi> Of the which I doubt not but to give to the impartial and pious Inquirer a true and right account, from the great knowledge hereof, which hath been freely communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and of the which I have therefore in some formerly <note n="*" place="margin">The Revelation of Revelations, <hi>p. 39, to 56.</hi> The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochian Walks, <hi>p. 26.</hi> The Laws of Paradise, in the Preface, &amp; <hi>p. II, 47.</hi>
               </note> Printed Books made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as also for that now, upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Four Heavenly Worlds, a fresh Stream of her Brightness hath circulated about my inward Mind; that so I might know and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32808:20"/>
understand what in her secret Deep hath hitherto lain hid, that to light and manifestation is commanded to be brought forth. The which Command for Publication I must obey, and all her Rules and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods observe. In the first place, we shall describe her Eternal Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginality, which is srom God the Tri. Un Deity, being a Virgin hid in Him from all Eternity, but as to her Nativity brought forth in Time, now I shall not speak in a Proverb, but plainly, as thus: God Created <hi>Adem</hi> at first to bear his own Image and Figure, who was to represent God himself, the High and Divine Masculine, Male and Female; so that <hi>Adam</hi> had his Virgin in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in imitation of his Creator, which in Time was brought forth in a distinct Figure, And this was a Type of the Eternal Virgin Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that lay hid in God, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre and Heart of Flaming Love;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32808:21"/>
from whence the production of a Glorious Female Figure was brought forth; that was so commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and mingled with Deity, as she became God's Spouse and Bride, being Spirit of his Spirit. Now be it known unto all, that from this Eternal Virgin Wisdom a new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Virgin Spirits shall be Born to make up the Glory of the New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> JESUS CHRIST being the Head, and the First-born of this Royal and Princely Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who was after the way and manner of Humane Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Womb of that Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that was but a Type of the Eternal Virgin, who brought forth the Son of God before all Time: But <hi>Mary's</hi> Womb was sanctified to bring forth in Time, that CHRIST who was the Son of God before all Time. And so the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Virgin Womb goeth on still according to Nature to bring forth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32808:21"/>
Wisdom's Off-spring, by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowing of the Holy Ghost, and the Qualifying Powers from the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> World.</p>
            <p n="17">§ 17. In the next place, I am to acquaint you what is the way of Bringing up, and the manner of Education, in which Virgin Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's Children are to be Manured and Disciplined; that as their Birth is great and high, being Heirs to the Father's Kingdom of Eternity, so they may have all those worthy Accomplishments suiting to the same, which are required. The chiesest of which, according as they have been revealed by the Spirit of Wisdom, shall be declared and made known. This then is the first Proviso or Caution which is given, that for as much as these holy Births are encompassed with an evil and sinful Principle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in great Danger and Temptation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32808:22"/>
doth lye, to prevent and hold down this Pure Thing from springing; therefore as soon as this Birth is, from whence its descent is with all high Graduations, it must deny and despise the Image of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinful Birth, by which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-born Spirit will be daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. For Christ the Lord was not exempted from Temptations, so Tried in like manner all must be, until the Conquest be wrought out. Therefore we are charged to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake our sinful Native Country and People of that sort, with our Father <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve's</hi> Family, and to return unto our first and antient Degree, as free Denizens of that City, of which God is the Light, and which Wisdom through the Eternal Spirit doth rule and govern in all Love-soveraignity. This then being premised, I come to give the Particulars after what manner Wisdom's Children are to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32808:22"/>
be Educated. In the state of their Infancy and Minority, as soon as they are Spiritually Born, care is to be taken that this holy Birth draw the sustenance of Life from no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than its own Virgin Mother, whose Breast must at all times sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and nourish it. For according to what it sucks in of such a Kind, Nature and Quality the Birth is, for it draws in the Spirit and Life of its Mother. Therefore watch to it, and hang not upon any strange Breast.</p>
            <p>Quest. Next it may be inquired, <hi>What kind of Cloathing this Royal Birth must have?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Though it be Born a pure Spirit, yet it must not be naked, and without a Body, for cloathing of such a sort as becometh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Wisdom's Princely Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. You will ask, What is that?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:32808:23"/>
I Answer, It is a pure and fine Robe made up of a Diaphanous Matter, from the One Eternal and Unmixed Element which can no more fade, as did the First <hi>Adam's</hi> Paradisical Body, that was, though Celestial yet Alterable, whence that withdrawing it self he became Naked; for he had then lost his Virgin Body, wherein his strength did lye. But now again Care is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the New Creation, that a Body be firly prepared for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the New <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Bride. But here it will be objected, that none so made Meet and Rarified in this Life-time can expect to be, so long as they are Cloathed with the Body of the Four Elements. In Answer to this, be it said, that the Corporeal Body is but an outside covering, as the Badgers Skin was a covering upon the Tabernacle Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Yet I must distinguish betwixt who are renewed and born into this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:32808:23"/>
Virgin Mind and Nature, and they who are Strangers to it, and know nothing of it, albeit capable of it, but for want of searching into their own Deep, where the Original Matter of it doth lye, they may, and do wear out their Cloaths, and go naked away, without being Cloathed upon with this Spiritual Body. Without which there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no getting up so high as to face the Throne Majesty, they must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in Centres of low Degree, till they can put on Christ's Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Body. Which is the Royal Robe that the Virgin Bride with all her Off-spring do appear in at the Festival Day, in which the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age shall be Solemnized. The First-fruits of it are given, as Tokens and Pledges to Wisdom's Children, by CHRIST now in the time of his Betrothment unto the Pure in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who keepeth their Virgin Mind undefiled, who will as a most inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:32808:24"/>
Lover make frequent Visits, bringing unto them choice and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Food, that the Espoused may Banquet with him; while the Cup of Love is still renewed, and filled as fast as it is drunk in. O is not this Ravishing Love of our <hi>Immanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> that doth make it out to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; considering that we are yet but in our Minority, and carrying the mean appearance of a Mortal Shade? From out of which such a Pull and Shake he will in his time give, as shall make the vile and gross Image which we bear to be more fine than the <hi>Ophir</hi> Gold, by the means of that Superior Element, that will with our Minds so Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie, and Commingle, as the Light, so as to arise thereby in a shining Lustre, for to come up unto the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Lord's Glory.</p>
            <p n="18">§ 18. Now having given you an Account of the Seven Worlds, with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32808:24"/>
the Inhabitants assigned to fill them up; I proceed on to the Eighth, which is the Beginning, and the Highest of all Worlds, called the <hi>Still Eternity.</hi> This there is no way possible for any one to describe, or give account of, but by being taken up into it. From which there is a freedom to give a Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to what hath been seen in this World by a Spirit thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Translated. It may be most properly entitled the Highest Court or Principality, of the Tri-Un Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. The Scituation of it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon an Abyssal Deep, where from an inaccessible Light doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and spread it self without bounds, as a vast Globe of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. God is here to be known and understood abstractedly from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature, as abiding in his own Simplified Deity, before either the Angels or other Creatures were Created. Here the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32808:25"/>
dwelt in the meek Stilness, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying themselves, before they brought forth any Image, or Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to themselves. For in this high and lofty Sphere no Figures of Glory could be seen, though great Powers did move here, and variety of Wonders did appear, sending forth a Majestick Awefulness.</p>
            <p n="19">§ 19. Q. But it may be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>What the Wonders of this World are, since there is nothing of Figure in it to be beheld; neither the Father, nor the Son. nor the Holy Ghost, in any Distinction for to be known?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is verily so; yet there is a Consubsisting of the Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in each other. The Fulness of the Godhead dwelleth here Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodily, with his Virgin Wisdom, and the Seven Spirits: All which do here open themselves from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Source; and from thence all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32808:25"/>
the Creating Powers do flow forth. For this is the Abyssal World, from whence all other Worlds were Created.</p>
            <p n="20">§ 20. Q. It may be further Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, <hi>What further Wonder did you here see?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> A glorious and wonderful Element was seen with numberless Sparks of Light: As this outward Air [or AEther] is full of Stars, so this Element was bespangled with Lights. Upon the Inquiry of the Spirit that was there caught up, what these might be? It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That all these were Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified Spirits, that were ordained to garnish that Globe, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend there the Tri-Un Deity, from whom they are Generated, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more watching the Eye, to see when it would send them forth to assume or take up Bodies; being
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32808:26"/>
all pure, meek and mild Spirits, which do perfect whatsoever and wheresoever they enter. These are the Spirits that will sublime, and make Bodies to become All-Divine.</p>
            <p n="21">§ 21. <hi>Q.</hi> Then was it further asked, by this Translated Spirit, <hi>Whence their Birth was?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It was Answered, From God the Father, in Conjunction with the Eternal Virgin Wisdom who brought them forth. Upon this I was advised, how that these Spirits are reserved in this High Globe, till Wisdom's Day upon this Visible World should as the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Star break forth. Then are they to go forth to multiply and make a Princely Host, God's Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders throughout all Nations for to display; that so this World of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and Mortaüty may see a more
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32808:26"/>
Happy Day, from the Operation of this Eternal and Meek Stilness, which will infuse their Powers, and qualifie with Souls, that from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Worlds were preordained to be Spirited after this kind, by the means of simple Abstraction; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the Production of these Pure and Eternal Spirits, that fill up this Globe of the Majesty of the Tri-Un God, who generated them out of himself, before the Creation of Angels, or of any other Beings. For these Spirits are the First-born from out of the Womb of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Virgin, as hid in God, before there was any Figurative Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station. They will enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore into holy Souls with such pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating Powers, as shall give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther habit of Mind, casting it into an Eternal Stilness, and quieting all the Working Properties in the Region of Nature: No awakening or stirring up there shall then be of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32808:27"/>
the Soulish Essence from its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Body; for that the Property of these Spirits is to do and act all in a still and silent way; and from thence the greatest Power and Force shall most effectually go forth. For it was told me that as these Spirits of Light, naked and unbodied, did fill up the Globe of the Unbodily Majesty in Trinity, so it should come to pass in the full Age of time, when Wisdom's First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born shall be made manifest, that this World, or Globe, should then descend, and open in the Virgin Off-spring of Wisdom. By whom alone the mighty Deeds and Works will be made apparent, so that it may be discerned that they are wrought in God only: All Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Actings of this kind will fall down as <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark, so that no dark <hi>Magia</hi> shall be able to stand. For in this Day all faces of a covering shall be rent away,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32808:27"/>
that so the true and right Acting Spirit may be known. Now in this new Modification, (which is a Passiveness in Spirit, Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so as no other motion of Life may be but from the Tri-Unity, that may beget pure and simplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits as numberless as our Thoughts) these holy, mild, and all-quieting Spirits may multiply in Souls accordingly prepared for them. For it hath been further shewed to me, that the very Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Mind should be all of a Deified Stamp, and of a most deep Engraving from the most High Majesty. Thus it is given to let you understand, that as from the outward Mortal Eye that doth spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the Objects and Things of this World, conspiring with the outward Ear which heareth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth them, so Thoughts do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise and multiply, according to Temporal Matters, and Concerns
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:32808:28"/>
of that kind; so likewise as these Spirits do proceed immediately from the Fountain Source of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, they seeing and beholding their Original Being, can do no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but contemplate, and delight themselves in, what the Eye of God doth see in them, and his Ear doth hear in them, having no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical Speech, but such only as is by pure Thought, whence they do generate according to what they see and hear in that Globe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which filleth them with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting Joy. Now be it known that when by the Holy Ghost the time shall be expired, for their descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Corporeal Beings, here, or elsewhere, in upper Mansions, their Eye shall become our Eye, their Ear ours; so that we seeing and hearing in them, to whom do stand open all Invisible Kingdoms and Worlds, with the great Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Glories in these, shall have
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32808:28"/>
Thoughts of a right kind to spring in our Minds; according to, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with the Objects presented, in as much as it quite turneth the Stream, making that which was formerly Downward and Earthy, now to become Upward and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. O Blessed Time and Day, when this Still Eternity shall thus open, and be made manifest in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreities! The which is given me to know will surely be. And it hath been revealed, that when these Spirits shall descend into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a Transfiguration so continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally impressing will be upon the Mind, for an incessant Generating of high and holy Cogitations, that are no less than the very Nature and Quality of these simplified Spirits themselves, as we being admitted hereby to look always into the Orb of Light and Love, and to fix there steddily the Eye of the Mind, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification may be brought down
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32808:29"/>
upon the Visible Elementary Body, while remaining here, at certain Seasons and Times of a more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Union and Commixture with these Powers of the manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, that so, as occasion may be, Mortality may be hid, or swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Immortality; to make good that saying, <hi>We shall not all Die, but be Changed, from Glory to Glory,</hi> by the bright influencing, namely, of these Spirits, through the Father of Spirits.</p>
            <p n="22">§ 22. Q But it may be here Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, <hi>Is not the Holy Ghost assigned for this great Change, and Work of Renovation? And where do we read in Scripture of such a Globe, or World, having such Spirits to inhabit in it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is true, the Holy Ghost is sufficient, as being so deputed and promised by the Lord CHRIST, for the perfecting of the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:32808:29"/>
or New Creation. But what if it be the all-wise designation, and pleasure of God, and his Eternal Wisdom, to separate such pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits from his own Fountain-source; thereby to effect the counsel of his Will, relating to his Lapsed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to put a new face of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon what is so deformed and vile, through the variety of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating Spirits and Powers, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately proceeding from himself? They are hence most meet to open the Depths, that lye deeper than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Creature; being brought forth before any Elements were in existence; for procreation of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the several Worlds: all of which, are to give place to that Superstructure and Building, which will be GOD himself, quite through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his whole Creation. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Seven Thousand Years may be expired, in the Miseries and Temptations of an Elementary
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32808:30"/>
Life, in this Outward, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Regions, yet what are these to a God, who is an Eternal Circle, which can never end? In the which Circle of a boundless Eternity, the Infinite and All-powerful God hath much more to do in all Worlds, than what hath been declared in Scripture, or yet by any other ways made known, finding all Prophesies and Revelations in Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, do extend no further than to the Limits of the Seventh Thousand Years Sabbath. What betwixt this Age, and that great Jubilee, will be successively produced, both in this our Visible, and in those Invisible Worlds that I have mentioned, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now be particularized: But in short, there will be for certain, most strange and wonderful Alterations, throughout the whole Globe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, for higher Admiration, than is yet conspicuous. For GOD is so full of an infinite Store, that he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:32808:30"/>
must bring forth himself in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual variety of Wonders. Let none therefore presume to set bounds to the Wisdom and Power of the Immense Being, to shut him up to this or that Measure or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Age or Time, who always moveth in Eternal Liberty; for the revealing, and making known the Counsel of his Will, and doth not pin up, or confine the worthy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers and Seekers of his Mind, from fathoming the Treasures of his Wisdom. Which are so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, as they are still to be renewed in every Generation, according as I my self have experienced in my Age of time, as the Volumes of my Writings do give witness to, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Revelation hath no cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that it is daily Renewed in Vessels, or Instruments, rightly qualified to receive it. Otherwise I could never have known what is here written; neither have been
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32808:31"/>
able to give any account of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Worlds, Regions or Centres, had they not been shewn to me. Therefore this is much preffed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, not knowing but that it may be the last Testimony that I have to leave behind me in this nature, to declare unto such as would know the Mind and Secrets of GOD: That a special Charge is given from the High Court of Eternity, that you do not stint your selves up to any foregoing Dispensation or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, no not to the Scripture Record it self: which though truly Weighty, and worthy to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, believed in, and comformed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; yet is not to be taken up in, and rested upon, as if there were nothing more to be revealed, for the Benefit and Instruction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Since the same Spirit that did Heretofore inspire the Holy Men of God to record them, is Now in this last Day more abundantly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32808:31"/>
shed forth to multiply Volumes of Scripture: For whatsoever is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dictated by the Holy Ghost, may be called by that Name; and so it was, before Christ's appearing in Flesh, by the Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; which was then succeeded by a Newer Ministration, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer being fulfilled in Him. This He promised should excel all that went before; for a more plentiful sowing of the sacred Unction, in the holy Ground of pure Hearts. The Sower hereof is, according to his Promises, gone forth; but where Stony, Thorny, and Unbelieving Ground is, it cannot enter so as to take root; which hath hitherto, for a long time, caused a great Scarcity, and Famine of the Spirit, with all its fruitfulness. But now the Day of the Spirit is arising, and its bright Sun will no more set, but multiply to its Seven-fold Light.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:32808:32"/>§. 22. Hear and Hearken, O <hi>England's</hi> Inhabitants, for unto you a great Light hath shined. O let it not cloud, and pass over you; but be ye wise in this your Day to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Spirit's bright-guiding Star, which is arising amongst you. O <hi>London,</hi> there is hid in thee them that have a true, and right Mission, from the Munition Rock, to give out the Waters of the Spirit plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. For a Cry there is gone forth, for persons to be Prepared and Sanctified, by this Water of Life; that so they may receive of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and be witnesses of his Power. Hear, and hearken in the Spirit: O hearken, and you will hear the Seventh Trumpet sound, from the Seven Spirits that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne; that do tell you, that the Mystery of time is now fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing; and that the Everlasting Gospel of the Love is opening; and and that the Heavens are ready to

            <p n="24">§. 24. Over thee, O City of <hi>London!</hi> a Mighty Angel doth fly, with this Thundering Cry, saying, Do not despise Prophesy, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry down the Ark of the Living Testimony; from which the Spirit, as a flowing Stream, must renew Paradise upon the Earth. And this Warning is given to all, of what Ranks or Degree soever, whether High or Low, whether in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grandeur, or in the private and inferious Means of this World: Even to you all; and every one, this Call doth reach;</p>

This is the Oyl that in Spirit I do see run: And I see that some in all Nations will herewith be shortly sprinkled, to give notice, that the Omnipotent KING is entering upon his Thousand Years Reign.</p>

Thus having, in Answer to that Grand Objection, to wit, How there should be any World, or Worlds, more than what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made mention of, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, that there is a successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit of Revelation, that is never to cease, but is more than ever to increase yet upon the Earth, as will in this very Age be known, and be witnessed: I must now draw to the Conclusion of this World, called the Still Eternity. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, I have this to declare, from what I was, when taken up into it, admitted to the knowledge of: I was then shewn, and taught these three Particulars, worthy to be observed. First, that no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance for Habitation is here found to any departed Spirit, though ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to never so high a Degree of Perfection. Nay it was said, that CHRIST himself, as the First-born from the Dead, and as Glorified in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32808:34"/>
our Humanity, did not ascend up hither. The Unity in the Godhead is always here, but not in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonality. For this Globe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Court is reserved; for a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Mystery then what is yet, to be made known: Only thus much I was, with respect to it, informed, that as out of this Still Eternity the Deity, in, and through the Eternal dilating Eye, did speculate his own Working Properties; for to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest himself in Nature, and thereby generate out of the Eternal Meek Stilness; the Creating Powers from the Trinity did go forth, to bring forth in the first place the Angelical World, furnishing it with Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirits: and so on did proceed to the rest of the above-mentioned Worlds. The Second thing we are to note is, that this shut-up Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and highest Court of the Tri-Un God, and of his Virgin Wisdom, with her offspring of Simplified Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:32808:34"/>
is not to be opened till the Will and Pleasure of God, the Creating Father shall be to move himself, through these mild, and pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; for some New Manifestation, and Modification upon what in the Created Worlds is found defective; that so, by a Renewed, Creating Power going forth in this manner, out from the Still Eternity; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother face of more excellent Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and more transcendent Glory, may, for an everlasting Fixation, come over that which under a Lapse, and an Apostacy hath been. But how finite and short is all that can be said, or even imagined, in comparison of those more amazing, and stupendous Charges, that still add to the Glory of God's Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, in his New Creation? As to the Third particular that we are to take notice of, which is, the Order, Union, and Equal Degree of these Spirits, in this Globe of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:32808:35"/>
we can but just hint at it. This Unity, and Coequality of theirs, is manifested by their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They are in their working Motion most Active; but all their Acts and Powers do go forth in a most profound Stilness, the Deity co-operating through them; by which an Influencing Stilness doth from them pass forth to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the other Worlds. And yet these Spirits remain all the while unmoveable, within their own Principle and Centre, moving according as the Deity glanceth forth in them with the Governing Eye, which giveth them their all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing Commission, the which, in a delightful Obedience, they never fail to execute; neither can they do otherwise, being unalterably Fixed in the Moving Power of the Holy Ghost.</p>

               <p>HAving now given a faithful, and true Description of these Eight several Worlds, not from Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, but from the revealed My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, according to the measure of the Communication of the Spirit of CHRIST; it remaineth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what Use and Application may be made, by the Readers of these deep and weighty things, that have been here Unvailed. In the first place then, we are hereby called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to consider, with the deepest humility, the efficient Cause, and Founder of these Worlds, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them all out of an Abyssal Deep, and an Eternal Nothingness. Secondly, We are called upon to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32808:36"/>
appropriate to God what is more Immense than Immensity, and Greater than all Greatnesses, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than all Heights, Deeper than all Depths, Perfecter than all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; who maketh his dwelling in an Eternal Circle of Love, Power and Wisdom, filling all these Worlds with the fulness of his Godhead, made manifest in the express Image of his Glory, namely, in the Second Number of the Three that bear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in Heaven. Thirdly, we are excited to consider, what we Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are, from whom our Descent is, and what manner of Spirit we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of, and exist by. For until we understand our own Eternal being, we cannot know God, the Being of all Being. For as we are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathed Soul from God, we live in his Effence. Which is the Glass through which we may see and know the invisible Deity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also know our selves, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:32808:36"/>
of the higher Principles, and Worlds above, as likewise of those Below. For they all Qualify with the Immortal, and also with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary, Part in us, for most wise, and wonderful Ends. O how great is the Mysterious Greatness of the Soul, that lieth vailed, covered, and unknown to it self? The Body of out ward sensibility thuts it up from understanding its own Power, as it is an Essence derived from God, and an out-flowing Breath from the Most High Majesty. The Earthy Life bindeth it down in all Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Christ</hi> in Spirit do enter in to make it free in his own Liberty, by quickening the Dead Effence of these Principles of Light, Love, and Power. And by this the Soul is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to its pre-existing and true Nativity in God; which is apt to be forgotten, if not continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in the Mind. In which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exercised, it will put, a check
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32808:37"/>
and awe upon it, from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of what it is, and to whom it must return, as to its Eternal Centre.</p>
               <p>Being come to the Conclusion of this Subject, I must be permitted, what I am in Commission for, from the High and Heavenly Court, to leave this word of Caution and Exhortation to all them who would full Redemption see, and would be glad to be set free from all fears, doubts, and concerns upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Watch against all Cavils, and Commotions that are apt to arise in the mind, by way of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the pure Inspiration of the Holy Spirit: O! grieve it not either in your selves, or in any other; remembring that you have it for a Counsellor and Comforter, and for a Key to open the Heavenly Worlds unto you, and to give you an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in them. The assurance whereof will be perfect Joy, Peace
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:32808:37"/>
and Glory, as some do truly witness, and do give it forth their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; who do therefore advise and exhort all, to whomsoever this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise may come, whether, in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in any more remote Places, where God is pleased to have it Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, that they seriously Study, and soberly Ponder, upon what, by the Wisdom of God, hath here been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and declared. For it is a Seal broken up, that doth belong to this present Age, wherein know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to increase, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the Great Day, that hath been Prophesied of, concerning the Daughter of <hi>Sion's</hi> Kingly Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>O come forth! be no longer hid, ye precious Stones of <hi>Sion,</hi> whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever scattered and dispersed: Whether near or far off, at Home or beyond the Seas, where-ever ye lye hid, come forth. To you the Golden Bells from the four Eternal
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:32808:38"/>
Worlds, do Sound out their Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, to draw you into them; where, as to your own People, and Native Countrey, ye may to the Feasts of Tabernacles come, sitting down together in Joy, and evermore ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating this Marriage Feast, in the Unity of Love, where the Author of this Treatise would in the Spirit meet, and so never cease to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate you, as fellow Citizens, and there to eat with you the Feast of Love.</p>

               <head>I. OF PARADISE.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1 INTO <hi>Paradise</hi> my Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doth first take its Flight, where all things are in good Order,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32808:39"/>
and the same flowing State, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adam</hi> had lost his Virgin Mate. Paradise is now stock'd again with such as have waded through the floating Sea of Sin and Mortality, in order to the putting on that Image of purity, which is to the Children of the Resurrection, given by JESUS. For not the least Guile or Fault may be found in any of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this place. My Spirit doth see here all in wonderful Harmony: And this Word was heard from the High and Lofty one, saying, With the Risen from the Dead I will dwell; though this Principle of Paradise be allotted to them for a certain time, to be a separated Mansion, until all be gathered up into the superiour Kingdom of <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and of the <hi>New Jerusalem.</hi> Thus did I hear the good news, that all is Rich and flourishing within the Paradisical Kingdom: Nor is there any decay since <hi>Adam's</hi> Day, but Increase
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:32808:39"/>
and Augmentation is daily through the Resurrection of the Spiritual Man.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. After this, the Spirit of Wisdom said to me, These things, whereof an account hath been given to you, may be declared of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Place of Paradise: Whereinto Spirits separated by Natural Death, putting off their Mortal Earthly Bodies, do enter; and there put on their Virgin Body. Which doth prepare them to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, who from thence fetcheth them up to <hi>Mount Sion.</hi> These are such, who in this very time, have fought the good Fight of Faith, and had very near overcome this World. What is lacking to make them fully Perfect,, is to be done in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disical place; where they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to stay till all their Bridal Trimming be finished, and they find that they can pass the Way to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:32808:40"/>
the Tree of Life, through the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Cherub, who remaineth still a Guard upon that Figurative Tree. In this place Holy Angels do also wait by their Course, to Minister unto those who do come here, as the Designed Heirs of that more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious State, which is revealed in <hi>Sion.</hi> This is some part of those good things, which doth belong to your Eternal Father; but now I shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to thee a further Mystery, which is, what may be entred upon in this very Life Time. <note n="a" place="margin">Laws of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad. conclusion.</note> For there is a Mystical Paradise as well as a Local, which Springs Metaphorically, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening from a pure Magical Centre. This will amount to thy present Peace and Joy. Wait, I say, to feel that now, that thy Spirit may give a Seal with me, that thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Anointing, and that thou dost walk with thy Spiritual Man
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:32808:40"/>
in this Paradise; where thou often dost hear the Eccho of thy Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's Voice, calling thee still, to hast the getting on all that which will make thee look Sweet and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable in his Eyes, and the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fragrant Sweets that may perfume and scent thee; that so all thy Garments may smell of these Beds of Spices, upon which thou mayest stretch thy self. Here a while confined be to dwell, after the manner of a Spirit in a Spiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, till thou shalt all of this Visible Orb overcome, and much excel all Creatures in it, as having the Tree of Life to live upon. Which is that which will airify, and put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee a most Transparent Body; for they who do daily feed upon it, shall be in good deed transmuted by it. Behold to thee this Gate of Paradise doth stand open, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever of the things of God is there, thou hast a right, not only to know,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:32808:41"/>
but them as thy own to Enjoy. But this word of Caution to thee is given, that thou take heed unto the <hi>Laws of Paradise,</hi> which have been in particular given to thee for this end. Observe them, and thy JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS will here frequently talk with thee, and shew himself, according to the Loves Betrothment, that is made afresh with thee in this <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi> This is what many Years ago was to me Communicated, and Recommended by the Spirit of Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. As I was, upon the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>October,</hi> in this present Year 1695. watching upon a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Friends account, after some time, I found she had passed through the Elementary Regions. Then Paradise being open'd, I search'd for her, and after about two Hours, I found her in the Third Degree of this Heavenly World, who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:32808:41"/>
to me of a most Lively and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Countenance. As soon as I had met her, I congratulated her, and said, I have been a long while seeking to find you. To which she Answer'd, very well you might; for I have been so taken up with the Variety of the Pleasures of this Place, that I had forgot all my Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Friends. Then she added, after a short pause, O my Friend, the Death which I feared, and that kept me in Bondage all my Life long, has been my Friend to set me free; and its Seing that I dreaded, became nothing less than a Living Balsam; by which now in Trumph I can say, Mortality is swallow'd up in Joy and Glory. To which I Replied, Did not I often tell you this, and that I would venture my own Soul for yours, as to the Security of it? Upon which she smiling said, Now I find it so to be. And so seeming to be unwilling to entertain
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:32808:42"/>
any further Discourse with me, as if thereby she was held from a better Enjoyment, she left me.</p>
               <p n="4">§. 4. Upon which, I was exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in some Meditation, and it was thus concluded, That Persons who did live very circumspectly and watchfully, in all Piety in their Life-time, as this Person had done, though void of all sensible Assurance, and Comfort of God's Favour, while they live, as if they did not live; but are estranged from this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary Body while they are in it; do, when they pass out of it, obtain a swift passage through the Elements, which are not able to cleave to, or detain them long, but are swallow'd up, and chang'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Paradisical Body. Which is a good Motive to incite all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to live above the Earthly Life; that so nothing may stick to them, when they go out of this World.</p>

               <head>II. MOUNT SION.</head>
               <p n="1">§. 1. Now from hence the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Man must make another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, to see what doth lye for him beyond this Region or Principle, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Precious Things that do flow from that Rich Ocean, which is betwixt Paradise, Mount Sion, and the New Jerusalem. This is that Glassy Sea, that is spoken of by the Beloved <hi>John,</hi> upon which the Conquerors are seen Singing their Songs of Triumph; and it doth Compass round the City, where is the Residence of the Great King, the Throne of the Lamb, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Sealing Powers, or Fountain-Spirits of God, that do go forth from the most Holy One. Now this burning Sea is for Probation; there being none able to pass it, but they who have gotten a full, perfect, and thorough, Conquest over this Beast,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32808:43"/>
and over his Image; so as they no thing more of this Mark do bear. They, and they only, can stand here; because they are Signatured from this flaming Glassy Sphere, that will make Bodies clear, and shining, as terrible Chrystal.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. This Kingdom of <hi>Moun Sion,</hi> where is an Innumerable Company of Angels, with the Church of the First-Born, and in which are contained all the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and living Patterns of what was Copied out by <hi>Moses,</hi> who had a sight of them, must open it self, and be Established, before the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> can come down, either Invisibly or Visibly. There is a necessity for the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial and Priestly Kingdom to go before, and make way for that.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Yet there is such a near &amp; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Correspondency between these

For that the Supream Majesty doth often come down hither, and the whole Grand Assembly which is here, do at certain seasons ascend up into the <hi>New Jerusalem;</hi> so that from the strict Union that is betwixt them, it is not to be wondred at, if sometimes the Name of the one be applied to the other.</p>

It was further declared to a Spirit caught up here, That in the Time of the Accomplishment of the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> Glory Below, there should be appointed certain Keepers of the Everlasting Gates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, most highly Spirited, to let in, and shut out, according to the Laws of this Kingdom; and that every such Angel of these Gates should sound forth his Trumpet.

Therefore Arise, Arise, ye Virgin Daughters, and draw near, having this Name inscribed upon you with the Finger of your God; and having your Twelve Foundations, according to the number of the Precious Stones of the Holy Oracle, made clear and sure in you; being all that which is to make up the Honour of your <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> Glory: Draw near now, ye Virgin Daughters of <hi>Sion</hi> that lye hid, and bring your Glory to this City;</p>

The Apostolical Name of the Lamb is here written upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gate, for the surviving Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Apostolical Spirits, to obtain admittance by. None can enter through the Gates, but these Virgin Spirits, who have before stood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and passed through the <hi>Sea of Glass;</hi> being the Living Jasper Stones, that are all covered upon with the flaming of Colours the Covenant-Rainbow. Such therefore must ye be, Oye Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem-waiters, and Children of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! And by her Stone within you, ye must come to be touched and changed, rhat ye may be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all these Flaming Stones. Be of good chear, for this Ruby Stone is as a Cherub, at work in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spheres of some that are known by Name, in order to this great and mighty Transmutation. Wherefore it is given me to advise you, that you give way to this Live
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:32808:45"/>
Goal within you, that so it may burn away all the Dross and Tin, so as nothing but the Golden Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for Coagulation with the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may remain upon this Almighty and most Sublime Thing, that is concealed in your Inward Furnace. Do ye still wait upon Ministring Fuel to it, that your Fire may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go out? Do ye still take out from the Pool of Golden Oyl; which will then make you come to that Heighth, as even to a Perfect Jasper Purity; which will, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it toucheth, turn into its own Source, Light, and Power? This is the White Stone, to which the Bride of the <hi>New Jerusalem</hi> will be joyned, and which will be hung in her Crown. Therefore after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less, ye beloved ones, do ye aspire: And say not in your Hearts, How can this be? Let that be cast upon your God's All-sufficiency, that by Wisdom's Stone will do
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:32808:45"/>
High, Mighty, and Marvelous things, through them, with whom it shall be found, that only shall have the honour of bringing the <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> down, to be seen within this Orb. For in such in whom the Stone of Wisdom is sown, and grown up, are the Lookers, and the Expectors to see this wonderful Time. Others who believe nothing of it, will stand without this City, amongst the Worshippers of the Beast; none of whom can Traffick, or Merchandize amongst the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Foundation Stones. Which are the Purchase of the Lamb, for his Conquering Tribe, to follow after him, with Palms of Victory over all fears and doubts, that spring from Unbelief; which hath kept numberless out, and stopped their Ascending up hither.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. Now to you, who through the Agate Windows of this walled
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32808:46"/>
City are given to look in, know that it is granted for no other end, but to take your Eye, and to draw your whole Spiritual Body herein: It is not to Tantalize you, or to let you see only the Tree of Vertue, and not hereof not touch, nor tast; but ye are evermore to live upon it. When ye, as fixed Inhabitants, shall no more go out, this Tree will be Food of most high Virtual Strength, Power, and Spirit. This Word then I will only drop, and leave with you, to wait in pure Love Patience, till for this last Remove, the Stone Within do Compleat you, through its All-Tincturing Power.</p>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:32808:46"/>
into an High Region, that was all Calm and Still, where I saw no Figures or Images: But there was a wonderful Light which Flowed into me like a River. Then it was opened in me, that this was the Creating Light, from whence all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings did proceed; &amp; that what was now expected as a New Creation, must be brought forth from the Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Light, with which the Soul's Essence must be Mingled: And that from this Union the Variety of the Wonders should be produced in the World.</p>
               <p n="2">§. 2. It was further said to me, that I had been long driven to hit the furthest Centre of all Centres, but the Plummet Line of my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, was too short to Fathom that deep Gulf, which was in a <hi>Visional Figure</hi> some Years ago shewn to me. This being led by the Spirit to call to mind, there came before
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32808:47"/>
mine internal Eye a Deep Abyss, that opened it self, and Streamed forth, with such a commixture in all variety of Colours, of Precious Stones, so dreadfully Sparkling and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that no other, but a simple and abstracted Spirit, could behold it, and much less enter into, and so be Mingled with it; according as I was both times invited and called to.</p>
               <p n="3">§. 3. This Second time it was renewed to me, by an <hi>Internal O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening;</hi> from which it was given me to understand, that this God-head-Gulf, was now broken up, for a Streaming forth with that high mixed Matter, which would Deify, and Tincture the Soulish Essence that had been under the Depravity. Then it was said to me by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that this was the true and right Baptism, into the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost; by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:32808:47"/>
which the Soul would return to its first Original, and then would know it self to have Power in GOD, as his Virgin Heart and Spouse, to do and act agreeable unto so high an Unity. This is the Summity of all Depths that can be searched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Do but study this, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Abyssal World will, from its Stilness, come to Qualify with, and Operate in you, in order to the wished-for Transmutation. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by will you into all Wisdoms's Treasures be admitted, and the Walls about your habitation shall be the Rock of Fire-Stones, in which Munition Strength, your Hiding shall, be as in God's ownSecrecy until you, go forth to Proclaim another Day of PENTECOST.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO A QUESTION, WHICH By a Noble and Worthy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer was, upon his own Experience, sent to be RESOLVED.</head>
            <p>To Answer a Query, <hi>Why such Departed Souls that are detained in the Middle Regions do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attract, and draw their near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Friends to be with them?</hi> This you must know, proceeds from
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:32808:48"/>
a most intimate Unity that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them while Living; whence not having Center'd their Loves higher than what was Elementary, the Deceased may have much power to draw away the Life of such out of the Body: Of which kind some Instances have been known. Let this therefore be a good Caution, to all dear, and near Relations, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry up their Love to one another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what is but Creaturely. But this know, that no Departed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit can have any force or power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Living, without they be such as are of Low Birth, under the Laws and Rudiments of this World; and the Constellations of the Starry World: But as for them, who are got up higher, by the supernatural Birth, they are out of danger to be reached by any Departed Spirits; For such are above their Influence, as making GOD their Centre on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:32808:49"/>It hath been shewed to me also, that there is a great Congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the highest Degrees of Saints, departed into the <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Principle; with such here as have attained to that high Birth, which can reach their Principle. Now this sort act quite after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind, they do not so much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet to draw them out of the Body, as to Influence, and bring down their Gifts and Powers into Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation, in, and through those whom they stand in such Love-U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with. These Perfect Spirits in the Separated order do well know, and take notice, who are most fitly Qualified, though in Bodies E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary, for Immersement vvith them, and do thereby communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and disperse the Light of New Revelations into this Lower Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; that so the Inhabitants herein may come hereby to Enlightened and Transformed.
