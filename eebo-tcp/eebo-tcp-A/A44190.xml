         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Papers of the
famous Lord <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
Your Great Uncle, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to fall into my Hands,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:98370:4"/>
I could not long deliberat
whether they deserv'd a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
View, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to get them printed
without any further Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
for the large share he had
in the Transactions of those
Times will as much engage
others to read these Memoirs,
as the Defence he was oblig'd
to make for himself are a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Reason for his writing
them. But when I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that Your Grace (out
of the Love You bear to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Actions, and Your Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
towards so near a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
did order a stately Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
to be erected at <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>
for this Illustrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:98370:4"/>
I was of opinion, that as
well for that Reason, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in his Life-time he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
an extraordinary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and Esteem for You,
Your Name should in like
manner be inscrib'd on this
Monument which he has left
of Himself to Posterity. The
Justice of the thing, and the
Sincerity of my Intentions,
must be all my Apology to
Your Grace for this Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for the Public (of
whom You deserv'd so well,
and particularly in appearing
early, like Your Noble An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
for the Liberty of
these Nations) will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
it an Obligation; nor,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:98370:5"/>
if any thing should chance to
be amiss, can I doubt but an
easy Pardon will be granted to
one who is, tho unknown,
my Lord, with so profound

humble Servant.</p>

            <p>SUch as really desire to know the
naked Truth, and propose for their
chiefest aim the common good (which
are certainly the best, tho not the greatest
part of Mankind) have ever exprest a
desire in their Writings of seeing the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs
of all parties made public, as the
most effectual means of framing a true
General History: For in those places
where nothing is licens'd to appear but
what visibly tends to the advantage of
one side, there can be no sincere represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Affairs, the basest Cowards must
pass for the bravest Heroes, the worst of
Villains for the greatest Saints, the most
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:98370:6"/>
Ignorant and Vicious for Men of Learning
and Virtue, and the Enemies of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
for its Preservers and Friends. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
consulting therefore the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
or reputation of any Faction, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the benefit of <hi>England</hi> in general,
these Memoirs of the Great Lord <hi>Holles</hi>
are communicated to the World, that by
comparing them with those of <hi>Ludlow,</hi>
and such as appear'd before, or will be
publish'd hereafter relating to the same
times, they may afford mutual Light to
each other; and, after distinguishing the
personal resentments or privat biasses of
every one of 'em, the Truth wherein
they are all found to agree (tho drest by
them in different Garbs) may by som im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
and skilful hand be related with
more candor, clearness, and uniformity.
What figure our Author made in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and in the Wars, at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
in his privat and public Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
is generally known, and needs not
therefore be mention'd in this place. The
account he gives of himself in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:98370:6"/>
Papers is confirm'd by many li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Witnesses, as well as in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part by other VVriters of the same
Transactions. But whether the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
of his Stile, the barbarous Usage
he receiv'd, his concern for the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Party, and his Displeasure
at the King's misfortunes (to whom he
was then an adherent and a friend) have
not guided his Pencil to draw the lines
of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Face too strong, and the
shadows too many, I refer to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the disinterested Reader, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him to allow all that is reasonably due
to one in these or the like Circumstances.
This caution iustice has oblig'd me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert:
For as to that tyrannical Usurper
of the Supreme Administration, who prov'd
so ungrateful to the Commonwealth, so
treacherous to the King, and so fatal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,
I think him bad enough painted in his
own true Colours, without standing in
need of exaggerating Rhetoric to make
him look more odious or deform'd. I should
write something here likewise with relation
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:98370:7"/>
to General <hi>Fairfax,</hi> but that the properest
place for it seems to be in a Preface to his
own MEMORIAL, which is in good
hands, and, it's hop'd, may be shortly expos'd
to public view. How far soever King
<hi>Charles</hi> the First's Enemies in <hi>England</hi>
may look on themselves disoblig'd, or any
of his Friends neglected by my Lord <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
the <hi>Scots</hi> are surely beholding to
him; for in his long Panegyric on that
Nation, he has said more in their behalf
than their own Historians have ever been
able to offer. But in this and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the like nature we shall not antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
the Readers Curiosity or Iudgment:
I shall therefore only acquaint him, that
tho this Piece be entitul'd <hi>Memorials</hi>
from the History it contains, yet in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
it is an Apology for that Party who
took up Arms, not to destroy the King, or
alter the Constitution, but to restore the
last, and oblige the former to rule accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

if you have not Grace to pray

            <p>1. THE wisest of Men saw it to
be a great Evil, that Servants
should ride on Horses, and
Princes walk as Servants on
the Earth: An Evil now both seen and
felt in our unhappy Kingdom. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Men, the basest and vilest of the
Nation, the lowest of the People have got
the Power into their Hands; trampled
upon the Crown; baffled and misused the
Parliament; violated the Laws; destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or supprest the Nobility and Gentry of
the Kingdom; oppress'd the Liberties of
the People in general; broke in sunder
all Bands and Tyes of Religion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
Duty, Loyalty, Faith, common
Honesty, and good Manners; cast off all
fear of God and Man; and now lord it
over the Persons and Estates of all sorts
and ranks of Men from the King on his
Throne, to the Beggar in his Cottage:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98370:10"/>
making their Will their Law; their Power
their Rule; their hairbrain'd giddy phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
humour, and the setting up of a <hi>Babel</hi>
of Confusion, the end of all their Actions.
But how this misery is befallen us, the
Kingdom brought so low, and so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
unhappily, inconsiderately deliver'd
over into such base and ignoble hands, the
Parliament abused, betrayed, and now
become in show and in name the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Tyranny, but in truth it self
made nothing; and (if the presence of the
right Speaker be so essential to the being
and acting of a Parliament, and so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
that Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> says in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
the House cannot sit without him)
then is there clearly at this present no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
but an Assembly of Men, acted
and moved by the Art and Malice of some
few sitting among them, by the means of
an Army, which those few, those Vipers
of the Parliament, that have eaten out the
Bowels of their Parent and destroyed her,
raised (that is, abused the Parliament, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them raise it) under colour of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the preservation of the Parliament
and Kingdom; when in truth it was out
of a design to make themselves Masters of
both, that neither of them might ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
Peace and Liberty more, to blast
our Hopes, nip all the fair Blossoms of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98370:10"/>
Reformation, dash in sunder all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
and endeavours for the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a happy Peace; and so a glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
Morning became a Day of darkness,
a Day of treading down and perplexity:
this, I say, will be worth the enquiry, and
perhaps be no difficult thing to discover,
and make so plain, that he who runs may
read.</p>
            <p>2. Yet I would not be conceived to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
so much of Wisdom and Foresight to
these Men, as to believe they had laid this
whole Design, with the several Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and Steps of proceeding from the
beginning; which not the Devil himself
was so politick and foreknowing as to have
done. But I am perswaded that they had
it in their general Aim, and laid it as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for all their Superstructures, to do
as much mischief as they could, make the
Disorder as great, the Change as universal
as was possible, and still to improve all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
and occasions <hi>ex re natâ,</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on for more as they prevailed in any
thing, till at last even beyond what either
they could hope, or we could fear, their
Design was brought to this perfection, as
will appear by the sequel of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>3. When in the beginning of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
in the Year 1642. after some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
in a Parliamentary way to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98370:11"/>
of many of our Grievances, and
reforming many Abuses both in Church
and State (for which we were not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
thankful) it pleased God, in his just
Judgment, for the punishment of our Sins,
to send a Spirit of Division between the
King and the Parliament, and things grew
to that height, as both of them appealed to
the Sword to plead their Cause, and decide
their Quarrel; the Members of Parliament,
who then engaged, declared themselves to
desire nothing but the settlement of the
Kingdom, in the honour and greatness of
the King, and in the happiness and safety
of the People: And whensoever that could
be obtained, to lay down the Sword, and
submit again to the King's Scepter of Peace
more willingly than ever they resisted his
Force and Power. This I am sure was the
ultimate end of many, I may say, of the
chiefest of those who at that time appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
upon which principle they first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and from which they never departed;
which made them at that time resolve to
put their Lives into their hands, and offer
them a Sacrifice to the welfare and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of their Prince and Country. I say
Prince as well as Country, tho he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
look'd on them as his greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
but they consider'd him as their
Prince, whom Nature, Duty, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98370:11"/>
of God, and the Laws of Men, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them to reverence, and to love as the
Head and Father of the People; whose
greatness consisted in his People's, and his
People's in his; and therefore neither could
be great, nor happy, one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which made those faithful ones put
them both in the same Ballance, and rather
adventure his displeasure by promoting the
publick Cause, than (as they thought) his
ruin by deserting it.</p>
            <p>4. Whilst these Men acted in the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of their Hearts, there was another Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Men, which, like the frozen
Snake that lay in their Bosoms, seemed to
desire but the same things with them, and
that the same should have contented them,
when it was nothing so; but they had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Designs, to destroy and cut off not
a few, to make the Land an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the King, and as many of the Nobility
and Gentry as they could, alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
have no order in the Church, nor
power in the State over them. This was
the Venom they harbour'd, which at first
they were not warm enough to put forth:
But it soon appeared by some evident Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
which discovered it to discerning
Eyes, though many were very long abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
For as the Devil can transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into an Angel of Light; so they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98370:12"/>
Zeal in Religion, and to be publick
Spirits, as if none were so holy and self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
as they: and so insinuated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the good Opinion of Men; and,
being bold and forward, got into all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
engrossed the whole managing
of the War (that is, the directive part
of it, not the fighting) whilst others, who
meant plainly, and honestly, went into
their several Countries, desirous to see the
business soon at an end; and, either by
shewing the Sword, to have kept it in on
both sides, or else, if God had otherwise
determin'd that some Blood must be drawn,
to adventure their own for speedy stopping
the issue of it in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>5. This was the first step of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Mens getting into power. When
other Gentlemen of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
unluckily left it upon these occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they then undertook the business, put
themselves and their Creatures into all
Committees, persons most of them before
only known by their Faces, and esteemed
for their Silence and Modesty. But they
soon grew Bold and Impudent, domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not only over the rest of the House,
but much more over others abroad, and by
their Pride and Insolency contracting En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and Hatred to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:98370:12"/>
6. By this means they had power over
all the Money of the Kingdom, pleasured
and recompensed whom they would, which
were none, be sure, but their Creatures,
or such as would be theirs; and so made
many Proselytes both within doors and
without, increasing their Party exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which made them carry the business of
the House as they would themselves: and
made it easie to them, in all Debates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
applications for Peace, to drive us
to extremities, demanding unreasonable
things, laying upon the King the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>Naash,</hi> to thrust out his right Eye
for a reproach; or, as the Devil did to our
Saviour, to have him fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
them, lay his Honour at their Feet,
his Life at their Mercy; while they, upon
all occasions, revile and reproach him, give
countenance and encouragement to all the
bitter, scurrilous and unseemly Expressions
against him, impeach the Queen, give her
the usage (both in words and actions) one
would not have done to the meanest Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
of the Kingdom, tho the Wife,
Daughter, and Sister of a King, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of our Prince, who is to sit upon the
Throne, if these Men hinder him not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and all this, to make the distance wide,
the wound deep, that there might be no
closing, no binding up. Then was there
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98370:13"/>
nothing but expelling Members out of the
House on the least information. If any of
those Whelps did but bark against any one,
and could but say he was busie in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
nothing but sequestring, impeaching
of Treason, turning Men and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
turning Wife and Children to starve:
so many Committees and Sub-Committees
of Examinations, Sequestrations, fifth and
twentieth part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made in City and
Country, and some of the most factious,
busy, beggarly men put in, as fittest Tools
for such Masters to work by, to rake Men
to the Bones, and take all advantages to
ruin them.</p>
            <p>7. This was a great breaking of heart
to all honest Men, especially to those in
the House, who being present and Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses
of the management of Affairs,
easily discovered the drift of these persons,
and opposed it all they could: which
made those Blood-suckers conceive a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
hatred against them, and in truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as those who had too
great an interest, and too large a stake of
their own in the Kingdom, to ingage with
them in their Design of perpetuating the
War to an absolute confusion.</p>
            <p>8. This made them look with a jealous
Eye upon my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> who was Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Army, finding him not fit for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98370:13"/>
their turn, as too desirous of Peace, and of
maintaining Monarchy; and therefore they
resolve to lay him aside, beginning to draw
Supplies from him, neither providing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits,
nor furnishing him with Money or
Arms, (except sometimes for a pinch, when
the necessity of their own preservation
required it) clogging him all they could,
countenancing and supporting who ever
did oppose him: In the mean time carrying
on the business of the House in a wild mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
making Ordinances, like <hi>Draco</hi>'s
Laws, written in Blood, that no Man
could be safe whom they had a mind to
destroy, and their mind was to destroy all
they could, by making so many desperate,
to render things more irreconcileable, and
cut off all hopes of Peace, which they were
resolved to put by upon any terms, <hi>per fas
aut nefas,</hi> if not by art and cunning, rather
to use force than fail, and where the Fox's
Skin would not reach, to take the Lion's;
as to give one Instance for all.</p>
            <p>9. The House of Lords in the Summer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the beginning of our Troubles in 1643,
having resolv'd to deliver themselves and
the Kingdom from this <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Slavery,
had prepared a Message to the King, with
Overtures for an Accommodation, and sent
it down to the House of Commons on a
Saturday, where the major part seemed to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98370:14"/>
be of the same mind, and after a long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
and much opposition prevail'd to take
it into consideration, made an entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, agreed to some particulars, and it
growing late, adjourned the further debate
till Monday morning; against which time
these Firebrands had set the City in a flame,
as if there were a resolution to betray all
to the King; and thereupon brought down
a Rabble of their party, some thousands
to the House of Commons door, who gave
out threatning Speeches, and named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves (but so as they might be
heard) some Members of the House, whom
they said they lookt upon as Enemies, and
would pull out of the House; which did
so terrifie many honest timorous Men, and
gave that boldness to the others, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all order they resumed the Question
that was settled on Saturday for going on
with the business, and at last carried it by
some Voices to have it laid aside: which
was the highest strain of Insolency, the
greatest violation of the Authority and
Freedom (the two essential Ingredients) of
a Parliament that before that time was ever
known. Since, I confess, the Army has
far outstrip'd it.</p>
            <p>10. This made some persons cast about
how a stop might be given to such violent
proceedings, and to have other Counsels
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98370:14"/>
admitted, which probably would give some
allay to those sharp and implacable Spirits:
It appearing to be altogether impossible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to obtain a Peace, whilst they were Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
who <hi>Phaeton</hi> like, were able to set the
whole World on fire. It was therefore
proposed that our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi>
might be called in, who were known to be
a wise People, lovers of Order, firm to
Monarchy: who had twice before gone
through the misfortune of taking up Arms,
and wisely had laid them down; still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
themselves with that which was
necessary for their security, avoiding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.
Their wisdom and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as was presumed, might then have
delivered us from that precipice of misery
and confusion, into which our Charioteers
were hurrying us amain.</p>
            <p>11. But these Men would none of it at
that time; they hoped to be able to carry
on the Work themselves, and meant to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
all the Spoil: which they had done if
it had not pleased God to give them that
check in the West, when their Army there
was beaten through Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig</hi>'s
default, one of their invincible Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
First, his ignorant foolhardiness, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
his baseness and cowardise, who
then found himself to be mortal (for before
he thought himself invincible, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98370:15"/>
Stick-free and Shot-free, having had
the good Fortune to be in a gallant Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
under Sir <hi>William Balfore,</hi> at <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>-Field,
and so not to run away) but, as
himself did afterwards relate it, wink and
strike, and bear down all before him.
This made him so absolute a Souldier, as
he thought Christendom had not his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and therefore would not be govern'd
by his Commander in chief, in that Western
Brigade, a gallant and discreet Gentleman;
but would charge contrary to order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sense or reason: and, finding that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
which he did not expect, ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
as basely with all the Horse, leaving
the Foot engaged. Presently afterwards
the Town of <hi>Bristol</hi> was lost by the like
Gallantry and good Soldiery of another of
their Champions, who for it was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to die by a Council of War, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
by my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> who was well
requited for it afterwards both by this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
and his Father.</p>
            <p>12. Then our Masters, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be mortal too, began to be afraid;
and now the <hi>Scots</hi> must be called in. So
in all hast they send to them to come and
help, with open Cry, <hi>Save us, or we perish.</hi>
They promise any thing, offer any thing,
do any thing for the present that the <hi>Scots</hi>
would have them do: The Honour of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98370:15"/>
not thought of, Liberty of Conscience
and the godly Party not mentioned: But
all that was heard was the Covenant, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity
in Church-Government, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Nations, never to make Peace
without them, and a solemn Treaty for all
this closed there, and presently ratified by
the Parliament here.</p>
            <p>13. But they meant afterwards to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with them, to perform nothing of
what was <hi>de futuro</hi> to be done, to serve
their turns by them, to make them instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
for their deliverance at that plunge,
and then pick quarrels with them and send
them home again with scorn and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
which they have since sufficiently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to do, and went far towards it, and
to the engaging of the two Kingdoms in
Blood; if some persons had not interposed
with more ingenuous and more moderate
Counsels, to the happy success of whose
Endeavours the piety, honesty, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves did very
much contribute, concurring with them,
and cooperating in all things which might
promote a Peace, as shall be afterwards
shewed in its due place: for this is but by
the way.</p>
            <p>14. Those Creatures of theirs whom they
sent Commissioners into <hi>Scotland</hi> for that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98370:16"/>
business, represented the state of Affairs to
that Parliament clear otherwise than it
was, endearing their own Party to them
as the only sincere publick spirited Men,
who desired such a Reformation as was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to their Government, and such a
Peace as might be a joint safety and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to both Kingdoms, giving Characters of
all others as Malignants, ill affected, averse
to the Scotish Nation, opposers of a good
understanding between the Kingdoms, and
of their mutual assistance of each other.</p>
            <p>15. With which prejudice of us the
<hi>Scots</hi> were strongly possessed, at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in about <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1643. and were in
<hi>England</hi> some time before they were disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused.
They were first made believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should be done without them, or
their advice and consent. To that purpose
a Committee of the two Kingdoms must be
appointed for uniting the Councils, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and direct the prosecution of the War,
and for communicating and transacting all
Affairs between the Kingdoms: In pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, and keeping out some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whom our Masters did disaffect, they
used such juggling, as never was heard of
before in Parliament, and none but such
<hi>Hocus-pocus</hi>'s could have the Face to have
done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98370:16"/>
16. Well, they carried it, and to work
they go, bearing it very fair to the <hi>Scots,</hi>
till they were got aloft again, and that
with their help they had recovered and
cleared the North, obtained that great
Victory at <hi>Marston-Moor,</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1644,
which without them they had never done.
And however Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwel</hi>
had the impudence and boldness to assume
much of the honour of it to himself, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Herod</hi> like, to suffer others to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
him and adore him for it (for I can
scarce believe he should be so impudent to
give it out himself, so conscious as he must
be of his own base cowardliness) those who
did the principal Service that day, were
Major General <hi>Lesley,</hi> who commanded
the Scots Horse, Major General <hi>Crawford</hi>
who was Major General to the Earl of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi>'s
Brigade, and Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi>
who, under his Father, commanded the
Northern Brigade. But my friend <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
had neither part nor lot in the business:
For I have several times heard it from
<hi>Crawford</hi>'s own mouth (and I think I shall
not be mistaken if I say <hi>Cromwel</hi> himself
has heard it from him; for he once said it
aloud in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> when <hi>Cromwel</hi>
past by him, with a design he might hear
him) that when the whole Army at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston-Moor</hi>
was in a fair possibility to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98370:17"/>
routed, and a great part of it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
he saw the Body of Horse of that
Brigade standing still, and to his seeming
doubtful which way to charge, backward
or forward, when he came up to them in
a great passion, reviling them with the
name of Poltroons and Cowards, and asked
them if they would stand still and see the
Day lost? Whereupon <hi>Cromwel</hi> shewed
himself, and in a pitiful Voice said, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General, what shall I do? he (begging
pardon for what he said, not knowing
he was there, towards whom he knew his
distance as to his Superiour Officer) told
him, Sir, if you charge not all is lost;
<hi>Cromwel</hi> answered, he was wounded, and
was not able to charge (his great wound
being a little burn in the Neck by the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
going off behind him of one of his
Soldiers Pistols) then <hi>Crawford</hi> desired him
to go off the Field, and sending one away
with him (who very readily followed
wholesom advice) led them on himself,
which was not the duty of his Place, and
as little for <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Honor, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be much for the advancement of
his and his Parties pernicious Designs.
This I have but by relation, yet I easily
believe it upon the Credit of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter,
who was a Man of Honor, that
was not ashamed nor afraid to publish it in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98370:17"/>
all places. Besides, I have heard a parallel
Story of his Valour from another person
(Colonel <hi>Dalbier</hi>) not inferiour, neither in
quality nor reputation, to Major General
<hi>Crawford,</hi> who told me, That when <hi>Basing-House</hi>
was storm'd, <hi>Cromwel,</hi> instead of
leading on his Men, stood a good distance
off, out of Gun-shot behind a Hedg. And
something I can deliver of him upon my
own knowledg, which makes passage for
the easier belief of both these Relations, and
assures me that that Man is as errand a
Coward, as he is notoriously perfidious, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious,
and hypocritical. This was his
base keeping out of the Field at <hi>Keinton</hi>
Battel; where he with his Troop of Horse
came not in, impudently and ridiculously
affirming, the day after, That he had been
all that day seeking the Army and place
of Fight, tho his Quarters were but at
a Village near hand, whence he could not
find his way, nor be directed by his Ear,
when the Ordnance was heard, as I have
been credibly informed, 20 or 30 Miles off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so that certainly he is far from the Man he
is taken for.</p>
            <p>17. That day's work at <hi>Marston-Moor</hi>
turned the Scales, and raised again the
fortune of the Parliament, which till that
day had very much declined: And these
Men (who all this while stalked under the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98370:18"/>
sides of the Parliament, and did but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the business of Reformation, and the
Peoples Liberties, thereby to break the
power of the King first, that afterwards
they might, either by artifice or force, lay
as low the Authority of Parliament, unless it
would betray its truth, and yield to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
to them) did, after this, begin
to put out their Horns, appear in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and, as they warmed more and more,
to spit out their Venom against Monarchy,
against Nobility and Gentry, against that
Reformation with which they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
held forth to the <hi>Scots,</hi> against the very
Covenant, their Vows and Declarations
wherewith they had abused God and the
World.</p>
            <p>18. Then did <hi>Cromwel</hi> declare himself to
the Lord of <hi>Manchester,</hi> and indeed reveal'd
the whole Design. First, His rancor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Scots,</hi> as that he would as soon
draw his Sword against them as against any
of the King's Party. Then his hatred of
the Nobility and House of Peers, wishing
there was never a Lord in <hi>England,</hi> and
saying, he loved such and such because they
loved not Lords, and that it would not be
well till he was but Mr. <hi>Montague.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
His intentions to hinder Peace, and that
therefore he desired none to be of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but such as were of the Independent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98370:18"/>
judgment, to interpose if a Peace were like
to be made which agreed not with their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.
All this remains upon Record in
both Houses, being the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi>'s
Charge against him. And let any one judg
if this be not the very Plot which was then
laid and since practised. Has not every
particular been attempted by them? have
they not fully compleated that which was
chiefly aimed at? As that which will, and
must certainly (if not prevented) bring on
all the rest the hindering of Peace, that no
ease nor quietness might be restored to the
Kingdom. For when the Parliament was
ready to disband the only Army then left,
and so to free the Subject from all Payments
and Taxes, that every one might return to
his Vocation, and all differences between
King and Parliament might be ended and
reconciled in a parliamentary way; then
did the <hi>Cadmean</hi> Brood turn their Swords
against their fellow Subjects, and their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
the Parliament, which by open force
they assault, make void, and unvote what
they had voted concerning their Disbanding,
put by all thoughts of Peace, and throw back
the Kingdom, which was entring into the
desired Haven of Peace and Happiness, into
the deep Seas of Storms and Misery and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
where I beseech God it perish not:
But of all this anon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98370:19"/>
19. Things were not yet ripe; tho
the Serpent's Eggs were laid by him in the
Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi>'s bosom, it was not time
to hatch the Cockatrice. Therefore when
it was by the Earl made known to the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
their Party in the House of Commons
did (<hi>more solito</hi>) with all the violence and
injustice in the world smother and suppress
it, quarrelling that the Lords had infring'd
their Privileges, in desiring that might be
examined by a Committee in both Houses,
saying, The Lords ought not to meddle in it,
because it concern'd a Commoner; whereas
nothing was more ordinary throughout the
whole proceeding of this Parliament in all
their inquisitions. Yet by that means this
was then stifled, the breach of Privilege re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to a Committee of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and there the business died.</p>
            <p>20. After this the <hi>Scots</hi> saw how they
were cheated, and it came to be, though not
an open breach, yet a great coldness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, a withdrawing of confidence,
of familiarity, of Counsels. And the <hi>Scots</hi>
then found that the other party had been
misrepresented, being the Men who, in
truth, did agree with them in Principles
and in Design: Which was only to reform,
not to alter; to regulate, and so to save,
not to destroy. That they still carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with them the sense of their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98370:19"/>
and Duty to the person of the King,
whom they did desire to see reinvested into
his Throne and Kingly Government, with
such a power, and in such a way, as might
be good both for Him and the People, that
thereby confusion, misery, and that disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which the Poet describes to have been
in the first Chaos, and which we now see
(not in a Fiction, but really feel and smart
under) might be avoided.</p>
            <p>21. By little and little the <hi>Scots</hi> and these
latter came to a better understanding; at
last they discover the horrid Practices and
the whole Design of the others, who, in
the mean time, drove it on, <hi>Iehu</hi> like, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
bearing down, and destroying all
that opposed them; for some opposition
they found. They saw there was a strong
Party in the House against them, between
whom and the Soldiers who were under
Command of my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> there was a
good Correspondency; and these two, together
with the <hi>Scots,</hi> were as a threefold Cord not
to be broken by them: therefore they would
untwist it, and so destroy them one after
another.</p>
            <p>22. The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> must be the first
who they found would not bow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must break; for many applications had
been made to see if he would stoop to their
Lure. Great offers, large promises, all the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98370:20"/>
glory of the Kingdom should be his, if he
would but worship them, be (as they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it) true to the Godly Party: but he
was true to his Principles. Therefore they
do what they can to make him odious, not
paying his Army, to make it a Burden to
the Country, and infamous; not giving
him means of acting by Supplies and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
so to be looked upon as a Drone or
worse, or putting him upon such Actions
as should break him, so to make him come
off with dishonour.</p>
            <p>23. As when he was about <hi>Oxford</hi> in the
Summer 1644, he on one side of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> with his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade
on the other; the King having then
but a small force within the Town, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not provided for a Siege, or not willing
to be shut in with a light body of Horse,
and I think some mounted Men, held them
play and distracted them, being sometimes
on the one side, sometimes on the other;
which was easie for him to do, going
through the Town, as he saw occasion, by
the conveniency of the Gates: It being then
known that he waited but his opportunity
and advantage to slip by, or break through,
our Grand Masters ordered my Lord of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
with a heavy body of an Army and a
great train of Artillery, to attend his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
motion, and Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> to go
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98370:20"/>
into the West, which they conceived would
be an easie Task at that time to reduce the
King's Party brought low, and so not able
to send any Forces into those parts for their
relief and encouragement.</p>
            <p>24. This they knew would absolutely
break my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> who must harass
his Army to follow a light and moving Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and if the King, which was probable
enough, should chance to give him the slip,
and get from him into the West, then was
he ruin'd in his Reputation, and liable to a
Question, and perhaps a further Prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It proved that his Majesty did get by
them, and passed by Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>'s
Quarters on the other side, who, as soon as
he knew it, marched after him, and gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
to my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> thereof; so as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he knew any thing, Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>
was got a days march before after the King.
Then was it impossible for him to overtake
them; and, being so much nearer the West,
Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> engaged in the other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he, upon the Advice of his Council of
War, resolved to bend that way, yet not to
make such speed, but that he should receive
other Orders from our Governors above,
that he might comply with them. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he gave that Account to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Committee of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
with his desire of their Directions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98370:21"/>
They were so mad to see themselves defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their Plot, that they would not for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
days return him any answer at all; his
disobedience was blown up, and trumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about by them and their Agents: Some
of whom did not stick to say, It were better
my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> and his whole Army were
lost and ruined, than the Parliament not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
and, that by their consents, he nor
his Army should be look'd after or cared for
more: A Maxim they have forgotten now
in the case of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> and his
Army's, not Disobedience but open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
but they were as good as their words
then, and did most maliciously, wilfully,
and treacherously (as to the Parliaments
Cause, which they seemed to be zealous in)
suffer General and Army to be lost, and the
whole West left further out of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
reach than before.</p>
            <p>25. Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig</hi> posted up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
breathing out nothing but ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> spoke it out
in the hearing of several persons, That he
would ruin him, or be ruined himself. His
malice and violence was so great at the
Committee of the two Kingdoms, where
he and his Party were prevalent, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
was thence brought down to the House
of Commons, by which Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>
was taken off from following the King, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98370:21"/>
by that means the King was left at liberty
to bend his whole force for the West after
my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> which he presently did.
At last they left my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> at liberty
to proceed in that Western Expedition, but
with a resolution to let him perish. He
takes in <hi>Weymouth</hi> and some other Towns,
goes on as far as <hi>Cornwal,</hi> whither the
King's Forces follow him at the heels, cut
off all provision from him, press upon him
exceedingly, and put him to very great
streights. He engaged in a Country inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with deep Ditches and strong Fences,
that he could neither break through, nor
march away; but sends Letter upon Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Messenger upon Messenger to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
representing his Condition, and
how easie it was with a small force sent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the back of the King's Army, if but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a good Party of Horse, to stop their
Provisions, and turn the Tables, streighten
them and free him, than which certainly
nothing had been more easie, and would
have saved the Kingdom a Mass of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and thousands of good Mens lives,
which the continuance of the War after that
time did cost.</p>
            <p>26. But our Masters did not desire then
to see the War at an end; they had not the
Sword in those hands they would have it
for to break the King's forces, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98370:22"/>
they must then have had a Peace, and
such a Peace as had carried with it an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment
of the King's Government, a
keeping up the Nobility and Gentry; all
things must have returned into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Channel, and (the security of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
and Kingdom being provided for)
the Law of the Land must have taken place,
their Arbitrary Empire been at an end, and
their Design wholly defeated.</p>
            <p>27. Therefore my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> must
not be relieved, but sacrificed to their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
the King's Army must be yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
to give them a colour to new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
theirs, and put the Power into the base
hands of their Creatures which should keep
the Kingdom in a perpetual Bondage; and
tho they ended the War with the King,
yet never made Peace, but continued to
grind the Faces and break the Backs of the
People with Taxes and Free-Quarter, to
maintain an Army when no Enemy was
left; in a word, they govern by the Sword,
the height of all Misery and Slavery that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Land can undergo.</p>
            <p>28. My Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> and his Army were
by this means broken in <hi>Cornwal</hi> in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of that Summer, and the King seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to gain a great Advantage, recover a
great deal of Strength; but to nip that,
they soon provided Force sufficient, it suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98370:22"/>
with their Ends, that his Majesty should
seem strong, but not be so. Therefore the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of that Army which had lost their Arms
in <hi>Cornwal</hi> are presently armed again, and
two other Armies joined to them, the Earl of
<hi>Manchester</hi>'s and Sir <hi>W. W aller</hi>'s, who gave the
King's Forces a ruffle at <hi>Dennington,</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some of the Works: Yet, when the King
came with the remainder of his Strength,
they did not think it convenient to put it to
the trial of a Day, but suffered him to march
away, when it had been a most easie thing
to have prevented it: And even there, in all
likelyhood, have made an end of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which was that they feared; and Sir
<hi>Arthur Haslerig</hi> could come up to <hi>London,</hi> and
into the House of Commons, all in beaten
Buff, cross girt with Sword and Pistols as if
he had been killing his thousands, when 'tis
more probable, if there was any danger, that
he had been crying under a Hedg, as he
did at <hi>Cherrington</hi> Fight, bellowing out,
<hi>Ah wo is me, all is lost! we are all undone!</hi>
insomuch that a great Officer, a Scotch-man,
finding him in that tune, wished him to go
off the Field, and not stand <hi>gudding</hi> there
(a Scotch term for crying) to dishearten the
Soldiers: but in the House of Commons he
feared nothing, none so fierce and valiant,
without fear or wit; and there, like a great
Soldier in that habit, gave a Relation of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98370:23"/>
what had pass'd, highly extolling the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
and conduct of all the Commanders,
the valour of the Soldiers, that no mortal
Men could do more, that the best Soldiers
in the world could not have hinder'd the
King's marching off, and that it had been
no wisdom to have adventur'd to fight, for
that the King would be King still, and
would soon have had another Army, tho they
had gotten the better, but if he had beaten
them, they had been utterly lost. This ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the turn for that time, to cast a mist
before the peoples eyes, and stop their
mouths. Yet within very few Weeks
after, this worthy Knight forgot all he
had said: for it is by <hi>Cromwel</hi> laid as a Crime
to the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi>'s Charge (whom
they then meant to lay aside) that he was the
cause they sought not with the King, and
Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> is a principal Witness to make it
good. But on the other side, the Earl of
<hi>Manchester</hi> returns the Bill, charging <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
that it was his not obeying Orders, who
being commanded as Lieutenant General of
the Horse, to be ready at such a place by
such an hour early in the Morning, came
not till the Afternoon, and by many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
makes it clear to have been only his
fault.</p>
            <p>29. And to say the truth, they could not
else have carried on their Design of new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98370:23"/>
their Army, of which then there
had been no need, and preventing a Peace
which they feared might else have followed.
For if the King had been too sore prest at
that time, it was in their apprehensions
probably he might have laid hold upon the
Propositions for Peace, which were then
ready, and sent to him to <hi>Oxford</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after.</p>
            <p>30. Therefore now they set upon their
great Work, projected long before, and
which <hi>Cromwel</hi> had broken to my Lord of
<hi>Manchester</hi> in the time of his greatness with
him, when he thought him to be one of their
own, that was to have an Army composed
of those of the Independent Judgment, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose
if there were like to be a Peace; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their Presumption and Impudence was
swell'd to be so much higher, as now, they
would have no other Army but of them.
Because they saw the danger was over;
there being no Enemy to take the Field a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, but such an one as they had
willingly set up and given time and means
to get together: so as there would be no
great need of fighting, that part having been
acted by others; for they were never good
at it, but excellent to assume the praise and
reap the benefit, when others had done the
work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98370:24"/>
31. Therefore the whole force of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
must be theirs, in the hands of their
Creatures; all the Noblemen and Gentlemen
who had engaged in the beginning, and
born the heat of the day, must be laid by,
all these gallant Officers who had done the
Parliament the best Service, indeed all, must
be cashier'd: The Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> the Earl
of <hi>Manchester,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Waller,</hi> and the rest must be reduced,
cast by as old Almanacks, in truth not fitted
to their Meridian.</p>
            <p>32. For this Feat the Juggle of a Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
Ordinance is found out, whereby it
is ordained, that no Member of either House
shall bear any Office Martial or Civil;
which strikes them all out of Employment
and <hi>Cromwel</hi> too, but for him they will soon
find a Starting-hole.</p>
            <p>33. Then there must be one body of an
Army composed of so many thousand Horse
and Foot out of the several Armies, which
were to be reduced (as I remember some
20 or 21 thousand, which number they
have since doubled or trebled for the ease of
the Kingdom) the Officers to be named by
the House, and a Committee appointed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the specious name of a Committee of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
for this Work, by which they
tear in sunder all their Forces, discontent all
their best Officers and Soldiers, utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98370:24"/>
the whole Frame of the Martial part
of their Affairs, and, I dare say, put the
King's Party in greater hopes of being able
to make it good by the Sword, and less to
apprehend the Consequence of not making a
Peace at that time, than the gaining of a
Battel would have done: nor in truth could
it have any other Operation with rational
Men.</p>
            <p>24. So to work they go, and find difficulties
enough. The Soldiers bore an affection to
their old Officers, which made them unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be reduced: Money there was not
to give any reasonable satisfaction out of
their Arrears to those who were to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shier'd:
But a fortnights pay was ordered,
where many months were owing. Yet
such was the obedience of those Officers
(gallant Men, old Soldiers most of them)
to the authority of Parliament (so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to the late rebellious Carriage and Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of our new Model, as shall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shewed) that they submit to it, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to sit down themselves, and (which is
more) use their interest to perswade the
Soldiers to a Conformity. Some of the
Horse who had served under my Lord of
<hi>Essex</hi> were a little stiff, and made some shew
of standing out in <hi>Hertfordshire,</hi> which our
violent bloody new Modellers would have
made advantage of presently to have faln on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98370:25"/>
them, and put them to the Sword; but the
Parliament followed more moderate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
endeavouring to gain them through fair
means, by sending down some of their old
Officers to dispose them to a submission,
which employment they declined not, but
went and prevailed: to which my Lord of
<hi>Essex</hi> himself contributed very much, an
Example that this present young General
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> would not follow when
his Army was to be disbanded.</p>
            <p>35. Yet such was the wickedness and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
madness of those Men, who thirsted
after nothing but blood, mischief and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
that at the very same time when the
Parliament was going a gentle way, Mr. <hi>St.
Iohn</hi> the King's Solicitor (one who I think
has as much of the Blood of this Kingdom
to answer for, and has dipp'd as deep in
all cunning pernicious Counsels, as any one
man alive) wrote a Letter under-hand to the
Committee of <hi>Hertfordshire</hi> (which is yet
extant) that they should raise the Country
and fall upon these men, to put all into
blood, contrary to the desire and endeavour
of the Parliament. A Villany never to be
forgotten nor forgiven in any man, much
less a Man of Law, who should better know
what price the Law sets upon the life of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Subject, much more of many toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and of a whole County, which, if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98370:25"/>
he had been obeyed, had run a great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard.</p>
            <p>36. But I wonder not at this or any other
such passage from him, who could have the
face to say in his Argument against my
Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> That some persons were
not to have Law given them, but be knockt
on the head, no matter how: tho he
knows it, or should know it, to be against
the Laws both of God and Man, that any
should be put to death before a legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
however he may have practised the
contrary since the beginning of these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
troubles: his composition being, it
seems, like that Monster Emperor's <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Sanguine maceratum.</hi> And to less than
an Emperor I would not parallel him,
whose vast thoughts have carried him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
King and Parliament, to frame, new
mould, alter, and destroy as he thinks good.
This mixture in his nature makes his actings
so fierce and cruel. I appeal to all who
have seen and observ'd him this whole Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
if, on all occasions, his Opinion
did not still conclude <hi>in severiorem partem;</hi>
if he ever stopt where there was any way to
it before he came to blood, or to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Estate and Fortune: But let him
pass.</p>
            <p>37. To return to our business: Those
Soldiers were by these means perswaded,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98370:26"/>
and the new Army framed, Colonels and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
new Officers appointed, and for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
in chief Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> is
found out; one, as Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig</hi> said,
as if he had been hew'd out of the Block for
them, sit for their turns to do whatever
they will have him, without considering or
being able to judg whether honourable or
honest. In the passing his Commission
they made the first plain discovery of their
Intentions concerning the Person of the
King: for with a great deal of violence and
earnestness they prest it, and carried it, that
the care of the preservation of his Person
should be lest out, and that this Army should
go out in the name of the Parliament alone,
and not of King and Parliament, as it was
before under my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
would not have medled with it. But
this General made no Bones, took it, and
thanked them, resolved (as it seems) to do
whatsoever those his Masters should bid
him: for I'm sure he has, at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
led his Army since against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
which he seemed to adore above all
things upon Earth.</p>
            <p>38. The next work was how again to
get in my friend <hi>Cromwel;</hi> for he was to
have the power, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> only
the name of General; he to be the Figure,
the other the Cypher. This was so gross
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98370:26"/>
and diametrically against the letter of the
Self-denying Ordinance, that it put them
to some trouble how to bring it about. For
this <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Soldiers, forsooth, must muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and say they will have their <hi>Cromwel</hi> or
they will not stir. Hereupon he must be
sent down; no word then of cutting or hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or of forcing them to a submission, as in
the case of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Soldiers; but
they must have their wills. Yet for these
very men had <hi>Cromwel</hi> undertaken before,
when upon debate the inconveniency was
objected which might follow by discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the common Soldiers, who would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be drawn to leave their old Officers
and go under new, he could say, that his
Soldiers had learn'd to obey the Parliament,
to go or stay, fight or lay by the Sword up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their command; which I know prevail'd
with a great many to give their Vote with
that Ordinance.</p>
            <p>39. By this trick a little beginning was
made towards the breach of it, which was
soon made greater. For they caused a report
to be spread, That the King was bending with
his Forces towards the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> but none
could save but <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who must be sent in
all haste for that Service, and an Order of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
is made for a very few Months,
two or three (I remember not well wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
but with such protestations of that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98370:27"/>
Party, that this was only for that Exigency,
and that for the World they would not have
the Ordinance impeached, as Mr. Sollicitor
said; and that if no body would move for the
calling him home at the expiration of that
time, he would. But all this was to gull
the House. Mr. Sollicitor had forgot his
Protestation, and before that was out there
is another Order for more Months, and so
renewed from time to time, that at last this
great Commander is riveted in the Army,
and so fast riveted, as after all his Orders
of continuance were at an end, he would
keep his Command still, which he has
done for several Months, and dos yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that Ordinance, without any
Order at all of the House for it.</p>
            <p>40. There, now they have the Sword
where they would have it, and resolve with
it to cut all Knots they cannot untie; yet
they desire to keep that Resolution behind
the Curtain as long as they could, and
would be thought very obedient to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
hoping they should be always able
to have it carried there according to their
mind; and partly by the awe of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
partly by hopes of reward and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
still to have the major Vote. Which
was easie for them, having both Sword and
Purse, and withal an impudence and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to reward all those who would sell their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98370:27"/>
Consciences. For all such Members of the
House, and others were sure to be prefer'd,
have large Gifts given them out of the
Commonwealth's Money, Arrears paid, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
confer'd upon them, countenanced and
protected against all Complaints and Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,
had they done never so unworthy,
unjust, horrid actions, to the oppression of
the Subject, and dishonour of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
All others discountenanc'd, oppos'd,
inquisitions set upon them, question'd, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd
upon the least occasion, colours of
Crimes many times for doing real good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and no favour nor justice for them: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the World might see which was the
way to rise, and which to be sure to meet
with contrary Winds and Storms, and so
to make all men at least to hold Candles to
these visible Saints.</p>
            <p>41. But a Party in the House still trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
them, which saw their Juglings, their
under hand dealings, suspected their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
found what they drove at, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
them, oppos'd them, sometimes
crost and defeated their Practices, always
vext them, and did, in a great measure, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
and keep off Evil, tho the stream
was so strong they could not attain and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the Good they desir'd.</p>
            <p>42. This knot must be broken, and some
of the persons removed, who are represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98370:28"/>
to the Kingdom by these Men and their
Agents, as those who were rotten at heart,
not faithful to the Parliament, holding cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
and intelligence with the King.
This was upon Generals, only to prepare
Mens minds to make passage for an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of any attempts to their prejudice,
and give credit to such Lies and false Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
as they should be able to set on foot:
and all means are us'd to procure Witnesses
to testifie any thing against them, Prisoners
examin'd and encourag'd to say something,
any scandalous desperate Rogues receiv'd
and hearken'd to, Spies set to watch them,
their goings out and comings in, what pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they went to, what persons they visited
or that visited them. Some of their Agents
consest they have been two years together
watching about some of our Houses, yet it
pleased God to protect the Innocent, and,
notwithstanding all these endeavours, it was
never in their power to do any great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
in this base unworthy way.</p>
            <p>43. They came nearest to their Mark,
when they had gotten the Lord <hi>Savil,</hi> a
known infamous Impostor, to accuse me
with keeping correspondence with my Lord
<hi>Digby</hi> (of which he said he had notice given
him by a Letter in Cypher from the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess
of <hi>Buckingham</hi>) and for what I did and
said at <hi>Oxford,</hi> when I was amongst others
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98370:28"/>
sent thither to present Propositions to the
King, where they had a sit Instrument to
act for them, and say and swear any thing
they would have him, who was at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time employed by some of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
ones, to truck and drive a Treaty under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
with some great persons at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
For the chief among them had always Grace
to try more ways then one to the Wood,
and commonly not to row the way they
look'd, willing enough to have made a
good bargain for themselves at Court, and
then have left their Whelps, their Zealots, to
have mended themselves as they could, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not despairing but to have perswaded
them it was for their good, and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Catholick Cause, so to have
quieted them, and some little thing should
have been done for their satisfaction. I did
with my own Eyes see Letters, and so did
several persons, Members of both Houses,
some yet alive, some dead, witten by <hi>Savil</hi>
to divers of great quality at <hi>Oxford,</hi> one to
<hi>L. D.</hi> some to others, with only one Letter
for their Names, where intelligence was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the proceedings and intentions of the
Parliament and their Army, many Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made in the name of that Party and
their Undertakings, and in the Close my
Lord <hi>Savil</hi> to be Lord Treasurer, Mr. Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor
to be Lord Keeper, and others of their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98370:29"/>
Faction to have several Offices of Honourand
Trust. These Letters were seen likewise by
my Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> who
are yet alive, and can testifie it, and by the
Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Christopher Wray,</hi> who are dead. Some of
them were written by <hi>Savil</hi>'s own hand,
some copy'd out by a person of Honour, who
was employ'd by him, and is yet alive to
make it good: And when they play'd this
Game themselves, and pretended, forsooth,
a designupon <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to have the King's
Army in the West deliver'd to them (which
was all but collusion and deceit, to abuse the
World, and colour their Correspondencies)
then did they make <hi>Savil</hi> play the Villain
and accuse me, whom they prosecuted with
that height of malice and violence, with so
much injustice and partiality, especially that
Man of Law Mr. Sollicitor, who tho
Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> had not only consented to, but
joined in, and advised all that I had done at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and that <hi>Savil</hi> himself had laid it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
upon us both in his Information (it
seems either not so wicked as his setters on,
or not fully instructed by them) yet such
was the Justice of that Man, as he would
needs sever our Cases, and was not a shamed
not only so to declare his Judgment, but
press'd it and sollicited it, that the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
might be singly against me: whereby
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98370:29"/>
the eyes of many indifferent persons, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the House, were open'd, and their
Spirits rais'd to an Indignation, insomuch
that in spight of the Sollicitor and his Party,
I was acquitted by the House.</p>
            <p>44. This made them bethink themselves,
begin to mistrust the House, and doubt if
they should be able to carry things as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly:
And thereupon resolve on a course,
which some amongst them had formerly still
oppos'd or declin'd, as Mr. Sollicitor by
name, which was to have the vacant places
of those they had thrust out filled up by a
new Election, issuing out Writs for it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their new Great Seal. This they hoped
would alter the Constitution of the House,
and give them infallibly a majority of Votes.
Accordingly in the long Summer Vacation
of the year 1645, when very many of the
Members were gone into their several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
they fall upon that point of recruiting
the House; and notwithstanding the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereof, and its being surprised with
that Debate, their Creatures most of them
there (as they were always sure of some fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Voices, persons whose only Employment
was there to drudg and carry on their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
work, having thereby a greatness far
above the Sphere they had formerly mov'd
in; whereas the others were Gentlemen, who
had Estates which requir'd their looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98370:30"/>
and all of them some Vocations, either
for their particular business or pleasure,
which made them less diligent, and many
of them, as at other times, so then away)
yet they carried it but by three Voices.</p>
            <p>45. Then to work they go to canvass for
Elections in all places, for the bringing in
of such as should be wholly theirs. First,
they did all they could to stop Writs from
going any whither but where they were
sure to have fit Men chosen for their turns,
and many an unjust thing was done by them
in that kind: Sometimes denying Writs,
sometimes delaying till they had prepared
all things, and made it, as they thought,
cock-sure: Many times Committee-men in
the Country, such as were their Creatures,
appearing grossly, and bandying to carry
Elections for them; sometimes they did it
fairly by the power of the Army, causing
Soldiers to be sent and quarter'd in the
Towns where Elections were to be, awing
and terrifying, sometimes abusing and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
violence to the Electors. And when
these undue Elections were complain'd of,
and question'd at the Committee of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
there appeared such palpable partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so much injustice, such delays and tricks
to vex Parties grieved and their Witnesses,
such countenancing and defending those
who had done the wrong, as it dishearten'd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98370:30"/>
every body, and made many even sit down
and give over prosecution.</p>
            <p>46. Notwithstanding all this, and that
by this means some persons unduly chosen
were brought in, yet it prov'd, that far the
greater part of those new Members deceiv'd
the expectation of these Men. For tho
they came into the House with as much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
as was possible against the other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Party, who had always been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to them as persons ill affected, not
faithful to the Parliament, obstructing all
businesses that were for the good of the
Kingdom, having Self-ends and ambitious
designs of their own; when they came to sit
in the House themselves, to see with their
own eyes the carriage of things, understand
the ways and drift both of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Party, discern the tricks and violent
proceedings of the one, and plainness and
reality of the other; that all these aimed at
was but to get a good Peace, see the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
settled both in Church and State, and
make no advantages to themselves, have no
share, nor desir'd none of the Moneys, look
after no Offices nor Preserments; in a word,
not seek themselves but the pulick; and those
on the other side hinder and oppose the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
of the Government, and keep things in
a distraction and confusion, not willing to put
up the Sword, but continue the burdens
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98370:31"/>
and pressures of the Country, countenance
the insolencies of Soldiers, bear them out in
their abusing of Ministers, and other honest
Men, who were for Church-Government,
keep up factions and drive on interests in
the House, put themselves, their Kindred
and Friends into all places of power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
share and divide among them the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth's
Money, by Gifts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and paying pretended Arrears; in a
word, seek the ruin of the Kingdom, and
the advancement of themselves and their
Party; this made them change their Minds,
and many of them to confess and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
they had been abused.</p>
            <p>47. But this was not the work of one
day: Some time passed before they could
make these clear discoveries and disabuse
themselves; our grand Impostors kept them
a good while at gaze, with putting jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
into their heads against the <hi>Scots,</hi> as if
the <hi>Scots</hi> had a design of making good their
footing in this Kingdom, and that we who
were of the other Party from them did carry
on the Scotch Interest, and design'd to betray
the Rights and Liberties of <hi>England;</hi> with
which Engine they batter'd a long time, and
made no small impression in many mens
Minds.</p>
            <p>48. For the next step they meant to make,
was to fall foul with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and engage
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98370:31"/>
the Kingdoms one against another in Blood,
which was the return they would give the
<hi>Scots,</hi> as a reward of the good Service they
had done them, coming to their help in
time of need, when they were so low, so
despairing of carrying on their work, and
effecting what they had projected to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as that the chief of them a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were ready to run away, Ships prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
good store of Treasure which they had
shark'd, pack'd up to carry with them, or
return'd beyond Sea by Bills of Exchange,
and all things in a readiness for their remove,
so well were they resolved to hazard, and
(if need were) sacrifice themselves for their
Country, tho they would be thought to be the
only Patriots; but they had certainly left it
in the lurch, if first my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> had not
done that memorable piece of Service in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Glocester</hi> (which was so gallantly
defended by Major General <hi>Massey</hi>) and
fighting the great Battel of <hi>Newbury.</hi> And
a little before that the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi>
engaging in the Cause, sent in their Army
to their assistance. My Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> as
has been shewed already, had his reward;
he was cashier'd, and so was Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Massey,</hi> who since likewise is turn'd out
of the House (being one of the eleven Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers)
and voted to be impeached of High
Treason. And next the <hi>Scots</hi> must have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98370:32"/>
theirs. The quarrelling with them, and
endeavouring to destroy their Army, is
what I must now speak of, as the Subject of
the next Act in this Tragedy. The first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
is to break the Scotish Army, by
not paying it, which before, whilst they had
need of it, or hopes that the Kingdom of
<hi>Scotland</hi> might cooperate to the working of
their Designs, they could be careful to do
their utmost to satisfie, and to provide for it
fitting Accommodations. But now they can
let many months pass without sending them
any Money, or taking any care for their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
or so much as affording them good
words. One of these two effects they
thought this would certainly produce, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Soldiers to run away, perhaps mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny,
so the Army disband and fall to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or else live upon Free-quarters, so by
oppressing the Country to become odious,
and the people rise against them. Nor were
they wanting to give all encouragement so
to do; Emissaries were sent out, and Agents
employ'd in all places to stir up and imbitter
mens Spirits. Many Complaints were, by
their procurements, sent up to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and all means used to get hands to
those Complaints, and strange things were
suggested, vast Sums to be levy'd by them,
so many thousand Pounds a week to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd
upon a County, unheard of Insolencies
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98370:32"/>
to be committed, Robbing, Killing, Ravishing,
Riots, all manner of Villanies. This would
come up with open cry, make a great noise,
be received and heighten'd in the House of
Commons with railing Speeches, bitter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives,
blown over the City and Kingdom
to the disadvantage and reproach not only
of the Army, but the Nation; in a word,
all done that could be imagin'd to set Man,
Woman and Child, and even the very
Stones against them. The Commissioners
of <hi>Scotland</hi> that were in <hi>London</hi> would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times send in their Papers to the Houses
of Parliament, to shew the falshoods of those
Reports, and desire that Committees might
be sent down to join with theirs to examine
these things; pressing that it ought to be so
done by the Treaty between the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and that there should always be a
Committee of both Kingdoms with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to govern it, to provide what was sit
for the Soldiers, and prevent both disorders
and misunderstandings: but it was not that
which our Masters desir'd, and therefore
they would send none.</p>
            <p>49. The Members of the House who
dislik'd those Courses, and saw the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
that were us'd to cause a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Nations, did yet desire, that
if those relations were true, it might so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and be represented not only to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98370:33"/>
General of the Army, and to that part of the
Committee of Estates of <hi>Scotland</hi> which was
in <hi>England</hi> (both those with the Parliament
and those with the Army) but even to the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that there might be
redress, the Offenders punish'd, and the
Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> righted and satisfy'd:
If false, that the raisers and contrivers of
those Reports might be punish'd, and the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> repaired, which was
the way to keep Peace between the Nations.
And so sometimes they prevail'd, and got it
order'd for an Examination, but never any
thing could be made of it. Only at a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Town
in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> there had been a
Riot, and some Men killed; for which a
Council of War had passed on the Offenders,
and some (as I remember) were executed,
some cashier'd. And for the raising those
great Sums of Money, it is true, Money they
did raise, or else their Soldiers must have
starv'd: But for that exorbitancy of raising
so many thousand Pounds a Week upon one
County, it was a Scandal and false Lye,
grounded upon notable Cheat and Collusion.
For the <hi>Scots</hi> drawing their Quarters near
together, which they did, as well for the
better governing of their Army, as for the
safety of it, knowing they had many back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends,
this made them lie heavy upon
places, and exact the more Money and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98370:33"/>
from those several Townships. Then
did these Men who were employed to blow
the Coals, and put all into a flame (if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
between the Country and the <hi>Scots,</hi> take
the highest rate that was set upon any one
of these Towns, and make a computation
what it would come to upon the whole
County at that proportion, which Sum they
inform'd to be the charge upon that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for the payment of the Scotish Army;
and this must be made a great business and
past for a truth, as if the <hi>Scots</hi> had rais'd so
much Money, when in truth there was no
such thing.</p>
            <p>50. Yet let me not be thought to excuse
and justifie all that the Soldiers of that Army
have done upon the Country, and not to
pity with a very tender Sense, the deep Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of those Northern parts, the Scotish
Army lying so long upon them on Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter.
I must be very ignorant of the
carriage of an unpaid Army, if I did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that many disorders were committed,
many a poor Country-man exceedingly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
and abus'd by the unruly Soldiers,
and more by half taken and spoiled by them,
than would have sufficed for their Pay and
Entertainment, if it had been orderly raised
and provided by the authority and care of the
State which was to pay them. And so should
I likewise have very small bowels towards my
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98370:34"/>
Country, <hi>England</hi> in general, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
those poor Counties, in one of which I
receiv'd my being, if I did not grieve and
mourn from the bottom of my Soul for the
sad condition which did then overspread
them, the poverty to which they are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
the ruin of so many Houses and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
the Land lying in many places an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
Wilderness, all over a face of misery
and desolation. But then the more I am rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to an indignation against them who were
the cause of this, those who had rather suffer
not one County or two, but all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in <hi>England,</hi> and two Kingdoms besides
to perish and ruin, than they to fail of their
Ends. So must all the North be made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to their malice and revenge upon the
Scotish Nation, and rather than not enforce
the <hi>Scots</hi> to oppress those parts, hoping at
last they would fall one upon another, they
will suffer the Country to endure any Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and not only so, but impudently and
perfidiously wrest and misinterpret the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
themselves had made, and so put a great
scorn thereon, to give greater provocations
to the <hi>Scots:</hi> and thus they make themselves
ridiculous and infamous to the World, and
to all posterity, by a gross and palpable col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion.</p>
            <p>51. For when the Commissioners of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and the General of the Army did so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98370:34"/>
and earnestly move for Pay for the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
representing that on the monthly
Pay which was condition'd for and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
they have not of so many Months re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
any thing, and that it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to observe that Discipline in the Army
which was requisite for the ease of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because the Soldiers were unpaid, they
had the face to say, that by the Treaty the
<hi>Scots</hi> could not receive their Pay at present,
because there was a Clause, that if any part
thereof were behind, they should be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Interest for forbearance (which Interest
was not to be presently paid neither, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
when the Peace was setled and the
Kingdom more able) upon which these
conscionable Logicians infer'd, that allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Interest nothing could be demanded.
So that which the <hi>Scots</hi> gave way to out of
friendliness and confidence, to shew they
would not exact upon our necessities, if at
any time through the great occasions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
we were not able to give them their
full Pay, is now made use of, and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
turned upon them, to defer the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any part: And this only to affront
them, and make them desperate.</p>
            <p>52. And as they deal with the Army, so
did they with the State and Kingdom of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> by putting neglects and indignities
upon their Ministers, raising jealousies of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98370:35"/>
them and of the whole Nation. For this
they had their <hi>Robert Wright,</hi> and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Knight to give intelligence of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencies
held by them with the Queen,
of undertaking to do great matters for the
King, Treaties with <hi>France,</hi> strange designs
and practices against the Parliament, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
foot Letters of Information from some
well-wishers abroad to Mr. Sollicitor, or Sir
<hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> or some other of that Gang,
upon this strain. Then this is whisper'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and these Letters go from hand to
hand, and told as a secret in every bodies
Ears, to make people afraid and mistrust e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
their own Shadows, as if all were in
danger. Sometimes the House must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with some of these things, or some
person or other brought to the Bar to make
some relation, as Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmore.</hi> Then
the doors are shut, long winded Speeches
made to set out our dangers, and great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
rais'd of strange discoveries, and all
but a <hi>parturiunt montes.</hi> Yet this serves to
make a noise, and they had Instruments abroad
to improve it, and many hones well meaning
men were cozen'd and stood at gaze, knew
not what to think of their Brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
nor yet of the Members of either
House, and desir'd to have things more fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carry'd towards them; and as they had
had experience of their faithfulness former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98370:35"/>
so could they not be brought by such ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
to have an ill opinion of them without
better grounds for it, and therefore differ'd
in the entertainment they gave to those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms,
judging them false and causeless, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
expressing themselves, diverting
and breaking the desperate thrusts which
these men made, and were therefore decry'd
as Scotish, malignant, and prejudged in all
they did or said.</p>
            <p>53. The malice against the <hi>Scots</hi> rests not
here, it carries them to discover and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
slighting and neglecting, and (that not
sufficiently provoking) a violent injuring
and affronting of them. First, they vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
not to answer the Papers they put into
the House, some not at all, none presently
(as formerly they were wont to do) nor in
any convenient time: but make them wait
days, and weeks, and months, for a return
to what the Commissioners present from the
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or from themselves in
the name of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>54. The Committee of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
is now no more in esteem, than (as
they say) a Saint without a Holiday: That
which before did manage all the great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which was looked upon with so much
reverence, even as a sacred thing, pray'd for
in the Churches like the Lords in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
had all the `trust, all the power, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98370:36"/>
in matters of War, which were wholly
left to them by the ordinance of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution;
but all other business of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
as framing propositions for Peace,
and all Addresses to his Majesty, all Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations
with foreign States, whatsoever did
in any high degree concern the Parliament
or Kingdom, was still referred to them, and
what they did, passed for Law, was seldom
or never alter'd in the House. But now the
Tide was turn'd, they had nothing to do.
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> was discharg'd of his
subordination to them, and left to himself,
to do as he saw cause with his Army.
They of the Committee, who were of that
Faction, seldom or never came to it; so
that the Commissioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
the other Members of it, did come and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
three or four days one after another,
sometimes oftner, to no purpose, and no
Committee could sit for want of a number:
nay, they prevail'd so far, as now to vilifie
and shew their neglect or jealousie of the
Scotish Commissioners. They would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
get business referred to the Members
of both Houses that were of that Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
with their Exclusion.</p>
            <p>55. To provoke them yet more, they
Break through the Law of Nations, which
in all places in the World give protection to
publick Ministers employed by any Prince
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98370:36"/>
or State, so as neither their Servants or Goods,
and especially not their Letters, which are
of greater consequence, and more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
concern the Honour and Interest both
of their Masters and them, ought to be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sort touch'd or stop'd; yet the Packets
of the Commissioners of <hi>Scotland</hi> must be
intercepted, and their Letters broke open.
This done several times in a secret and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
manner, the Letters suppressed and
never heard of more, which was a great
wrong and injury to that Kingdom; yet
cannot be said to be an affront, because
it was not avowed. But they have likewise
done it openly and avowedly in a most inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
way: Once they set a Captain, one
<hi>Massey,</hi> at the Guards by <hi>London,</hi> knowing
the Commissioners were sending an Express
into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and this Captain (who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be made an Example for it, and
his Masters too who set him to work) stops
the Gentleman who was sent with the Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
takes the very Letters they had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to the Committee of Estates, reads them,
and keeps the Messenger Prisoner upon the
Guard, which was the highest affront, the
greatest violation of the publick Faith, the
greatest scandal to all Princes, States, and
even Societies of Men, the basest unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
dealing with a Nation, to whom we
were engag'd by Amity, League, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98370:37"/>
common Interest, and all Bonds of
Gratitude for the good we had receiv'd from
them, that ever was heard of, or read in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Story, or I think ever will be again.
Yet was this fellow, by the power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of these Men, protected in the House
of Commons: So far from being punish'd,
when the Scotish Commissioners made their
Complaint, that when the Lords had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him for it, they made the House set
him at liberty, and quarrel with the Lords
for breaking their Privileges, in committing
one who was under examination of their
Committee: for they had refer'd the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to a Committee, in truth not to do
the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> any right in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
the Offender, but affront it the more
in protecting him.</p>
            <p>56. One would think now these had bid
fair for an absolute breach with <hi>Scotland,</hi>
but they are not satisfy'd yet; one thing
more they will do which they are confident
will do the feat. It is this; At the coming
in of the <hi>Scots,</hi> they had born them in hand,
they desir'd nothing but the uniting of the
Nations: That therefore they would never
make Peace without their advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
and that as they desir'd a conjunction
of Forces and Counsels for prosecution of the
War, so whensoever a Peace was made, they
desir'd a conjunction of Counsels and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98370:37"/>
for the preservation thereof, that so the
Kingdoms, interwoven one with another,
might be a mutual strength and security one
to another. Therefore in framing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
for Peace presented to the King at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and treated on at <hi>Vxbridg,</hi> which
was done at the Committee of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
they make it one proposition, That
some Commissioners from <hi>Scotland</hi> should be
joined with ours in the power of the Militia
of this Kingdom, and converse some of ours
with theirs in their Kingdom, and so bring
it to the House. Where my self, and many
more, who truly desir'd the joyning of the
Nations in love and good understanding to
perpetuity, opposed it, fearing that joining
them in that power would prove a dividing
of affection, which should be best set, and
so preserved by keeping several their several
Interests. But those carry'd it, and what
we fear'd prov'd true: it being afterward
made an occasion of great endeavours to set
the two Kingdoms farther asunder, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
was first done by them out of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
            <p>57. For now when the propositions were
to be sent again to the King to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> that
Party took their rise upon that proposition
to have them all review'd, and changed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all in them that look'd towards the
<hi>Scots,</hi> and gave themselves liberty, as they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98370:38"/>
had a large Field, to shew the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of admitting another Kingdom to share
power in this. And much was done and
said reflecting upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> and against all
such intermixtures. Then those who shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their dislike of it before, and would not
have had it done when it was to do, being
now done, did not desire at that time to have
it undone, in truth, unwilling there should
be any altering of the propositions at all;
not knowing where these Men would stop,
if once they began to change any part: And
therefore offer'd this consideration, that
though before it had been no wrong or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness
to our Brethren not to have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to such a Copartnership, which
they apprehended would prove rather a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
than otherwise, but being now in,
they thought it might be ill taken to thrust
them out, and argue a jealousie and change
of Affection, according to the Rule, <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius
ejicitur quam non admittitur,</hi> &amp;c. But
for that very reason were these Men the
more earnest for it, that it might be ill taken,
that it might argue a jealousie, that the
<hi>Scots</hi> might see by it, that the countenance,
of the Parliament was not to them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and that the Ligament being untied,
by which the two Kingdoms did seem to be
bound up together, they might fall in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the breach be the greater. O the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98370:38"/>
wickedness of these Men, that thirsted after
nothing but to see the two Kingdoms wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
in that blood which they must let out
of one another's Veins! But that does the
more commend the goodness, piety, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and moderation of our Brethren of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> which prevented it; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all these provocations, all these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
and affronts, they were stedfast, they
were unmoveable in their resolutions to
promote the Peace of <hi>England.</hi> They said
they came in to help it, they will not be
made Instruments to destroy it: They had
bound themselves in a Covenant before God,
and in a Treaty with their Brethren of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
to endeavour by all good ways and
means a happy Settlement and Reformation
both in Church and State: The art and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of their Enemies, and the Enemies of
Peace, shall not engage them to become in
any sort an occasion of hindering it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they deny themselves, they renounce
their own interest, they quit all pretensions,
and agree with the Parliament in those alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
aand thereby defeat the expectation
of those who hop'd to see, not only the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
of Peace laid aside upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but that <hi>Scotland</hi> should have born the
blame, both of not making Peace with the
King, and also of all the Miseries which must
have followed upon both Kingdoms by a
rupture and breach between 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:98370:39"/>
58. When they saw they could not by
Art and underhand-dealing compass this
Breach, that neither the <hi>Scots</hi> would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
to declare against the Parliament, and
so the War begin on that side; nor could
they engage the Northern Counties to fall
upon them: If either of which had taken,
they had still kept themselves behind the
Curtain, and hid the Arm which had thrown
the Stone; they had seem'd, alas, innocent
well-meaning Men, and yet the mischief
befallen which they had contriv'd. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than fail they will throw of the Vizard,
and come downright with open face, to the
executing their Design. They set on their
Teazers, as <hi>Haslerig, Mildmay, Martin,</hi> and
many others, to move, That Sir <hi>Thomas
Fairfax</hi> might go down with his Army to
protect those Northern Counties, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them from the oppression of the <hi>Scots,</hi>
a pretty way of protection and giving ease,
to send an Army into a Country. We see
how this Army eases the Country now, to
the breaking both of their backs and hearts.
But, could they have gotten a Vote for this,
their work had been done, and we should
soon have heard of mischief and felt it: The
animosity between those two Armies had
instantly put them and the Kingdoms into
blood, for which, no question, Sir <hi>Thomas
Fairfax</hi> had his Instructions, but the House
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98370:39"/>
would never give way to it, tho with earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
prest many times by that Party. And
when they saw they could not prevail, the
presumptions are very strong, that they would
have had the Army to have march'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without the Parliament's order: for the
<hi>Scots</hi> had an alarm of the Army's moving
towards them, and their Commissioners so
inform'd the House, with a protestation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, upon which there was a stop,
with a denial and disavowment of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any such intention. Yet certainly there
was an attempt, and it is said, orders out for
part of the Army to move that way; but God
be thanked it went no further, for that would
have been a sad business.</p>
            <p>59. Before I go off this matter, I must do
that right to Col. <hi>Pointz,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Northern Forces, as to attribute to
his care and vigilancy, and his discreet or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of his business, a great part of our
happiness, that all that mischief was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
which was so earnestly endeavour'd
to be pull'd on us, by engaging the Country
and Scotish Army in quarrel and bloodshed;
and that was his Crime with these Men to
be for it, since so unjustly put out of his
Command, after they had stir'd up the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
Rabble of the Agitators, to take him
by violence out of his House at <hi>York,</hi> being
as absolutely in his Command as <hi>Fairfax</hi> was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98370:40"/>
in his: Meerly doing it by an act of power,
force, and violence, breaking through all
Rules of Justice, Equity, and Honesty,
bringing him a Prisoner to the Army, not
suffering him so much as to put on his
Clothes, or speak to his Wife, or any
Friend, but use him as if he had been the
greatest Traytor in the world, when Sir
<hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> could not pretend to the least
jurisdiction over him, not any thing could
be laid to his charge. Such is their hatred of
every honest Man, who stands in their way
to their pernicious designs.</p>
            <p>60. Their next hope was, that the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Army would not go out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
at the desire of the Parliament; so bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Noses would be upon that occasion: and
I must give them their due, there was no
failure in them, to do all that was possible
to have kept them in still only to quarrel
with them, but with a seeming to desire
nothing so much as their going. Very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
they were to get the Vote of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
that they should be gone; but to
inable them to go they would not help, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hinder, and hang on all the weights
they could. To say the truth, they had
some ground to believe, First, That they
would not go, Secondly, That they could
not, if they would; for the <hi>Scots</hi> had a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
if not just reason to have refus'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:98370:40"/>
61. By the Covenant and Treaty, the
two Kingdoms had bound themselves before
God and one to another, as one intire Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to prosecute the Cause (these are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
words of the Declaration of both Houses
to the State of the united Provinces, which
Declaration Mr. Sollicitor himself penn'd,
therefore they must hold it Canonical) and
that neither Kingdom should lay down Arms
till the Ends mention'd in the Covenant
and Treaty were obtain'd. If then in this
Cause the Forces of both Kingdoms made
but one intire Body, the <hi>Scots</hi> had a good
Plea, Why will you send us away and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
us wholly? This proceeding is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
the Body must suffer, and cannot act
as an intire Body if one whole Member be
cut off; or if there be no more need of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if the Ends be obtain'd for which the
Body was constituted, and therefore you
send us away, then why do you keep up
your own Army, the other part of this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
This had certainly been strong reason,
which Mr. Sollicitor would have been puzled
to answer.</p>
            <p>62. Besides, the <hi>Scots</hi> had cause enough
to have their jealousie prompt them, that it
was not safe for them to depart with their
Army, lay by their Swords, and leave stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this Kingdom so great a Force, which
they knew to be so ill affected to them, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98370:41"/>
might act to their prejudice; and the King
being in their power, perhaps force both
him and the Parliament to a Peace disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and differing from those
grounds upon which, by the Kingdom of
<hi>England,</hi> they were engag'd in this Quarrel:
or else make no Peace at all, but interpose
(as <hi>Cromwel</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi>) to
hinder it, and themselves govern by the
Sword, not only to the prejudice of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
but also ruin of <hi>England.</hi> One may swear
there was ground enough for such a fear;
for since it hath prov'd so to purpose. But
according to the old Rule, they who mean
well themselves, are not suspicious of others.
The <hi>Scots</hi> had no thoughts but of setling a
Peace, laying down of Arms, calling the
People, and all things to revert into their
old Channel; therefore they were willing
to be gone and return into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
in confidence that after their departure,
the Army under Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> should
likewise presently be disbanded, since there
was no more need of any Army at all, so
they were willing to go.</p>
            <p>63. But then the question was if they
would go or not, and how the Soldiers would
be dispos'd to march out, who had not been
paid of so many Months, insomuch as the
Scotish Commissioners gave in an account of
some 800000 <hi>l.</hi> Arrears. Here our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98370:41"/>
hop'd they had them upon the Hip,
and should surely give them a fall. Then
they thrust on some of their little Northern
Beagles, as Mr. <hi>Blaxton,</hi> and others, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what high Sums they had rais'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Country; upon which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Scotish Army was in their debt,
and therefore they would come to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with them, which had been a sure
way to have kept them in the Kingdom
five or six months longer. But to help that,
our just Pay-masters said the Army should
march away, and some persons be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
to see all accounts adjusted: which had
requir'd very good Rhetorick to have made
it Justice, especially to have appear'd so to
the Scotish Soldiers: for to have sent them
away without Money, and then ask the
Country-man what the Soldiers had taken,
when he might say what he thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> good,
the Soldier not there to answer for himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and yet his Pay to be thereby determin'd,
would have been but hard measure. But
the Rhetorick had been, Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi>
to have gone down with his Army,
which should have made it just, and easie,
and every thing; for this was it they desir'd
to bring it to, as it was often mov'd and
press'd by them.</p>
            <p>64. At last the well-wishers to Peace
with much ado prevail'd in the House, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98370:42"/>
it was carry'd to offer the <hi>Scots</hi> a gross Sum
for all, so to part fair, and avoid the delay
and disputes of an account, to which they
presently agreed. Then the question was
what Sum. Here again we had a strong
debate: For our Incendiaries hung by every
twig, sticking fast to their Principles to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfie
the <hi>Scots,</hi> and break with them (if
possible) upon any point; pretending the
poverty of the Kingdom, and the great Sums
the <hi>Scots</hi> had rais'd, and therefore they
would give but 100000 <hi>l.</hi> which they knew
was all one with a hundred Shillings, as to
the satisfying of the Soldiers for marching
away. In the end, after many debates in
the House, and passages to and again with
the Scotch Commissioners, the lowest Sum
that could be agreed unto by the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
was 400000 <hi>l.</hi> two in hand, and the
other two after some time, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of theirs, that the Army would
not be satisfy'd with less, nor inabled to
march, which was motive enough for these
Men to deny it; for if they could have
wrought the dissatisfaction of the Army,
so as to have refus'd to go, it was where
they would have it. Whereupon 'twas op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
by them with all the power they had,
but in the end the better part, that is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Party, who were the Peace-makers,
those that labour'd to keep things even and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98370:42"/>
fair between the two Kingdoms, carry'd it:
And the sum was voted, and all things
agreed upon, tho with difficulty (for
they fought it out and lost it by Inches)
then the <hi>Scots</hi> declar'd they would march out
by such a day.</p>
            <p>65. Yet had our <hi>Boutefeus</hi> one hope left,
which was to quarrel at last about the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> believing the <hi>Scots</hi> would
certainly have taken his Majesty with them
into <hi>Scotland.</hi> This they knew had been
ground sufficient, and would have engag'd
all <hi>England</hi> against them, giving a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all the jealousies formerly rais'd, and
occasion'd a thousand more: And had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
more advantag'd the designs of those
who thirsted after the destruction of the
King first, the <hi>Scots</hi> next, and then all such
as desir'd Peace within this Kingdom, and
have made them a smoother way to their
damnable Ends, the altering of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and bringing in a confusion both in
Church and State, than any thing that could
have happen'd: And the two Kingdoms
had been together in blood, the author of the
mischief undiscover'd, mask'd over with the
glorious pretences of zealously vindicating
the honesty and interest of <hi>England,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
breach of Covenant and Treaty in this
Cause, which made them with so much pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptoriness
and incivility, and in truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:98370:43"/>
demand that the <hi>Scots</hi> would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
up his Majesty, who had an equal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in his Royal Person with the Kindom of
<hi>England,</hi> he being equally King of both,
and an equal interest in the closing and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the unhappy differences which were
between him and both his Kingdoms, they
having been engag'd in that Quarrel at
the entreaty of <hi>England,</hi> and made up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with an intire Body with <hi>England</hi>
(as is before shewed) for the prosecution
of it. Therefore they had no more reason
to trust us with the King than we had
them; and as much were they concern'd
in all that related to his Majesty's Person,
so as they had ground enough to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
it, and out of that hope was it press'd
by the others. But the wisdom of the Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Nation foresaw the inconveniencies
which must have necessarily follow'd, had
they been positive at that time, how they had
plaid their Enemies game to their own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and even ruin to his Majesty. Therefore
they made for him the best conditions they
could, that is for the safety and honour of
his Person, and to avoid greater mischiefs,
were necessitated to leave him in <hi>England,</hi>
and so march away. Which they did in
<hi>February</hi> 1646.</p>
            <p>66. Here then the very mouth of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
was stopt, Malice it self had nothing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98370:43"/>
to say to give the least blemish to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and reality of the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the clearness of their Proceedings,
their zeal for Peace, without self-seeking
and self-ends, to make advantage of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
and misfortunes of <hi>England.</hi> This
gave such a reputation to them, and to those
that appear'd for them (that is, so far for
them, as to endeavour the doing of them
right, and prevent the practices of those
who sought all means of doing them wrong)
and gave such a blow to the other violent
Party, so broke their power, and lessen'd
their authority in the Parliament, as it made
way for obtaining those resolutions which
were presently taken for disbanding Sir
<hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>'s Army. Till when, by the
fomenting jealousies against the <hi>Scots,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all moderate and well affected persons,
as if their designs were to betray the Cause,
deliver over the Honour, and Interest, and
Strength of <hi>England,</hi> into the hands of the
<hi>Scots,</hi> they prevail'd so far, generally upon
the affection of the people, and especially
upon many well-meaning (but not so well
discerning) persons, Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they were able to suppress all good
motions tending towards Peace, all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of smoothing those rugged ways that
their violence had put all things in, and to
swell up that Independent Army, like the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98370:44"/>
Spleen in the Body by the concourse of all ill
humours, to the ruin and consumption of
the Body it self: And yet other Forces ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shier'd,
as Major General <hi>Massey</hi>'s Brigade,
which had done all the Service in the West,
of which those Drones robb'd the sweet, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the honour and advantage of it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
That tho that Army was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd

to whom they did the honour of letting them
perform all the Action which that Army
had to do, and who every one of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
left it, when it left its obedience to
the Parliament and fidelity to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and that they grew to be not only an
unnecessary grievous burden in respect of
charge, but also a let and hinderance to the
setling all Government both civil and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,
neither submitting themselves to
order of Parliament, nor permitting others
where they could hinder it; but giving
countenance to all disorders, especially in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98370:44"/>
the Church, as breaking open the Church
doors, doing most unseemly barbarous things,
indeed not fit to be related either to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
or Christian Ears, and in time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service interrupting Ministers as they
were preaching, miscalling, reviling them,
sometimes pulling them down by violence,
beating and abusing them, getting into the
Pulpits themselves, and venting either ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
or scandalous things, false and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Doctrins, countenancing and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seditious Pamphlets (for which they
had a Press that follow'd the Army) decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both King and Parliament and all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
infusing a rebellious Spirit into the
people, under the pretence of Liberty and
Freedom. All this notwithstanding while
the Scotish Army was in the Kingdom.
Such things were whisper'd, such jealousies
and fears rais'd, as these inconveniencies
were not only dispens'd with, but the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
supported and cherish'd as if they had
been tutelary Gods, those who must have
protected and deliver'd us from all danger,
and all that the Parliament and Kingdom
could do, little enough to feed and maintain
them, tho an excrescence that drew away
the whole nourishment of the Body, and
starv'd it.</p>
            <p>67. But afterwards when the Kingdom
saw how they had been abus'd, made to fear
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98370:45"/>
where no fear was, and were come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they soon grew to feel the weight of
that which lay upon them, and seek for ease.
Then City and Country could petition the
Parliament for disbanding the Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of their intolerable disorders and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities,
and the Parliament was well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
for it, who now likewise discover'd
the art and malice of the Independent Party,
a Spirit they had rais'd which they would
gladly lay, and consider'd, that as such an
Army was dangerous, so none at all was
needful, that <hi>Ireland</hi> wanted what we had
too much of, Soldiers.</p>
            <p>68. Besides, they well saw that whilst that
Army stood, they should never be able to
relieve <hi>Ireland</hi> to any purpose, the stock of
the Kingdom was swallow'd up in their
maintenance; and tho for the space of a whole
year there had not been an Enemy in the
Field, nor Town possess'd by any to find
them employment, yet they recruited daily,
all care being taken for sending them Pay,
Arms, Provision, Clothes, with all other
necessaries, as if they were every day upon
hard and dangerous Service, when they did
nothing but trouble and oppress the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so as notwithstanding their glorious
pretences of fighting for Conscience, not
Pay, sacrificing themselves to God and the
Kingdom's Cause, none of them would stir
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98370:45"/>
to help the poor Protestants in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
but even hinder'd what they could
all others from going.</p>
            <p>69. Which appear'd by Colonel <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s
Capitulation, being design'd for the
Service of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who tho he were but an
Ensign to Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of those Wars, now a Colonel of the
new Model, stood upon his pantoufles,
That he would not be oblig'd for longer than
two or three Months, have all his Pay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, Victuals for six Months tho he
would stay but two, be absolute Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of all the Forces there, have a proportion
of Money over and above for contingent
occasions put into what hands he would
appoint, a Fleet of Ships to transport him,
wait upon him, and be at his disposing, not
to stir without his leave, in truth he must
be Admiral and General; such Terms as no
Prince or foreign State that had but given an
assistance could have stood upon higher.
This was the obedient conscientious Army;
but most Men were satisfy'd if it was not
disbanded <hi>Ireland</hi> must be lost, and <hi>England</hi>
undone.</p>
            <p>70. The Parliament therefore taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their consideration the necessity of relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that dying Kingdom, after long debate,
and much opposition from all that Party,
came at last to a resolution in <hi>May</hi> 1647,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98370:46"/>
and vote, that a certain proportion of Foot
and Horse should forthwith be transported
into <hi>Ireland</hi> (as I remember seven Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Foot, of which four I am certain
were to be taken out of the Army) they
further vote, that no Foot should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
in <hi>England,</hi> but those that were to be
for the necessary defence of the Garisons,
and that about five thousand Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
should remain under Pay in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
for quieting and preventing any stir
or trouble, either within or from abroad,
to interrupt proceedings till a settlement of
Affairs: Peoples Minds after such Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being, like the Sea after a Storm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
for some time tho the wind be abated.
Those Men would have had a far greater
number, and press'd it earnestly, saying,
We laid by our strength that all might be
deliver'd back into the King's hands; and
tho even this proportion seem'd very great
to discreet and moderate Men, yet they
pitch'd upon it, partly to stop the mouths of
these Railers, and give satisfaction to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
persons, who look'd not so far into
business, and were apt enough to be misled
into jealousies and suspicions, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they well hop'd it would be but for
some short time that this charge should be
continu'd upon the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:98370:46"/>
71. Here then is the Ax first laid to the
root of this broad spreading Tree, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
a dismal Cypress, the shadow and
dropping whereof were so pernicious as to
darken all the comfortable beams of our
Sun-shine of Peace, and suffer no good thing
to prosper near it; this vext the Children
of darkness, who now must cast about,
shake Heaven and Earth, raise all the black
Spirits of Hell, confound Sea and Land, and
all the Elements, rather than permit this to
take place.</p>
            <p>72. The Parliament goes on with this
work, refers it to the Committee of Lords
and Commons at <hi>Derby-house,</hi> to see those
Votes concerning <hi>Ireland</hi> put in execution.
The eleven Members were almost all of
them of that Committee, who may say <hi>Hinc
illae Lacrimae.</hi> For doing their parts, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the rest, in discharge of the duty
and trust which lay upon them to take care
of that poor Kingdom, and discovering the
designs of the Army to frustrate all the
good designs of the Parliament, they incur
the mortal hatred of the Party and Army
which have driven them from their Homes,
and Country, and City of <hi>London,</hi> without
the privity or consent of the House of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
The Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Dacres,</hi> Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,</hi>
Major General <hi>Massey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:98370:47"/>
are the persons employ'd. These la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to dispose Officers and Soldiers to a
compliance with the necessities of <hi>Ireland;</hi>
but at the very first were receiv'd with a
mutinous acclamation amongst the Officers
whom they had call'd together, some of
them crying out, One and all, and the
whole Company disturb'd and distemper'd.
So as finding it not convenient to deal with
them together in a body, they desir'd, that
such as had a sense of the miserable condition
of that Kingdom, and a will to ingage for
the relief of it, would repair to them to their
Lodgings, which very many did, Colonels
and Lieutenant Colonels, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and undertook for themselves, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
considerable number of their Soldiers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
1500, or 2000, casting themselves
wholly upon the Parliament for their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The rest of the Officers and Soldiers
of the Army doing all that was possible to
obstruct the Service, decrying the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
railing upon, misusing, threatning,
and thereby discourage those who engag'd,
calling them deserters of the Army and of
their General, and by great offers and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of better conditions to stay with them
keeping of others.</p>
            <p>73. And at that very time did some of
the Officers meet and prepare a Petition, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a Representation, in the name
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98370:47"/>
of the whole Army, That before disbanding
there might be an Act of Indemnity with
the King's royal Assent to it; that Auditors
might speedily repair to the Army to cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
up their Accounts for their Service from the
beginning; that none who had serv'd volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
in that Army should be compel'd to
go out of the Kingdom; that till disbanded,
Money might be sent down for their supply.
This was a fair beginning of the godly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
taking care for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of those
good Officers proceedings, so obedient to
the Parliament, as meerly for that they had
been made choice of and put into the rooms
of far better Men than themselves; now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
when the Parliament would have some
of them go for <hi>Ireland,</hi> they will put the
whole Army into a Mutiny.</p>
            <p>74. For an Army, or any part of it, to
join in a Petition, tho but for Pay, when
their Superiors (that Authority which they
are to obey) require any Duty to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
or Service to be done by them, as
the present relieving of <hi>Ireland</hi> was, this,
I think, by the Rules of War, has in all
Armies been held a Mutiny, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
at least, punish'd with death. Here
to be sure it shall mutiny to purpose, and
not disband according to the resolutions of
Parliament; they put them not only to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
in this mutinous way, but to desire
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98370:48"/>
impossibilities, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> says, <hi>Non ut asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querentur
sed causam seditioni,</hi> not to rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
with former Ordinances, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
care taken for all who had serv'd in
these unhappy Wars, but to demand a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Act of Indemnity with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
approbation, not that they car'd for
him, or meant ever to see him again in
power to enact any thing, which their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
since have made clear to all mens
understandings (though some discern'd it
very well to be their principle and their
drift from the beginning) but they knew
this would take up time, could not possibly
be so soon done, and would elude all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of disbanding. So for Auditors to go
and cast up their Accounts was the work of
many Months, and a strange demand for
this godly obedient Army to make, who,
by their own sayings, were not Mercenary,
but had taken up Arms in judgment and
conscience, and out of love and duty to the
Parliament, not for their Pay. Their other
demand is as good, and is as much as to say,
as that the Parliament should send none of
them for <hi>Ireland,</hi> they who were the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Army, who, as Mr. <hi>Cromwel</hi> made us
believe, would go with a word to any part of
the World, whither the Parliament would
please to send them; and therefore the other
Armies and Major General <hi>Massey</hi>'s Forces
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98370:48"/>
must be cashier'd (those who certainly
would have gone) to make way for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.
These now who had receiv'd
the Pay of the Kingdom so long, the sole
Army, which, like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean Kine,
had eaten all the rest, and had the Sword of
the Parliament singly and wholly in their
hands, stand upon terms, and will not be
compell'd to go, that is, will not go; for
they know none is compell'd for <hi>Ireland,</hi>
nor was there any thought of it, since many
were willing to ingage in that War who
were not so in this; but this was enough to
possess the Army with a prejudice against
the imployment, and against the intentions
and proceedings of Parliament.</p>
            <p>75. This Petition and other of their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
so interrupted the business, that our
Commissioners at their return inform'd
both Houses of it, who yet were so tender
of conceiving or expressing any great dislike
of the contrivers and promoters of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for obstructing the Service of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and distempering the Army, and that those
who had but been drawn in it should not
find themselves lessen'd in their good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
who resolv'd to pass by all, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
none, except such as should mutinously
persist in the promoting of it. They sent like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
up for some of the Officers that had more
notoriously appear'd therein, and in discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98370:49"/>
and abusing them who offer'd
themselves in the Irish Service: Whose
miscarriage, though it was very gross, and
the answers of some of them at the House
of Commons Bar mere collusion and equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
(as by name Lieutenant Colonel
<hi>Pride</hi>'s, who being charg'd with causing
the Petition to be read at the head of his
Regiment, deny'd it stoutly, because, it
seems, it was but at the head of every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
the Regiment not being drawn up
together) notwithstanding all this, the
House willing to bury what was past, and
hoping it would have gain'd them to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obedience for the future, sent them down
again, rather with respect than otherwise,
acquiescing with their denyal. And this
very act of Clemency was turn'd against
them; and afterwards when the Army
came to do their work barefac'd, no longer
to excuse but justifie that Petition, nay,
make the Parliament criminous for questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
it, they upbraided the House with
sending up for the Officers from their
Charge, when they had nothing to say to
them.</p>
            <p>76. The necessity of disbanding more and
more appearing, it hastens the resolutions
for it; whereupon it was order'd, that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and Soldiers should have six weeks
Pay of their Arrears, and so be disbanded,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98370:49"/>
those that would be taken in for <hi>Ireland</hi> to
have six weeks more advance. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at first pitch'd upon no greater Sum,
it being the highest that had yet been given
to any. Major General <hi>Massey's</hi> Brigade,
which had been much longer without Pay,
and had done better Service, had no more.
The other Armies under my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi>
and Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> which had likewise
done more work, the chief and main of it
all, as having had a stronger Force to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with, and yet had receiv'd less Wages,
were put off with a fortnights Pay. This
made the Parliament think this proportion
sufficient; yet afterwards they of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
increas'd it to two months, which
was more than any had before. Supposing
then there would be no question of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
they proceed to perfect what was
further necessary for the supply of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and safety of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>77. For <hi>England</hi> they appointed what
Regiments of Horse and Dragoons shall
stand, settle the Garisons, name Sir <hi>Thomas
Fairfax</hi> General of all the Forces under Pay,
which was sufficient Honour for him for the
Service he had done; and shew'd that they
had no meaning to dismiss those with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
who had serv'd them, as they were
falsely scandaliz'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:98370:50"/>
78. For <hi>Ireland,</hi> they make Serjeant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General <hi>Skippon</hi> Commander in Chief,
with the Title of Field Marshal, and Major
General <hi>Massey</hi> Lieutenant General of the
Horse; recommended it to the care of the
Committee at <hi>Derby house,</hi> to prepare all
things necessary for the forwarding of that
Service, and draw off such of the Army as
were willing to go: for the distempers
there continu'd, those who had declar'd
themselves being affronted, discourag'd, and
many of them debaucht from that Service.</p>
            <p>79. This was faithfully perform'd by the
Committee (that is, by part of it) for some
of them, as the Sollicitor, <hi>Cromwel,</hi> Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur
Haslerig,</hi> and those of that gang would
not attend, but the others did. And if I
may speak it without vanity, it being one
of the great Crimes with which the eleven
Members stand charg'd, by their care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
they put the whole business into such
a way, not only doing their best endeavours
to have sent over the Forces that should have
gone out of the Army, but sending over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
also, as Colonel <hi>Iones,</hi> and those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
which went to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the best they could my Lord <hi>Inchiqueen,</hi>
and those Forces which were there before,
with such necessaries as they could provide,
that by the blessing of God the foundation
was laid for all the good which has since
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98370:50"/>
befallen that Kingdom, and for the great
advantages which those gallant Men have
gotten upon the Rebels, notwithstanding
the little assistance they have since receiv'd,
having, in truth, been rather hinder'd than
helpt; for every body knows the malice
which is born them by that Party which
now bears sway, what discouragements
my Lord <hi>Inchiqueen</hi> has labour'd under,
and the small regard had of Colonel <hi>Iones.</hi>
Yet they have subsisted, and not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
but advanc'd very much the English
Interest, with Honour to themselves, and
shame to these unworthy Men who are so
little sensible of the conditions of the poor
Protestants there, preferring their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
revenge and prosecution of their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
End before all that is of Honour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and either of duty to God and their
Country, or compassion to their distressed
Brethren.</p>
            <p>80. The Officers in the mean time play
their parts below in the Army, they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
engag'd the Soldiers to stand upon
Pay, an Act of Indemnity, and some other
Immunities, plausible things to make them
all of a piece, enter into a kind of a league
and combination one with another, and so
become fit to receive any other impression,
and unite upon it. Therefore now they go
a step further, to incense them against the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98370:51"/>
Parliament, misrepresenting all passages and
proceedings to them, as if the intention
were to force them for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore
starve them or dismiss them with shame,
and expose them to question and trouble for
what they had done in the Wars; so enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them to persist upon their demands in
that Petition, and ask reparation of the
Parliament for wrong done them by the
Commissioners sent down for the business of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and other Members of the House,
whom they had characteriz'd to be Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Army, whereby they put them
into such a distemper, as all thoughts of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and obedience were cast off, nothing so
odious as the Parliament, nothing would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
but revenge.</p>
            <p>81. When they had wrought the Feat,
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> himself came to <hi>London</hi>
upon pretence of taking Physick; <hi>Cromwel,
Ireton, Fleetwood, Rainsborough,</hi> who were
Members of the House of Commons as well
as principal Officers of the Army, keep the
House, that the Soldiers might be left to
themselves to fire the more, run up to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
and put themselves into a posture
to carry on their work of Rebellion with a
high and violent hand, which had been so
handsomly done: for either they must have
appear'd in it and join'd with the Soldiers,
which had been too gross, or have stop'd it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:98370:51"/>
in the beginning, crush'd the Serpent in the
Egg, which had been most easie, but was
contrary to their design. So now they give
the business time to foment, and the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
to grow to some head, that afterwards
when they should come amongst them (for
they could not but expect the Parliament
would send them down) they might seem
to be carry'd with the violence, and to give
some way for preventing greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and to keep them from extremities
till the Monster was form'd, and got to
that strength as to protect it self and them,
when they might without danger declare
for it, which they afterwards did. In the
mean time disclaiming it, blaming the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
at that distance (as <hi>Cromwel</hi> did open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the House, protesting, for his part, he
would stick to the Parliament) whilst under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
they sent them encouragements and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections;
for nothing was done there, but
by advice and countenance from <hi>London,</hi>
where the whole business was so laid, the
Rebellion resolv'd upon, and the Officers
that were in town so deeply engag'd, that
when the full time was come for putting
things in execution, my friend <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
who had been sent down by the Parliament
to do good Offices, was come up again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing any, and he who had made those
solemn publick Protestations with some
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98370:52"/>
great Imprecations on himself if he fail'd in
his performance, did, notwithstanding, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
convey thence his Goods (which many
of the Independents likewise did, leaving Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Parliament as mark'd out for destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
and then without leave of the House
(after some Members missing him and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him gone, had mov'd to have him sent
for; whereupon he being, as it seems, not
yet gone, and having notice of it, came and
shew'd himself a little in the House) did
steal away that evening, I may say run away
post down to the Army, and presently join
in the Subscription of a rebellious Letter,
whereof I shall speak anon. But let him
take heed those Imprecations fall not upon
him, which many times God remembers,
and takes Men at their word, meeting with
them in their dissembling wishes, when
themselves least think of them, perhaps
have forgot that ever they made them. This
by the way.</p>
            <p>82. For the present the thing pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was to set up a kind of Council (like
the supreme Council of the Irish Rebels, but
that those were most of them persons of
birth and degree, these <hi>ex faece populi</hi>) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of Agitators. Two (as I
take it) were chosen out of every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
at first, I think, but common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
(tho afterwards some Officers were
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98370:52"/>
added) to transact this business. These
now, forsooth, seem to acknowledg no
Officer, but to rule and dispose of all things
as they think good. They take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
what is fit to be done, what not,
and give their orders accordingly, examine
and censure the Orders and Votes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
receive all Complaints, give the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,
send out their Warrants and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
write their Letters, exercise a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
power over all, set up a new form of
Government in the Army, and in the end
are instrumental to their Masters to possess
themselves of his Majesty's Person, subdue
Parliament, City, and Kingdom, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
upon all those who had formerly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
any disturbance to the carrying on of
their design, till such time as the work was
done which they had set them to do. But then
Mr. <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his Officers could give a
stop to their proceedings. And when the
Agitators thought to do as formerly, and
finish'd what they were made to believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
should be the Catastrophe of their Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which was the destruction of the King,
and alteration of the Government, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
not being at that time so dispos'd, nor
the time ripe for the execution, they soon
found their Locks were cut, and (the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of their Superiors ceasing) their strength
fail'd, so as they brought but confusion to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98370:53"/>
three of the chief were condemn'd
to die for mutiny, but <hi>Cromwel</hi> being a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Prince would take but one, who was
shot to death, the rest reduced to subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and obedience, their Council Table dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,
and their Castles in the Air Vanish'd
to smoak. But these things fell out long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for a time they triumph, act all, drive
on the design; <hi>Cromwel</hi> and his fellows
standing behind the Curtain, laught in their
sleeves, and pleas'd themselves to see the
Game which they had packt, play so well.</p>
            <p>83. The first Act of these new Rulers,
was a Letter sent to their three principal
Officers, who were then in <hi>London,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
persons, God knows, knew nothing
of all this, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> Lieutenant
General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and Serjeant Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Skippon.</hi> For this last, to do him right,
I think that at that time he was innocent
indeed; but afterwards I must avow it, he,
together with the help of Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>er,
contributed more to the success of
their Villanies, betraying the Parliament
and City into their hands, than all that
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> the Sollicitor, <hi>Ireton,</hi> and the rest
of the Crew did or could do, and no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
will be sufficiently rewarded for it by
them; for they are good at it to pay dear
out of the publick Store for any man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that will be sold, and may be useful
to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:98370:53"/>
84. This Letter was an exclamation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Parliament, false and untrue
Complaints of wrongs done to the Soldiers
at Assizes in the Counties, a protestation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Irish Expedition, calling it a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to break the Army, declaring if any of
these three Commanders should engage,
their averseness to it (tho one of them,
<hi>Skippon,</hi> was by the Parliament appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and had accepted it) in plain English
saying they would not disband, nor receive
any other propositions from the Parliament
till their expectations were satisfy'd. Three
of the Agitators brought it, and <hi>Skippon</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the House with it; they were sent
for, and carry'd themselves at the Bar in a
slighting braving manner, refusing to answer
such questions as the Speaker, by order of the
House, ask'd them; saying they were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
by the Army, and could not without
leave from thence discover any thing. Many
the House resenting this high affront, were
earnest to have them severely punish'd; but
that Party stood as stifly for them, insomuch
that the worthy Burgess of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Warmworth,</hi> stood up and said he would
have them committed indeed, but it should
be to the best Inn of the Town, and good
Sack and Sugar provided them, which was
as ridiculous, as 'twas a bold and insolent
scorn put upon the Parliament; at last even
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98370:54"/>
Mr. <hi>Skippon</hi> himself excused them, said they
were honest Men, and wisht they might
not be too severely dealt with: whereupon
the House flatted, let them go without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and by tameness encreas'd their
madness and presumption. Where as had
they serv'd them as Mr. <hi>Cromwel</hi> after wards
did their fellows, hang'd one of them (they
all well deserving it) it might probably
have given a stop to their Career, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
a great deal of mischief, which has
since befallen the Kingdom by their means.</p>
            <p>85. All that we did (whether it was
Fate or Design I know not, but it prov'd
our Ruin) was to command down to the
Army the Officers that were Members of
the House, such as were in town, and the
General himself. I say, I know not if there
were a design in it; because afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
just such another occasion, we sent Sir
<hi>Henry Vane</hi> the younger, Mr. <hi>Scawen,</hi> and
some others, which I am sure was a thing
laid; and this wrought the same effect as that
did, even put them together the better to
contrive and lay their business, joining the
counsels of the Officers to the actings of the
Agitators, so to hatch that horrid Rebellion
which soon after broke out, to the utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
(if God's hand of mercy interpose not)
of Parliament and Kingdom. They were
sent to allay the distempers, and to prevent
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98370:54"/>
inconveniencies, but how they discharg'd
that trust will soon appear.</p>
            <p>86. Instead of discountenancing, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and suppressing that disposition to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny,
that standing upon terms with the
Parliament, those Meetings and Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by which the ill humour was nourish'd,
and instead of perswading them to a fitting
obedience and submission, and laying the
Regiments farther asunder to lessen and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the contagion, they gave them occasion
to encrease their distempers and vent them,
by asking them what they will have, calling
the Officers together, and sending them to
their several Regiments to be inform'd of
their designs; and by drawing them together
already so indispos'd and inflam'd, inflame
them the more. A strange way of quieting
an Army that was in a way to Rebellion,
and had begun to set up a new Government
amongst themselves by their Agitators,
which sped accordingly, and produced the
effect that they desir'd, a representation of
Grievances, in which the whole Army now
join'd and engag'd, except some few gallant
Men, both Officers and Soldiers, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
those proceedings.</p>
            <p>87. This Representation is brought up to
the House by Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
and Colonel <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> who had the faces to
say (just as the Representation begins) That
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98370:55"/>
the Army was quiet and free from any visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
distemper, which was only to amuse us.
But then it expostulates with the Parliament
the making of the foremention'd Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
sending for up and questioning those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who had been complain'd of for obstruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Service of <hi>Ireland,</hi> justifies them,
taxes the Commissioners of Parliament, and
other Members of the House, for doing ill
offices to the Army, stands upon all the
particulars of the first Petition.</p>
            <p>88. The House was very much dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
with these proceedings, and if ever it
deny'd it self, did it then: for it was willing
to give the Army satisfaction in all things
possible, to free the Kingdom of that burden,
even dispensing with their own Honours.</p>
            <p>89. They pass several Ordinances for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity,
freeing from pressing the relief of
maim'd Soldiers, Widows, and Orphans,
with such alterations and amendments as the
Army desir'd. Concerning the proposition
of Pay upon disbanding, which was eight
weeks, they conceiv'd it could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd,
in regard of the great present ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to which they were necessitated for
the supply of <hi>Ireland;</hi> That the two hundred
thousand Pounds, which for those two occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
were then borrow'd of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
would scarce serve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:98370:55"/>
90. Therefore upon these terms both
Houses concluded the disbanding, begin
with the Foot, and appoint to every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they lay quarter'd, a Rendevous
at some Town near, where they were to
lay down their Arms, receive their Money,
and have Passes to their several homes.
Those that would engage for <hi>Ireland</hi> to
march to some other place near hand, there
to receive Advance-money and further Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>91. The several Ordinances and Orders
were sent to Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> who then
had his head quarters at <hi>Bury;</hi> and two
Lords and four Commoners were appointed
Commissioners to repair to the several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
appointed for disbanding, with Money,
and directions to see the Service perform'd,
and assist Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> in it, who was
desir'd to issue out his Orders for the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
drawing to those places.</p>
            <p>92. Then it was refer'd to a Committee
of the Army to put into a way, the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Accounts, both of Officers and
Soldiers; and where more than two Months
appear'd to be due, the Commission Officer
was to receive his Debenter from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
and Treasurer of the Army, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appointed where he should be paid.
The inferior Officer and common Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
was to have his security upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98370:56"/>
Let any Man now judg if the Army
had any cause to complain, if all was not
done that with any colour of reason and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
could be expected.</p>
            <p>93. Our Commissioners, who were the
Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Lord <hi>De la Ware,</hi> Sir
<hi>Gilbert Gerard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Grinston,</hi> and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
went to <hi>Chelmsford</hi> the first of <hi>Iune,</hi>
the Rendevous appointed for the General's
Regiment, whither the Lieutenant Colonel
came, Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Iackson,</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and gallant Man, with a resolution to
conform to the Order of Parliament; but a
Command comes from the General to the
Regiment to march another way for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Quarter near together.</p>
            <p>94. For upon the 29<hi>th of May,</hi> when the
Votes were sending down for disbanding,
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> had call'd a Council of
War of the factious Officers (the honest Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
who were for submitting to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and a quiet disbanding, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been most of them abus'd, and forc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the violence of the Soldiers and
commands of the Agitators, he conniving at
it) where they resolve upon an humble Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to his Excellency, That since their
Grievances were not at all satisfy'd, and
Jealousies were very great, it would not be
safe to disband, but rather draw the Army
into a close posture (there being a great
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98370:56"/>
propensity in the Soldiers to a general Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devous)
and then resume the consideration
of their Grievances, and of the Votes for
disbanding, suspending, for the present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
proceedings upon these Votes; which
advice his Excellency follows. So the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
commands to disband, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>
to march away, and draw to a Rendevous:
Fit he should be obey'd.</p>
            <p>95. At the very same time Colonel <hi>Rains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi>
dos the like with his Regiment
which was at <hi>Petersfield</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for <hi>Iersey,</hi> and so far upon the way,
himself being attending the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
of which he was a Member, and
pretending to prepare for that Employment
which had been entrusted to him; but in
truth to give his Soldiers opportunity to
mutiny, as the rest of the Army did; who,
to give them more time for it, would not
presently acquaint the House with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
he had receiv'd of their disorder,
but having it in the morning kept it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
till towards the evening, even denying
his knowledg of any such thing, when Sir
<hi>William Lewis</hi> inform'd the House of it, and
about five or six a Clock in the Afternoon
(the House then by accident sitting, as these
deportments of the Army gave them cause
sufficient) spoke of it, said they were in a
great distemper, resolv'd not to march to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98370:57"/>
the Sea side, but return to <hi>Oxford;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
being sent down to quiet them, and
reduce them to obedience, he went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
but put himself at the head of them,
and instead of taking care for <hi>Iersey,</hi>
march'd to <hi>Oxford</hi> first, so to the Army;
and none more violent in the Rebellion than
he: for which good Service, and joyning
with the Agitators in their highest exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies
for the destruction of the King and
altering of Government, and particularly in
a Petition for taking away the House of
Lords, the House of Commons since made
him Vice Admiral. And the Lords, to the
eternizing the honour for their gentle tame
dispositions, consented.</p>
            <p>96. But one thing was yet wanting (as
they thought) for the carrying on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and amusing the poor people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with an expectation of their settling a
Peace, so to make them sit still and look on,
whilst they trampled upon Parliament, City
and Kingdom, which was to be possest of the
King's P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rson, and make the world believe
they would bring him up to his Parliament,
and set him on his Throne. For this it
seems a meeting was appointed at Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s, upon the thirtieth
of <hi>May,</hi> where it is resolv'd, That Cornet
<hi>Ioyce</hi> should, with a Party of Horse, go to
<hi>Holmby</hi> and seize upon his Majesty, which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98370:57"/>
is presently executed, and given out, that
others had the like design, which they had
prevented. At first it must seem only to be
the act of Mr. <hi>Ioyce, Cromwel</hi> protested he
knew nothing of it (tho he was the Man
appointed it to be done, as appears by what
has been recited, taken out of some of their
own Authors, one that calls himself <hi>Sirrah
Niho,</hi> and others) Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> writes
a Letter to the House, professes the same for
himself as in the presence of God, with a
large undertaking for the rest of his Officers,
and the body of the Army. And perhaps he
said true, I would fain be so charitable as to
believe it; nor indeed do I think the good
Man is privy to all their Plots, he must
have no more than what they are pleas'd to
carve and chew for him, but must swallow
all, and own them when they come abroad.
Here then they have the King, <hi>Ioyce</hi> drives
away the Guards, forc'd Colonel <hi>Greaves</hi> to
fly, whom else they threaten'd to kill, for
no man's life must stand in their way (Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
being no Sin in the visible Saints) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
away his Majesty and the Commissioners
that attend him Prisoners, and immediately
sends up a Letter to certifie what he had
done, with directions it should be deliver'd
to <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and he absent, to Sir <hi>Arthur
Haslerig,</hi> or Colonel <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> which was
given to Colonel <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> as one Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:98370:59"/>
               <hi>Markham</hi> inform'd the House, saying,
the Messenger that brought it told him so:
nor did Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig</hi> make a clear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
when he was ask'd concerning it in the
House, Colonel <hi>Fleetwood</hi> being at that time
gone to the Army, so as he could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd.</p>
            <p>97. By this trick they hope to catch the
people, and so find no resistance to their
traiterous proceedings; yet they will not
trust only to Jugling, they will play a sure
Game, and have power in their hands to go
through the work, and make their way if
it will not be given. Therefore the Army
must be put into a posture for it, they have
the Soldiers already, they must have Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
and Ammunition; so at the same meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Cromwel</hi> likewise appoints <hi>Ioyce</hi> (as the
same Authors relate) to repair to <hi>Oxford,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that Garison, the Magazine and Train
of Artillery which had there lain many
Months, the Army having had nothing
to do, and so no use for it, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Parliament had then order'd to be
remov'd and brought back to the Tower,
the place where all Stores are kept. But
those who were sent down by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for that purpose, were by these Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers
beaten and wounded, the Magazine
and Train kept away by force, and besides,
some 3 or 4000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money taken from
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98370:59"/>
them, which they had carry'd down for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding
of the Regiment there in Garison.
And now they think they have all in their
own hands, the Fish is catcht, they may
throw away the Net. They begin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forre
to appear in their own Colours; <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,
Ireton,</hi> with the rest of the Cabal, and
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> in the last place (who,
tho he be General, is not to lead, but will
be sure to follow close) may not lay aside
their innocency and their ignorance (for
all this while they knew nothing) and put
themselves in the head of the Agitators, own
all they have done, and at <hi>Triploe</hi> Heath,
near <hi>Cambridg,</hi> appoint a general Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
there to declare themselves, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowedly
enter into the Confederacy.</p>
            <p>96. At this Rendevous was fram'd that
solemn Engagement, wherein, they say,
they look upon the resolutions of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their disbanding, as proceeding
from malicious and mischievous Principles
and Intentions, and not without carnal and
bloody purposes. That therefore they are
resolv'd not to appear at the places thereto
appointed, and then declare, agree, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to and with each other, That till they
have such satisfaction in all their Grievances,
and such security for the future as shall be
agreed on at a Council, consisting of the
general Officers, with two Commission Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98370:60"/>
and two Soldiers to be chosen for each
Regiment, they will not disband or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
nor suffer themselves to be disbanded
or divided. And this is one result of that
meeting of the godly obedient Army, this
the fruit of the new Model, and of all the
great undertakings of that man of God (as
his Disciples call'd him) Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Cromwel</hi> in their behalf.</p>
            <p>99. They likewise frame there another
submissive business, which they call'd an
humble. Representation of the dissatisfaction
of the Army, in relation to the late resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for so sudden disbanding, where they
are more large in their humble cudgeling of
the Parliament, and do it to that purpose,
with a scorn of all that had been offer'd to
their satisfaction, say, The private Soldiers
will not regard what is behind of Pay after
disbanding, implying all must be had, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
further security for the Officers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears,
as Forest Lands, and the revenues
of Cathedrals, quarrel with the ordinances
past for Indemnity, exemption form Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
&amp;c. expostulate about the Declaration
against their seditious Petition yet standing
in force, demand reparation for questioning
their mutinous Officers, and will have it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those Members of the House who had
done but their duty, and discharg'd their
Consciences in that particular, declare
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98370:60"/>
plainly, That tho all their Grievances were
duly consider'd, it were nothing except
those persons were censur'd, calling them
Men of desperate Principles, Incendiaries,
that must not continue to be their Judges,
that is, must not sit in Parliament, and much
more of this nature, which in contempt they
send up to the House. These are they that
fight for privilege of Parliament, who have
made a Covenant with God and Man so to
do, and well they perform it; those they
mislike must be thrust out by head and
shoulders, and such as remain, if they be not
obedient to them, shall be serv'd with the
same sauce: And this is to make a free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
Was there ever a more perfidious
breach of Duty, did Rebellion it self ever
outdo it, can any Man think? Yet let us go
a little further with them, and we shall see
greater abominations than these.</p>
            <p>100. All this while they seem'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
only things concerning themselves, tho
very unfittingly and wickedly, both for
matter and manner; yet not to meddle
with any thing else concerning settling the
business of the Kingdom, which in many
Messages and Declarations they still protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against, saying (as Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>
wrote up from <hi>Cambridg</hi>) That whatever
was suggested or suspected, they would
leave all such matters to the wisdom of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98370:61"/>
Parliament. But now <hi>Tempora mutantur,</hi>
they have power in their hands, and the
Kingdom shall feel it; the Parliament shall
not only give them what they will have, but
do what they will have done, or smart for
it. They make the world believe they will
set the King on his Throne and in his
Rights, the People in their Liberties, the
Parliament in its Duty, and a Golden Age
is like to follow.</p>
            <p>101. To this end they march up in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile
way towards <hi>London,</hi> bring his Majesty
along with them from <hi>Royston.</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas
Fairfax, Cromwel, Ireton,</hi> and the rest of
the Officers, write a Letter to the Lord
Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council,
telling them, That the sum of what they
have desir'd of the Parliament, is a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to their demands as Soldiers, a
reparation upon those that have improv'd
advantages (as they falsely say) by false sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
and misrepresentations to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Army, and endeavour'd to
engage the Kingdom in a new War. That
the things they insist upon as English Men,
are a settlement of the Peace of the Kingdom,
and of the Liberties of the Subject, which
they say they have as much right to demand
as their Money, or other common Interest
of Soldiers, and that the honest People of
<hi>England</hi> are full of the sense of Ruin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98370:61"/>
should they disband before. That for
the obtaining of these things, they are draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near the City, and declare, That if the
City appear not against them, nor provoke
them, they will give no offence; but if they
do, they call God to witness they are free,
and have wash'd off the Ruin which will
befal it: that they will lose all rather than
not be righted of the Men they aim at, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desire, that like fellow Subjects and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the Citizens would follicite the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in their behaf.</p>
            <p>102. Here they first take upon them
openly to intermeddle with the business of
the Kingdom, contrary to all the former
Declarations and Protestations; but their
words nor yet their vows were ever any
rule to know their meaning by: as <hi>Hammond</hi>
told the King concerning <hi>Cromwel,</hi> so is it
with all those visible Saints, have they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
vow'd, sworn never so much, call'd
God and Man to witness, if the condition
of their Catholick Cause so alter, that what
they have so promis'd and sworn be no
longer expedient for them, a pretended En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm,
a new Light shall give a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and they will do clean contrary, yet
all out of tenderness of Conscience; well,
they are now in strength and power, and
will make use of it to turn all upside down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:98370:62"/>
103. The poor Parliament all this while
is sitting upon addle Eggs, take a great deal
of pains, like Children, to build Castles of
Cards, a puff from their faithful Army
blows it all down. It is true, that at first,
upon return of their Commissioners, who
were sent down to disband, and had brought
them an account of the scorn put upon them,
how instead of the Regiments coming to
the Rendevous appointed, a Command
from Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> fetch'd them clear
another away; how the train of Artillery
was seiz'd upon at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Money
which should have disbanded a Regiment
taken away by force, and the Servants whom
they had employ'd, beaten and wounded;
this did with good reason startle them; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Members express'd a sharp and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Sense of it; the House was taking vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
and honourable Resolutions, tho op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
with might and main by all the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Party, who prevail'd but little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now a known engag'd Faction, till Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
Major General <hi>Skippon</hi> stood up, a
Presbyterian, one who had seem'd to dislike
those factious ways before his last going
down to the Army, who was nominated
Commander in chief for the Irish Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
had receiv'd a gift of a thousand Pounds
by way of encouragement to go, but now
was willing enough to stay at home with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98370:62"/>
it; he, forsooth, in a grave way, with a
doleful Countenance, and lamentable Voice,
makes a long Speech to exhort to moderation,
and to bear with the Infirmities of a zealous
conscientious Army which had done so much
good Service. Therefore it was his opinion
we should humble our selves before God,
appoint a day of Fasting, and do those things
which the Army desir'd, give them their
full Pay, alter the Ordinance according as
they propos'd, and he was perswaded in
his Conscience they would then be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd;
however they were not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd,
for they were a form'd Body which
would be upon us before we were aware.
This knockt us on the head, especially his
last Argument, a demonstration <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; so it
is, they are strong, they will fall upon you;
timorous Men, as he knew many of those
were he had to deal with, could make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to it.</p>
            <p>104. But had he done his duty, given
warning of those preparations and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
sooner, when he was below with the
Army so long, and could not choose but
discern it, the House would not have been so
surpris'd, would have provided against it in
time, but now fear took away the use of
reason. They look'd upon the Army as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at their doors, <hi>Hannibal ad portas,</hi> and
all of them Children of <hi>Anak,</hi> armed Giants
not to be resisted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:98370:63"/>
105. Whereas in truth there was no such
cause of fear. As they in the Army had more
Cause carrying about them so much guilt,
as I am confident they had as great a share of
apprehension. But they presum'd upon
their Agents among us, they knew we
had them with us both in Parliament and
City who would betray us, possess'd with
the like evil Spirit as <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets were;
we should prevail, otherwise we were not
in so despicable a condition. The Parliament
had not yet utterly lost their reputation, the
Image of Authority was not wholly defaced
in them, they had a stock intire and untoucht
of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> provided for disbanding the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and service of <hi>Ireland,</hi> multitude of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
and gallant Soldiers about the Town,
who had always fought gallantly, and obey'd
readily, had little reason to be in love with
the Army which had unhors'd them, so it
is likely would have engag'd chearfully and
done good service. The City was high in
the opinion of the People for courage and
resolution, firmness to the Parliament, zeal
in the Cause, hatred of Independency, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of the Army, and a Purse to make all
good, give Sinews and Strength to that side
with which they should close, and had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
presented many Petitions to the
House for those very things which they
were doing, and the Army only came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98370:63"/>
which were in order to a Peace, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the King, settling the Government both
in Church and State, and giving ease and
quietness to the Kingdom, so as they were
in truth already engag'd with us, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but a Summons to declare themselves,
when by this unfortunate Man's interposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at that time (to whom chiefly and to
his Chaplain <hi>Marshal,</hi> we must attribute
all the Evil that has since befallen King and
Kingdom) all was dasht; instead of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
resistance to the insolencies of perfidious
Servants, vindicating the honour of the
Parliament, discharging the trust that lay
upon them to preserve a poor People from
being ruin'd and inslav'd to a rebellious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
they deliver up themselves and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to the will of their Enemies, prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
all to the Lust of heady and violent Men,
suffer Mr. <hi>Cromwel</hi> to saddle, ride, switch,
and spur them at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>106. For we instantly fell as low as dirt,
vote the common Soldier his full Pay, the
Officers a Month more (that is in all three
Months) upon disbanding or engaging for
<hi>Ireland,</hi> take all our Ordinances in pieces,
change and alter them according to their
minds, and (which is worst of all) expunge
our Declaration against that mutinous Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
cry <hi>Peccavimus</hi> to save a whipping,
but all would not do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:98370:64"/>
107. In so much that when our Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
were sent down to the Army at
<hi>Triplo</hi> Heath, to give an account of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
complyance, they would not vouchsafe
to hear them, but when they offer'd to read
the Votes, cry out, Justice, Justice, a Note
that <hi>Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton</hi> had taught them to
sing, being done by their directions, as some
of their own Disciples falling our with
them, have since discover'd; which was by
Mr. <hi>Scawen,</hi> who was one of those were
sent, reported back to the House, in such a
gastly fearful manner (only to terrifie us
and make us more supple) he saying, the
Army was so strong, so unanimous, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,
as the poor Presbyterians hearts fell
an Inch lower, and the Independents made
themselves merry with it. Then forsooth
the Houses must send down Members to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
with the Army as with a Power inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,
or a third Estate, improve all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
and opportunities, to give good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the actions and intentions of the
poor Parliament, and, like <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
catch at any thing of comfort which
might fall; these were Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> the
younger, Serjeant Major General <hi>Skippon,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Scawen,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Povey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>108. In the mean time the Army is
marching, draws nearer and nearer to the
City, where, as well as in the Parliament, Men
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98370:64"/>
were between hopes and fears; looking upon
what was done sufficient to appease them,
what then offer'd, what they always intended
for doing right to the Army; and in truth
to all persons, they could not but hope as well.
But seeing the postures and proceedings of the
other side, there was more cause of fear, till at
last that Letter came to the City of which I
spoke before, which satisfy'd our doubtings;
and when the Citizens who were sent from
the Common Council brought it to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
the horror and indignation of such
an Impiety, so great a Presumption, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
a Rebellion, awaken'd us to see our
danger, and master'd those fears which had
been given us to awe us from resistance, so
as both Houses and City resolv'd to put
themselves in a posture of defence, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Committee of Lords and Commons to
go into the City, call the Committee of the
Militia of <hi>London</hi> to them, and jointly and
severally do what was necessary for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
safety.</p>
            <p>109. The Committee went and did their
parts, but they found <hi>Ioab</hi>'s hand every
where; the Army had so plaid <hi>Absalom,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
an intention to settle Peace imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
correct the exorbitances with which
the people had been oppress'd and abus'd,
restore the King, with such other plausible
things; and their Agents had so industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98370:65"/>
improv'd their Interests, some false
Brothers in the City, as Alderman <hi>Foulks,</hi>
and Alderman <hi>Gibbs,</hi> so cunningly wrought
upon mens Minds, sometimes upon their
Fears, setting out the strength and power of
the Army, which threaten'd nothing but
ruin; sometimes upon their hopes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of Peace, gilding over their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as all done in order to it; sometimes
upon the dislike of the present condition,
assuring them all Taxes and Payments would
by this means be taken off; sometimes upon
their credulity, making them believe, that
those Persons whom the Army had in their
eyes to remove, were not so well affected to
the publick, but had particular Ends and
Designs of their own, to arm Reformadoes,
and set up the power of another Sword to
rule and govern by, so to continue the
Miseries and Burdens of the People: by
which Falshoods and Juglings, those two
chiefly, like <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
bewitcht the City, and lull'd it into a
security, withstanding those who had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thought than to deliver their Brethren
and themselves from that subjection and vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salage
to which they were then design'd,
and are since brought. As the Citizens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
not to stir, but look'd on to see what
this Army would do; some few did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
rather to make objection and hinder
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98370:65"/>
the business than help it; and tho many
good orders were made for putting the City
into a posture to defend it self, none were
obey'd: so on all hands the poor Parliament,
and Kingdom, and City it self were betray'd,
and left to the mercy of the Army, whose
mercy we shall soon see was Cruelty it
self, Injustice, Oppression, Violence, and
Rebellion in the highest degree.</p>
            <p>110. They now thunder upon us with
Remonstrances, Declarations, Letters, and
Messages every day, commanding one day
one thing, next day another, making us
vote and unvote, do and undo; and when
they had made us do some ugly thing, jeer
us, and say, our doing justifies their desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, as they serv'd us concerning all we
had granted for Pay, expunging our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
passing the Ordinances for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity
against Pressing, and the like.
They tell us in their Representation of the
14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> That our resuming the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of these things, as to their further
satisfaction, dos much justifie their desires
and proceedings so far; and therefore they
then proceed further, and say, They desire
full and equal satisfaction, not only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but for all the Soldiery throughout the
Kingdom, who have concurr'd or will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
with them; so ingage all against the
Parliament, and contract such a debt as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98370:66"/>
has broken the back of the Commonwealth,
and now say they are not a mercenary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to serve the arbitrary power of the
State, but that they took up Arms in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Conscience (notwithstanding
they have receiv'd more Pay than all the
Armies in the Kingdom, and yet liv'd
most of Spoil and free Quarter) therefore
they are resolv'd to assert and vindicate the
power and rights of the Kingdom, and say,
That what they do is short of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of other Nations, to things of a higher
nature than as yet they had pretended to, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancing
in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> For
the present they require, that the Houses be
purg'd, those who have appear'd against them
not to be theirs and the Kingdom's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
whose names they say they will speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give in; they tell the Parliament what
kind of Men they will have preferr'd to
power and trust in the Commonwealth;
then (which was a Crime some six
weeks before, to move in Parliament and
in a Parliamentary way, so as that sagacious
Gentleman Mr <hi>Gurden,</hi> stood up in a rage,
and said it smelt of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and it was much
decryed by all the Crew, but is now of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
merit, and very pious, coming from
their Masters the Army) they will have a
determinate period of time set to this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
some provision to be made for the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98370:66"/>
continuance of future Parliaments. And when
his Majesty shall have given his Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to these and all other things that shall
be propos'd for the liberties of the People, the
Militia, and peace of the Kingdom, then
his Rights and of his Posterity to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.
They will have the Rights of the
People clear'd for freedom of Petitioning,
and such as are imprison'd for pretended
Misdemeanours to be speedily try'd, and
have reparations if they have suffer'd wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
the power given to Committees, and
deputy Lieutenants to be taken into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
The Kingdom to be publickly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
in point of Accounts, and after pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Justice done upon some of the excepted
Persons, that there be an Act of Oblivion.
Then they conclude that these things done,
tho there be many other particulars, yet
(which certainly was merely out of their
great goodness and grace, like that of the
modest Spaniard with his <hi>no quiero mas</hi>) they
will ask no more, but leave the rest to the
wisdom and justice of the Parliament; and
this they say they find to be the concurrent
sense of the People, by their Petitions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the General, wherein (as in all
the rest) they play the arrant Impostors and
Mountebanks, being as impudent, false,
cunning, bloody, proud, and ambitious as
the Devil himself, their grand Master.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98370:67"/>
They will have us believe the Sense of the
People joyn'd with them, and that they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition'd
for these things; when their own
fellow Witches have since discover'd how
<hi>Cromwel</hi> himself drew those Petitions, sent
them about into the Countries, had his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
to promote them with mellifluous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amouring
promises (as the expression is)
so got some Independents to subscribe them,
and perhaps some few more that they had
cozen'd; which serv'd the turn, and made
their wise General engage himself with
them, saying, That what he wanted in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of his devotion to their Service,
should be supply'd in action, as Mr. <hi>Iohn
Lawmind</hi> informs in his <hi>Putney</hi> Projects.</p>
            <p>111. The Parliament is now brought to
a fine pass, made a notable free Parliament,
but we must believe it to be so, because
<hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Army says it, and speed as well
as our first Parents believing the Serpent,
that told them eating the Apple would
make them as Gods, wise, and happy.
The Army on the other side triumphs,
drives on like <hi>Iehu,</hi> bears down all before
it, carries about the King as a Prisoner to
shew him, and make that use of him, which
the <hi>Philistines</hi> would have done with the
Ark, prevail against all opposition; and
truly that and their power together did
make them prevail.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:98370:67"/>
112. Their next work is, charging ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Persons, Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
particularly by name, but with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things; for particulars they were not
provided with, as their friend <hi>Iohn Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind</hi>
says, who uses these words, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
matter of their Charge was to seek
after they had in general charg'd them:
And another of their Disciples, <hi>Sirrah Nico<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
says, That <hi>Cromwel</hi> confess'd at <hi>Colebrook,</hi>
he had nothing against Sir <hi>Iohn Maynard,</hi>
yet he must be put in amongst the rest, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because he was a busie Man against him
and his faction; so you see these Thieves
falling out some truth comes to light.</p>
            <p>113. With this general Charge there
comes another Paper from his Excellency
and the Army under his Command, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Members impeach'd may be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
suspended sitting in the House, and a
months Pay to be immediately sent down
to the Army for a present supply; and of
these things to know the resolution by the
next Thursday at the furthest, which was
within two days. They require further<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That the Officers who had deserted the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
(as they call'd it, but in truth who
had left them for their Rebellion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
for <hi>Ireland</hi>) should have no more of
their Arrears paid them till the Army was
first satisfy'd: And to be sure the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98370:68"/>
should have none to defend them,
They command them to raise no new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
within the Kingdom, nor invite, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any from other parts; the reason, or at
least the colour for this was, because the
Committee of Safety, at such a time as in
obedience to the Order of Parliament they
had endeavour'd to have put the City in a
condition to defend the Parliament and it
self, had consider'd of raising some Force,
but never any thing was put in execution,
nor one Man listed: And tho the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and City did assure them there was no
proceeding in it, which they might then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
likely believe, and in good manners have
acquiesc'd, yet such was either their fear,
by reason of guilt, or their scorn of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and petulancy to shew how they
slighted what they said or declar'd, as they
would not believe them, but threap them
down that there was listing still, and quarrel
with them about it, to such a height were
they then grown, and others to that tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>114. This pass'd about the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iune.</hi>
The Hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e took these things into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
obey'd in all but that concerning the
Members; wherein they came to a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That upon such a general Charge they
could not in Justice proceed against them,
nor suspend them, therefore desire to know
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98370:68"/>
what they could charge them with in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
They further consider'd how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome
it was, the King should be so
hurry'd up and down with the Army, and
that if he were at some of his own Houses
near <hi>London,</hi> application might be made
to him jointly by them and the Scotish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
in order to Peace; whereupon,
tho it was mightily oppos'd by the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Party, yet they voted his Majesty
should be desir'd to come to his Mannor
House at <hi>Richmond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>115. Here the Scholars had broken out a
little into rebellion against their School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters
the Army, and soon they were
lash'd for it. For on the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>June</hi> comes
a ratling Lesson, a Remonstrance from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
full of sharp and scoffing Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ends with a lusty Menace, tells them,
The voting of the King to <hi>Richmond</hi> is but
in pursuance of the former design upon
him at <hi>Holmby,</hi> and to put his Majesty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the reach of those Men, who had already
listed considerable numbers of Horse and
Foot about <hi>London;</hi> therefore wishes them,
as they tender the welfare of the Kingdom,
and the avoiding of jealousies and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
in the Army, to resume again
the consideration of that business, and not
propose any place for him nearer <hi>London</hi>
than they would have the head Quarters of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98370:69"/>
the Army: then to ingratiate themselves
with the King and his Party, and make
him willing to stay with them (till their
design was ripe to dispose of him otherwise,
as it was afterwards) they take notice of
some scandalous information, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement
forsooth of eleven Members and
others of their Party, as if his Majesty were
kept a Prisoner among them, which they
say is most false and contrary to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
(as has appear'd since by what Sir
<hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> commanded to be done to
the King in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
answer to the four Bills, without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Parliament, like a great Prince, <hi>Ex
mero motu &amp; certa scientia,</hi> tho it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
approv'd of and justify'd <hi>Ex parte
post</hi>) but as yet they are harmless Saints and
good Subjects, all for the King. Therefore
they take occasion to declare there, That
they desire a just freedom for his Majesty
and those of his Party, and profess they do
not see how there can be a firm Peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a due consideration of and provision for
the Rights of himself, his Royal Family and
late Partakers. O ye Hypocrites, then with
Honey for him in their Mouths, and War
in their Hearts!</p>
            <p>116. For the expunging of the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they say, they acknowledg the Justice
of the House in it, but should rather have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98370:69"/>
been satisfy'd with the Parliaments decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
how and by whom they had been mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform'd
and surpriz'd, and that it is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
dishonour to them to pass such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
and soon after without alteration
in the pretended ground and cause of it (for
shame of the world) to expunge it: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
they say true in this, but the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
is, true Jests are bitter Jests.</p>
            <p>117. Then for the Members, they insist
to have them forthwith suspended upon the
general Charge, saying, they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
proceed to particulars, if they might
be encourag'd by the Justice of the House for
suspending them for what it self knows, as
having been done there, which they say
they cannot prove without breaking the
privileges of Parliament: Therefore they
advise a necessary expedient for prevention
of the like for the future, That in the House
of Commons dissenting Members may enter
their Dissent, as they do in the House of
Peers, with a Protestation, and say, They
offer these things from their good wishes to
the privileges of Parliament, to render them
more lasting by being more innocent.</p>
            <p>118. Was ever Parliament so abus'd?
First, they must, because the Army will
have it so, give a Judgment upon persons
before they know any fault by them, only
to encougrage their accusers to tell the fault,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98370:70"/>
for which that Judgment is already given;
first punish, then enquire; <hi>Hallifax</hi> Law,
and Army Justice. And this no less than of
suspension, where not only the Parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have a mark of ignominy put upon'em,
are dispossest of the execution of that Trust
which their Country has reposed in them,
but the places they serve for, Towns and
Counties are punish'd, depriv'd of their
Representatives in Parliament, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
of their suffrages there which they
give by them. Then what must this be for?
even for what was done and said in the
House (for so it is laid) contrary to all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
and privileges of Parliament,
which will have no man question'd for
that afterwards; upon this ground, That if
he had done amiss, the House would at that
time have checkt it; and they not finding
fault then, for any other to do it, must needs
reflect upon their Wisdom and Integrity, as
if they approv'd of what was ill, or could
not discern it. And lastly, for my young
Masters to jeer them with their good wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to have their privileges less nocent, and
then dare to propound so great an alteration
in the very fundamental constitution of the
House of Commons, where the minor part
is involv'd in the major, and both make but
one intire Agent in all they do, where
there is no particularizing of persons, not any
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98370:70"/>
one Member to be so much as nam'd, where
all is acted as by one Man, that which must
bind the whole Kingdom to be establish'd
by the united consent of it, there to make
such a rent and division as to introduce dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Protestations, only to foment Faction
and Parties, and by troubling the Fountain,
to corrupt all the Streams, is the most tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
presumption that ever was heard
of.</p>
            <p>119. But that which in my opinion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
most of injustice in it self, and dishonour
to the Parliament, was the requiring them
to discharge and disperse those, who upon
their orders of invitation and encouragement
to engage for <hi>Ireland,</hi> had left the Army,
quitted the advantages they might have had
in joining in that Rebellion, and wholly cast
themselves upon the Parliament, as Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Pye</hi>'s Men, Colonel <hi>Graves</hi>'s, Colonel
<hi>Butlers,</hi> Captain <hi>Farmers,</hi> Lieutenat Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Iacksons,</hi> the Captain, and many of
the Soldiers of the Life-Guard, and others
quarter'd in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> the greater
part of the two Regiments under Colonel
<hi>Herbert</hi> and Colonel <hi>Kempson,</hi> quarter'd
about <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Evesham;</hi> these honest,
gallant, faithful, stout Men, both Officers
and Soldiers, for their obedience to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
zeal to <hi>Ireland,</hi> must be abus'd and
ruin'd, the Parliament it self made to eat
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98370:71"/>
its own words, break its faith, deceive them
who trusted it, deliver them up, make them
Anathema's: for what? because the Army
says they are Deserters, and raisers of a new
War, but in truth, for complying with their
Commands, refusing to join in a Rebellion
against them, being willing to adventure
their lives against the Rebels of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>120. Never was such a violence and scorn
put upon a single person, or any society of
Men, much less a Parliament, to make it
act its own shame and confusion, except by
that <hi>Italian,</hi> who to be reveng'd on his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
got him at advantage, bad him deny
Jesus Christ, and acknowledg him his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
or he should die presently, which
the wretch doing to save his life, he then
stabs him to the heart, and says, Go thy
ways, I am now reveng'd upon Body and
Soul. So the Army threaten'd the Parliament,
if all these things foremention'd were not
done (and likewise the poor Reformadoes
put out of the City, who had offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and were ready to run all dangers for
theirs and the City's preservation) and done
by the next Thursday night, that then they
should be forc'd to take such a course extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
as God should enable them and
direct them to.</p>
            <p>121. And when the Parliament had done
it (as they did all but suspending their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98370:71"/>
Members) had retracted that Vote concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King's coming to <hi>Richmond</hi> (which
the Lords did first at Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi>'s earnest
sollicitation, as I have heard, who at that
time could not have prevail'd so with the
House of Commons) prostituting their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
renouncing whatever would be of
strength and safety to them, casting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
down naked, helpless and hopeless, at
the proud feet of their domineering Masters,
it is all to no purpose, it dos but encourage
those merciless Men to trample the more
upon them, like the Task-masters of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
double the tale of their Bricks.</p>
            <p>122. For this was a resolution taken, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should satisfie, nay not be accepted
with a good look, a smile, whilst the eleven
Members sat in the House; while <hi>Mordecai</hi>
stood in the Gate and bowed not, proud
<hi>Haman</hi> cannot be pleas'd, therefore he must
die: The eleven Members must out. The
House of Commons will not do it, Mr. <hi>Ioyce</hi>
and his Agitators shall. For this Sir <hi>Thomas
Fairfax</hi> takes up his Quarter at <hi>Vxbridg,</hi>
some of his Forces advance within three or
four Miles of <hi>Westminster,</hi> he sends his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
for Provisions into the very Suburbs, a
Party of Horse is commanded to be ready at
a Rendevouze, to march up to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then here is the Case of the eleven
Members; stay, a violence shall be offer'd
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98370:72"/>
upon the House, the Members pull'd out by
the Ears, and then <hi>Actum est de Parliamento,</hi>
I may say <hi>de Parliamentis,</hi> farewel this and
all Parliaments.</p>
            <p>123. Those Gentlemen therefore think it
best, rather than a breach should be made
upon their occasion, that through their sides
the Parliament should be stuck to the very
heart, and die for ever, to make it their
own act of forbearing the House. And
therefore they told the House, they saw they
were in that condition they could neither
protect them nor themselves; that if they
would not do as <hi>Achish</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> who
bid him be gone because the Princes of the
Philistins lov'd him not, yet that they would
at their humble suit and desire be pleas'd to
give them leave to withdraw, and to such
as desir'd it, Passes to go beyond Sea, which
at last they did agree to, tho truly I must
say, unwillingly; but which all said, they
look'd upon it as a good Service done to the
House for preventing greater inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>124. Upon this they forbore, and staid,
I think, a week or better, expecting if the
Army would send in a particular Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all or any of them; which not doing,
but instead of that writing up a Letter to
commend their Modesty, they then peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
the House, that they would send to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98370:72"/>
the Army to know what particulars they laid
to their charge, and prefix them some conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
time to do it in: Which the House did,
giving them about a week. And one would
have thought a short day might have serv'd.
That accusing Members in such a manner,
with such a noise, as if they had been so cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous,
that as Mr. Sollicitor said by his
Beasts of prey, which were not to have Law
given them, but be knockt in the head, so
they were not worthy of Justice, nor of
privilege of Parliament, nor of common hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
much less to be us'd with some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
like Gentlemen who had so long, and
some of them serv'd their Country so often
in Parliament, and more faithfully than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any of the Army party did, or will do
there or any where else. But all Bonds of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and civil society must be broken through
to come at their destruction; they must
needs have known some notorious things by
them which might readily be produc'd.
But it seems they were not so provided, the
particular matter of their Charge was yet
to seek (as their fellow Mr. <hi>Iohn Lawmind</hi>
says) they were then hunting out for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
sending about for Witnesses to testifie
any thing, promise, bribe, threaten, but
all would not do: several persons came to
me, informing how they had been sollicited
to inform against me; one <hi>Lewis</hi> told me
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98370:73"/>
they had been tampering with him; one
<hi>Westcomb</hi> acquainted me how one <hi>Pain</hi> had
been sent for by <hi>Rushworth</hi> his Excellency's
excellent Secretary, to the same purpose,
who lodg'd him in his Chamber, gave him
an Angel the first time; that he went these<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, and this <hi>Westcomb</hi> with him,
and then had a Horse given him worth ten
Pounds, and the promise of some Place in
the Army, for which it is presum'd he did
some acceptable Service. It seems these
Saints were put hard to it; well, the first
day pass'd and no Charge came in, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
longer time, and promis'd it should be
ready by such a day, and I think the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it did come: And if I be not very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to my self, as in this I believe I am not,
after all this travelling of the Mountains,
out comes <hi>ridiculus Mus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>125. I will not repeat all the particulars
here, they are in print and our answer
to them, which I hope satisfies all Men;
besides another answer we put into the
House, more upon the formality of a legal
Plea, which it seems satisfy'd them, for
they never proceeded further, nor did the
Army prosecute, but the House order'd the
Speaker to give us Passes according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</p>
            <p>126. I will but make this observation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some of them, That they and their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98370:73"/>
acted those very things which they laid
to our charge; and what was false as to us,
was really true in them.</p>
            <p>127. One thing was holding a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency
with the King and his Party,
which of all Men they ought not to have
objected, doing what they did even at that
very time; for suppose it never so great a
Crime, it ill becomes the Devil to find fault
with the Collier for being black: they treat
with his Majesty, have some of his Servants
present at their Councils of War to debate
and prepare things, frame proposals for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
the whole business of the Kingdom;
and if their own Writers, Prophets of their
own, tell true, capitulate for Honours and
Preferments, <hi>Cromwel</hi> to have a blew Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
be an Earl, his Son to be of the Bed-Chamber
to the Prince, <hi>Ireton</hi> some great
Officer in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Now admit all true
they said of us, was it to be compar'd to
this? is it not a <hi>Decimo sexto</hi> to their Folio,
a Mole-hill to their Mountain? And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
it may be taken notice of, that in all the
Charge there is not a word of the Plot to
fetch the King from <hi>Holmby,</hi> bring him to
<hi>London,</hi> or put him at the head of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which they made the groundwork of
all their Villanies, pretending some of us
(in truth underhand, and in their Pamphlets
naming me) to have had such an intention;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98370:74"/>
and that what they did was by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.
Is it likely this would have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
if there had been the least colour of
truth for it? but Truth was what they ever
least look'd after in all their Speeches and
Actions, caring only to serve a turn, gain an
advantage by cozening the world, and then
cast about how to make it good by power,
or amuse Men with some new Cheat, that
the last might be forgotten.</p>
            <p>128. They accuse us of infringing, and
endeavouring to overthrow the Liberties and
Rights of the Subject in arbitrary and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
ways, and by indirect and corrupt
practices to delay and obstruct Justice.
These are the words in their general Charge.
Now I appeal to all Men, and even to their
own Consciences, who say this, whether of
the two, they or their Party, or we in the
House of Commons, upon all occasions,
were for violence, oppression, and ruin, to
destroy all that came before them, sequester
Estates, impose great Fines, imprison, starve,
sometimes take away life, make Men offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
for a word, take all advantages, wrest
and strain up to the height of all their penal
Ordinances; and who they were that had
the hand in making all those penal Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
so severe for Sequestrations, so high for
Compositions, so insnaring and bloody for
making new Treasons, and little things to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98370:74"/>
be capital Crimes; that no Man almost was
safe, free from question, and few or none
question'd but sure to be destroy'd. How
many Ministers wre pull'd out of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
for very small faults? how many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
made Delinquents, their Estates torn
in pieces, themselves, their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
turn'd to beggery, and ready to starve
for no great offences, at least that for which
they did not deserve so severe a punishment?
What Committees were set up? That of
Haberdashers Hall, to pill and poll Men,
put them to an Oath as ill as that <hi>ex officio</hi>
to make them discover their Estates, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselves to their merciless carving out
a fifth and twentieth part, which was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
of many, even fetching in some of the
Members of the House to whom they had a
displeasure, and generally all Men who had
crossd or oppos'd them in any thing: that
of Goldsmiths Hall, to impose Fines to the
ruin of many of the best Families of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi>
that of Sequestrations, where the
very intention of the Houses was perverted,
that Committee being first propos'd and
made only for great and notorious Offenders,
but afterwards came to be worse than any
Spanish Inquisition, few escaping that were
ever question'd; I dare say Serjeant <hi>Wild</hi> the
Chairman, and Mr. <hi>Nicklis</hi> the Lawyer, and
some few more Bloodhounds, who always
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98370:75"/>
attended there, never gave their Votes for
the freeing of scarce any one person; and then
the delay there is worse than the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
making suitors wait one, two years,
and commonly be sequester'd at last. The
Committee of Examinations where Mr.
<hi>Miles Corbet</hi> kept his Justice Seat, which
was worth something to his Clerk, if not to
him, what a continual Horse Fair it was?
even like Dooms-day it self, to judg per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of all sorts and sexes.</p>
            <p>129. Did not that Faction put on all
these things? did not we still oppose, hinder
it all we could? how earnestly and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
have we mov'd the putting down those
Committees? that of Sequestration, that of
Haberdashers Hall. Those in the Counties
sometimes got orders of the House for that
purpose, brought in Ordinances, and still
by some art or other of theirs put by when it
was thought in a manner settled, so as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
might have return'd to Sheriffs,
Justices of Peace, Grand Juries, and other
Ministers of Justice in that subordination
which the Law had establish'd. Was any
preserv'd and deliver'd out of his trouble,
that we or some of us had not a hand in it?
Were we not call'd the moderate Party?
branded with that Title (for they held it a
crime) were we not said to favour Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants?
when in truth we had respect to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98370:75"/>
Parliament, that it should not be made the
Instrument of those mens Lusts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
that Odium which only could ruin it,
and upon which this very Party, being
themselves the cause of it, took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to master and subdue it, they in the
beginning of their Rebellion exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Parliament for those things, and
therewith possessing the Country, which
themselves and their Faction made it do.
Who but they drew all business into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
especially when themselves or their
Friends were any thing concern'd? And had
they not an Art of delaying men, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them attend when they could not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
them by dispatching the business? were
any more violent in an arbitrary way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
than they? nay, were any so but they?
could a Mayor, or Officer, or a Burgess for
Parliament be chosen almost in any Town
of <hi>England,</hi> but with their leaves and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their likings? And on the other
side, did not we press to have all things left
to the Law of the land, and to the antient
and ordinary course? yet they accuse us to
be the troublers of <hi>Israel,</hi> and themselves
would be thought to be the restorers, just
as the Wolf in the Fable charg'd the Lamb
with troubling the Waters.</p>
            <p>130. They charge us beside with having
a great power upon the Treasure of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98370:76"/>
Kingdom, disposing of the publick Monies,
inriching our selves, and say in many of
their Declarations, that we would embroil
the Land in a new War, that we might not
be called to an account for them. O the
impudence! They know that themselves
only and their Creatures had power over
the Monies, and medled in Money matters,
well licking their Fingers; for they know
they shar'd and divided amongst themselves
all the Fat of the Land, the Treasure, the
Offices, the King's Revenue, the Revenue
of the Church, the Estates of so great a part
of the Nobility and Gentry, whom they
had made Delinquents, and we, not one of
us had any thing to do in all this; Mr. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder
I think only was of the Committee
of the King's Revenue, but very seldom
came thither. And did not they make use
of the price in their hands? And did they
not like charitable persons begin at home,
give Gifts and Offices to all their own Party,
to some upon mere Grace, as the thousands
to Mr. <hi>Blaxton,</hi> a thousand Pound to Mr.
<hi>Pury</hi> (besides a good Office) as much to
Mr. <hi>Hodges</hi> of <hi>Glocestershire,</hi> to Alderman
<hi>Pennington,</hi> who had conceal'd three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Pounds of Sir <hi>Iohn Pennington</hi>'s which
he had in his hands, for which, by their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
he should have forfeited the treble,
and had he been a friend to the eleven Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98370:76"/>
should not have been spar'd; they did
not only forgive him that, but gave him that
three thousand Pounds, and three thousand
Pounds more, which was upon the City's
turning him out of their Militia, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
made him be put in again. The
Speaker had Money given him, I know not
how much, 6000 <hi>l.</hi> at one time (as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member)
was made Master of the Rolls,
Chancellor of the Dutchy, and a good
while Keeper; Mr. Sollicitor was, besides
his being Sollicitor, the King's Attorny, and
about two years one of the Lord Keepers,
got infinitely by the Pardons upon Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
which was a device only to fill his
Coffers, and had a thousand Pounds given
him at the expiration of his Commission for
the Great Seal. So had all his fellow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> and
Serjeant <hi>Wild,</hi> each their thousand Pound
besides the profits of the Seal; Mr. <hi>Prideaux</hi>
also made himself Post-master of <hi>England,</hi>
being but the Chairman of a Sub-Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
to the Grand-Committee of Grievances,
where my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Burlamachi</hi>
were contesting about the place, which was
there represented as a publick Grievance,
tho my Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Grant prov'd not
to be so; but this worthy Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the Committee, and in the Chair,
who was to hear both, and report their
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:98370:77"/>
Cases to the Grand Committee, from whence
it was to come to the House, finding it a
convenient Employment, worth some 24,
or 2500 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> eas'd them of it, took
it himself, and has kept it ever since. Mr.
Serjeant <hi>Wild</hi> was trusted with some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
by the Lady <hi>Thornborough</hi>'s Father for
the use of his Daughter, and took occasion
upon her going to <hi>Oxford,</hi> pretending she
had got possession of his Estate, to get a fair
Ordinance of both Houses to have that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
given to himself; but sure found some
good Law for it, as he did for hanging of
Captain <hi>Burley;</hi> and being excellent at it,
no question would find Law to hang the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven
Members, were there a whole dozen
of them, and me highest for writing this,
which he would prove to be a greater Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
than any in the Statute of the 25<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d;</hi> and when I come within
his power, I will forgive it him, let him
hang as many, and get as much of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths
Money as he can in the mean
time. But I will say this for him, the Elders
of <hi>Iezreel</hi> that found a Law to put <hi>Naboth</hi>
to death, were but fools to him. Then how
many of their small Prophets were prefer'd,
that Man of Conscience Alderman <hi>Hoil,</hi>
that worthy Lawyer Mr. <hi>Nicklis,</hi> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Allison,</hi> Mr. <hi>Love,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lenthal</hi> the
Speaker's Son, these two made six Clerks;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98370:77"/>
Mr. <hi>Lisle,</hi> Master of St. <hi>Cross</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Miles
Corbet,</hi> Colonel <hi>White,</hi> a Colonel that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was in the Field with his Regiment,
Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> the Goldsmith; all of them, and I
know not how many more, in places of
great profit, some in the Courts of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
others made Treasurers of their Armies,
as <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>White;</hi> the latter also made
Clerk of the Assizes in the Northern Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit,
worth 5 or 600 <hi>l. per Annum. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>
has 2500 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> Sir <hi>Peter Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
a Gentleman's Estate for half the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
settled likewise by Ordinance, tho the
Gentleman (whose delinquency was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
aggravated, because he would not sell
him that Land which he had long desir'd,
like <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard) offer'd to pay the
Money to the State as the Fine for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
which by the rules of their own
proceedings could not in Justice have been
deny'd him. I remember we put by the
Ordinance two or three times, but I hear it
is since past, which makes me mention it
here.</p>
            <p>131. To some for reparation of Losses.
So Mr. <hi>Cornelius Holland,</hi> who had some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
place in the Prince's Houshold
(which certainly he was not born to, the
height of his ambition reaching no further
in the beginning than to be Sir <hi>Henry Vane's</hi>
Man) was in recompence set over the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:98370:78"/>
King's Children, above my Lady of <hi>Dorset,</hi>
and had the managing of their Houshold
some three or four years; then they gave
him the King's Pastures in <hi>Buckinghamshire</hi>
for twenty one years, worth to him <hi>de claro</hi>
some 15 or 1600 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> Sir <hi>William
Strickland</hi> for the burning of his House in
<hi>Yorkshire,</hi> has a Gentleman's Estate in
<hi>Kent</hi> of a good value. Mr. <hi>Henry Herbert</hi>
had 3000 <hi>l.</hi> given him out of my Lord of
<hi>Worcester</hi>'s Woods, and Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi>'s.
The Lord <hi>Say,</hi> in lieu of the Mastership of
the Wards, which by his power since the
beginning of this Parliament he had wrested
from the Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> had 10000 <hi>l.</hi>
and for part of the Money (I think 4000 <hi>l.</hi>
of it) had <hi>Hanworth</hi> House, with the Lands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, which was worth, as they say, 14000 <hi>l.</hi>
Colonel <hi>Fleetwood</hi> was by way of Sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
put into the Remembrancers place of
the Court of Wards, which his Brother held,
and by going to <hi>Oxford</hi> lost it; upon the
putting down of the Court he had 3000 <hi>l.</hi>
recompense: multitudes there are more of
this kind.</p>
            <p>132. To some for pretended Arrears; as to
Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerig 7000 l.</hi> who had earn'd
it well at the <hi>Devizes</hi> and <hi>Cherrington.</hi> To
the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Sir <hi>William Constable,</hi>
Sir <hi>William Brereton,</hi> great Sums. To Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Thompson 2000 l.</hi> for his wooden Leg,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98370:78"/>
which nothing but a Cannon could have
helpt him to, for he would never come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Musket shot. To Colonel <hi>Purefoy</hi> and
his Son Colonel <hi>Boswel,</hi> some 1500 <hi>l.</hi> each;
and so to many more.</p>
            <p>133. To some to buy their Voices, make
them Proselytes. To Mr. <hi>Weston,</hi> Son to
the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> the reviving an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rear
of a Pension which was his Ladies, and
if I be not deceiv'd, had been discontinu'd
for many years: The Debenter, as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
was 4000 <hi>l.</hi> To the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
(who had before been zealous for my
Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> as he had good reason for the
respects he had receiv'd from him) a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Sum, which I well remember not,
to be paid him out of such discoveries of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
Estates as he should make; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he and his Terriers were long attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Committee of Examinations, in the
prosecution still of some Game or other, till
his Sum was made up. To Mr. <hi>Scawen,</hi> one
who formerly had not very well lik'd of
their ways, 2000 <hi>l.</hi> How many of the Lords
that could not be heard before, nor their
Petitions scarce vouchsafed to be read, when
they tackt about and voted with them, were
then presently consider'd, and good propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
allow'd them; nay, they were so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
as some of them would not stick to
give it for a reason openly in the House,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98370:79"/>
why they would not grant their desires,
that they took notice how they gave their
Votes: Mr. <hi>Gourden</hi> is the Man I have heard
say so several times; this was an excellent
way to make a free Parliament, for the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to be honest and discharge their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>134. Then for Accounts; I would fain
know what Accounts they have pass'd: Let
any Man peruse my Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s and Sir
<hi>William Constable</hi>'s, I hear they are strange
ones for the great Sums they have finger'd:
And I am sure the Committee of Accounts
did complain, that their Sub-Committees
were beaten in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> where Mr.
<hi>Purefoy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Boswel</hi> should have acted,
and would not.</p>
            <p>135. Upon the whole matter, I would
have our Accusers say so much by one of us:
I confess, I am sorry to discover this of them,
it being much against my nature, but I am
forc'd to it for my vindication. I may say
with the Apostle, They have compell'd me,
and not only so to recriminate, but even to
glory a little in some thing. Have any of us
ever refus'd to account, who were liable to
it? Sir <hi>William Lewis</hi> did account for the
Monys he receiv'd, being Governor of <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
so fairly and satisfactorily, as that
the Committee of Accounts made a special
report of it to the House, to be (as they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98370:79"/>
said) an Example to others for his care and
just dealing in managing the States Monies
which came to his hands. Major General
<hi>Massey</hi> I am sure was sollicitous to perfect his
accounts, which if or no he had done before
they drove him away I know not. Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Waller</hi> and Colonel <hi>Long</hi> finish'd theirs.
Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi> never touch'd but his
personal Pay, yet did account, and had but
forty Shillings a day, being Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Horse under my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi>
who was Generalissimo, when Sir <hi>Arthur
Haslerig</hi> had five Pounds for commanding
the Horse under Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> a Place
inferior to his, and had been at no charge,
having liv'd still upon Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi>
and gotten well all along the Imployment.
Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> had his Arrears after his
subordinate Officer; Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> had led the
way, who broke the Ice for his General and
all the rest. Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi> had also
his, a very small one for so eminent an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
in regard his allowance was no greater;
it came to about 1700 <hi>l.</hi> having left the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of his whole Estate during all the
Wars, which <hi>Haslerig</hi> did not, if his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in <hi>Leicestershire</hi> say true, that his
Grounds have continu'd full stock'd all this
while, better than ever they were before,
so safe and well protected (as I have heard)
that his Neighbours when there was danger,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98370:80"/>
would send their Cattel thither; I confess, I
understand not the mystery.</p>
            <p>136. Here is all concerning matters of
Accounts and Arrears of the eleven Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
the rest medled not with any of the
States Monies, some of them have refus'd to
receive what the House had given them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
much juster grounds than all the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the others that had so much. I my
self for my Sufferings after the Parliament
3<hi>d. Car.</hi> which continu'd many years, cost
me some thousands of Pounds, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd
me more, had five thousand Pounds
given me by the House for my reparation. I
refus'd it, and said, I would not receive a
Penny till the publick debts were paid. Let
any of them say so much. I desire who ever
shall chance to read this, to pardon me this
folly, I do not mean for not taking the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but seeming to boast of it. I must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
repeat the Apostle's words, I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Fool in glorying, but they have
compel'd me. It is true, I had paid for a
Fine impos'd in the King's Bench, which I
laid down in ready Money out of my Purse,
a thousand Marks: This in the time of these
troubles, when my whole Estate was kept
from me in the West, that for three years
or thereabouts I receiv'd thence not one
Farthing, was reimburs'd to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:98370:80"/>
137. Now I appeal to the world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our accusers, or we the poor eleven
Members, so decry'd, so oppress'd, were
the more guilty, who they were, who had
gotten, cozen'd, oppress'd, were indeed
the Traitors. If he did not say as truly as
he did wittily, if they had not had more
men than matter against us, they had been
the Traitors themselves, which many of
their own Disciples have upon the matter
confess'd and publish'd, saying, they were
to seek for matter; only we were a Beam in
their Eyes: And their great Apostle <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi>
himself says, the great aim was but to
pull down those who stood in the way of
their preferment.</p>
            <p>138. Here is our Crime, I will ask par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of God for my failings, even in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of all these duties, where I serv'd
my Country best, but not of the Parliament
from whence I desire no favour. Let them
put upon me the severest disquisition, either
concerning those things then charg'd, or the
great. Treason since committed, of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to defend my self, the Parliament,
the City, from a rebellious, unjust, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Army, which against all Laws of God
and Man, came to force us, for which I
stand voted to be impeach'd of Treason, and
am outed the House, of which I shall treat
presently.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:98370:81"/>
139. But first I shall shew the Steps to it.
The Army now did all, the Parliament was
but a Cypher, only cry'd Amen to what
the Councils of War had determin'd. They
make themselves an absolute third Estate,
have Commissioners residing with them
from the Parliament, Agents from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and abuse both sufficiently; as solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treated with as if no Subjects, but a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
subordinate to neither, vested with an
Independent Authority, claiming only from
God and their Sword. The whole business of
the Kingdom is there now agitated, and the
engagement of the Army is the Standard by
which all propositions must be measur'd. If
any thing be offer'd by the Parliament which
they like not, it is presently answer'd not
to stand with their solemn Engagement.
Many meetings there were, great consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and debates upon certain proposals for
settling of a Peace, and securing the Rights
and Liberties of the People.</p>
            <p>140. Notwithstanding this, while these
things are in agitation, after all their affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
baffling, forcing the Parliament, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up against it and the City, contrary to
their orders, by which they were not to
come nearer than within forty Miles of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
they will have them own them for
their Army, undertake to provide for their
maintenance, and immediately send down
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98370:81"/>
a months Pay, yet will not be subject to
them in any thing. All this is done, Mr.
<hi>Marshal</hi> the Minister being a principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
for them, who was still going and
coming between <hi>Westminster</hi> and the head
Quarters, or at the Parliament doors sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Members of both Houses, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them by all manner of arguments,
sometimes assurances, sometimes terrifyings,
to agree to those things which the Army
desir'd; and this not in order to the setting
up of Presbytery, in which he had formerly
been so zealous (for the Presbyters were
not then Trump, and he meant to whine
therefore to put out them to take in better
Cards for his turn) Afterwards they send
to repeal the Ordinance for the Militia of
<hi>London,</hi> which had been settled upon many
and long debates, to stand for one whole
year, and renew the former expir'd Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for establishing the old Committee,
which was the year before.</p>
            <p>141. It is but ask and have, that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
done; and truly I think it was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Army, merely to provoke the
City, engage them to do something, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
a dislike perhaps, fly out, and give
them an occasion to offer some violence
should they persist; or if yield after a little
ill favour'dly shewing their teeth, then to
put such things upon them, so yoke them,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98370:82"/>
break their strength, trample upon their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and Privileges, as they should not
be able afterwards upon any occasion to
raise them disturbance, and make oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to whatever they should set on foot, tho
never so grievous and displeasing to the
whole Kingdom; for they thought not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
secure whilst the City stood unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>142. Their Plot took, the City was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much mov'd at this sudden Act of the
Houses, in the altering their Militia, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
so much as giving them notice to hear
what they could say in a point so nearly
concerning them. They look upon it as an
Infringement of their Charter (granted and
confirm'd to them by so many Kings succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
by which they were still to have the
power of their own Militia) as a shaking of
the foundation of all their security for those
vast sums of Money they had lent, which
depended only upon Ordinances: and the
easie and sudden repealing of this, gave
them cause to fear they might be serv'd so
in the rest.</p>
            <p>143. Whereupon at their Common
Council they agreed upon a Petition to
the Houses, informing them of the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
in the City upon the change they had
made, and beseeching them to reestablish it
as it was before; which was presented by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98370:82"/>
the Sheriffs, some of the Aldermen, and of
the Members of the Common Council in a
fair and submissive way. But the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
durst do nothing without the leave of
their Masters, only give them good words,
and so hop'd to slide over the business. Then
some young Men, Apprentices and others,
appear'd, pressing hard, who would not be
satisfy'd till it was done; which the Houses
sticking at, the young Men insisting, drew
a great concourse of people, putting things
into some heat, so as at last they prevail'd,
and the Militia was again settled according
to their desire: upon which they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
returning to their homes, only some
of the younger and more unruly sort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd,
among whom some idle people (and
perhaps not well affected) Soldiers and others,
and I have heard some of the Independents
even belonging to the Army, thrust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and put the multitude, disorderly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
before, into great distempers, who
then would make the Houses do this and the
other thing, vote the King's coming to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
the calling in of the eleven Members,
and I know not what else, would not suffer
the Parliament Men either of the one House
or the other, to stir till all was voted and
pass'd which they desir'd, keeping them
there till I think nine of the clock at night;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98370:83"/>
when the Common Council hearing of these
disorders, sent down the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi>
and some of the Aldermen to appease them,
which they did. This was upon Monday
the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly.</hi> The Houses adjourn'd
themselves, the House of Peers to Friday,
the Commons house to the next day. The
City had against the next day, which was
Tuesday, taken order to prevent such fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inconveniences by unruly people as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
about <hi>Westminster,</hi> which before
they could not well do, in regard their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
was unsettled by the alteration that the
new Ordinance upon the Armies command
had made, and I heard sent down a Message
to the House of Commons to assure them of
it; but Mr. Speaker was so hasty to adjourn
till the Friday, perhaps because the rather
he would not receive that Message which
had half spoil'd the Plot, that he would scarce
stay till it was a House; and some of the sacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
crying to adjourn, he did so, tho many
cry'd out against it, who could not be
heard.</p>
            <p>144. By the Friday the two Speakers,
the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi> of the Peers, and Mr.
<hi>Lenthal</hi> of the Commons, instead of giving
their attendance according to their duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Houses, with eight Lords and fifty
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98370:83"/>
eight Commoners, were run down to the
Army, there enter into an engagement,
bearing date the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> to live and
die with it, upon pretence of a force and
violence to the Parliament, but in truth by
a Conspiracy with the Army, design'd and
laid principally by Mr. <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor,
as appears by a Letter sent from
<hi>Rushworth,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>'s Secretary,
to the Speaker, with no name in it, but the
latter part of it written with his own hand,
advising him not to appear at the House on
Friday morning, but to take counsel of Mr.
Sollicitor, who would tell him what was
fit to be done, assuring him the Army would
all lie in the dirt or protect them who were
their friends. This, as I remember, was
the effect of the Letter, yet remaining in
one of the Houses; which, no doubt, came
from Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
and the rest of those Governors undertaking
so for the Army, and shews who was the
man that must give the Orders, and direct
what was to be done by the House, and
then may well be suppos'd to be the Author
of all. The ground of this Engagement is
made to be a Declaration of the Armies
shewing the reasons of their advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>London,</hi> as full of falshood as it is of
malice against the eleven poor Members,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98370:84"/>
and in truth intended only against them,
who are by it said to be the cause of all that
had been done in the City; that therefore
they were resolv'd to march up to <hi>London,</hi>
expecting the well affected people of the
City would either put us in safe custody, or
deliver us up to them, stuffing up the whole
Declaration with falshoods and lies, as well
in the narrative part as in the comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; they pretend, That to carry on our
former evil designs, and preserve our selves
from the hand of Justice, we had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to cast the Kingdom into a new War,
and to that end had procur'd an under hand
listing of Reformadoes, and continu'd a
wicked and treasonable Combination, which
we caus'd several persons to enter into, That
this could not be done in the time of the
old Commissioners for the Militia, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the new were made, who many of
them were very intimate with us, which
was a just cause for the Army to have them
chang'd again: That thereupon the tumult
was abetted and fomented by us to violate
the Parliament, and force it into our hands,
which makes them require that we may be
in that manner deliver'd up; and declar'd all
that was done in the Houses that day or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
till those fugitive Members should
return again, null and void (so here the Army
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98370:84"/>
takes upon it to declare what Votes shall
stand good, what not; and this is for the
honour and freedom of the Parliament, that
which those worthy Patriots would live and
die upon) And besides, they say they were
labouring after the settlement of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and had even brought it to perfection,
the particular proposals ready to be sent to
the Parliament for a final conclusion of all
our troubles; which conclusion of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
in truth, nothing in the sight of Man
could have hinder'd, but this cursed practice
of violence upon the Parliament, which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing in them was as cursed a High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as could be committed, a mercenary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
rais'd by the Parliament, all of them
from the General (except what he may have
in expectation after his Father's death) to
the meanest Centinal, not able to make a
thousand Pounds a year Lands, most of the
Colonels and Officers mean Tradesmen, Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Taylors, Goldsmiths, Shoemakers, and the
like; a notable Dunghil, if one would rake
into it, to find out their several Pedigrees:
these to rebel against their Masters, put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
upon them, upon the King and whole
Kingdom, make their Will a Rule, that all
the Interests of King, Parliament, and
Kingdom must be squared by, which they
are not asham'd to declare here to the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:98370:85"/>
145. And this pious Declaration do these
worthy Lords and Commons receive with
much approbation, and with much thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to God in the first place, and next
under him to the ever faithful Army; and
so became, like the Proselites which the
Scribes and Pharisees made, twofold more
the Children of Hell than themselves, more
criminous, and guilty of a greater Treason,
as having broken a higher Trust, being
themselves part of the Parliament which
they deserted and betray'd; a wound given
in the more noble and vital parts, tearing the
Bowels, and piercing to the very Heart.
Whereas the Army were but Servants, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and ministerial parts, so to be look'd
upon, and so punish'd; Slaves were crucify'd,
but Citizens that betray'd were extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they and their posterity, and the whole
City turn'd into mourning, sensible of the loss
as the Body when depriv'd of a principal
Member.</p>
            <p>146. They should have remembred, that
even at the time of the pretended force which
they would have men believe to have driven
them away, the House lay under a greater
force, and themselves were greater Slaves
to the lusts of the Army which trampled
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98370:85"/>
upon their Necks, made them more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
than the smallest Court of Guard
that had but a Corporal to command it, to
eat their words, their Declarations, Orders,
Ordinances, break their Faith, betray and
destroy all that serv'd them faithfully, give
thanks for being cudgel'd and abus'd, pray
and pay, and be glad it would be accepted;
should not every Member have been sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of such violations and injuries done to
the Body? But some will say it was as these
Men will have it, who were like the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
lusts in the Soul, quiet and well pleas'd,
while the strong man the Devil keeps the
house: So they were satisfy'd with all that
was done, because it was according to their
Minds, conducing to their Ends. If it be
so, and that they will be Slaves, let them
be Slaves still, for they deserve no better.
The Army was the fittest place for them,
as <hi>Brutus</hi> said of those he took Prisoners at
the first Battel of <hi>Philippi,</hi> Let them go, says
he, they are greater Captives in their own
Camp under <hi>Cesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> than here.</p>
            <p>147. They might likewise have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that the force upon the Parliament
from the Army, as it was greater, so to
have been a more horrid crime, of more
dangerous consequence to the Kingdom, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98370:86"/>
more destructive to the being of Parliaments
than that from the Apprentices; which is,
in my opinion, very clear. This of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
being a sudden tumultuary thing
of young idle people without design, and
without that obligation; indeed but an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the other, both as following their
example, and also as occasion'd by the just
offence which they had given the City:
whereas the Army was a form'd deep laid
design of revenge upon them they call'd their
Enemies, of domination over the Parliament
and Kingdom, carry'd on both with power
and cunning, laying the foundation of a
perpetual Tyranny by a company of hir'd
Servants, that had receiv'd more wages ten
times than their work deserv'd, and now
betray'd the trust reposed in them, rising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Masters, whose own Swords
they turn'd upon their breasts, to force them
to do most dishonourable, unjust, infamous
actions, deliver up themselves and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to their wills. So as take the act of
the Apprentices at the worst, it is <hi>ex malis
minimum,</hi> and that of those fugitive Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
at the best, which is, that they were
really under a force, and under a fear, they
did <hi>vitare Charibdim incidere in Scyllam,</hi> and
leap (as the old Proverb is) out of the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingpan
into the Fire, wherein they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98370:86"/>
and well would it be for them in
the day of their accounts if it were but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
but it is too apparent to have been in
some of them a propens'd Malice and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
Combination.</p>
            <p>148. As for what they lay to the eleven
Members, with all the aggravations in that
Declaration, I will not answer it as Mr. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel
Fines</hi> did Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, to say only thou liest, and quote
along the Margin, First, Second, Third,
and Fourth Lie. But this I will say to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it, affirming it upon the word of a
Gentleman, and faith of an honest Man (I
think I may speak as much for the whole
number) I was not in the City all the time
those businesses were in agitation, knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Petitions nor actings in the
Common Council, nothing of the City's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
never saw it till two or three
days after it was printed, had not the least
thought of the Apprentices coming down
to <hi>Westminster,</hi> nor notice of it till the very
day at eleven of the Clock when they were
already there. We had appointed four
days before to meet that day at dinner at the
Bell in <hi>Kingstreet,</hi> there to even our Reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onings,
because we had made a common
Purse for Lawyers Fees and other charges,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98370:87"/>
in preparing our answer for the House, then
to take our leaves one of another, resolving
to go several ways, some beyond Sea, some
into the Country. As I was going into my
Coach (there was with me Sir <hi>Philip Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton,</hi>
Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> Major General
<hi>Massey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Long)</hi> one brought us word
of the hubbub at the House, whereupon we
resolv'd not to go, and parted companies
upon it; but presently Sir <hi>William Lewis</hi>'s
Footman came to tell us, his Master and
Mr. <hi>Nichols</hi> were staying for us at the Bell;
upon which Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Waller,</hi> and my self (who were yet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether)
went thither, but hearing more of
the disorder about <hi>Westminster Hall,</hi> we
would not stay so much as to make an end
of our Dinners, but presently came away.
I mention this particular because I know
they have made a great matter of that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as if it was to be near hand, to receive
information, and send instructions according
to occasion, when we were as innocent of
it as any of those who cry out most against
us; nay more, if it be true what is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
reported, as I said before, that there
were Independents most busie amongst that
unruly multitude.</p>
            <p>149. Here we have seen what those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:98370:87"/>
Members did at the Army, and upon
what ground, and besides what little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
they had to go away upon the pretended
force, which was a sudden thing, then past,
and care taken it should be no more, and
they lying before under a greater force,
which they purposely now ran again into,
to continue it the longer upon themselves
and the Kingdom. Now let us see what in
the mean time was doing at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>150. The Houses met according to the
adjournment upon Friday the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
some six or sevenscore in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and as great a number of Lords in
their House as of those who went to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
but all mute, neither having their
Speaker, for whom they sent about to seek,
waiting till they had certain information
how they had dispos'd of themselves; then
they fell into consideration of what was to
be done, and that offer'd it self, which in
truth was obvious to every man's reason, to
chuse other Speakers. For the Lords House
there could be no question, it was every
day's practice, their Speaker being but <hi>pro
tempore,</hi> and changeable at pleasure; so they
make choice of my Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
For the House of Commons, it lay
not so above ground, their Speaker being a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98370:88"/>
settled Officer, made with great Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and not so moveable at pleasure; but
that he cannot be at all remov'd upon no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
not for misdemeanour (as it is not
esteem'd for a Speaker to be honest, or to be
so powerful by his compliance with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
or the more active part of the House, to be
born out in his Knaveries, as some have the
luck of it) or if he desert the House as Mr.
<hi>Lenthal</hi> lately did, or be disabled by sickness,
or any other accident, I think no Man will
say. For then what Act of continuance will
be of avail to keep up the Parliament, since
it would depend upon the will of one Man,
or the uncertainty of his health, to frustrate
all such provisions, and at any time to set a
period to a Parliament?</p>
            <p>151. Therefore they proceed to the choice
of their Speaker, and pitch upon Mr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Pelham,</hi> who, according to the custom,
is presented at the Lords House Bar, brought
in by my Lord of <hi>Pembrook</hi> in his Robes,
and there receiv'd.</p>
            <p>152. They then go on upon the business
of the House, take into consideration the
Letter spoken of sent by <hi>Rushworth</hi> to Mr.
<hi>Lenthal</hi> the late Speaker, which discover'd
the intention of the Army to march up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98370:88"/>
the City; whereupon they order a
Letter to be written to the General, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
in what quietness they sat, and that
therefore he should not advance his Quarters
any nearer.</p>
            <p>153. They afterwards order the eleven
Members to come and give their attendance,
who were presently sent for, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that had been forc'd by the Army to
forbear the House.</p>
            <p>154. For amongst other enormous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Army, one was, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that some sat there who had born
Arms against the Parliament, or abetted
the other side, they make the House enjoin
some Gentlemen to present a state of their
Case upon certain Votes then pass'd, which
put an incapacity upon such as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in them under a heavy penalty
if they forbore not the House of themselves,
so compelling them either to accuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against all rule of Justice, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
law of Nature, undergoing the greatest
hazard that could be; for if they fail'd in a
tittle, as very well one might in a thing
done three or four years before, or that any
Knave would come and swear something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, they underwent the penalty,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98370:89"/>
or else to deprive themselves of their rights
of sitting in the House, and so the Town or
County which had chosen him lose the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of their Burgess or Knight; indeed this
was a heinous villany, but they are guilty
of so many that one drowns another.</p>
            <p>155. They pass a Vote, that the King
may be humbly desir'd to come to his
own house at <hi>Richmond,</hi> that so the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Parliament and Commissioners of
<hi>Scotland</hi> might have access to him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
what was necessary for settling the
Peace of the Kingdom, himself be in a
place of safety out of the hands and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Army, whose fair shews towards
him they had cause to suspect to be no
other than the kisses of <hi>Iudas,</hi> to betray
and ruin both him and the Kingdom: and
accordingly Messengers were sent to attend
him with it, but the Army frustrated all
those endeavours.</p>
            <p>156. Some other things were pass'd that
day, and lest the Parliament should be
wanting to it self in doing what was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for its defence and the Citys, in case
the Army should not stop upon their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the Committee of Safety is reviv'd,
and order'd, as before, to join with the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98370:89"/>
Militia, and provide for their protection;
and all but need, for Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>
and his two Councils of War, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and the Officers, would not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to read the Letter, but march on
<hi>Rabshekah</hi> like, threatning ruin and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
yet was there no such thought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, our End being not <hi>vim in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,</hi>
but <hi>repellere,</hi> get such a strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us as might only defend, not offend.
To that end those Forces which were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
further off in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> as Sir
<hi>Robert Pye</hi>'s Company, Colonel <hi>Graves</hi>'s,
and some others, were commanded to draw
near the City, not offering or intending
any act of hostility, when upon a sudden,
the Sunday morning the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> a
Party of Horse, about two Regiments,
commanded, as I take it, by one <hi>Desbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
a Major, fell into <hi>Deptford,</hi> where
were some half a score of Sir <hi>Robert Pye</hi>'s
Soldiers who had staid behind the rest to
discharge the Quarters, and most inhuman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and basely butcher'd those poor Men as
many as they could light of, killing besides
any that look'd like a Soldier whom they
found upon the way, some within a stones
cast of the works of <hi>Southwark.</hi> This, as
it was a most barbarous and bloody Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(which will bring down vengeance
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98370:90"/>
upon their heads soon or late, that tho
they should escape the hand of Justice here,
the hand of God will certainly overtake
them) so did it something awaken the
City to see their own danger, and a little
quicken their pace to draw the Ordnance
upon their Works, and man them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
better; but in truth not much. For
I may say they were a people prepar'd for
ruin and slavery, <hi>Gibbs</hi> and <hi>Fowks</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
had bewitch'd them; and Agents for
the Army who were up and down, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
Mens hearts and hands, so as nothing
was done to any purpose for putting them
into a way of safety, or possibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.
All were desirous equally of
Peace, but not all equally afraid of Danger;
those who fear'd it most were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
cause of it: and some good well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men of the Assembly, Mr. <hi>Herbert Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
and others, whom Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> had
wrought upon and perswaded to come to
the Houses first, as being Ministers and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
of Peace, to perswade to Peace,
and then to the Common Council to do
the like to them; which did but dishearten
and discourage those who were apt enough
to fear, being not so fully ready to resist a
power that was coming upon them, and
did hinder the preparations. To say the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98370:90"/>
truth all was done that could be to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and little to help. Insomuch as at
that very time when the Army was
marching up for their destruction, about
49000 l. which had formerly been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to be sent down for the Army's
drawing off further from the City, could
not be privily convey'd out of Town by
Sir <hi>Iohn Wollaston,</hi> and some others, in
which Mr. <hi>Scawen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the House, had a principal hand,
which was as great a blow to Parliament
and City as could be given; for it serv'd
to keep the Soldiers together, and unite
them for marching up, whereas before
there were high discontents amongst
them, and it weaken'd us, even taking
away so much of our blood, that which
at that time we principally stood in need
of.</p>
            <p>157. The Parliament did all that could
be desir'd, yet still with a resolution to
endeavour the ways of preventing extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
Those Commissioners of theirs
who were at the Army had in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
disavowed them, for never any thing
came from them to the Houses; and
Mr. <hi>Skippon,</hi> when the City sent to him
to come and take the conduct and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98370:91"/>
of their business, a duty they might
very well have expected from him, he
was so far from performing it as he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
refus'd except he might have
an assurance from the Parliament, and
from them, to return again to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
if he lik'd not his conditions, which
was a great ingratitude to those who had
deserv'd so well of him, and an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
complyance with them who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
neglected him.</p>
            <p>158. A Message was resolv'd upon to
be sent to the Army, to see if they
could be stopp'd from coming in that
manner to endanger putting all into blood;
Mr. <hi>Swifen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ashurst</hi> as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
were nominated, the rest I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got.
The like was also prepar'd in the
City, and more quickly executed; upon
Tuesday Alderman <hi>Gibbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Noel,</hi> and
some other Aldermen and Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilmen
were appointed to go with it. And
they soon return'd, not with an Olive
branch, but with a heavy doom to the
honour of the City, freedom of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and safety of the poor eleven
Members in the first place, and next of
all that had engag'd in the defence of
the City. The Keys of the City (if I
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98370:91"/>
misremember not) must be deliver'd to
his Excellency, all the Works from the
<hi>Thames</hi> side to <hi>Islington</hi> Fort demolisht,
the eleven Members secur'd or given up,
and all the Reformados and Officers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
who were ready to have fought
for them. This was as worthily by the
Common Council yielded to, their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
notably promoting it. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven
Members were not yet seiz'd nor
deliver'd, but as bad, left to shift for
themselves, no care at all taken for their
preservation, tho the City had now this
last time wholly embark'd in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and engag'd them in their business,
petitioning the House of Commons to
enjoin them to attend the Service of the
House, themselves not at all moving in,
or desiring it: Nay, they did not so much
as provide for Major General <hi>Massey,</hi>
whom they had made their Commander
in chief; but like <hi>Isachar</hi> bow'd under
the Burden, betray'd themselves and all
that had to do with them.</p>
            <p>159. Here was an end of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in truth of the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y, all
whose Glory is laid in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ust; and as
it was high before in reputation both
at home and abroad, so is it now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98370:92"/>
a hissing and reproach to all that
see it or hear of it. The next day Sir
<hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> sends to take possession,
and the day after that marches in state,
bringing with him those deserting Lords
and Commons, and the Earl of <hi>Manche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Lenthal,</hi> the two pretended
Speakers, not vouchsafing to look upon
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, who were
there with the Recorder, provided with
a Speech for his entertainment, which
he did not so well deserve, as they did
that scorn then put upon them.</p>
            <p>160. He goes strait to the Houses,
put those two Men in the Speakers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who had no more right to them
than himself, and has ever since con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
them there by force, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the true Speakers; which the
Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> is to the Peers (that
House being under an adjournment, and
not sitting when the Intruder came in,
so not in a capacity to admit him) and
Mr. <hi>Pelham</hi> to the Commons, who had
been legally chosen when the House was
free and under no force; the other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
deserted, which is of all Crimes the
greatest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:98370:92"/>
161. So as without him it is no House,
but an Assembly of Men acting under
the Army without lawful authority; some
of them by a combination and agreement
with the Army, but far the greater part by
a terror and an awe from it, and therefore
to be look'd upon accordingly; and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionless
many of them continuing there
out of a good intent, like so many <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shais,</hi>
only to defeat the pernicious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of those <hi>Achitophels</hi> who had design'd
the destruction of <hi>David,</hi> the ruin of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Men, and even the trouble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of the whole <hi>Israel</hi> of God, Church
and State. These are so far from deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thereby either to become the object
of blame or pardon, as they merit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
are worthy the praise both of
present and future times; but to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
rather as faithful Patriots, that
act out of necessity in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way, stand in the Gap to keep off
mischief, than as Members of Parliament
able or indeed qualify'd to exercise any
parliamentary Power for the good of the
Kingdom; the House having been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd,
and for the time suppress'd by a
real Force, not feign'd and imaginary as
the other was; and while this force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98370:93"/>
not suffer'd to come together, but
as soon as it ceases will return of it self
to be as it was before.</p>
            <p>162. For there is a difference between
these two Cases, one the Parliaments act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under a force, remaining still to be
a Parliament, which dos not annual it,
nor the Acts it dos; but makes them fit
to be repeal'd, yet standing good <hi>pro tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>163. Many of our best Laws have
been so made (when Armies have been
on foot) and afterwards declar'd good
in a free Parliament; and what then
done did appear to be inconvenient and
unjust, was by subsequent Parliaments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd.
So is it fit that what was compel'd
to be done by the Apprentices and others
in that tumultuous way, the Monday that
the force was, should be repeal'd, as not fit
to be continu'd. And so all that has
been done a great while, under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and force of the Army, since it first
rebel'd and gave Laws to the Parliament,
is as fit, if not more, to be hereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd;
and questionless will, if ever the
Parliament come to be free again. Nay,
even these pretenders do us that right,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98370:93"/>
as finding the proceedings of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
after their desertion not sutable
to their Ends, but against them, by an
Ordinance to repeal and declare them null;
which otherwise had not been needful,
seeing they would fall of themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Crimes in their own nature as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from an usurp'd Authority. This
is one case; the other is, when a force
proceeds so far and so high as not to
suffer a Parliament to be, gives it such
a wound as for the time it cannot act,
but must cease, even as a wounded Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that lies in a Trance without sense
or motion: But when that force is over,
and the Spirits recollected, it returns to
it self to do the functions of life, move
and act as formerly. It is but like a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis
in a Sentence, and remains one
and the same as if the Parenthesis were
not at all.</p>
            <p>164. But to return where I left. This
General, a setter up and puller down of
Parliaments, has a Chair set him in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
House, where first in the Lords
House, then in the Commons, those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Speakers make Speeches to him,
giving him thanks for all, approving his
Declaration of the Reasons of his coming
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98370:94"/>
to <hi>London,</hi> desiring him to go on in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
care for the security of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and to appoint a Guard for the
Parliament. Than which there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any thing more base; but Mr. <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thal</hi>
exceeded, being both base and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
applying a <hi>Higgaior Selah</hi> to this
last act of his Excellency, who as wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took it. Then that the prophaness
might be compleat, and God mock'd as
well as Men abus'd, they appoint the
Thursday after for a day of Thanksgiving,
and fitted it with Preachers, Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Nye, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> where
they say <hi>Marshal</hi> outwent all that had gone
before him, and his Brother <hi>Nye</hi> was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Presbyterian in comparison of him; but
that Apostate went beyond <hi>Ela,</hi> making
this deliverance a greater one than the
Gunpowder Treason, as I have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
inform'd by those that heard him.
And some few days after, Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax</hi>
and the whole Army marcht in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
with Lawrel in their Hats as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
through the subdu'd City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to shew it was at his mercy; which
was an airy vanity I confess above my
understanding, and might have rais'd
a spirit of Indignation, not so easily to
have been laid. But a higher insolency
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98370:94"/>
of an Army compos'd of so mean peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and a more patient humble submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and bearing of a great and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
City, but a little before so full of
honour and greatness, was, I think, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of.</p>
            <p>165. And now the Houses fall to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
the Lords leading the way, and
outdoing the Commons, as much as Mr.
<hi>Lenthal</hi> outdid the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi> in
the Thanksgiving, or Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> did
Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> in the thanksgiving Sermon.
They make Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissimo,
Commander in chief of all the
Forces in the Kingdom, and Constable of
the Tower, otherwise signifying Mr. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
Cromwel,</hi> of whom Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was the
shadow; they thank his Excellency over
again for his care of the safety of the
City and Parliament, <hi>Risum teneatis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mici;</hi>
leave it wholly to him to appoint
what Guards he thinks fit for their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
<hi>Sed quis custodiet custodes?</hi> give a
months Pay for a gratuity to the Army
for their many good Services, which is
<hi>praemium nequitiae;</hi> then set up the Star
Chamber, the High Commission, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Inquisition, in one Committee of ten
Lords and twenty Commoners (read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
but their names, and you will swear
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98370:95"/>
it, except for four of the Commoners, who
are very unequally yok'd, sixteen against
them) to sit in the painted Chamber <hi>de die
in diem,</hi> to examine the business of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny,
and of forcing the Houses.</p>
            <p>166. So far the Lords lead and the
Commons follow; but in another Vote
they go by themselves a good while,
that all things done by the Members
since as they injuriously and falsly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
the Speakers and other Members
were driven away from the Parliament,
be annull'd, and of no effect, and declar'd
to have been so at the making thereof.
The Commons can't agree to this, but
put off the debare to another time. Some
sense of honour there was amongst them,
and of the dangerous consequence of such
a Vote, besides the unreasonableness and
injustice, taking away the Authority by
which those Votes were made, and so
exposing to question and ruin all such
as were at the passing of them, or had
acted by them. Many days debates were
spent upon it, but it could not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
the House of Commons would be
a House of Commons still; and as they
represent the people of <hi>England,</hi> so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
their Liberties, if they were left to
themselves, and not overaw'd by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Army.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:98370:95"/>
167. Therefore the Agitators must to
work again with an humble Address to
his Excellency, and some Proposals on
behalf of the Kingdom and the Army:
First, That all those that have fat at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> usurping a parliamentary
Authority, since the forcible expulsion
of the Parliament, may immediately be
excluded the House. Secondly, That
those Members who have adher'd to that
pretended Parliament, may be also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
under a penalty if they presume
to sit. Thirdly, That all former Votes
against disaffected Members may be put
in execution. And this is to make a free
Parliament, for those Rogues to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
who shall sit, who shall not, and
how they shall be punish'd who diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
them. These Lords and Commoners
deserve well of Parliament and Kingdom,
that ran away from the Parliament, and
went to the Army for this.</p>
            <p>168. Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of War answer presently, for it is
but a Song of two parts, making one
harmony, all set by the same hand. A
Remonstrance is forthwith produc'd and
sent to both Houses the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:98370:96"/>
a sorrowful Ditty for the poor House of
Commons, which tells them plainly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long deduction of all passages,
just lying over the same Lies again,
That those Members which sat during the
absence of the Speakers, are guilty of the
prosecution and maintenance of the said
treasonable engagement and violence, and
therefore must not be their Judges (but
their adverse Party shall be theirs, which
is Army Justice) That they might have
been made Prisoners of War; wherefore
they protest and declare, if they hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
intrude themselves to sit in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they can no longer suffer it, but
will take some speedy effectual course,
that both they and others guilty of the
same practices may be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign
punishment.</p>
            <p>169. And they back this Remonstrance
(for which the Lords return a Letter of
approbation and great thanks to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
for his continu'd care of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and freedom of Parliament) with a
Party of a thousand Horse drawn up to
<hi>Hide-Park; Cromwel</hi> and <hi>Ireton</hi> making
menacing Speeches in the House, and
Guards out of the Army besetting the
doors and avenues. By all which means,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98370:96"/>
and the terror of their surly impeaching
looks (as some of the Pamphleteers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it) many of the Members were
driven away, and the poor House forc'd
the 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> to pass the Ordinance
for declaring all Votes, Orders, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
made in one or both Houses
from <hi>Iuly</hi> 26 till <hi>August</hi> 6, null and void.
And now they are a free Parliament,
or as <hi>Haslerig</hi> told them the next day
after the eleven Members were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
a glorious Parliament, in truth
no Parliament, but they are what Mr.
<hi>Cromwel</hi> will have them to be.</p>
            <p>170. Then they lay about them, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
seven Lords of High Treason, spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
only my Lord of <hi>Pembrook.</hi> They
proceed against some of their own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
suspend Mr. <hi>Bainton,</hi> put Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<hi>Copley</hi> and Mr. Recorder out of the
House, whom they commit to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for high Misdemeanours, expel like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Sir <hi>Iohn Maynard,</hi> and send him
to the Tower. The rest of the eleven
Members upon the City's delivering up
it self and the Parliament to the will of
the Army, having sent for their Passes
which the House had order'd and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them withdrawn themselves into fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98370:97"/>
parts, the Lord Mayor and some
of the Aldermen were likewise imprison'd
in the Tower, and charg'd with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
And all honest Men persecuted,
threaten'd, and therefore fled and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
some one way and some another;
and these are the effects of a free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>171. The Lieutenant of the Tower,
Colonel <hi>West,</hi> an honest and gallant Man,
after he had been at charge to treat and
entertain Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> coming to
take possession of his Place as Constable,
was by that worthy General, by way
of thankfulness for his good entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
turn'd out: And an Independent,
one <hi>Tichburn</hi> a Linen Draper, put in,
which was done with so much insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and scorn of the City, as when his
favourite Alderman <hi>Gibbs</hi> had prepar'd
a long winded Speech in the name of the
City, who crav'd it as a Boon and Act
of Grace, that he would keep in the old
Lieutenant, he cut him off short, and bid
him speak no more of it. Indeed it had
been against his Instructions, and the
Maxim of his Master <hi>Cromwel</hi> and all
that faction, which is to suffer none in any
power save such as are theirs Body and
Soul, and put all others out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:98370:97"/>
172. So Colonel <hi>Pointz</hi> was seiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by force fetch'd out of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
in the North; Major General <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi>
must not continue in his of the West;
Captain <hi>Patten</hi> turn'd out of his Vice
Admiralship, and <hi>Rainsborough</hi> put in;
Colonel <hi>Carne</hi> out of the Government of
the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and <hi>Hammond</hi> in his
room. The Self-denying Ordinance was
a trick for this purpose. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these troubles Sir <hi>William Lewis</hi>
not agreeing with their Palate, being Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> they make the
Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> who was then General,
send for him, upon a supposition that he
was a favourer of Malignants, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things; which being examin'd
by the Committee of Safety, he gave so
good an account of himself, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
could not do less than write a
Letter in his justification to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
leaving it to him to repair him as
he thought fit. Then some of these honest
Men, who themselves had subscrib'd to
it, sent a Letter privately to my Lord
of <hi>Essex,</hi> by which they advis'd his not
sending him back to <hi>Portsmouth;</hi> which
jugling of theirs he receiv'd with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and wish'd Sir <hi>William Lewis</hi> to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98370:98"/>
return to his Command: but he seeing
what Men he had to deal with, quitted
the Employment; and to say the truth,
he only can be happy who has nothing
to do with them, except it be in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them according to their demerits.</p>
            <p>173. They have now they think both
Houses to their minds, ready to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they please. Accordingly the House
of Commons orders those of the eleven
Members, who were beyond Sea upon their
Passes, which gave them liberty of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
six Months, to appear the 16<hi>th</hi> of
<hi>October,</hi> taking no course to have them
summon'd, only notice to be given at
their Houses, or places of their last abode,
where few of us had any Servants, my
self only an old Porter and a Maid or
two.</p>
            <p>174. Then they go on to the publick
business, such work as the Army had cut
out for them. Which were certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals
that Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> and the
Council of War had sent them the 1<hi>st</hi> of
<hi>August,</hi> sign'd by <hi>Iohn Rushworth</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
now far above <hi>Iohn Brown</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Elsing.</hi> In these they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> down a new
platform of Government, an <hi>Vtopia</hi> of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98370:98"/>
their own, take upon them to alter all,
give Rules to all, cajole the King, claw
with the people, cheat both, never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good to either. The reading of the
Articles themselves which are in print
will satisfie every body; they need no
Comment, and are so many, and of so
vast a comprehension, as to treat of them
all, to shew the absurdities, contradictions,
impossibilities, unreasonableness, which
many of them contain, would swell this
to too big a Volume. I will only speak to
some few, and shew how they dissolve the
whole frame of this Monarchy, taking a
sunder every part, pulling out every pin
and new making it. First, The constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and proceedings of Parliaments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
new things for their beginnings,
continuances, and endings, for the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Members, privileges and customs
of the Houses, which they had violated
before <hi>de facto,</hi> but now must be alter'd
<hi>de jure.</hi> The Militia of the Kingdom,
where they will have a General appointed
to command it, Pay setled to maintain it,
a Council of State to superintend it, which
signifies to establish by Act of Parliament
this holy Army, the Council of War, and
General <hi>Cromwel.</hi> Then matters of the
Church, where they will have no power
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98370:99"/>
exercis'd to preserve Religion and Piety;
they would have Bishops so they may be
just Cyphers, and all Acts to be repeal'd,
which hinder Men from being Atheists or
Independents; for no body must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
to come to the Church, and there
may be Meetings to practise any thing of
superstition and folly, the Covenant must
be laid aside. In sum, it is to take away
all Government and set up Independency.
They propose a new way for making grand
Jury-men, Justices of Peace, and Sheriffs.
When these and many other things which
they mention are settled, which will take
up time enough, then the King, Queen,
and Royal Issue to be restor'd, which is as
much as just nothing. Next they make the
people believe they do as great matters
for them, will have a liberty of petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is but to make way for schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
seditious Petitions; for if any Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
stick at their <hi>Diana,</hi> none so fierce
to punish. Who more than they against
all the Petitions from <hi>London</hi> and the
Counties for disbanding of the Army, and
complaining of their factious ways? how
eager were they against the Petitions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
in the City in the beginning, for
which <hi>Benion</hi> was fined, and many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
and some Petitions out of <hi>Kent,</hi> for
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98370:99"/>
which some Gentlemen were committed?
How barbarously did they fall upon some
poor women which came one time to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
petitioning for Peace, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Troop of Horse to run over them,
the Train'd Bands to shoot at them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
many were wounded and some kill'd?
Yet the world must think they will have
it free for all to petition. Then they will
have the Excise taken off from some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
whereon the poor people live,
and a time limited for taking off the
whole; which was but to please and amuse
them till they had got the mastery of those
who they thought stood in their way: but
being Masters themselves, they soon sent
out a Command (more now than any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
or Ordinance) to forbid all Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
any way to interrupt the levying
of the Excise, orany other Tax charg'd
by the Parliament, which they had made
merely instrumental to poll the people for
the support of them and their Faction.
They will have no Tythes to be paid,
and so Ministers to be starv'd for in truth
they would have no Ministers at all, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no Ministery; like <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
take away <hi>presbyterium</hi> not <hi>presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros:</hi>
for Ministers that will be subservient
to them, like Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> shall be much
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98370:100"/>
made of. The rules and course of Law
must be reduc'd; indeed they will need
no Law, for they will rule by the Sword,
and the Councils of War shall supply all
Courts of Justice. Prisoners for debt, if
they have not wherewith to pay, must be
freed; so we may be sure few debts shall
be satisfy'd, for it is an easie thing so to
convey or conceal an Estate, as nothing
visible will be left for doing right to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.
None must be compell'd to answer
to questions tending to the accusing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
or their nearest Relations in crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Causes, witness their Orders to make
men under great Penalties state their Case
in no less matter than Treason; therefore
this is understood to extend only to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
of their own Faction. We must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all Statutes and Customs of Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and of imposing Oaths which may be
constru'd to the molestation of religious
people, that is, Independents, for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are Greeks and Barbarians. Yet these
men, in how many Letters and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do they say and protest, they have no
thought of setting up Independency, nor to
meddle with any thing but what concerns
the Soldiery, and leave all the rest to the
wisdom of the Parliament. Indeed they
conclude their Proposals with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98370:100"/>
the Soldiery: That provision may
be made for payment of Arrears to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and the rest of the Soldiers of the
Kingdom who have concurr'd with them
in their late proceedings: and in the next
place, of the publick debts and damages
of the Kingdom, which they have taken
a course that the Parliament shall never
satisfie, having caus'd such a debt to the
Soldiers, and so insupportable a charge for
the maintenance of the Army, which is to
be satisfy'd in the first place before other
debts to the rest of the Kingdom, that the
Subject is not able to bear it, but is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ruin'd.</p>
            <p>175. To some of these Heads they say
they will offer some speedy particulars
in the nature of Rules, of good use to
the publick: Rules indeed, from which,
and from the Rulers, good Lord deliver
us. But here you see they compile a work
like the second part of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, treating
from the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon</hi> to the Hysop
on the Wall; of all degrees and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
from the King that should be on the
Throne to the Beggar in Prison. And
since they have brought both ends toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so now we have a free Parliament
and a free Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:98370:101"/>
176. Every day produces some effects
of their tyranny and power, like another
<hi>Africk,</hi> some Monster, tho they were not
without their difficulties to wrestle with
and overcome. For to bring so absolute a
Bondage upon a people that was free be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
could not be without many heats
and colds. They had the King to deal
with, whom they must in some measure
satisfie and perswade that they had good
intentions for him, to restore and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him in a power and dignity sutable
to his Royal Person and Office, from which
the truth and bottom of their design did
differ <hi>toto coelo:</hi> they had the King's Party,
whom they must entertain in hopes and
expectation, and then cozen; they had
the Parliament which must be kept under,
brought to obedience, and a total subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vience
to their will and command. They
had the generality of the people, who were
for Government and Monarchy founded
upon Peace (as they had reason) desirous
to be eas'd of their Burdens and Taxes,
with hopes whereof the Army had fed
them, but it stood not with their Interest
to procure it them. They had lastly their
own faction which troubled them most of
all, being violent, impatient, not to be
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98370:101"/>
gain'd to go the pace of their Grandees,
and wait the revolutions of time, which
they desir'd might have taken place, for
the same things to be effected which even
those headstrong furious people coveted,
but with more ease, advantage, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to themselves.</p>
            <p>177. For they apprehended it very
dangerous to fall presently upon his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and break with him, seeing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of the people towards him, and
he at liberty for all persons to have access
unto him, whom he might confer with,
inform, and dispose according to occasion,
perhaps take some resolutions which they
apprehended might turn to their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.
Besides, they knew not how the
Scotish Nation might then declare and
engage, which with the help of those
whom they had already discontented by
their injustice and oppression in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their particular malice and revenge,
and those whom they should discontent
by frustrating their expectation, having
born them in hand with hopes of Peace
and freedom from Taxes, must needs have
given a great interruption to their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and even shake the foundation of
their whole design; therefore they must
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98370:102"/>
work in another way, make his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
believe they will do great things for
him, so to receive rather an advantage
than hinderance from his influence upon
the affections of the Kingdom. To this
end were all those applications to him by
<hi>Cromwel, Ireton,</hi> and the rest of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Instruments, in framing of the
proposals, appearing for his interest in the
House, seeming to desire his restitution,
being now turn'd absolute Courtiers. They
knew it would at last come all to one
with that which they have since done to
him. For, coming to a settlement with
his concurrence, they had the power, he but
<hi>vanam imaginem;</hi> and what of lustre and
quietness had been contributed by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
conjunction, would but have serv'd
to have confirm'd and heighten'd their
authority, all had been but Stilts to raise
them above the rest of the Kingdom and
himself likewise; so as it had been in their
power (as well as we are sure it had been
in their will) to destroy him afterwards,
he should have only been a little longer
repriev'd, as <hi>Vlysses</hi> was by <hi>Polyphemus</hi> to
be devour'd at last.</p>
            <p>178. But the Party would not give way
to this; hatred to the King, envy and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98370:102"/>
against their aspiring Leaders, and
a violent desire of having the work done
at once, lay all persons and things level
on the sudden, bring forth their mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
conceptions all at one birth, made
them break out, flye in their faces, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
many of their villanies, and, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by that business of <hi>Lilburn</hi> and <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
even resolve to take <hi>Cromwel</hi> out
of the way, and murder him for an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>
            <p>179. When <hi>Cromwel, Ireton,</hi> and the
rest saw this, and that this madness of the
inferiour sort of their Disciples, which had
formerly rais'd them, supported them,
and lately given them the advantage of
their Enemies, victory over the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a superiority over all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
would now be their ruin, if either
they clos'd throughly with the King (for
then their Party would forsake them, turn
against them, and they knew they had so
well merited of King and Kingdom, as
not to expect to be preserv'd in greatness,
either for honesty or abilities) or if the
King continu'd at liberty at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi>
or any other place, where freedom
of resort might be to him, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
taken and improv'd to meet with and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98370:103"/>
prevent all their attempts, that then it
would be impossible to carry on their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
in an open and declar'd way of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
against him. They saw a necessity
of removing him, and making sure his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
that done, they thought they might
be bold to do and say what they would,
and own a second time the actings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
of the Agitators.</p>
            <p>180. The difficulty was how to bring
this about, to cozen the King so as to
make him act it himself, and flie into the
Cage; carry him by force they durst not,
it would be unhandsom, it might be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous:
They use this stratagem, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
and sharpen underhand the mad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of their Party against him, to have
it break out all manner of ways, in threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Speeches, Pamphlets; some consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that whilst his Majesty liv'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
he could not be safe; meetings to
consider and come to some resolutions of
taking him out of the way: the Army is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
disquiet, the Officers not obey'd, all
things tending to mutiny, and some vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
eruption. Then dos Mr. <hi>Cromwel</hi>
and his Cabinet Council seem to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
solicitous of the safety of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's
person, cause some discoveries to be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98370:103"/>
given him of his danger, express great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
and trouble in the House, in the
Army, and other places against these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
act their parts so to the life, as
the Life of a Man must go to make up
the disguise: an Agitator whom at a
Council of War, with two more, they
condemned, was shot to death; so as
the King could not but have a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in these Men to believe that they
were really for his preservation. At last
<hi>Cromwel</hi> writes a Letter to <hi>Whalley</hi> (who
commands the Guards about his Majesty's
Person) to be shewn his Majesty; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
informations are likewise brought
him, to make him believe that if he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd
not presently he will be murder'd;
and he is advis'd to go to the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi>
where they had beforehand provided him
a Jaylor, Colonel <hi>Hammond,</hi> one for whom
they said they could answer, that there his
Majesty would be in safety, and they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to serve him.</p>
            <p>181. Here they have the King safe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and now the Army is presently
quiet, the Agitators as obedient as Lambs,
and Councils of War are set up again to
act as formerly. And Sir <hi>Thomas Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi>
with their advice, sets out a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98370:104"/>
to give satisfaction to the Army,
which he concludes with a Protestation,
to adhere to, conduct, live and die with
the Army in the prosecution of some things
there express'd; as namely, To obtain a
present provision for constant Pay, stating
of Accounts, security for Arrears, with
an effectual and speedy course to raise
Monies, a period to be set to this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
provision for future Parliaments,
the certainty of their meeting, sitting, and
ending, the freedom and equality of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,
and other things which he had
the impudence and boldness to publish in
print.</p>
            <p>182. And now instead of the Proposals,
they intend to send the four Bills to his
Majesty to sign, which done, they would
treat with him. By these Bills the Army
was to be establish'd, which was the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
of that for the Militia; and by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them they would make sure, that
the countenance of the Parliament and the
acting of the Army should never be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated;
which was the intent of that for
power of adjourning. So as if at any time
the just sense of Indignation, of so many
Indignities and Injuries offer'd by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to all ranks of Men, Magistrates both
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98370:104"/>
supreme and subordinate, people of all
conditions and degrees should stir them
up to some endeavours of casting off this
iron Yoke; their Party in Parliament,
with their Speaker Mr. <hi>Lenthal</hi>'s help,
should presently be ready to adjourn to the
Army, then damn and destroy all the
world by colour of Law and power of
the Sword; so King and Kingdom must
be subject to a perpetual slavery by Act of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>183. The Scots were laid aside in this
Address to his Majesty, contrary to the
Treaty, and contrary to the Covenant.
By the Treaty there ought to have been
no application for Peace but with their
advice and consent; here the Scots did
not only not advise nor consent, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
against it. By the Covenant all were
bound to keep united, firm and close one
to another, not to suffer themselves to be
divided; here these Men do divide from
the whole Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> make a
rent and breach between the Kingdoms in
settling of the Peace, the very end both
of Treaty and Covenant.</p>
            <p>184. And for that subterfuge, that it
is against the privilege of Parliament that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98370:105"/>
any out of the Houses should interpose, or
have any thing to do with Bills, it is a
mere cavil, Fig-leaves which cover not
their nakedness; for that would have been
no more against Privilege, than was the
whole transaction of business in carrying
on of the War, and managing other great
concernments of Parliament and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
wherein the Scots all along were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to participate in Counsel and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.</p>
            <p>185. The King refusing to sign these
Bills, <hi>Hammond,</hi> by Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>'s
single order, claps him up a Prisoner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
all his Servants. It seems by this
time they had forgot their Remonstrance
of the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> where they say it is
against their principles to imprison the
King, and that there can be no Peace
without due consideration of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
Rights: But then was then, and
now is now. It was then necessary for
the good of their Affairs to seem graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
desirous of Peace, and of restoring
the King. Now they appear in their
own colours, their nature having no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint;
nay, Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is so absolute and sacred, as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Burley</hi> was hang'd for endeavouring
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:98370:105"/>
to oppose it, there being at that time no
other pretence for his Majesty's Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but because Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> had
commanded it: it is true, that upon his
signification to the Houses of what he had
done, it was approv'd of and confirm'd.</p>
            <p>186. All this while a rigorous hand
is continu'd against the impeach'd Lords
who were under the Black Rod, the
Gentlemen of the House of Commons,
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen in the
Tower, who had been kept Prisoners so
many Months, upon a general Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and no particular Charge against
them. It was often endeavour'd in the
House to have pass'd the Articles which
were brought in against the Lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby,</hi>
to be a leading Case to the rest.
Where I cannot pass by, that I find he
is charg'd with Treason for levying War
against the King, and this done by the
same persons that imprison the King, and
had hang'd <hi>Burley</hi> for levying War for
him: One may see they will find matter
to hang on all hands. Many debates
were had on this business, and at last it
was resolv'd to lay the Articles aside.</p>
            <p>187. The seven Lords still press'd for
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98370:106"/>
their Trial, the House of Peers as often
sent down to the House of Commons to
give them notice of it; and no Charge
coming up, they set them at liberty. The
Common Council likewise petition'd for
the liberty of their Members in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
which the Army took so heinously,
as that and the laying aside of the Charge
against the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> together with
a Vote which had pass'd for disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the supernumerary Forces, produce
a thundring Remonstrance of <hi>December</hi>
the 7<hi>th,</hi> casting in the Parliaments teeth
their delays and neglects: That the Army
had with patience waited four Months
upon them: That finding such obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in matters of supply, and such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
requital, they apprehended God
upbraids their care to preserve a people
given up to their own destruction: That
they could, to speak Amen, with the
power and advantages God had put into
their hands (for so is their expression)
have put the Army and other Forces en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
with it into such a posture as to
have assur'd themselves of Pay, and made
their opposers have follow'd them with
offers of satisfaction: That now all busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
seems to be wrapt up in one bare
Vote, That all supernumery Forces should
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98370:106"/>
be disbanded, which Vote they say they
cannot imagine to be absolute and sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign:
They offer as their final advice, that
40000 <hi>l.</hi> more <hi>per mensem</hi> be added to
the 60000 <hi>l.</hi> that is in all 100000 <hi>l.</hi> a
Month. That for the more sure and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
payment, the Force<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> may be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
assign'd to several Counties, out
of whose Taxes they shall be paid, and
the General have power to make those
distributions. And many things more
they offer, or rather order for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Soldiers so peremptorily, as if
it be not granted and pass'd effectually
by the end of that present week, they
say they can give no longer account of
the Army in a regular way; but if they
find not satisfaction in their judgments,
must take some extraordinary ways of
power. Then they come and vent their
malice against the City, of which they
say they have been so tender; witness
their carriage in their late advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, notwithstanding provocations,
their innocent march through it, their
patient waiting for their long due Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears.
But now Justice forces them to
desire that (the adjacent Counties being
undone, and the whole Kingdom groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the oppressions of free Quarter,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98370:107"/>
whilst the City, which occasions all, is
free of it) there be no longer stop to the
drawing thither of the Army: That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
levying the arrear of the Tax, it
make reparation to the parts adjacent of
100000 <hi>l.</hi> damage: That if they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
or call'd on by the County, they
must on their behalf demand of the City
to the full: They earnestly desire that the
proceedings against the Citizens and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
impeach'd may be hasten'd, and that
out of their Fines and Confiscations some
part of reparation be made to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Then they say they see not how the
Parliament can sit in safety in the Army
should never so little withdraw, when
they find the Common Council, thro the
Parliament and Army's lenity, take the
boldness already, in the face of both, to
intercede for the release and acquittal, or
rather justification of those impeach'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who are but fellow Delinquents to
most of that Council: That the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this, and the renew'd confidence
of Mr. <hi>Gwin,</hi> and other Members, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
in the same things, who presume
to sit in the House, makes them fear, that
through lenity and moderation, so much of
the same Leven is left behind, as even the
worst of the eleven Members (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98370:107"/>
their double Crimes) may be
again call'd for in, unless the House by
some exclusive resolutions and proceedings
do timely prevent the same.</p>
            <p>188. Indeed these are gracious Princes,
full of lenity and moderation, by their
own sayings; but they dwell by ill Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
that they must commend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for no body else will do it. The
Parliament is beholden to them, they tell
them their faults, bid them not trust so
much to their Votes, which are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
nor soveraign; let them know what
is their duty to do, and give a short day
to perform it in, lest they should be idle,
and a worse thing fall upon them. The
Country is beholden to them, who now
know the worst of it; 100000 <hi>l.</hi> to be
monthly rais'd to ease them of Taxes, and
the Excise according to promise: but then
they have to help them, reparation from
the City for former damages, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
appointed out of whose Estates it must
be paid by way of Fine or Confiscation,
whether they prove guilty or no; and
they are not wanting in their expressions
to the City of their tenderness of it,
wherefore they give good instance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against it with Banners display'd,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98370:108"/>
Horse and Foot armed, Cannon loaden,
and only take possession of their Works
and of the Tower, change their Militia,
take from them <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi>
commit their Mayor and principal
Aldermen, yet doing the City no hurt
(like the Fryer in <hi>Chaucer,</hi> who would
have but of the Capon the Liver, and of
a Pig the head, yet nothing for him should
be dead) then marching through it so
innocently, only putting that scorn upon
them which none of their Kings ever did
when most provok'd; that to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd
a plundering had been more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
Then waited so patiently for their
Arrears, when they had a great part of
the 200000 <hi>l.</hi> which the City had lent
for their disbanding, had taken that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
yet would not disband, and destroy'd
Trade by their late Rebellion; and now
having so long lain upon free quarter all
about, that they had made Provisions
excessive dear, and almost famish'd the
City, to express a desire to come and
quarter in it, which sure was for their
good, only Justice made them move they
should pay 100000 <hi>l.</hi> for reparation to
the Country; that their best Members,
greatest Aldermen, and others, and their
Lord Mayor, whom they had caus'd to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98370:108"/>
be unjustly committed, should be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
fin'd and ruin'd; and then charge
so honourable a Court as the Common
Council with Treason.</p>
            <p>189. Then for the eleven Members,
how much they are beholden to them is
beyond expression, all their Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as well as this make it appear; here
they desir'd only they might have a Writ
of ease from attending the Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more, out of their abounding care
for the freedom of Parliaments, and the
free sitting and voting of the Members.</p>
            <p>190. And they will be sure to have
all put in execution, the refractory
House of Commons shall make them wait
no longer. A Regiment or two of Foot
march and quarter in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Horse in the <hi>Mews</hi> (they having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
another Lodging for the King,
therefore making bold with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's
House) and then they think they
can take a course both with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and City; which in truth they do
full handsomly.</p>
            <p>191. For presently they make them
resume the consideration of the Charge
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:98370:109"/>
against the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and pass it,
and likewise against the rest of those
Lords, and Sir <hi>Iohn Maynard;</hi> carry it
up to the House of Lords, and demand
the recommitting of those Lords, and
putting them to their answer. Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur
Haslerig,</hi> the now worthy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> staid in town from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to take possession of his Command,
only to do this feat; so to make good
what he before said, when they could
not upon a long debate, and the laying
out of all their strength and power, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Impeachment, that it was no
matter, the Army should impeach them
all.</p>
            <p>192. A little after the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of
<hi>Groby</hi> sets on foot the motion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those of the eleven Members who
were beyond Sea, having had Passes to
travel for six Months, and most of them
written or sent to the Speaker and other
Gentlemen of the House, to desire the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of a longer continuance, in regard it
was winter, and ill crossing the Seas; but
if it would not be granted, upon significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their pleasure, they would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
return. They had likewise (upon
occasion of the Order of Summons) writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98370:109"/>
of the uncertain report they had heard
of such a thing long after it was done,
that if notice had been given them of it,
they had not fail'd to appear, and would
if they might be certify'd that the House
continu'd in the same resolution; so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
were they of their innocency, tho
they knew the malice of their Enemies,
and their violence and force upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament:
But proceedings since have made
it clear what Justice they should have
found. For notwithstanding all this,
those Horse and Foot were so powerful
an argument against them, backing the
Remonstrance for the exclusive resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it was carry'd to expel them
the House, and Impeachments order'd to
be brought in. A parallel proceeding to
this was never known in Parliament,
where it has not been refus'd to any,
especially who were beyond Sea, or in
truth any where absent upon leave, to
give a further day upon non-appearance
the first; and in our Case there was a
great deal more reason, considering the
season of the year, the occasion of our
departure (then look'd upon as a merit)
our readiness to obey upon the first Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
All this writes but their Injustice
and our Oppression in the more Capital
Letters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:98370:110"/>
193. I am now coming to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe
of this Tragedy, the last and
most horrid Act. The Parliament forc'd
to do that which is unnatural against
the being of Parliament, the end for which
it is call'd, which has <hi>rationem formae</hi> in all
moral things; that is, to declare they will
make no further address or application to
the King, receive none from him, nor
suffer it in others; which is, as if a Limb
should cut it self off from the Body, and
thereby deprive it self of life and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment:
For the communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and Parliament is that
which gives it being and life. It is call'd
by the King, <hi>ad colloquium habendum &amp;
tractatum cum proceribus Regni, &amp;c.</hi> They
are the words of the Writ which brings
them together. Now there is <hi>Colloquium
&amp; Tractatus</hi> cut off, which was the first
unhappy breach between his Majesty and
this Parliament, and which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
found themselves grieved at, that
he had withdrawn himself from them, so
as they could not repair unto him for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and counsel. And in all our Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Messages in the beginning, until
these people (who it seems had projected
from the first what they have now acted)
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98370:110"/>
got to the Helm, and steer'd us into this
violent tempestuous Course, that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
see our Pole, nor use our Compass;
we still desir'd, press'd, endeavour'd his
Majesty's return to his Parliament: But
they say he shall not return, the Regal
Power they have assum'd, they will keep
it and exercise it. They will no longer
be fellow Subjects with the rest of the
Kingdom, but Lords and Masters. Those
whom they represent, and whose substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
they are, they will put under their
foot; as if an Ambassadour should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Prince that sent him, and say
he will make his own Dignity real and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
which is but representative and
deriv'd, take away the substance and yet
the shadow remain: certainly this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
against nature, and will turn
all upside down; yet this disorder must
be made perpetual, put out of all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of recovery, like Death, from
which there can be no returning. For
admit the King would grant all that
they have desir'd or can desire, give them
all imaginable security for it, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
it should be made known, and
so cannot be receiv'd, and by consequence
our Peace never be settled; which is cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kingdom into a mortal disease,
putting it past cure, past hope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:98370:111"/>
194. To shew by what Magick this
Spirit is rais'd, you have his fellow De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
immediately call'd up by a Council
of War; a Declaration comes from his
Excellency and the general Council of
the Army from <hi>Windsor,</hi> bearing date the
9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> presented to the House
the 11<hi>th</hi> by Sir <hi>Hardress Waller,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they give their approbation of the Votes,
say the Parliament in that Address to the
King, with the four Bills, could go no
lower without denying that which God,
in the issue of War, had born such te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
unto: That they account that
great business of a settlement to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and security to the publick interest
thereof, by and with the King's concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
to be brought to so clear a trial,
as that upon the King's denyal, they can
see no further hopes of settlement and
security that way; therefore upon the
consideration of that denyal, added to so
many other such Votes as had been pass'd
that no further application should be
made to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They do freely and
unanimously declare for themselves and
the Army, that they are resolv'd firmly
to adhere with and stand by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in the things so voted, and in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98370:111"/>
what shall be further necessary for the
prosecution thereof, and for the settling
and securing the Parliament and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
without the King, and against the
King, or any other that shall hereafter
partake with him.</p>
            <p>195. And in this I believe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(I am confident) the only truth has
proceeded from them in all their Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
or Proposals, with relation to his
Majesty. I would remember them, if
'twere to any purpose, of some of their
former professions, That it was against
their principles to imprison the King,
that no Peace could be lasting without
him, and the like. But they can blow
hot and cold, as the fellow in the Fable,
to make all the Satyrs, and almost the
Devil himself abhor them, as afraid to
be outdone by them in his own art
of lying and dissembling. Therefore I
shall not trouble my self any more with
blazoning their Coat Armour, which is
nothing but false colours and base me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals:
Their Impostures, Contradictions,
Falshoods, Hypocrisies, and damnable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions
being beyond all Heraldry, not to
be trick'd within the compass of any Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:98370:112"/>
196. I will only add one Scene more
of this last Act, represented in the House
of Commons. I do not hear that the
House of Peers have had any part in it.
But the Commons, like the Consistory of
<hi>Rome,</hi> have spent much time since in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out the Premises, to infer the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
formerly agreed upon, a Declaration,
or rather rhetorical Invective, to perswade
mens Affections, not convince their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of those enormities in the King,
which should justly merit, and so justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the resolutions taken concerning him.
The particulars are such, as truly I cannot
name withont horror, <hi>Auferat oblivio si
potest, si non, silentium tegat:</hi> I would
forget that ever such a thing was done
by the Parliament. I will only say this
of that Faction (for I look upon it mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as their act and their Army's, who
have forc'd the House to it, as they have
to all the rest since the breaking out of
their Rebellion, the owning them, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, voting their continuance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling,
committing, impeaching their
own Members, the Lord Mayor and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
of the City of <hi>London,</hi> doing what
not for the encreasing their own shame,
and setting up their <hi>Diana,</hi> that Idol of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98370:112"/>
confusion) That if they themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that to be true which they there
relate, they are excellent good Patriots,
and notable Justices, to see and not see
faults for their own advantage. For if
the King would have agreed to such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
as they propos'd to him, and such
a Settlement as had been in order to their
Ends, to have continu'd an Omnipotency
in them and ruin'd the rest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
these things had been all dispens'd
with, sacrific'd to their greatness, and the
advancement of their <hi>Dagon;</hi> then nothing
but <hi>Hosannah</hi>'s in their mouths, no Peace
could be lasting without due consideration
of his Rights; far was it from them to
have a thought of imprisoning him; he
had been their good King, and they his
and our gracious Masters. But now that
his Majesty had discover'd their aims, and
would not contribute to them, he is an
<hi>Anathema,</hi> guilty of such and so many
crimes, as not to be found scarce in any
one person; and now these Men of <hi>Belial</hi>
can say he shall not reign over us. For
the things themselves, I doubt not but
there are those who knowing the <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
Imperii,</hi> will give satisfaction to the
world by a faithful and clear manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Majesty's Actions and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98370:113"/>
relating to them. I who stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and at distance, as I cannot have
the knowledg of such high things, so
will not presume to meddle with them,
only upon the general say, that methinks
in reason those things cannot be; for to
destroy the Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> whose
preservation must needs be as a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Soul of a Protestant King,
so a strength and advantage to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
were strange State-policy. And
as for the Rebellion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to cut
off so great a Limb from himself, pluck
off one of the three Flowers of his Crown,
is, methinks, to be <hi>Felo de se.</hi> To speak
nothing of that concerning King <hi>Iames,</hi>
an act so monstrous as not to be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Heathen, not to be found in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
<hi>Rome,</hi> much less in a Christian;
truly I cannot, as a rational Man, bring
my judgment to admit of a belief of
those things; and then certainly Charity
obliges to hope better, believe better of
any Man, much more of a King, and of
our own King, whom <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us
we are not to curse, no, not in thought,
much less, which <hi>Iob</hi> blames, tell him,
and tell the world he is wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
least of all when there is not a
clear an undeniable proof. And even
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98370:113"/>
their expressions in their Declaration are
not positive, as if the subject matter were
only <hi>allegatum,</hi> not at all <hi>probatum,</hi> and
rather set forth <hi>ad captandum populum,</hi> to
gain, if possible, an approbation of the
vulgar of what they had done, than that
they conceiv'd it would find credit with
rational and judicious Men, or that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
thought it to be a truth. For the
other things, as Knighthood, Ship-money,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> any thing by which the Subject has
been oppress'd and his Purse pick'd, they
of all Men should not find fault, whose
little Finger has been heavier than the
Loins of Monarchy. What was all that
in comparison of free Quarter, Excise,
and even the 100000 <hi>l.</hi> a Month, which
they say they must have for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Army? those were but
Flea-bitings to these. At the worst one
may say, we were then chastis'd with
Whips, but now with Scorpions.</p>
            <p>197. And so I hope I have made good
what I undertook in the beginning, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made it appear, that <hi>England</hi> is
become, by the actings of these Men,
that Monster whose shape is perverted,
the head standing where the feet, and
the feet where the head should be, mean
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98370:114"/>
Men mounted aloft, and all that is or
should be great, Lacqueying it after
them: The authority of the Magistrate
suppress'd, and the will of particular
persons made the Law of the Kingdom,
Justice obstructed, and Violence in the
room of it; King and Parliament trodden
under foot, and an Army insulting over
the Persons and Estates of the Subject;
so as we may take up the Psalmist's
Complaint, That the very Foundations
are destroy'd, and what then can the
Righteous do?</p>
            <p>198. I will conclude all with this
short Epiphonema: If such a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Treason as this, which they have
design'd and carry'd on all along, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of so many several parts, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
all the Trusts Men can be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of, as Subjects to their King, Servants
to their Masters, an Army to them that
rais'd and paid them, English Men to their
Country, and which is more, Christians
to their God, bound up yet in a more
particular obligation by Covenant, Vows,
and Protestations; all these Relations
thrown aside, nothing of Duty, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
or Morality to stand in the way,
that could either be remov'd or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98370:114"/>
eluded or broken through. If, I
say, a Treason rais'd up to this height, by
so many several steps of Hypocrisie, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
Perfidiousness, Injustice, Violence,
and Cruelty, can be made good, and the
Actors prosper, blessing themselves in
their success, sacrificing to their Nets
and Gins, by which they have snar'd
and destroy'd all their opposers: And
on the other side, if no blessing must be
on the good endeavours of those who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had propos'd to themselves <hi>Bonum pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum,</hi>
had nothing in particular in their
Eye, sought nothing for themselves,
but to find their safety compris'd and
contain'd in the happiness and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the King, Parliament, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
like the honest Passengers that seek
their preservation in saving the Ship they
sail in (as I can speak it for a truth,
take the God of Heaven for Witness,
and defie all the Men on Earth to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it) that I for my part (and I hope
the same of those other persons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Members of both Houses, with
whom I have cooperated, and now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in their sufferings) never had other
end: Let the Earl of <hi>Manchester</hi> speak,
who has been present at and privy to
all our Consultations, and is now join'd
and engag'd with the Army, and those
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98370:115"/>
other Men who carry on this pernicious
design, where, besides the universal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
of the whole Kingdom, there is
a particularity against me for my ruin
and destruction, and therefore I doubt
not but he will say all he knows: Let
Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> of the House of Commons,
who went a long time and a great way
with us, but is since fallen off and become
throughly theirs; the same I say of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Harvy,</hi> who was long enough in
our Ears, and in our Bosoms, to bottom
all our thoughts, know all our desires.
If these or any other, even that malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and treacherous Lord <hi>Savil,</hi> can say,
that at any time, upon any occasion, I
propos'd any thing that look'd towards
a self End, the driving of any particular
Interest, setting up of any Party, but
merely to prevent these fearful Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into which the Kingdom is fallen,
by the art and practices of these Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Peace, and to attain such a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
as all honest moderate Men
might have found in it both security and
satisfaction: If they can, let them speak;
and if they prove one tittle, I will put
my Mouth in the dust, I will bear my
punishment, and expect mercy neither
from God nor Man; nay, even in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Army, and those persons who
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98370:115"/>
have a long time sought my ruin, if all
I desir'd and aim'd at in disbanding that
schismatical factious Soldiery, in carrying
on the business of the House in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to that Party, and even in this last
great Treason of levying War against
King, Parliament, and Kingdom (as they
stile it) which was only to do my best
endeavour to defend them and my self
from a rebellious Army that was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up for all our destructions, contrary
to the Orders of both Houses, against
whom it first rebell'd instead of an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
disbanding; then cudgel'd them to
own it for their Army, forc'd the City
into a trouble, and shew of opposition to
what it had made the Parliament do;
then took that occasion to march both
against it and the Parliament. If not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all this, in what I did, I
had any thought of personal revenge, or
to do the least hurt to any particular
person in case we had prevail'd, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to return into the way whence we
were put out, of a free quiet Parliamentary
proceeding, to accomplish the great work
of settling the Peace both of Church and
State, let me perish; and God, who is
the searcher of hearts, knows I now
speak nothing but truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:98370:116"/>
199. Well then, I say, if all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
must, like an untimely birth,
come to nothing, our hope be cut off,
our persons destroy'd, our integrity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
fidelity, question'd and decry'd,
our good names traduc'd, torn in sunder,
our memories made to stink to all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
by the false calumnies of our
malicious Enemies, and their power in
suppressing truth, and which is worst
(for all this is but particular) the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
the publick, the Common wealth,
once in so fair a way of recovery, at the
eve of a happy day, to be rid of Armies,
enjoy a Peace, hear no more of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of War, but see a blessed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
of all unhappy differences, reap
the fruits of Justice and Mercy; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a sudden to find all this but as the
hungry man's Dream, who is the more
empty when he awakes, so instead of
this solid happiness to embrace a Cloud,
have nothing but the empty promises of
a false deceitful Army, and be cast back
into a greater gulf of misery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
than all the enemies in the World
could have brought it into, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end to be far worse than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:98370:116"/>
200. If this be our Portion, were I
a Heathen, I should say with <hi>Brutus</hi>
when he meant to kill himself, seeing
the assertors of publick Liberty over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and ruin'd, and the Invaders
prevail and conquer, <hi>O misera virtus!
eras igitur fabula, seu verba; ego te ut
rem colebam &amp; exercebam, tu autem fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae
serviebas.</hi> But being a Christian, I
am taught another Lesson, to know
that nothing comes by chance. God,
who dos all things in number, weight,
and measure, orders and disposes all as
may most make for his own Honour,
and the good of his Church and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to which even the wickedness of
the wicked, and these Disorders will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
tho the wit of Man cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
it: therefore I will lay my Hand
upon my Mouth, and not once whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
because the Lord has done it, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take up St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s admiration, and
with it end, crying out, <hi>O Altitudo! O the
Depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and
Knowledg of God! How unsearchable are his
Iudgments, and his Ways past finding out!</hi>
