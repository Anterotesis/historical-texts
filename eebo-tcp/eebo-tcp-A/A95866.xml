            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

On the Siege of Gloceſter, and Col. Maſſey.</head>
            <l>SO ſtands a Rock (rooted within the main)</l>
            <l>In ſpite of Tempeſts, whil'ſt the waves in vain</l>
            <l>In curled heaps, which on his boſome beat,</l>
            <l>Fall back in foame, and make a faint retreat:</l>
            <l>As <hi>Gloſter</hi> ſtood againſt the numerous powers</l>
            <l>Of the Beſiegers, who with Thunder-ſhowers</l>
            <l>Charg'd her old ribs, but vaniſht like a ſtorm</l>
            <l>With their own loſſe, and did no more perform</l>
            <l>Then Squibs caſt in the ayre, which throw about</l>
            <l>Some furious ſparks, and ſo in ſmoke go out:</l>
            <l>'Twas not her Trenches which their force withſtood,</l>
            <l>Nor River purpled with Malignant blood,</l>
            <l>Canon, nor Bulwarks rais'd with Martiall art,</l>
            <l>That did ſecure her, but great <hi>Maſſeys</hi> heart,</l>
            <l>That was the Fort, no Engyne could beat down,</l>
            <l>Nor Mine blow up, more ſtrong then was the Town,</l>
            <l>Impregnable as a Rock, they ſooner might</l>
            <l>Plunder the Fire of heat, the Sun of light,</l>
            <l>Then him of vertue; neither could reward</l>
            <l>Nor battery of Court-Honours break his Guard,</l>
            <l>Nor promiſes nor threats an entrance got,</l>
            <l>But did return as fruitleſſe as their ſhot;</l>
            <l>And when the fuell for Defence was waſted,</l>
            <l>Even to the laſt extremes his valour laſted.</l>
            <l>For formidable <hi>Eſſex,</hi> from a far</l>
            <l>Upon the Mountains (like a Blazing-ſtar)</l>
            <l>Appears to the Malignants, and portends</l>
            <l>Ruine and Death: but his diſtreſſed Friends</l>
            <l>With animating vigour he inſpires,</l>
            <l>And warns at diſtance by auſpitious fires,</l>
            <l>As when the Sun with his aſcent doth cleer</l>
            <l>The Winter Tempeſts, and recrute the yeer:</l>
            <l>'Tis ſaid, The Satyre fled from man agaſt,</l>
            <l>When he perceiv'd his breath with the ſame blaſt</l>
            <l>To cool and heat; had here that Satyre been,</l>
            <l>He might from flames the like effects have ſeen.</l>
            <l>Theſe courage got, and thoſe their courage loſt,</l>
            <l>And what to theſe gave heat, to thoſe was froſt;</l>
            <l>'Stead of Granadoes, Curſes now they dart,</l>
            <l>With vollies of God-dammees, and ſo part.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Gloſter</hi> is freed, her Being and her Name,</l>
            <l>Made Monuments (Brave <hi>Maſſey</hi>) to thy Fame;</l>
            <l>Her Temples and her Pyramids now turn</l>
            <l>Thy Trophies, which were like to be thy Urne,</l>
            <l>Whil'ſt we diſpute, which to aſcribe to thee,</l>
            <l>An active or a paſſive Victory;</l>
            <l>And are in doubt in which thou wer't moſt brave,</l>
            <l>When thou didſt thouſands kill, or thouſands ſave.</l>
