            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> Father of our Church elſewhere vpon another occaſion (though more rightly applya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this generation) ſaid, <hi>Qui ſemel modestiae limites tranſilijt, knauiter fit impudens.</hi> But the Prieſts and Ieſuites in this poynt of jmpudency ſurpaſſe, and one maine reaſon hereof, as I take it, is becauſe they hold the laye Papiſts, of whome they haue their maintenance, in ſuch a thraldome of jgnorant obedience, as that they dare not for feare of damnation read any booke whereby to enforme them in the truth, but only ſuch as their traiterous and ſeditious vn-ghoſtly leaders ſhall permit: And ſo if they can hold the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their maintainers, they will neuer bluſh at whatſoeuer themſelues ſay, or whatſoeuer bee ſaid of them by others.</p>
            <p>If any friend ſhall thinke that this my labour might well haue beene ſpared, becauſe the liues of the Martyrs, the proceedings againſt them, &amp; the times and cauſes of their ſufferings are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by <hi>Mr</hi>. <hi>Foxe</hi> in his large Booke thereof more fully expreſſed; or otherwiſe ſhould thinke that I do the Papiſts too great a grace, by placing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6647:15"/>
them in the ſame Booke with the true Martyrs of Chriſt; to him in friendly manner I thus replye, and firſt to the firſt. That though his allegation bee indeed true (for I willingly confeſſe that hee hath deſerued much for his extraordinary paines that wayes, and hath compaſſed ſo much and ſuch variety of matter therein, as that I cannot ſay whether were greater,<note place="margin">1610.</note> his labour or the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders profit) yet cannot euery mans purſe reach ſo great price as is that <note n="h" place="margin">The booke at large (wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in letters of gould) is this yeare newly and well prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Companie of Stationers in London.</note> Booke at large; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I haue not medled with any matter of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie contained therin, but only haue borrowed out of him the names of ſuch as were in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies burned, as I haue likewiſe out of their Martyrologiſt the names of their Prieſts, Ieſuites, and Recuſants, for vnleſſe I ſhould ſet downe their names, I could make no good compariſon of their numbers in oppoſition one to the other, which is the eſpeciall end whereat I aime.</p>
            <p>Secondly, although that twentie or thirtie yeares ſince many hundreds of Thouſands of perſons were liuing that could <hi>viva voce</hi> beare record how cruelly and vnmercifully the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſts truth were dealt withall in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> daies, and could alſo (if any ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Prieſt or Ieſuite had accuſed their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne of cruelty) haue thus replyed, <hi>Away vild harlots, belie her not, for Queene</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was a mercifull Queene, but mine eies haue ſeene the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of bloud ſhed in Queene</hi> Maries <hi>raigne onely for conſcience, wherwith ye were neuer glutted,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:6647:15"/>
but now theſe <hi>Viue-ſpeakers</hi> in Chriſts cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by time conſumed, it is more needfull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue by theſe neuer-dying memorials, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their ſufferings, eſpecially ſeeing the aduerſarie is ſo buſie by all meanes that the Pope, the Diuell, or hell it ſelfe can poſsibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to exalt their faction, and to bring a ſcandall both vpon our Soveraignes, vs, and them.</p>
            <p>And to the ſecond poynt; That it is a Grace vnto the Papiſts and Romaniſts to haue their Prieſts and Ieſuites ranked with the true Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, I anſwere thus: It is not the puniſhment, nor the place, but onely the cauſe that maketh a man famous for vertue, or for vice jnfamous, loued of God for his owne free graces, or hated of God and good men for their villanies.</p>
            <p>If the Iron barres whereon <hi>Catesbies</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> heads are fixed and nailed on the Parliament houſe, be a grace vnto them or any of their fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, becauſe they poſſeſſe the higheſt places of that Honourable houſe; ſuch grace haue all the kings enemies. If <hi>Garnets</hi> ſcaffold becauſe it was rayſed aloft for more publique view, were an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnto him or any of his Ieſuited ſociety, ſuch honour haue all that are, were, or hereafter ſhall be his partakers. If <hi>London</hi> bridge or Newgate grace that faction, becauſe their friends diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred limbes are ſo highly thereon aduanced; let Crowes and Rauens likewiſe deuour all them that deſerue the like grace for the like jnfidelity. Laſtly, if <hi>Iudas</hi> their fellow-traitor can any whit
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6647:16"/>
at all grace them becauſe he is noted in the booke of God, (but with this foule addition, Traitour) let them likewiſe take him and make him a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Company, or rather jncorporate themſelues into his Society, but let all that beare ill will to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Kings Majeſtie as a principall member thereof; let I ſay, their ends (oh God) be like vnto their maſter <hi>Iudas,</hi> and let their bowels breake in ſunder that would eat out the bowels of thy Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and let this blacke word of Traitour bee the jndelible ſpot, neuer to bee waſhed away, wherewith I brand all Engliſh Italionated Prieſts and Ieſuites, and their Abbettors, Adde to theſe alſo the <hi>Iacobine</hi> Fryer and <hi>Rauilack,</hi> the two mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of two French kings <hi>Henry</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Henry</hi> 4.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6647:16"/>
from any ſuch attempts, not needing to feare pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill either by ſtabbing, poyſoning, powder, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then let a toleration be graunted; but how ſound their concluſion is, <hi>France</hi> hath felt, <hi>England</hi> may feare, and all the world is amazed thereat.</p>
            <p>For if the King of <hi>France</hi> being a Papiſt, and at moſt but ſuſpected to affect the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, could not yet be ſecure in his perſon, how much leſſe can our King expect any aſſurance of ſaftie by a toleration, his Majeſty being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a profeſſed Proteſtant, and directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in Faith and Religion. Nay it might rather bee much feared, that it would bee a meanes to pull Gods juſt judgements vpon him and vs, for permiſsion of ſuch falſe worſhippe of the true God; for ſo wee may read in diuers places of the Old Teſtament, that when the Rulers of the people fell away from God, God ſent vpon them many plagues, miſeries, and oppreſsions by their enemies.

And here for a ſhutting vp of all, giue me leaue, (becauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts hold ſo much of the Popes authoritie againſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by him excommunicated,) to inſert <note n="d" place="margin">Beſides this Prieſtes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt themſelues, ſee alſo for thy better confirmation in this point, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of ſtate in their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall writings publiſhed by the Earle of Salisbury in his anſwere to certaine ſcandelous papers in the third page of C. and the Earle of Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in his ſpeech at Garnets Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignement, in the letter <hi>HH.</hi> in diuers pages thereof.</note> two queſtions with their anſweres, propounded by the right reuerend father in God the late Lord Biſhoppe of London, vnto Thomas Garnet, <hi>Aliàs</hi> Roockwood, <hi>Aliàs</hi> Sayer a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Prieſt, at the time of the ſaide Garnets arraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Seſſions-houſe without Newgate in London vpon Thurſday the 16. of Iune 1608.</p>
            <p>The firſt queſtion was this. <hi>Whether the ſaide Garnet had euer read any authors whatſoeuer, vntill ſome hundreds of yeares after Chriſts time, that did hold that the ende of Excommunication tended to a depriuation of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond queſtion was this. <hi>Whether if the ſaide Garnet himſelfe helde lands, which by lawfull and lineall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance had deſcended from his aunceſtors vnto him, it were lawfull for the Pope, Garnet being by him excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, to giue the lands vnto whom hee pleaſed?</hi> Garnets anſwere vnto the firſt was vncertaine, for ſaide hee, I remember not well what I haue reade concerning this point.</p>
            <p>But vnto the ſecond queſtion hee anſwered directly, Noe. Why then, mildely replied the Biſhoppe, <hi>what reaſon haue you Maiſter Garnet, to hold that the Pope hath more authoritie ouer the Kings Maieſtie, being your Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, then ouer you being but a priuate perſon, and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</hi>

Nor may I here neglect that offer which Pope Paulus the fourth made vnto Queene Elizabeth in the beginning of her Raigne, who when he perceiued that his vſurped authoritie and Primateſhip grew in England contemptible, condicional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that hee might hold that power here that vniuſtly hee had before done when this land was drowned in Poperie, would haue beene contented, and cauſed the Queenes Maieſtie to vnderſtand that hee would be pleaſed, <hi>that all matters for religion</hi> ſhould be adminiſtred in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that then they were, (being the very ſame then <hi>per omnia,</hi> that now it is) onely his Supremacie muſt bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, for that indeed, not Religion, not godlineſſe, not any thing but pride and ambition to be in the eyes of the world aboue all, both was and is the cauſe of his raging madneſſe.</p>
