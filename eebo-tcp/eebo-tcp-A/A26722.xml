            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BE pleased to take notice that this book, in
bigger Print, differs not greatly from my
smaller printed Psalm-book, but onely in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which thou may'st reconcile by observing
these rules.</p>
            <p>1. In the first place are bound up my own
<pb facs="tcp:102080:99"/>
composed Psalms, and in the little print, they
are commonly the second metres.</p>
            <p>2. In the second place are bound up all the
old Psalms, by me amended, and in the little
print they are commonly the first meter, but
whither so or no, they are referred unto, and
the title tels what metre they are.</p>
            <p>3. In the last place follow the Psalms com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by my self and others, and they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
of choicer tunes, <hi>viz.</hi> Ye children, &amp;c.
O Lord consider, &amp;c. and in the little print
are alwaies the first metre, as the title doth
also refer.</p>
            <p>4. The Collects must be alwaies looked for
after the meters.</p>
            <p>Note also that all the Psalms may be sung
in one of these 5 well known tunes. <hi>viz.</hi> the
119 the 67 the 100 the 113 the 148 but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such as the fift ps. I. m. and the 17. 2 Coll.
which go sweetly in a part of the 113. <hi>&amp;</hi> 148
as the first &amp; second metres of the 117 Ps. in
the smaller print do shew by musick notes,
Only remember, in those of my first impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in this book, to read two lines into one.
wherever you meet with but <hi>4</hi> syllables in a
line, as in the eight Psalm.</p>
            <p>Note also that the old Psalms done by me, are
<pb facs="tcp:102080:100"/>
printed in greater letter then the rest, &amp; those
for the present I specially commend for the
publick use, of which, those that are entire
Psalms, or entire parts, may be sung without
offence, while others keep to their old Mump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus;
Do you not know, that somewhere, the
Dutch, French, and English sing one and the
same Psalm in their severall languages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the measures and tunes differ not?</p>
            <p>Lastly, know that there are ready to be
added to these impressions, at least <hi>40</hi> more
of the old Psalms, (whereof the <hi>119</hi> is one)
and in the old tunes, and divers hymns are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
ready to be added, when it shall please God
to give the Authour incouragement by the
Houses allowance of them in publique.</p>
            <p>And here follows a taste of each, to incite
thee to desire them. Accept this staffe to make
up the 10 part of the 119 Psal. &amp; doubt not
but all the rest shall be done as well.</p>
