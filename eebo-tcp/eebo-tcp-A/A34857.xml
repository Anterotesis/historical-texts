         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore you come to the Authors own Epiſtle, and Narration, I
ſhall mention ſome remarkable paſſages, which I had from his
own mouth, and finde them not mentioned in his writing;
and I can aſſure thee this Relation is no feigned ſtory, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but thou haſt it preſented to thy view, as I received it from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himſelfe, with all the Verſes of his own compoſing.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Roger Crab</hi> is well known to many in this City and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
and while this Booke was printing, he ſtayed purpoſely here in the
City till it was publiſhed, and I think is in Towne ſtill; he lodged at the
Golden Anchor in white Croſſe Street, at one Mr. <hi>Carters</hi> houſe a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
where divers people reſorted to ſee him, where ſuch as doubt of it
may be ſatisfied. I am informed by himſelfe and others, how that
three years ſince: Hee was a Haberdaſher of Hats, and kept a Shop at
<hi>Cheſham,</hi> in <hi>Buckingamſhire;</hi> and hath ſince given over his Trade,
and ſold his Eſtate, and given it to the poore, reſerving a ſmall matter
to himſelfe, being a ſingle man, and now liveth at <hi>Icknam,</hi> neare
<hi>Uxbridge,</hi> one a ſmall Roode of ground, for which he payeth fifty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
a year and hath a mean Cottage of hiis own building to it; but that
which is moſt ſtrange and moſt to be admired, is his ſtrange reſerved, and
Hermeticall kinde of life, in refuſing to eat any ſort of fleſh, and ſaith it
is a ſinne againſt his body and ſoul to eat fleſh, or to drinke any Beer, Ale,
or Wine; his dyet is onely ſuch poore homely foode as his own Rood of
ground beareth, as Corne, Bread, and bran, Hearbs, Roots, Dock-leaves,
Mallowes, and graſſe, his drink is water, his aparrell is as meane alſo,
he weares a ſackcloth frock, and no band on his neck: and this he ſaith
is out of conſcience, and in obedience to that command of Chriſt, to the
young man in the Goſpell, and in imitation of the Prophets, and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabites</hi>
in <hi>Jer.</hi> 35. who neither planted vinyards, nor builded houſes,
nor drank wine, and were highly commended by the Lord for it: I reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the caſe with him, &amp; told him that I conceived Chriſts meaning when
he bad the young man ſell all he had and give to the poore, was, that he
ſhould part with all his deareſt Sinnes, that were as dear to him as his
poſſeſſions, or elſe to try him for his coveteouſneſſe; he anſwered, how
can a man give that money to the poor which he ſelleth his ſinnes for: I
<pb facs="tcp:42017:3"/>
perceive he is well read in the Scriptures, he hath argued ſtrongly with
ſeverall Miniſters in the Country, about this and other ſtraing opinions
which he holds; but I will not be ſo tedious to the reader as to mention
them all; he approves of civill Magiſtracy, and is neither for the <hi>Leve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
nor <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor <hi>Shakers,</hi> nor <hi>Ranters,</hi> but above Ordinances.
He was ſeven years in the Warres for the Parliament; he is the more to
be admired that he is alone in this opinion of eating, which though it be
an error, it is an harmeleſſe error. I have heard ſince this was in the
Preſſe that Cap. <hi>Norwood</hi> was acquainted with <hi>Roger Crab,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enclining to his opinion, began to follow the ſame poore diet till it coſt
him his life; <hi>Felix quam facit alienem pericula cautem.</hi> In the
Primitive times we read of ſuch perſons that were weake, who did eate
hearbs, and made a great ſcruple of eating fleſh; but the Apoſtle ſaith,
That every creature of God is good, if it be received with thankefulneſſe,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 4. And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. ſaith he, <hi>If meat make my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to offend, I will eate none while the world ſtands.</hi> And iin
Rom. 4. 2, 3, 4. <hi>One believeth that he may eate all things, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
who is weake eateth hearbs, let not him that eateth deſpiſe
him that eateth not,</hi> &amp;c. The reaſon why this man betooke himſelfe
to this Hermites reſerved life, he ſaith was, that he might be more free
from ſinne, as luſt, pride; and becauſe of the many lyes, ſwearing, and
deceiving that is too too frequently uſed by moſt Shop-keepers &amp; Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as the Prophet complains in <hi>Hoſ. 4. 1, 2, 3. For the Lord hath
a controverſie with the inhabitants of the Land, becauſe there is
no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God, but by ſwearing,
and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and whoring, they breake
out, and blood toucheth blood; therefore ſhall the land mourn,</hi>
&amp;c. But however, we may ſee how apt men are to erre, both on the right
hand and on the left, and to run into extreams, yet of the two extreams
this is the better, and more tolerable which this Engliſh Hermite hath
choſen, rather then that of our Engliſh Anticks, and Prodigalls, who
give themſelves over to run into all exceſſe of ryot and uncleanneſſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
all ſorts of wickedneſſe with greedineſſe; Some given up to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,
others to whoredome, and a third ſort to gluttony, as of late
dayes it was reported of one <hi>Wood,</hi> called the great Eater of <hi>Kent,</hi> who
could eate a whole ſheep at a meale, beſides other victualls; Alſo Mr.
<hi>Marriot,</hi> the great Eater of Grays Inne, was ſuch another glutton. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi>
reports of one <hi>Domitius,</hi> who receiving more meate at ſupper
then his ſtomacke could diſgeſt, or his belly containe, dyed ſuddenly ſitting
<pb facs="tcp:42017:3"/>
at the Table: and Doctor <hi>Taylor,</hi> that famous Preacher of <hi>Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
in his Booke of the Theatre of Gods judgments, makes mention of
<hi>Maximinus</hi> the Emperour, who was given to ſuch exceſſe and gluttony,
that every day for his allowance he had forty pound of fleſh and bread an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable,
and five gallons of wine for his drinke, which he conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
beſides fallets and made diſhess.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Emperour <hi>Boneſus</hi> would drinke healths, and eate exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
both theſe came to miſerable ends, this Emperour was hanged, and
the former cut in pieces by his Souldiers, ſee more at large in the ſecond
part of that booke, page 102. I will adde but one more Relation
hee mentions, which had I not ſo good an Author for, I ſhould not
give credit to it: A rich Citizens ſonne having left him by his Father
thirty thouſand pounds in ready money beſides Jewels, Plate, and Houſes
richly furniſhed, was ſo prodigall as to conſume all his whole eſtate in
three yeares, and hee had a great longing to pleaſe all his five Sences at
once, and did accompliſh it, allowing to each Sence a ſeverall hundred
pound, it would be too tedious to mention all the ſtory; hee grew at laſt to
all debauchedneſſe that could be named, and was forced ſhamefully to beg
of his acquaintance, and was after preſt for a common Souldier, ſee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
laſt of that Booke above mentioned. I ſhall no longer detaine the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the Hermits relation; theſe things I thought would be moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to impart to thee, hoping thou wilt make this good uſe of it, by
avoyding theſe two Extreams, and walking in the golden meane of rtue
godlineſſe, which hath the promiſe of this life, and of that which is to
come. <hi>Vale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One more remarkable thing hee told me: That when hee was in Clarken-well Priſon,
the 17. of this January, 1654. His Keeper having a prejudice againſt him, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Priſoners not to let him have bread with his water, and ſhut him downe in the
hole all night. The next morning, being ſomething hungry, walking in the Priſonyard,
there came a Spannell and walked after him three or foure turnes, with a peece of bread
in his mouth: He looked upon him, and wondered why the Dog walked (as he thought)
with a Chip in his mouth: He looked at the Dogge, and he layd it downe: and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it was bread, he walked away againe, and the Dog walked after him with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
then he ſtooped, and the Dog layd it downe to his hand, then he tooke and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
it, and eate it.</p>

hearbs, we had not been corrupted. Thus we ſee that by eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
we are ſwallowed up in corruption; for ever ſince <hi>Noah</hi> came
out of the Arke, the world being drowned, and no fruits nor hearbs-on
the earth, man was ordered to eate the fleſh of the Creature which came
out of the Arke, ſo that by that meanes our deſires were made ſtrong after
fleſh; That when the hearbs &amp; innocent food was come forth, we ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, calling it traſh in compariſon of a Beaſt, or beaſtly fleſh; ſo that by
that meanes the fleſh-deſtroying Spirits and Angels draweth neer us, and
frequently attendeth man kind. This you may ſee by the Angels that
came to <hi>Abraham</hi> to deſtroy the fleſh of the Sodomites: <hi>Abraham</hi>
knowing their deſigne, killed them a Calfe, and made them a fleſhly feaſt,
ſo that we may ſee God hath all ſorts of creatures for all ſorts of deſignes,
and for all ſorts of food both in heaven and in earth; Innocent creatures
for innocent food, and beaſtly creatures for beaſtly and fleſhly food.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing I am become a gazing ſtock to the
Nation, &amp; a wonderment to many friends
in this my reſerved life, I ſhall therefore
indite a few lines as the moſt high ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
me, wherein I ſhall give an account of
this my undoing, owning Chriſt and the
Prophets to be exemplary both in prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying
and practiſing, as farre as God ſhall give power to any
man; I having truly examined it, and often diſputed it with
all Sexes and Miniſters in moſt Counties in <hi>England,</hi> and moſt
of them grants me that the practice of Chriſt and the Prophets
is written for our Learning: and if this be granted, that wee
ought to be imitators of their righteouſneſſe, hereby the
judgment of God may be ſeen to a <hi>Sodomite</hi> generation, living
now upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground; but firſt I ſhall begin with my ſelf,
who have tranſgreſſed the commands of God, and ſo found
guilty of the whole Law, living in pride, drunkenneſſe, and
gluttony, which I upheld by diſſembling and lying, cheating
and cozening my Neighbors: But now <hi>that light which enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
every man that cometh into the world,</hi> according to <hi>Johns</hi>
writing, <hi>hath diſcovered the love of God to my underſtanding,</hi> which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42017:5"/>
cauſeth me to with-draw from what I have done; and inſtead
of ſtrong drinks and wines, I give the old man a cup of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and inſtead of roſt Mutton, and Rabbets, and other dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
diſhes, I gave him broth thickned with bran, and pudding
made with bran, &amp; Turnep leaves chop't together, and graſs;
at which the Old man (meaning my body) being moved,
would know what he had done, that I uſed him ſo hardly;
then I ſhewed him his tranſgreſſion as aforeſaid: ſo the warrs
began, <hi>The law of the old man in my fleſhly members rebelled againſt
the law of my mind,</hi> and had a ſhrewd skirmiſh; but the mind
being well enlightned, held it, ſo that the old man grew ſick
and weak with the fluxe, like to fall to the duſt; but the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
love of God well pleaſed with the Battle, raiſed him
up againe, and filled him full of love, peace, and content in
mind, and is now become more humble; for now he will eate
Dock-leaves, Mallows, or Graſſe, and yeelds that he ought
to give God more thanks for it, then formerly for roaſt fleſh
and wines; and certainly concludes that this muſt be of God,
if it be done out of love, and not out of ſelfe-ends; for before
the old man fought with his ſteel ſword, with his fleſhly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
againſt old men, and that envy in him begat envy in them,
and both of the Devill, in pretence of liberty and peace, it is
eaſily judged of by the event; for our fighting to regulate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the Old men, we ſee it ſtill as bad, if not worſe
then it was before: Therefore let us put off the old man with
his fleſhly Laws, which reached no farther then the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of earthly bodies, ſo that every one for their obedience
to God in this fleſhly Law, receiveth a reward to uphold his
fleſhly body here upon Earth, and would go no further then
reaſon could reach in the organs of fleſh: Therefore this Law
could never give life in the ſpirituall Chriſt, but the practifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
thereof were the greateſt enemies to Chriſt, as you ſhall
ſee fully in their calling of Chriſt Devill, and putting of him
to death, <hi>Mat. 10. Luke</hi> 23. Far worſe then bloody Butchers,
for they deſtroy their fellow creatures for gaine, and to feed
their bodies; but theſe deſtroyed that innocent Lamb of God,
meerly out of devilliſh zeale and envy againſt innocency; this
moves the Butcher to the queſtion to know why I would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
eating of fleſh: To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:42017:5"/>
Firſt, I do it exemplary from the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 1.
which ſaith, <hi>The Kings meate defileth his body, and beſeecheth
that he might eate pulſe, and drinke water.</hi> This firſt we ought to
believe, becauſe the Scripture ſaith ſo. 2. I believe it from
experience. 3. From reaſon.</p>
            <p>1. I have experience that God hath enlightned my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in a great meaſure more then before I tooke this
courſe: So that all the Tithe-mongers and ſelfe-ended people
profeſſing Religion, are afraid to meet me in any publique
diſpute; but leſt I ſhould judg my ſelfe wiſer in my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
then my underſtanding will beare me out, I am here rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be tryed by any perſon or perſons whatſoever, and ſo
much for Experience: Now I ſhall ſhew ſome reaſons.</p>
            <p>My firſt Reaſon is, That God never accepted of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for a Sacrifice of fleſh, that would deſtroy a body of fleſh
to feed on; and alſo forbid his people the Jewes to feed on
them; for it is a practice of Dogs and Wolves, Bears and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Hogs and Ravens, Kites and Hawks, and many ſuch like
devourers of fleſh; and all or any of theſe have no need to fear
their lives, but from, or of ſome of that ſame kind; no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
creature need never feare his life from an innocent
creature: If all birds would take the Dove for an example,
and all beaſts take the Lamb for their example, and all men
take Chriſt for their example, then <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> the two
chiefe Devills would be trampled under feet. Such a time is
promiſed, but not yet; but God waiteth with long patience
upon the veſſels of wrath, whilſt they prepare themſelves by
thirſting after fleſh and blood, which are thereby made fit to
deſtroy each other: Therefore hearken to the Doctrine of
Chriſt, in <hi>Matth. Chap. 5. 6. Deny your ſelves, humble your ſelves,
undo your ſelves of all righteouſneſs of the fleſh. Become as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
like Lambs, like Doves, then Chriſt is ours, and we are his:
Few words to the wiſe is ſufficient.</hi> I ſhall return to the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of the Law in this Nation, which excludes Butchers
from being Jury-men of life and death: Surely if they are
judged uncapable of being of a Jury, becauſe they kill the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they that buy it with their money to devour it, cannot
be clear, for we alwayes count the Receiver more ſubtil and
worſe then the Thiefe; ſo that the buyer is worſe then the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42017:6"/>
Butcher; but <hi>Mars</hi> being the god of War, is the governour of
theſe deſtroyers: and while he can get fleſh to feed on, he will
encreaſe his deſires to deſtroy fleſh: ſo that <hi>Mars</hi> being ſervant
to the moſt high God, breeds them up with fleſh, untill they
are full of corruption. Then he raiſeth up Trangreſſor againſt
Tranſgreſſor to deſtroy each other, as you have it in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.
2. where it ſaith, <hi>Agrievous viſion was ſhewed unto me, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor
againſt the tranſgreſſor, and the deſtroyer againſt the deſtroyer.
Goe up Flam, beſiege Media,</hi> &amp;c. Had my parents been ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
as to have taught me this Doctrine in the time of my
youth, I had ſaved my skull from being cloven to the braine
in the late War for the Parliament againſt the King, and alſo
ſaved my ſelfe from the Parliaments two years impriſonment
which they gave me for my paines, and from my ſentence to
death in the Field by my Lord Protector; but all thoſe things
wrought together for the beſt to me, and in my eſtimation
are of more value then an office of five hundred pounds a year,
for I in ſome meaſure know my ſelfe, and before I neither
knew God nor Devill, nor my ſelfe: but now having found
out that my body was governed by the inclination of my
Conſtitution from the ſtarry heavens, having tryed it with
many ſorts of food, and with much faſting and praying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scripure, which gave me light to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
of others, and enabled me to adminiſter phyſick to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
ſo that I have had a hundred or ſixe-ſcore Patients at
once, this gave me a great light of the evil that came by eating
of fleſh: If my Patients were any of them wounded or feaveriſh,
I ſayd, eating fleſh, or drinking ſtrong beere would inflame
their blood, venom their wounds, and encreaſe their diſeaſe,
ſo there is no proof like experience: So that eating of fleſh is
an abſolute enemy to pure nature; pure nature being the
workmanſhip of a pure God, and corrupt nature under the
cuſtody of the Devill: Now for the objection in 1 <hi>Tim. 4. v.</hi>
3. where it ſaith thus; <hi>Forbidding to marry, and commanding to
abſtain from meates which God hath created, to be received with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thanks of them which believe and know the truth:</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.
it ſaith; <hi>For every creature of God is good, and nothing ought to be
refuſed if it be received with thankeſgiving.</hi> This Scripture being
very uſefull for the purpoſe, and will give much light to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42017:6"/>
adhearers to this opinion, and conform them of ſound prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
within themſelves; for whoſoever ſhall forbeare mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
or abſtain from meate, from the commandement of
men which pretends his commands to be of God, all that
are obedient hereunto will ſerve the Devill, and muſt needs
be without the ſpirit of ſanctification; neither are they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
neither obey the Truth; ſo that if they ſhould eate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
creature, there would a hundred be poyſoned at a meale
for want of the ſpirit of power and ſanctification which <hi>Paul</hi>
and others had by the promiſe, which promiſed them, if they
drank any deadly poyſon, it ſhould not hurt them, and could
take away Serpents: <hi>and if they layd their hands on the ſicke, they
ſhould recover,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Mar. 16. verſ.</hi> 18. Another
Objection is alledged from that Scripture in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 11.
where he ſaith theſe words: <hi>That which goeth into the mouth defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not the man, but that which cometh out of the mouth, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth
the man, which is murthers, adulteries, fornications, thefts,
falſe teſtimonies, ſlanders,</hi> &amp;c. If this be meant that any thing
put into the mouth cannot defile the body, then no man can
can be poyſoned: but there hath been many a man poyſoned
by taking things into the mouth: If ſo, then nothing ought
to be taken but that which is nouriſhable to pure nature, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they have faith and power of ſanctification to exclude
the venom: ſo in ſhort, my judgment is of every place of
Scripture which ſpeaks any thing of this nature, that to him
that believeth all things are lawfull, as in relation to Chriſt
in the Spirit, but ſome things not expedient. Now to thoſe
that will not unlick themſelves from the world, as to <hi>deny
father and mother, wife, children, lands and livings, and all for
Chriſts ſake</hi> in the Spirituall eſſence, but will rather ſerve him
according to the fleſh in the ten Commandements. Now this
is the wonderfull and admirable love of God, that hee will
give them a reward alſo according to that diſpenſation they
are under; for he hath promiſed them a bleſſing in basket, and
in ſtore, their children long life in the Land for their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their Parents in the fleſh: but no more then fleſhly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
can be given for fleſhly obedience; for hee that dyeth
with fleſhly deſires, fleſhly inclinations, and fleſhly ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;this
being a compoſure of the ſpirits of darkneſſe in this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42017:7"/>
body, muſt riſe agaiin in the ſame nature, and muſt be taken
into the centre of <hi>Mars,</hi> the god of fleſh, blood, and fire, ſo
that every man ſhall receive the things which are done in his
body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or
evill, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <p>Then how happy are they that takes Chriſt and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
for their example: Chriſt being an innocent pattern to
the whole world, expoſed himſelf to all danger and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not for his owne ends in the fleſh, but for others ſakes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them that perſecuted him and violated him with terms of
ignomie, calling him a Glutton, and a wine-bibber, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer,
and a Devill, and at length killed him out-right,
and hanged him ſhamefully upon the Croſſe; the perſons that
did it were the Prieſts, Councellors, Lawyers, and the rude
multitude inſtructed by them, filled all with envy againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
<hi>but all this worketh together for the beſt to them that fear
God,</hi> in humbleneſſe and meekneſſe, together with love and
charity, where envy cannot be; but ſome glimps of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
light which diſcerneth all things, <hi>even the deep things of
God,</hi> according to the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10. But reaſon it
will diſcover a glimps of Gods proceedings in theſe our
dayes; he hath tryed almoſt every ſort of men, and every ſort
of ſects according to their Pedgree in our Land.</p>
            <p>1. The King and Biſhops were exalted next to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. The Parliament who found fault with them, not pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the beame of Covetouſneſſe out of their owne eyes, and
their Sects depending, were all exalted in ſtead of the other.</p>
            <p>3. The Army with their Trades and Sects depending upon
the ſame account, became exalted; So the Gentlemen and
Farmers have had their turn in Offices and dearth of Corn,
and now they will try inferiour Trades, as Journey-men and
Day-labourers, and their aſſociates depending, even to the
Orphan and Almſ-man, and now giveth them the fulneſſe of
bread, and cloathing, and ſilver, and all according to their
reſpective place and capability they are in: So that now we
look over all their proceedings, and judg by their fruite, and
it will be a hard matter for a low capacity to judge which of
all theſe parties hath been moſt juſt: but I being of the loweſt
ſort, and unlearned, being amongſt day-labourers and jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neymen,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42017:7"/>
have judged my ſelfe with them the worſt of all
theſe parties, in pride, gluttony, drunkeneſſe, lying, deſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
ſwearing, curſing, covetouſneſſe, diſobedient to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
breeding up children to diſobedience, and all other ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations:
Were not the moſt High wonderfull and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
to us, one of theſe ſinnes are enough to bring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and terrors upon the whole Land, namely the ſinne of
drunkenneſſe, being explained, will prove it; when the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeing
eye looks into every Ale-houſe of this Nation, and
ſeeth of which ſort are moſt there, and they will appear to be
labouring poor men, which in times of ſcarcity pine and
murmure for want of bread, curſing the rich behinde his
back; and before his face, cap and knee, and a whining coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
and ſome are cholerick, and diſcontented, and will
not ſpeak at all, neither of them conſidering what they did
in the time of plenty, when they drank in one day as much
as a buſhell of barly will make, which will keep two ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
families a whole week in bread; this two men will doe
twice or three times a week; and when Sunday cometh, they
will hear two ſermons, and have their child chriſtened by the
vertue of his faith, and receive the Sacrament at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and
then all is well; his conſcience being feared up, he returns
to his companions, and falls on as before, to drunkeneſſe,
and gluttony, ſpoiling, backbiting his neighbours, ſwearing
and curſing, and reviling againſt the Higher powers for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
him; making a good conſtruction of his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drunkard
which is drunk three or four dayes in the weak;
they will ſay he is an honeſt fellow, and no bodies foe but
his own, although both he and they what ſo do are the greateſt
oppreſſors under the Sunne, and the greateſt enemies to the
poor fatherleſſe orphans, widdows, and ſtrangers, which are
below them; for by their drunkenneſſe and gluttony Corn is
made dear; and Corne being dear, Land is made dear, ſo that
the Farmer muſt give a great rent for his Farme, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to hire many more Acres. By this means cattle and
Corne hath been at a high rate, the Farmer being coveteous
minded to uphold his wife and children in pompe and pride,
feaſting and glu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tony at Chriſtnings and Banquettings, by
which means ſurfets and diſeaſes drives them to the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42017:8"/>
who wait for their prey, to get their money to purchaſe
Lands and houſes, that they may let it out to them againe;
Thus you ſee that the body of <hi>England</hi> is become a Monſter:
God hath created eyes in us that are the feet, to diſcover her
nakedneſſe as far as the middle; we have a little light of her
armes, and her head, which keeps her pomp by ſword and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence;
but our ſight being weake, and moſt work to do at
home, and moſt convenient for every man to pull the beame
out of his own eye, according to the Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 3.
that we may ſee clearer, <hi>and juſtly judge the tree by his fruits,</hi> we
ſhall try the inferiour and lower ſort of feaſting among wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
called by the name of Chriſtnings, which are theſe. Firſt,
to exchange upon ſome body that is ſilly, or fooliſh, ſlut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,
or covetous, or an ill Husband, or a Drunkard: Others
be condemned for often feaſting, and wearing fine cloaths,
ſwearing and lying, ſo that all ſorts are laughed at, and
judged; but our ſelves, whilſt wee our ſelves are doing the
very ſame things, and this is the fruit that grows upon the
Tree called Chriſtning, or baptizing the Child into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
faith; which is an admirable Tree, if it be true, that the
child can be in Chriſt by the Fathers faith, and no falling
from Grace; then let us conſider whether <hi>Adam</hi> did believe in
Chriſt: and if it be found he did, then this baptiſme would
have ſaved all the people from <hi>Adam</hi> to this day, and will do
from this day forward; for the Child being baptized into the
Fathers faith, groweth up, and begetteth children, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fall away, baptizing children into their faith, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
So that if God had been as wiſe as we in our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
he might have ſaved the lives of all his Peophets, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and people too, but the moſt High is now once more
beginning to break through the clouds of darkneſſe in poor
innocent forms of earth, rayſing them up from carpenting
fiſhing, and Tent-making, <hi>to confound the high and mighty, for
the wiſdome of man is fooliſhneſſe,</hi> 1 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chap. 1. Now let us
compare this inferiour feaſt called Chriſtning with the feaſt of
Chriſt among the multitude, and ſee which was beſt exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the people, and which produced moſt good to ſoul and
body; and conſider the example of Chriſts birth in a Manger,
with the pomp and pride of childrens births in our dayes:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42017:8"/>
Again, conſider what feaſt there was when Chriſt was baptized
of <hi>John,</hi> &amp; I think we ſhall find none at all. Then let us ſee what
Chriſt had at his feaſt with the people, he being able to <hi>command
ſtones to be bread,</hi> or <hi>water to be wine,</hi> was alſo able to command
roſt Beef or pig: but he was to be exemplary to all people on
earth, in all his actions and doctrine, made an innocent feaſt for
the people with barly loaves and fiſhes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. But ſome will
object and ſay, he was able to work miracles, and we are not;
To which I anſwer; If we as he, were able to command all
things, and yet would have nothing at our feaſt but barly loaves
and fiſhes, what advantage would our power be to this Feaſt? the
Feaſt being innocent, without hurting any creature that breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on earth; but on the contrary, he endeavoured to preſerve,
and to reconcile the people to God with ſound words of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
uttered with love, peace, and meekneſſe, with motions of
healing all people that were brought to him: So that you may
ſee a great difference betwixt his feaſt and the other. Again, he
often went to the Feaſt of the Jews, and to a wedding to ſhew
forth the power of his father, in turning water into wine; but
we never finde that ever he was drunke, or eate bit of fleſh at any
of their Feaſts, or Wedding: The Paſſeover was his owne Feaſt,
and did belong to the fulfilling of the law of the Father in his
fleſh, even for a diſobedient people, which the Lord by <hi>Moſes</hi>
brought out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> from their fleſh-pots, into the wilderneſs,
to purifie their bodies with Angels food called <hi>Manna,</hi> which
they ground in mills, or beat in morters, to make in Cakes: But
they looſing their groſneſs, grew leane and hungry, and <hi>murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and rebelled againſt the Lord, luſting after the fleſh-pots of Aegypt:</hi>
Their deſires being much and ſtrong, the Lord granted them
fleſh, even as he granted them a King, and his wrath and plague
came with it, as you may ſee in <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 33. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 31.
<hi>While the fleſh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, even
then the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt the people, and the Lord
ſmote the people with an exceeding great plague.</hi> Thus you ſee what
miſerable creatures we are, being bred up with fleſh and blood, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyons
and garlick, all under <hi>Mars,</hi> who God hath made governor
over that humor that luſteth after fleſh and blood, which is made
ſtrong in us by feeding of it, as I my ſelfe may ſpeak by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
for if God had commanded mee to forbeare fleſh before I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42017:9"/>
had knowledg of this my diſcourſe, although he had ſent an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
or a man working miracles, I doubt I ſhould have judged all
to be of the Devill, for the luſt I had after the ſweetneſſe of fleſh;
even as the rich men in theſe our dayes will deny the Scripture,
wherein Chriſt commanded the rich man in the Goſpel, <hi>to ſell his
goods and give to the poor:</hi> But they will ſay, it reached no farther,
then that one rich man ſhould; for ſay they, if we ſhould believe
this Scripture to extend to us, we ſhould make the poor richer
then our ſelves: So it ſeems by this, that they had rather deny
this Scripture, and many more that ſpeak to this purpoſe, even
Chriſt and all, rather then to part from their riches; this would
have been my condition in ignorance:</p>
            <p>Therefore let not the rich men miſtake me, and think that I
would have them ſell their goods, before God hath enlightned
their underſtandings, &amp; let them ſee the danger of keeping it, for
then they would play the Hypocrites, and doe as bad to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as if they had kept it, although good to others; this
would be the condition of every one that ſhall forbear fleſh, or
beere, as in relation to God, becauſe it is a ſinne againſt the body,
or bodies and ſoules of men: <hi>Except any man thinks he ſinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God in eating, to him it is ſinne, becauſe he is weake, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:</hi>
So he ought to forbear, becauſe of his ſcruple; as you
ſhall ſee in <hi>Rom. 14. 8. 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 10. For if any man ſee thee
which hath knowledge fit at table in the Idols Temple, ſhall
not the conſcience of him which is weak be boldned to eat thoſe
things which are ſacrificed to Idolls? you may obſerve from
this, that he that walketh by another mans light before he is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced in himſelfe, if he buildeth on ſand, he will fall in
the Tempeſt, becauſe he hath loſt his tender light of his ſcruple,
which <hi>Paul</hi> endevored to ſtrengthen in every one of his brethren,
let them be of what opinion they would in matter of conſcience:
Its very plaine in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and very few in theſe dayes beleeveth
it; for we all cry out againſt many opinions, yet every one
would have his owne opinion juſtified; we may as well cry out
and condemn every one his Neighbour, becauſe they differ in
phyſiognomy, and ſo condemn the work of God without us, as
well as within us, but this is rebellion againſt our Maker; for the
Scripture commandeth us not to judge one another in matter of
conſcience towards God, but for the ſinne againſt our brethren
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42017:9"/>
and neighbours; we ought to know the Tree by his fruits. So
that any man or men in Countreys, Towns, or Cities, that ſhall
defraud his brethren, and ſhall advance themſelves in pride by
oppreſſion and tyranny, imitating <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in all
manner of abhominations; if any ſee this imitated in <hi>England,</hi>
it's high time for we, or they that ſo ſee, to become imitators
of Chriſt and the Prophets; firſt in order of the Prophets that
came before Chriſt, who were ordered by their practice to ſhew
<hi>Iſrael</hi> their tranſgreſſions, in drinking water by meaſure, and in
making bread; for <hi>Ezekiel</hi> took of wheat, barly, and beans, and
lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in a veſſel, and
made bread thereof; and inſteed of butter and ſpice, he was to
take cows dung, inſteed of mens dung, to prepare his bread with,
and he was to have his portion by weight, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. 9. Thus the
Prophet was to ſhew them their error in matter of food; and
for clothing, you may ſee in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20. Who was a Prophet of
God, ordered not onely to weare ſack-cloth, but to go naked,
and without ſhoes three years: If theſe Scriptures are written
for our learning, imitation, and practice, then we are to judge
which are the Prophets of God, by this practice in Scripture;
and if ſo, where ſhall we finde Prophets of God: But ſome will
ſay, we are to follow Chriſt and the Apoſtles in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and if you will have it ſo, then we muſt exactly ſee what
orders they had in their Commiſſion, that we may know them
from hirelings: We finde in the Commiſſion, that they were to
go and preach without mony, or ſcrips, or ſhoes on their feet,
but to bee ſhod with ſandalls, <hi>Marke</hi> 6. 8. So we may doubt
whether we ſhall finde any Apoſtles too, if we ſhall judge by
Chriſts Commiſſion; but if you will not own theſe Scriptures,
neither let us try them that mark out the falſe Apoſtles and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
namely <hi>John</hi> 10. where he ſaith, <hi>the hireling is not his Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd:</hi>
and <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. where he ſaith, <hi>ye ſhall know them by their fruits,
inwardly they are ravening wolves.</hi> Many more Scriptures to this
purpoſe there are; but if you have a minde to your hirelings ſtill,
you will belive no Scripture that is againſt him, neither is there
any for him; ſo that all the true practicall part of Scriptures
muſt bee layd aſide, onely talk of it and diſpute of it a little, and
pick out of it a few places to preach out off, and to write, to get
ſome mony to uphold their pride and honour in this world, to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42017:10"/>
pleaſe the old man in the fleſh: Surely if <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſhould
come forth againe, and call himſelf <hi>Leveller,</hi> and take ſuch food
as the wilderneſſe yeelded, and ſuch cloathing, and Preach up
his former Doctrine, <hi>He that had two coats ſhould give away one of
them, and he that hath food ſhould doe likewiſe;</hi> How ſcornfully
would our proud Gentlemen and Gallants look of him, that
hath gotten three or four Coats with great gold and ſilver but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
and halfe a ſcore dainty diſhes at his Table, beſides his
gallant houſe, and his furniture therein; therefore this Scripture
muſt be interpreted ſome other way, or elſe denied: and this is
our condition, if the Scripture will not ſerve for our own ends
to fulfill ſelfeiſh deſires, to uphold the old man in his fleſhly
honour, which belongeth to the Magiſtrate onely, who God
hath made a Miniſter for thy wealths ſake, and doth not at all
belong to innocency nor Chriſt in the Spirit; for there is ſmall
ſigne of the olde mans dying or putting off, whilſt he ſmites his
fellows for the liberty of his fleſhly deſires; and this is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that loveth the world, in whom the love of God cannot
be, 1 <hi>John 2. 15, 16. Love not the world, neither the things of the
world: If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him;
for all that is in the world, as the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and
the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world:</hi> Theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have I endeavored formerly to interpret ſome other way,
by abſurdities and conſequences; how that if we ſhould not
weare ſuperfluous things, thouſands of people would ſtarve for
want of Trading, and ſo by conſequence bring greater evill
upon us: So I being not willing to looſe my pride and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pomp, I queſtioned the truth of the Scriptures, and even
God himſelfe, and all for want of ſome glimps of ſpirituall
light, which my naturall eyes in reaſon could not diſcerne.
Therefore the moſt high was pleaſed to convince me with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
formes, namely birds of the Aire, which every day brought
me intelligence according to my worldly occaſions; for almoſt
three years ſpace I have obſerved them, for they would foretell
me of any danger or croſſe, or any joy from friends; I mean any
danger or diſhonour to my perſon, or loſſe of cattell, or corne,
or any other diſadvantage to my advancement in the world;
and this cleerly convinced me, that there was a power above
man. Then I conſidered the wiſe mans ſaying, <hi>Eccleſ. 10. 10.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42017:10"/>
Curſe not the King, not not in thy thought, neither curſe the rich in thy
bed chamber, for the fouls of heaven ſhall carry the voice, and that which
hath wings, ſhall declare the matter:</hi> Alſo I conſidered that God
made uſe of a bird to feed <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet: by this I ſaw that
he made uſe of naturall cauſes to fulfill naturall deſires, ſo I
came to know God in nature. Moreover I conſidered the Scrp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
where the Lord ſpeaks againſt the Sooth-ſayers, and againſt
Aſtrologers, Sorcerers, and wizzards; all theſe I found to be
the ſpirits of darkneſſe, and will reach no further then the old
man in the fleſh, yet very neceſſary to be known, that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the evill thereof: Chriſt and the Prophets knew all theſe
things, or elſe they would never have ſpoken againſt them, but
we in the old man have often ſpoken againſt things that we
knew not, out of blinde zeale, but not according to knowledge:</p>
            <p>Therefore let the Scripture rule us, that wee judge no mans
heart which belongeth to God only in the Spirit, but our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
muſt be externall of every tree according to their fruits;
<hi>For by their fruits we ought to know them:</hi> So to reprove every man
his Neighbor to his face, leave off backbiting and ſlandering one
another, and making up our laughter in deriding the actions of
others, which we cannot do, unleſſe we think our ſelves wiſer
then they; This ſad thing have I obſerved in many Families,
when they have hapned in any diſcourſe, it ſeldom or never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
without backbiting, or deriding one another behind their
backs with their tongues, which cauſeth envy, and ſets on fire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man that uſeth it againſt his Neighbor, according to the
Scripture, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. and this cometh for want of mortifying the
old man in the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. Theſe and many other helps
there are in the Scriptures, if we will believe it, to overcome the
fleſh; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat. 7. 8. Whoſoever asketh receiveth, and
he that ſeeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it ſhall be opened:</hi> This
Sccripure ſeems to reach further then the Diſciples in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
for ſome that did not believe, made uſe of his name to caſt
out Devils, and it ſeems the power of God aſſiſted them therein;
for they could not doe it by the power of the Devill, for then
they would not have made uſe of Chriſts name. Again, Chriſt
himſelf ſaith, <hi>If Satan caſt out Satan, his Kingdome cannot ſtand,</hi> Mat.
12. 26. And it<hi>'s</hi> contrary to any reaſon, that God ſhould caſt
out God, or the Devill caſt out the Devill: So we find according
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42017:11"/>
to the whole tenour of Scripture, that God anſwereth all ſorts
of people according to that diſpenſation they are under, if their
deſires are fervent, whether it be for their good, or their hurt, as
have proved ſufficiently in my diſcourſe concerning the fleſh gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 7. where God ſaith to
<hi>Samuel, Hear the voyce of the people in all that they ſhall ſay unto thee.</hi>
So God condiſcended to the deſires of the people for the hurt of
their bodies in granting them a King; but if any out of zeale to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God in the Spirit will pray unto him, and yet would up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the righteouſneſſe of God in the fl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh; God anſwering them
with ſuch ſpirits as may diſhonour them in this world, by lying
or falſe prophecying, to deſtroy the honour of the old man in
them, that they may be brought forth as tryed in the fire, more
pure in the ſpirit of Light: but if any ſhall enquire after God at
the mouth of his Prophets, only to uphold the honour and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of the old man in this world, God will ſend them falſe
ſpirits to preach lyes, of purpoſe to deſtroy them; and this will
come upon thoſe that are for their own ambitious ends, as you
may ſee in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. where the falſe ſpirits wait<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on God for
their meſſuage, and God ſends them forth, and bids them proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
to pleaſe <hi>Ahab</hi> in his requeſt; Thus wee ſee for the love of
this world people are deſtroyed. Then let us conclude, that it is
high time to caſt off the old man with his rudiments, with his
malice and envy, and entertain light, love, and peace, and joy in
the holy Ghoſt; That this may be our treaſure, leading us up to
that throne of grace, full of unſpeakable joyes, where Chriſt ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in the Councell of his Father, with all his Angels, entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all with fulneſs of joy, that entereth in at this narrow gate,
wiping away all teares, and all deſires ſhall ceaſe, and ſorrow
ſhall never more come neare them; and inſtead thereof ſuch joy,
that neither tongue of men or Angels can expreſſe.</p>
