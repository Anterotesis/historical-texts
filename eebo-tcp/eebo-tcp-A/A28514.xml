            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S this Sermon came from you into the
world, ſo now it returnes from the
world to you again: your approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and requeſt (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
enough) encouraged me to,
and in the publication; and your
Patronage ſhall be all the ſhelter I
will ſeeke, in caſe of detraction. I know the matter will
diſpleaſe many, becauſe here the Church of God is put upon
acting againſt the Antichriſtian Synagogue, and partie:
but I matter not theſe mens diſpleaſure: for I profeſſedly
ſeeke, and preſſe a diſappointment of their deſigne, and a
diſsipation of them, ſo farre as they drive it on wittingly,
<pb facs="tcp:51012:3"/>
and willingly againſt the Lord and his Chriſt. There is a
generation of men who pretend daily to pray (as they are
taught) Thy kingdome come, and yet their plots and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
are againſt nothing more, then the coming of
Christ his kingdome: ihe enlightning of theſe mens eyes,
or the binding of their hands is chiefly aimed at, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
Diſcourſe: for the preſent therefore I am reſolved
not to waigh what they cenſure, becauſe I looke upon them
either as blinded, or wrong byaſed, and ſo neither a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
partie, nor indifferent Iudges. If the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the ſtyle be either queſtioned, or blamed, my anſwer
is ready, it was choſen on purpoſe, that if any good do iſſue,
upon either, the preaching, or publiſhing of this peece, the
praiſe may be of, and to God, not the weake and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Inſtrument. Theſe notions found acceptance with you,
in the delivery, and therefore, though now they may want
that life and vigour which then they ſeemed to have, yet I
hope (for Gods not mans ſake) they will finde a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
acceptation with your eyes, to that of your eares:
ſome enlargements of particulars which you heard in the
Pulpit are here poſsibly omitted, for memory may faile me
to gather up theſe fragments. All the materials are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
laid together, only one uſe in the cloſe, (as proper to
the point, and neceſſary for theſe times) is briefly added.
If ſingularitie in point of offenſive Armes be laid to my
charge, I reply, that now men generally call for, and enquire
after newes, and though this may ſeeme to ſuit theſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
wits in the publication, yet the Text cleares it, to be an
old truth; novell onely in caſe of diſcovery. And the
truth is, this beſt ſuits my genius, for I wholly deſire to be
the diſciple of old truths, and have no heart to tamper or
be taken with them, who affect to be maſters of new here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies:
as there are too many (who through faire ſhews, but
without doubt, for baſe ends) doe trouble the Church with
<pb facs="tcp:51012:3"/>
their fond fancies, and new fangle toyes, in theſe turbulent
times: but I leave them to their juſtly deſerved cenſure,
with the Apoſtles wiſh,<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 5. 12.</note> would to God they were even cut off
that trouble us, and to the Church of God with the ſame
Apoſtle I write thus.<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note> Now I beſeech you Brethren, marke

the catching of thoſe<note n="d" place="margin">Cant. 2. 15</note> Foxes, thoſe little Foxes,
that ſpoyle the vines. For though they come to us in ſheeps
cloathing, yet inwardly they are ravening wolves. Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thus, I ſee not but malignants of the new garbe in the
Church, may do as much hurt as thoſe of the old one, in the
State. Let me not for this be thought, an enemy to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
Reformation, it is the deſire of my ſoule to ſee it
up, in its full beautie, and ſtrength, onely I would have old
Babylon broken down, and all new Babels kept down, that
whiles we have voted, and vowed out by-paſt ſuperſtition,
we may not be obſtructed, or burthened in the worke of the
Lord, with new Ieſuitic all plots of faction and ſchiſme, leſt
whiles men plead for libertie, they turne Libertines: and
after we have covenanted; ſincerely, really, and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(through the grace of God) to endeavour, that the
Lord may be one, and his name one in three kingdomes, we
be not found by every mans ſeeking, and ſetting up himſelf,
to neglect the keeping of the union of the ſpirit in the bond
of peace, and inſtead of advancing the Lord Ieſus, to be the
beginners and fomentors of confuſion, in all the Churches
of Chriſt. But from this occaſionall digreſsion Ireturne.
And if the needleſneſſe, or tardineſſe of my paines in this
ſubject, be laid in the way of that profit which might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be reaped hereby, I would remove this obſtacle thus,
although this be but to write Iliads after <hi>Homer,</hi> yet all
<pb facs="tcp:51012:4"/>
men either have not ſeene, or will not make uſe of, or cannot
underſtand the Labours of the more Learned: theſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may be uſefull to ſome, and I have my aime, if either
for condiction, or confirmation, I can benefit any, though
they be the meaneſt of the people for parts, or place. And I
might have been ſooner in print, if I durſt have thought
any thing the Lord had imparted unto me, worth publique
view, or any wayes able to ſtand up againſt a generall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
but ſince you worthy Patriots may not be non-ſuited
by him who is unexpreſsibly engaged to your, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
ſervice, and that I muſt out and abroad, among the
croud of other ſcriblers, theſe Lines through Gods mercie
may prove in good time for kent, (where they were bred,
and for which, they are chiefly publiſhed,) although other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they be too late for Chriſtendome. I will not any longer
ſtand or ſtay to anſwer for my ſelfe, by a larger Apologie, I
muſt leave my defence in other things to you moſt induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gentlemen; And I ſhall thinke my Lot very ſtrange,
if you (who under God) have been the Saviours of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
cannot ſhelter me among ſo many, eſpecially ſince (for
deſires to doe good) I feare not Tongue, if I can eſcape Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot.
It will be happineſſe enough to me, moſt faithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,
if upon the review of theſe my unworthy Labours,
your ſpirits be heightened into action againſt the enemies of
the truth; It is an honourable ſervice, for you to ſpend and
to be ſpend in. And by quickning you hereunto, my hope is
to ſee you every way ſucceſſefull, under <hi>Boaz</hi> his bleſsing,

the words doe clearely reſpect and enforce the ruine and
utter overthrow of the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> ſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the people of God muſt put their hands, and be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
for the accompliſhment of that Prophecie of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,
Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, as we have it
<hi>verſ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 2. Where (for clearing of my way) it will firſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
Why the holy Ghoſt both in this Chapter, and all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51012:5"/>
along the Prophecie points out the ſtate of Rome lapſed
and Antichriſtian, by the name and title of Babylon, and not
rather by its owne name Rome; that ſince this is a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
we might have had it plainly, and clearely revealed,
who and what is meant?</p>
            <p>To omit all other anſwers for the preſent,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I pitch upon
this, as moſt ſatisfactorie. That the reaſon hereof is, becauſe
God in this title or name, Babylon, had an eſpeciall aime, to
hold out unto his Church, all the enemies of his people,
and oppoſers of his truth. For as Babylon of old, was a
great and grand Adverſarie to the Church and people of
God: ſo here, under that name, the holy Ghoſt ſets forth
unto us, the condition and end of all ſpirituall Babylonians,
they are bloudy perſecutors in their times, and their end
is to be deſtroyed. And that this is the reaſon, will appear.
For if the Lord had onely ſaid. Rome the great is fallen, is
fallen; and, reward Rome as ſhe hath rewarded you, it had
beene of too narrow a compaſſe for expreſſion of the minde,
and meaning of the holy Ghoſt, and the inſtruction of the
Church, what to thinke of, or how to deale with her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
For if Rome in the letter had beene once deſtroyed
(which the Church might poſſibly have attempted, and
ſoone atchieved) then all her other perſecutors would, and
might have boaſted themſelves as out of the verge, and liſt
of them who by this Prophecie are noted, and voted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
But here it is apparent that they are all Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,
where ever they inhabite, and drinke of Romes
poiſoned and cruell Cup, of error and bloud. And this is it
the Church muſt doe to them, Reward them as they have
rewarded her. She muſt double unto them according to their
workes, in the Cup that they have filled, ſhe muſt fill to
them double; pointing out rather what the Church muſt
doe againſt Romaniſts then Rome, aiming equally at men
of Romiſh ſpirits, as well as Romes Deniſons and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants:
for not to dwell in Rome, but to have Rome dwell
in us is a ſinne, and the high-way to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>It is all one in this caſe, whether they be <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51012:6"/>
Babylonians. So that (as I conceive) the purpoſe of God
in the Text, is the impartiall cutting downe of Church ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as well thoſe of the Romiſh partie, and faction, as
Synagogue and profeſſion. And hereupon, if theſe words
be compared with thoſe of <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. (as of neceſſitie they
muſt be referred thereto for the ſupply of the ſenſe) then
without all further either ſcruple or curioſitie, the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
concluſion from the words as a Baſis of that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues,
will be this.</p>
            <p>It is the dutie of all thoſe who have eſcaped Romiſh cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,<note place="margin">The ſumme of the Text in one generall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> to be inſtrumentall for Babylons compleat fall and
ruine.</p>
            <p>The witneſſes I ſhall produce to prove,<note place="margin">The firſt proofe of the point in a diſcovery of command from Jer. 50. 8 14, 15.</note> and make this
good, are of unqueſtionable veritie, and authoritie: as firſt,
you may ſee it cleared in a diſcoverie of Command parallel
to this in the Text, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. at the 8. <hi>verſ.</hi> compared with
the 14. and 15. For firſt in way of eſcape the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes
his people to remove out of the midſt of Babylon,
and to goe forth out of the Land of the Chaldeans, and be as
the he-goats before the flocks: and this certainly hath an
eye to the eſcaping from ſpirituall filth, and pollution as
well as the ſlaverie, and bondage of that captivitie; for it
is one of the puniſhments which the Lord threatens the
Church in the wilderneſſe withall, <hi>that if they doe ſinne and
commit wickedneſſe againſt the Lord, then the Lord will bring
them and their King which they ſhall ſet over them, unto a
nation which neither they nor their fathers have knowne, and
that there they ſhould ſerve other gods, wood and ſtone,</hi> Deut.
28. 36. and this we ſee urged upon ſome as their moſt
bitter portion in that land of Chaldea <hi>to fall downe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the golden Image which Nebuchadnezzar had ſet up,
Dan.</hi> 3. 15. And to ſay truth, what is all corporall reſtraint,
if compared with temptations and provocations to ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
uncleanneſſe, which the people of God ſhall certainly
meet with, whiles they remaine in the hands, and under the
power of Babylonians? ſo that (as I take it) the Lord chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aimes at Sionsridding, and acquitting her ſelfe from the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51012:6"/>
ſinnes of, and in Babylon: for to what purpoſe is it, to be
Iewes in habitation, and Babylonians in opinion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation?
And we ſee clearely, that it coſt the godly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Iewes a great deale of care, and paines, to get the
Congregations purged from thoſe ſinnes the people brought
back from Babylon, at their returne out of that captivitie:
as it is upon record, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 6. 13. &amp; 9. 38. &amp; 13. 15.
Well then, ſuppoſe we the people of God ready, and prompt,
both in reſpect of ſinne and ſorrow, to come up to God at
his word, and make removes from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Babylon as he here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
is this all they have to doe, may they reſt content
with this their locall and ſpirituall ſeparation? No ſure, there
yet remaines ſomewhat more for them to doe, they muſt
look back upon Babylon: but not (as many times they did
upon Egypt) with hearkening after returnes to her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
contentments. No, it muſt be to execute, and take
vengeance, for all the ſinnes wherewith ſhe hath offended
againſt the Lord, and all the ſufferings ſhe hath formerly
laid upon his people: for ſo it is given in charge, <hi>Put your
ſelves in aray againſt Babylon round about: all ye that bend
the bow ſhoot at her, ſpare no arrowes, for ſhe hath ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Lord: ſhoot againſt her round about, ſhe hath given
her hand: her foundations are fallen, her wals are throwne
downe: for it is the vengeance of the Lord; take vengeance
upon her, as ſhe hath done, doe unto her, as thus it followes in
the afore quoted</hi> 14, &amp; 15. verſ. <hi>of the</hi> 50. <hi>of</hi> Ier. Whiles
the Church forſakes her in heart, ſhe muſt ſtrenuouſly, and
ſedulouſly act againſt her with her hands: and thus of the
diſcovery or proofe of the point from command.</p>
            <p>But it will be ſaid,<note place="margin">The ſecond proofe of the point in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Icel 3. 7, 8.</note> this place of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> puts others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
acting againſt, and taking vengeance upon Babylon as
much, if not rather more, then Iuda and the people of God,
that have been captives there, and now are delivered. For
anſwer hereto, ſee the point further confirmed, in a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of promiſe to the Church in ſpeciall for this purpoſe;
<hi>Behold, I will raiſe them out of the place whither ye have ſold
them, and will returne your recompence upon your own head,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51012:7"/>
and I will ſell your ſonnes and your daughters into the hands of
the children of Iudah, and they ſhall ſell them to the Sabeant,
to a people farre off; for the Lord hath ſpoken it. Ioel</hi> 3. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>And yet if any ſticke at,<note place="margin">The third proofe of the point, in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe.</note> or queſtion the truth of the point,
ſee it once more, in a diſcovery of bleſſings, or happineſſe,
that ſhall fall upon thoſe, who are inſtrumentall to compleat
Babylons fall and mine. <hi>O daughter of Babylon who art to be
deſtroyed:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 137. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Happy ſhall he be that rewardeth thee as thou haſt
ſerved us; Happy ſhall he be, that taketh and daſheth thy lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ones againſt the ſtones. Pſal.</hi> 137. 8, 9. And who are ſo
fit to doe this worke, and ſhare in this bleſſedneſſe, as they
upon whom God hath done his worke, and bleſſed them
with a diſcovery of, and an eſcape from Babylons filth and
pollutions?</p>
            <p>But perhaps,<note place="margin">1. Reaſon to confirme the point, from Gods devoting of her to ruine.</note> theſe teſtimonies are not convincing enough,
ſome men muſt have reaſon to confirme, and ſettle them, in
the beliefe of ſuch a doctrine as this; To condeſcend to them
therefore; ſee the point eſtabliſhed and bottomed upon ſuch
arguments as theſe. Firſt, God hath devoted Babylon to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine and deſtruction; it is that which the Lord hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
and determined, yea he hath recorded it in the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolls
of heaven, that Babylon ſhall fall, and come down to
utter ſhame and confuſion. And not onely ſo, but he hath
made known, and diſcovered his will and pleaſure to the
Church. For ſo he looks upon it, as a known truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
principle of old; <hi>O daughter of Babylon which art to
be deſtroyed, Pſal.</hi> 137. 8. the Church makes no queſtion,
but it shall be, and the truth is, we need not doubt it. For the
motions and counſels of Gods minde continue ſtill, and are
ſtable without change, or variation; and this is his will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Babylon, both literall and ſpirituall, (ſo farre as can
be knowne by his word) that it ſhall utterly periſh and come
to naught. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 13. 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>And great Babylon
came in remembrance before God to give unto her the cup of the
wine of the fierceneſſe of his wrath, Revel.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>And a
mightie Angel tooke up a ſtone, like a great milſtone; and caſt
it into the ſea, ſaying, Thus, with violence, ſhall that great citie
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51012:7"/>
Babylon be thrown down, and ſhall be found no more at all.
Revel.</hi> 18. 21.</p>
            <p>I would draw up this into forme of an Argument thus.
That which God hath determined and made known to
his Church in his word concerning the ruine of Babylon, it
behoves all thoſe who have eſcaped Romiſh corruption to
be inſtrumentall for the accompliſhing and bringing to paſſe.</p>
            <p>But God hath determined, and in his word made it
known to his Church, that Babylon ſhall fall and come to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine, and that by the Church. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The minor propoſition is cleare, from that which is above
ſaid, and the major cannot be denyed, except men will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and plead it lawfull for them, either to goe againſt, or
come ſhort of Gods will revealed to them in his word. I
ſhall end this reaſon in this propoſition.</p>
            <p>That as the unbeleeving Iews, through ignorance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe,
did performe Gods determinate counſell and will,
in putting to death the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the Lord of life
and glory; ſo it behoves the beleeving Gentiles, through
faith and knowledge, to performe Gods determinate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and will, in the utter overthrowing of Antichriſt, that
man of ſinne and ſonne of perdition, with all his glory and
pompe, that they may deſcend with ſhame and ſorrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
everlaſting infamie and oblivion.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reaſon from Gods precedency or going before us in the work.</note> we have not onely Gods vote, but his worke
to argue from, in this caſe; for he goes before us, and begins
to his people in this buſineſſe of Babylons fall and ruine; ſo
that it is no ſhame for us to follow; nay, it is a ſinne, if we
doe not, when we have ſuch a leader. Now the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
of himſelfe, with a note of obſervation and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;
<hi>Behold, I am againſt thee, oh thou moſt proud, ſaith
the Lord of hoſts, for the day is come, and the time that I will
viſit thee, Ier.</hi> 50. 31. And what will be the concluſion or
upſhot of this viſitation? A very bitter and intolerable
end to Babylon, for ſo it follows, <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. <hi>And the moſt
proud ſhall ſtumble and fall, and none ſhall raiſe him up: and I
will kindle a fire in his cities, and it ſhall devoure all round about
him.</hi> The Lord will make an end of all, he will leave her nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51012:8"/>
name nor ſrup. Yea, the Lord is yet more full and cleare
in this particular, for if the Church (in remembrance of the
wrong Babylon hath done her) complaine to God, and tell
him, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the King of Babylon hath devoured
me, he hath cruſhed me, he hath made me an emptie veſſell:
he hath ſwallowed me up like a Dragon, he hath filled his
belly with my delicates, he hath caſt me out; The violence
done to me and to my fleſh, be upon Babylon, ſhall the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
of Sion ſay, and my blood upon the Inhabitants of
Chaldea, ſhall Ieruſalem ſay. The anſwer then of the Lord is
this, for the comfort and refreſhment of his people; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thus ſaith the Lord; Behold, I will plead thy cauſe, and
take vengeance for thee, and I will dry up her ſea, and make
her ſprings dry, non of her defences ſhall be a ſecuritie for
her, when the Lord on Sions behalfe comes againſt her. And
Babylon ſhall become heaps, a dwelling place for Dragons,
an aſtoniſhment, and an hiſſing without an inhabitant. Here
is the Lord doing, and doing to purpoſe, in way of avenging
Sion upon Babylon, good reaſon therefore it is, that Sion
ſhould be up and acting, ſeeing the Lord is not onely with
her, but before her in the worke, even to the making of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylons
fall compleat and full. For as we have heard before,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 51. 34, 35, 36, 37. So the Lord goes on, further to note
what he will doe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 57. I will make drunke her princes,
and wiſe men, her captaines, and her rulers, and her mightie
men, and they ſhall ſleep a perpetuall ſleep, and not wake,
ſaith the King, whoſe name is the Lord of hoſts. It is no good
ſigne of a good ſouldier to ſhrinke back and take to his heeles
when his captain is valiant in the battell. It were a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
thing to the people of God, if they ſhould faint,
be cowardly and give out in acting for Babylons compleat
fall and ruine, when they have a <hi>King</hi> to lead them, a king who
wants neither counſell, ſtrength, or means to defeat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
his enemies. For his name is the Lord of hoſts.</p>
            <p>But thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Reaſon from the end of eſcaping Romiſh pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> this is the end why the people of God are
fetched out of, and delivered from corruptions; that there
may be ſome meetly qualified, diſpoſed and fitted to worke
her fall and ruine? we cannot thinke that God hath cauſed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51012:8"/>
light to ariſe out of obſcuritie, that there ſhould be no acting
againſt the children of the night and darkneſſe. If he have
diſcovered unto us the filthineſſe of the whore, it is that we
may hate her, and burne her fleſh with fire, and give her
blood to drinke. It is no wonder, that our forefathers hands
were bound, and that they did little, or nothing againſt the
Beaſt and the Babylonians: for their eyes were blinded, they
were in the darke, and could not ſee to worke, much leſſe
to fight. But that <hi>we</hi> having cleare viſions, and full diſcoveries
made of the Beaſt and her abominations, ſhould ſit ſtill, be
careleſſe, and ſuffer her for ever to play her beaſtly prancks, it
is a moſt notorious ſhame and ſtaine unto us; true fire hath
its heat, as well as its light, and true grace doth not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten,
but alſo ennoble our ſpirits: it doth not onely make us
to know, but to doe the will of God. It puts us upon acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it cannot be otherwiſe, but that where the love and life
of God is, there will be working and endeavouring, to ruine
and bring under all the enemies, and oppoſers thereof, as
well thoſe open, and in the view of the world, as thoſe more
ſecret, and ſhut up in the heart of a Chriſtian. We have the
true and ſaving knowledge of Chriſt, that we may be the
more quickned, and encouraged to act againſt, and to bring
down Antichriſt. It is a ſhame not to do Gods work that he
hath deſigned us unto; eſpecially, when he affords us day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to accompliſh it in. Our light is lent us, that the king
and kingdome of darkneſſe may be troden down, not onely
amongſt our ſelves, but where ever he hath ſubjected the
ſouls of men to Babyloniſh thraldome and ſlavery. For
though we cannot give others light, yet we may, we muſt
endeavour their libertie.</p>
            <p>But fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Reaſon form the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Gods people.</note> I ſhall preſſe the point, by an argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the prayers of Gods people; It is the dutie of all
them who have eſcaped Romiſh pollution, to be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
for Babylons compleat fall and ruine; that ſo (as farre as
in them lies) they may ſpeed, and haſten an anſwer to their
own prayers, concerning her fall and ruine, when their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are ſtirred up, to act towards the accompliſhment of
their own deſires, and requeſts. The men of Iſrael are beaten
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51012:9"/>
before the Inhabitants of Ai; the curſed Canaanites can
both repulſe, and kill Iſraelites; the reaſon is (though not
then known) becauſe there is an accurſed thing in the camp;
<hi>Ioſhua</hi> betakes himſelf to the old and ſure way; the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
fall before their enemies in battell, the Commander fals
down before his God in prayer, <hi>(Ioſhua</hi> 7. 5, 6.) he enquires
after the cauſe, and reaſons out the caſe with his God; and
this is good ſo farre: but this is not enough, there muſt be
ſome what more then prayers, to ſet all right againe; <hi>Ioſhua</hi>
muſt up, and act, he muſt finde out, and put out of the Camp
the accurſed <hi>Achan,</hi> the troubler of Iſrael: So we and our
forefathers have prayed, and doe pray, againe and againe, for
the ruine of Rome; have not we like thoſe ſouls under the
Altar, flaine for the word of God, and for the teſtimony
which they hold, cryed with a loud voyce, ſaying, How long
ô Lord, holy and true, doeſt thou not judge and avenge our
blood on them that dwell on the earth? <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 9, 10. But
what can prayers doe? it is confeſſed, they are of great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valencie
with God, but for all our prayers, enemies are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſtill, Babylonians are Babylonians ſtill, Antichriſtians are
Antichriſtians ſtill, men are implacable, inexorable in their
evils ſtill; eſpecially, thoſe they act againſt the Church, and
people of God. To our prayers therefore we muſt joyne,
and adde our ſpirits, and let it appeare, that our prayers have
ſo had power with God, as to encourage our hearts and
hands to warre againſt Babylon. We make our prayers to
God, that he would avenge us of our enemies, yea ſaith the
Lord, I will, but you muſt help to avenge your ſelves, you
would have Babylon down, you ſhall, it ſhall be ſo; your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and prayers are granted, onely you muſt venture and
hazard a little blood, let us ſee, can you ſpare a life, that Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians
may die, I will doe my part, but I will have my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to doe theirs alſo, put your hands to the worke, and I will
not pull back mine, reward her as ſhe hath rewarded you, if
you will have me to doe your will in heaven, doe you my
will on earth, my people and I are both of a minde, we
would have Babylon brought down, and totally routed, and
ruined, onely here is the difference, they would have me to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51012:9"/>
doe all, and I will have them to doe ſome. Let them but up
and act, and it ſhall ſoon be ſeen, that the Lord is their help.</p>
            <p>Again laſtly,<note place="margin">5. Reaſon from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements that lye upon the people of God to this ſervice.</note> I ſhall clearely confirme the point from the
conſideration of thoſe engagements, that lye upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God to be active in rewarding Babylon as ſhe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
them, in doubling to her according to her works, in
the cup that ſhe hath filled of filling her double: and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligements
are many, but theſe ſhall ſerve at preſent.</p>
            <p>An obligement of profeſſion is upon them,<note place="margin">1. Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> they publiſh
to the world, that they are the ſervants and ſouldiers of the
Lambe, and therefore they muſt beſtirre themſelves, that
their Lord may overcome; they muſt not onely enter and
liſt themſelves, take pay, we are their colours, and live upon
the proviſion of the camp, but they muſt play the men and
fight alſo. It is obſervable, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 14. that thoſe who were
with the Lambe (when he makes warre with the ten horns,
that receive power as kings at one houre with the Beaſt)
were called, and choſen, and faithfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a ſouldier indeed, not onely to be called, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
but that alſo, in all, and above all, he be found faithfull.
and our fidelitie to Chriſt cannot more be ſeene, or better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed,
then when not onely as men, but Chriſtians alſo, we
act valiantly and conſtantly againſt the Antichriſtian brood
in the world, who wage warre againſt our King and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>They have aſſurance that in the blood of the Lambe they
ſhall overcome,<note place="margin">2. Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 11. My brethren, who dares or
can be a coward, that hath it aſcertained unto him, upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable
warrantie, that without doubt, he ſhall get the
better and overcome in the battell? that whether he kill or
be killed, he ſhall be looked upon and honoured as a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour?
yea, certainly he ſhall triumph and ſee his captivitie
led captive. And this is the condition of all the faithfull ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in the Lambs warre againſt the Beaſt and his partie.
For there is that blood already ſhed, that hath overcome
them all for us. Suppoſe thoſe we are to encounter be kings,
their ſtrength is broken, cruſhed, and made weake, we have
our feet upon their necks, whiles we goe forth to the warre.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51012:10"/>
Our <hi>Ioſhua</hi> hath conquered, and we goe after him onely to
take the ſpoile, and triumph. For he is king of kings, and
Lord of lords, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 14. the field is fought, and wonne, we
onely goe forth to fetch in the trophies of victory.</p>
            <p>We have comfortable and abundant experience of and
from the people of God,<note place="margin">3. Engagement.</note> who in this buſineſſe of rewarding
Babylon as ſhe hath rewarded them, have out of ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
come up to great and honourable atchievements:
Time would faile me to relate many inſtance of former
dayes, doe but reade over Gods dealings, with his Church
in theſe ſeven laſt yeares within the compaſſe and confines of
Great BRITAINE, and tell me whether there be not
experience upon experience herein, even to no leſſe then
wonders and miracles. Scotland weake, and poore, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

and the wicked coming in their ſtead. Courts full of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if not injuſtice, tumbled downe into their firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of <hi>non entitie.</hi> In warres for the moſt part the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſucceſſefull, or not utterly deſtroyed, able ſtill to doe
ſomething for God and his cauſe, even to the envie of the
adverſarie. And in the beginnings of reformation, more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull
and bleſſed, then in formerly expected periods. We
would heretofore have thought our ſelves happy, to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
where we now thinke there is ſcarce a beginning. But
to come to Kent, for whom, and with whom I have to doe
in this ſervice, how were we (unworthy) proſpered in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
(not over a twelve-moneth ſince) a deſperate inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
without either skill, or helpe almoſt in any, but our
God? who till a conſiderable number of faithfull ones were
gathered,<note place="margin">Great raine at the time of the riſing in Kent.</note> and till the heart and ſtrength of the wicked, was
wel-neare broken and ſcattered, continued his raine, of love
to his people, but of wrath and confuſion to his enemies:
and hath twice ſince then, defended us from the invaſions
of cruell and bloud-thirſtie men. Oh that we could never
forget theſe mercies, to ſerve God, according to the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51012:10"/>
they lay upon us, and that here we could (as <hi>David</hi>
from remembrance of the Lion, and the Beare) gather heart
to act further and further againſt the brood of babylonians,
becauſe we have cauſe to beleeve, that he who deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us from ſo great deaths, and doth deliver us, will alſo in
Chriſt Ieſus deliver us to and in the end.</p>
            <p>The continued darings,<note place="margin">4. Engagement.</note> challengings, and provocations of
the Antichriſtian party. For beſides their wondering after, and
worſhipping of the beaſt, ſaying, Who is like unto the beaſt,
who is able to make warre with him? <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 4. have
they not gathered together in Armes, and Armies againſt
the Lord and againſt his Chriſt? Nay, are they not daily more
and more mad, and deſperate in their miſchiefe conceived
againſt the Church? Doe they not hourely beat up their
Alarmes, and bid defiance to the people of the moſt High?
Do they not rob, ſpoil, and plunder all where ever they come?
and are theſe things, with many more of the like nature,
any other, then ſo many callings out of the godly, and well-affected,
to take up their Armes, draw and uſe their ſwords
in the Lambs cauſe againſt the Babylonian beaſts, and beaſtly
Babylonians? Not that I would encourage any man to Duell
it, in his owne avengement, or for his private honour, (for
that argues baſeneſſe of ſpirit, and begets a blot with all truely
noble and generous ones) I would hese have every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
to ſtand upon his reputation, and after and amidſt ſo
many and ſo proud challengings, not to diſcover puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and ignoble ſpirits. What hath Antichriſt done for
them they dare be ſo bold? and what hath not Chriſt done
for us, that we ſhould now in theſe dayes of darings be
daſtardly, hen-hearted and effeminate?</p>
            <p>But enough for confirmation,<note place="margin">1. Vſe.</note> the poynt would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
and may firſt informe us who and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men they are, whom we muſt looke upon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be moſt active, and inſtrumentall againſt the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian

we reſpect her Cup of, firſt, Idolatrie, or ſecondly, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
for this hath ever beene the policie of that ſtrumpet,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51012:11"/>
to hamper men in the bonds of Idolatrous and ſuperſtitious
worſhip, and to enlarge them in the way of licentious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe:
it is enough, if Satan can make men zealous accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his principles of religion and devotion, although they
be moſt remiſſe and careleſſe in the things of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements:
theſe men are ſo enſnared and fettered, as that it
is their very death, to part with their bands, the gyves are
ſo faſtened upon their hearts, and hands, that there is no
expecting any thing in way of <hi>Sious,</hi> enlargement from
them.</p>
            <p>Wonder not to ſee men of this world ſlow to a warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Antichriſt.<note place="margin">2. Vſe.</note> For this were to act againſt, firſt, their
owne intereſt, for here they have their portion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 14.
the creature is the totall ſtay and ſupport of their hearts: it
is not poſſible that theſe ſhall doe any thing in a warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Antichriſt, but thoughts preſently ariſe, of the givings
out, and emptyings of their God: their good, is in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of earthly ſupports; let theſe be called for and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, and their heart is down, they give up all as loſt,
becauſe their goods are called for, they inſtantly conclude
their God is gone; they know no other, and therefore they
can doe no better.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if theſe ſhould act, it were to move againſt their
owne ends; the purpoſes and determinations of their hearts,
are to eate, drinke, and take their eaſe; they are devoted ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the fleſh, and therefore may not act againſt thoſe
waies and things, that give them full leave and libertie to
make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts of the ſame.
If they act againſt Babylon, they can neither grow great, nor
enjoy pleaſures, in their ſenſe. And hence it is, they pity
her, rather then act againſt her, as in their owne language
we read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 19. Alas, alas, that great Citie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were made rich all that had ſhips in the ſea, by reaſon of
her coſtlineſſe; for in one houre ſhe is made deſolate. Let it
not trouble us that great Doctors, and profane Proctors with
&amp;c. doe not act againſt, but for Antichriſt: their intereſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth
them, and they muſt be all true and faithfull to their
baſe and carnall ends. Their ſhips are forth in a voyage for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51012:11"/>
luſt, and lucre, and they would not for a world they ſhould
miſſe of their fraight, or periſh in their adventure for trading
and commerce with Babylon: the truth is, ſelfe-ſeekers are
no fit men to act againſt Babylonians.</p>
            <p>Hence we have a diſcoverie of the reaſon,<note place="margin">3. Vſe.</note> why the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
ſtate ſtands ſo long, and ſtrong in the world. And
that is becauſe the people of God generally, and for the moſt
part have done but one halfe of their dutie, if ſo much, againſt
Babylon. We ſhould have uſed the ſword, and the ſpeare,
as well as the pen, and the pulpit, in ſeeking her demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and fall; we ſhould have had battels fought, as well as
bookes written; ſhe ſhould have beene diſheartened, as well
as diſcovered; we ſhould have daſhed in pieces her carnall,
as well as her ſpirituall props. We ſhould have overthrowne
her towers, as well as her tenets. We ought to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
our ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nons, as well as our conſciences againſt her. We
ſhould have uſed our armes as much, nay more, then our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
againſt her. For theſe would have overcome, when
thoſe could not perſwade. We ſhould have diſpatched, and
not diſputed her out of the world: we have not done all our
worke, and why ſhould we expect all our wages in the fall
of Babylon?</p>
            <p>But is not this a piece of ſtrange, and harſh, if not falſe
doctrine? may ſome men ſay. Shall we from the pulpit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
men to uſe their armes, and that to the utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and ruine of others? I know it will be thus objected,
but what of that? I matter not the murmurings, or mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of men, ſo long as I have a warrant from the word to
back me and beare me out. And therefore here,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the people of God have a commiſſion not onely
for a defenſive,<note place="margin">4. Vſe.</note> but an offenſive Militia, and poſture of Warre.
I know many have taken great paines, and to good purpoſe,
to prove it lawfull, in the preſent cauſe of God, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and Parliament to take up and make uſe of Armes, in
the defence of Religion, the Church, and the truths of God
therein: but by the light of my Text and Doctrine, I ſhall
make bold to goe one ſtep further, and not onely to preach,
but preſſe the Saints to put on, keepe on, and uſe manfully
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51012:12"/>
weapons of offence againſt the brats of Babylon. And I ſhall
hence and here boldly affirme, that he who now ſtartles and
ſtaggereth, delayeth, and refuſeth, with the Parliament and
their partie, to beare and uſe Armes, againſt the Prelates,
Papiſts, and Atheiſts, with all the frie of Antichriſtian factors
and panders, is no other then a rebell and traytour againſt
God. For let theſe men cry up as much as they can, and with
as wide and loud a mouth as they are able, the Proteſtant, I
am ſure they have never knowne or beene acquainted with
the Chriſtian Religion. For to forbeare, or be mercifull to
theſe Babylonians, is both injuſtice and cruelty, to the
Church, our ſelves, and poſteritie.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> To the Church of Chriſt. For theſe are her open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who have endevoured, and are ſtill a plotting, how to
withdraw her from her ſtedfaſtneſſe in the faith, that they
might eſtrange her heart from her husband Chriſt, to doate
upon, and to paramoure it with that grand Idoll of Rome,
and to make her of the Temple of God, the Synagogue of
Satan. And how ſuch as theſe ſhould be uſed, read <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.
<hi>per totum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> we are referred to the doctrine of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and the Old Teſtament for proofe in this caſe; and that

            <p>But firſt:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I am glad that it is acknowledged for a piece
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of Scripture; and then I am ſure that Whatſoever was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It hath no more nor leſſe in it concerning the ſevere and

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Heretiques now are of as dangerous conſequence as

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As an husband now, will not endure the corruption of
his wife by an adulterer, any more, then a Iew under the
Law: ſo will not the Lord ſuffer the wrong of alienating
the heart of his Evangelicall Spouſe, any more, then of his
Legall one, if I may ſo ſpeake.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The carriage of all Heretiques and Idolaters in all Ages,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51012:12"/>
in their prevailings hath beene too cruell to the Church, and
the Church on the contrary hath beene too favourable and
mercifull unto them; as experience teacheth both to our
ſorrow and ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Lenitie and mercy moves not, they are not one jot the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>

by all the lenitic and favour ſhewed them: they will
ſtill labour to ſeduce and ſubdue the Church and people of
God. Let us hence learne and labour to ſubdue them.</p>
            <p>By ſparing theſe, men are moſt cruell to themſelves: for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
he who can now pitie the bodies of Babylonians, will one
day find, if they prevaile, that they will neither pitie bodies,
eſtates, or ſoules, (ſo farre as lieth in their power) to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
or ſpoyle. If we like <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſpare <hi>Benhadad</hi> under no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of brotherhood, the reward ſhall be, that our lives
ſhall goe for thoſe we ſpare, and their charge (in the day of
advantage) ſhall be like the Aſſyrian Kings; Fight neither
with ſmall nor great, but with the King of Iſrael. With none
but the godly partie, that now ſcruples and boggles at the
deſtroying of thoſe, that cannot, ſhall not, avoid determined
indignation.</p>
            <p>And as for poſteritie, they may have cauſe to ſit downe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and curſe the day, when we neglected the opportunitie put
into our hands, of breaking the Babylonian yoake totally, and
univerſally from off our necks, that ſo it may never be put
upon theirs, either in poperie or ſlaverie; which in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie
muſt needs be entailed by us to after Ages, if now
in this nicke of time, we ſit ſtill and doe nothing, or not to

bones of Babylons brats, thus boldly and bloudily, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to law and reaſon, riſen up amongſt us; and againſt us,
and Gods true Religion profeſſed by us. Brethren, it is a
ſhame to finne againſt opportunities; God hath now put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our hands a poſſibilitie of ruining and caſting off more
Babylonians in way of warre, within the compaſſe of a day,
then our forefathers have had abilitie to ſubdue in this Age
of reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51012:13"/>
But muſt we put men to death for their religion onely,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are Papiſts?</p>
            <p>The objection in theſe times is moſt frivolous.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> For thou
art not hereby put upon killing them for what they profeſſe,
but for what they practiſe; not for their opinions, but for

they act: for ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>reward her, as ſhe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
you;</hi> and truly my ſentence is, that God armes them
with courage, ſtrength, and weapons againſt his people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
heretofore, and now alſo, they have and doe find too
much favour at our hands. For if we will not doe Gods will
upon his enemies, he can give them ſtrength, and heart to

For we are no other then Gods enemies, whiles by
a baſe neutralitie and parcimonie, we declare our ſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants

            <p>Hence we may learne,<note place="margin">5. Vſe.</note> how little good to expect from

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> This is quite croſſe to Gods command concerning Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,

they have thus barbarouſly robd and ſpoiled.</p>
            <p>It is croſſe to their deſerts, they have merited a Cup of

ſo ſlowly: doth it not argue our want of faith in God,
that we ſet up carnall reaſon as an onely engine to undermine
and overtop the tottering Babel of Antichriſtianitie? and is
it not juſt with God to befoole us in this worke, and lay ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
upon obſtruction in our way, becauſe we will not
take them at their own word, and weapons, and cudgell
them into a peace?</p>
            <p>It is no ſmall diſcourteſie to after ages, to neglect the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
preſently given, and to leave them to lugge it out with
Antichriſt, who otherwiſe (were not we in fault) might
freely, and comfortably follow the Lambe whither ſoever he

why then ſhould they lead any of the flocke that drove away

heart, and that under a double notion or conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, want of pitie and compaſſion to our brethren. We
doe not remember thoſe that are in bonds as bound with
them, and them that are in adverſitie as being our ſelves alſo
in the body. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3. we thinke not upon mangled Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;
in their members and eſtates, upon wives defiled,
maids raviſhed, husbandleſſe windows, fatherleſſe infants,
whole towns both Northward, and Weſtward plundered
and diſpoyled, Congregations deprived of godly Miniſters,
whole priſons filled with precious Saints, &amp; there reproached
and abuſed; but why ſhould I here proceed? for if we would
but let our hearts looke upon decay of trade, diſappointment
of our hopes, and the generall exhauſting of the treaſure, and
leſſoning of the ſtrength and honour of the Nation, and all
this occaſioned by the plots, and practiſe of the Babylonians,
how could we as men, as Chriſtians, as Proteſtants, as Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
men, as men of Kent, ſitſtill with our hands bound? but
here is the anſwer and reaſon, our hearts are bound through
want of commiſeration, and how then can our hands be looſe
to the Churches help? an impriſoned heart, cannot have an
enlarged hand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in ſenſuall ſecuritie, or rather ſenſeleſſe ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
We cannot, we will not be perſwaded, that the cup of

they are ſo diſtempered, diſtracted, and diſcontented in thier
