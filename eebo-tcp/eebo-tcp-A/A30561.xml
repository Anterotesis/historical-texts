            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSVVER To divers QUERIES</head>
            <opener>
               <hi>Superscribed thus,</hi> To the <hi>Quakers</hi> some <hi>Queries</hi> is sent to be <hi>Answered,</hi> that all People may know your <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the temper <hi>of it,</hi> and your <hi>Judgment</hi> concerning <hi>the Times</hi> and <hi>Seasons; and Subscribed, let your Answer be directed,</hi> Tradite banc Amico Regis.</opener>
            <p>AS concerning the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that are scornfully so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, We are at this day, and have been ever since we were a People, a poor despised and contemptible People, in the eye of this world, and deep Sufferers under the <hi>Injustice,</hi> and <hi>Cruelties,</hi> and <hi>Oppressions</hi> both of <hi>Rulers Teachers</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and we have been <hi>a prey to the wicked,</hi> and troden down under the feet <hi>of Ambitious men,</hi> that have been in <hi>Power</hi> in this <hi>Nation,</hi> and have Ruled in <hi>force</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> over us, and this hath been ever since the Lord raised us up to be a <hi>People,</hi> though we have not been offensive <hi>to any just Law,</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> or to <hi>any sort of People,</hi> otherwise then that we have given our Witness against Sin and wickedness in all People; but we have not been <hi>Oppressors of others,</hi> neither have we <hi>envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the persons of any,</hi> but in all good Conscience have we walked <hi>towards all men,</hi> doing no otherwise <hi>to any,</hi> than we would be <hi>done unto;</hi> and this is the very Law <hi>we walk by towards all men,</hi> desiring the <hi>good of all,</hi> and that <hi>all may come to Repentance and be Saved;</hi> and what we are as unto the Lord, if I should declare, it could not be believed by many: But we are his <hi>People,</hi> and he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52872:3"/>
hath <hi>Chosen us,</hi> and he is <hi>our God,</hi> and we have <hi>Believed in him,</hi> and <hi>walked with him</hi> in the uprightness of heare, and we have this Testimony in our own hearts, if we die <hi>it is for him,</hi> and if we live <hi>it is to him;</hi> and though we have been and may be clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the <hi>Reproaches</hi> and <hi>Persecutions</hi> of an <hi>Uncircumcised Generation,</hi> yet in the Lords season it shall be manifest, even <hi>to the world,</hi> and <hi>to our very enemies,</hi> that we are <hi>his People</hi> and <hi>Chosen of him,</hi> and he in the midst of us, whom <hi>we Serve</hi> and <hi>Worship in Spirit, in Truth,</hi> and <hi>in Righteousness,</hi> and this shall be manifest in the day of the Lord, and in the mean time we are willing to <hi>bear,</hi> and to <hi>suffer</hi> all things that is put upon us, for the Name of the Lords sake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 1. Whether you, or any of you, that pretend to <hi>Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Revelation,</hi> did foresee, or was it revealed to you, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> should be Proclaimed <hi>King</hi> to Reign in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ever any more? Or, whether or no any of you did believe it, or could have believed it by your great Faith which you profess, if it had been told you long ago?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As for the Proclaiming of <hi>Charles Stuart King,</hi> to Reign in <hi>England,</hi> it was not improbable unto our Faith, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it contrary unto that which some of us hath seen; for we know that God respecteth neither <hi>persons</hi> nor <hi>names,</hi> but doth <note place="margin">See <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Paper directed to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> so called.</note> give the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>this World</hi> to whomsoever he will: And thus much was said as may be seen in a Book, called, <hi>GOOD COUNSEL AND ADVICE, REIECTED,</hi> (and divers other Papers) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 17. In a <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> it is said concerning you that are commonly <hi>called Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers;</hi> But <hi>what and if, for and because of thy wickedness in the sight of God, he should raise them up, and make them Instruments in his hand to accomplish his wrath upon thee, even like as he made thee once his Instrument to overthrow them,</hi> &amp;c. And here the thing was believed to be possible, that the Lord might raise you up again for <hi>his pleasure,</hi> to fulfil <hi>his will,</hi> because of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Nation;</hi> and it is now come to pass even as was seen and believed. And also it was expressed in a <hi>Letter,</hi> written in the tenth Month, 1659. concerning them that were your Enemies, and that were at first raised against you, <hi>The very same spirit of Pride, and Oppression, and Idolatry, is entred into them,</hi> (meaning your Enemies) <hi>and now lives in them in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52872:3"/>
as high a measure as ever it lived amongst you; and their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are well nigh finished, and the Lord will one way or other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and reproue them, and they shall be dealt with in like manner as they have dealt with you; for they were no more than a Rod in the hand of the Lord for a season, and they must also be broken and cast into the fire, and whether the Lord may ever make use of you to reprove them, as he did of them to reprove you, this I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine not; but leaves it to him who can do whatsoever he will by what Instruments he pleaseth: It is true you have made many At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to be revenged upon them, but you have not hitherto pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered; but could you be humbled and come into the meek Spirit of the Lord, then might you prosper, but hitherto the Lord hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes defeated you, and bowed you down under a People as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy at others, but their time will come to an end: And submit unto the will of the Lord in what is come to pass, and seek not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to your selves, and then the Lord will avenge your cause for the Iniquities of your Adversaries are ripe, &amp;c. And</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>must either be Converted to God, and ruled by him, or else he can never rightly Rule for God in this Nation; though this I believe it is not impossible but that he may be a Rod upon them that once smote him, and their Oppressions and Ambitions may receive a check through him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These things were written in a Letter to all the people of your part, long before there was any visible appearance, of that which is now come to pass: whereby it doth appear that these things in a great measure were foreseen and <hi>Prophesied of,</hi> and it was believed as a thing very possible, that thus it might be as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come to pass: And <hi>as for visions,</hi> they are for an appointed time, there is a time <hi>to see,</hi> and a time <hi>to speak what is seen;</hi> and revealed things belongs <hi>to us,</hi> and when we declare them then you may take notice of it; But it was verily believed as a thing possible, that such a thing would be, and also by the proceedings and transactions as they have fallen out, for your very enemies have so acted and proceeded as to destroy themselves, &amp; to bring you in over their Heads, though they little intended the thing, yet the effect of their proceedings could hardly prove otherwise than to destroy themselves, and make room for you, and these things I observed; <hi>And also thus far we did fore see and it was revealed to us, and believed by many of us fully, and we did often
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52872:4"/>
Prophesie it, that the Lord God of Heaven &amp; Earth would destroy and bring down the Government, &amp; Authority as they have stood in this Nation for divers years,</hi> and that he would <hi>bring Iudgment upon the Rulers, and upon many of the Teachers, &amp; People of this Nation, because of their Oppressions and Unfaithfulness, and Treachery, &amp; Hypocrisie, &amp; Wickedness,</hi> which <hi>abounded amongst them,</hi> which <hi>we have felt and seen, and been sensible of;</hi> and we have <hi>often given our witness against them,</hi> because <hi>of their guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in their sinful waies;</hi> Oh it hath been <hi>loathsome unto the Lord,</hi> even the Oppressions &amp; Treacheries of the Rulers! Oh how hath <hi>Cruelty and Injustice</hi> abounded in their <hi>Government!</hi> &amp; their hypocrisie hath been evident in our <hi>sight</hi> in many <hi>Particulars,</hi> &amp; even in that they have cryed against and overthrown <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingly Government,</hi> charging them with <hi>oppression</hi> and <hi>cruelty,</hi> and <hi>pretended</hi> to ease the People in a better way of <hi>Government,</hi> when as though <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Names,</hi> &amp; <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> were changed and altered, <hi>yet oppression ceased not,</hi> neither was <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi> forsaken, nor was the heavy yoakes <hi>of great bondage</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: <hi>but the rather these things were increased upon many good People in these Nations,</hi> and herein was the unfaithfulness, and treachery of the Rulers very great in the sight of God, and their Government <hi>unjust and unequal,</hi> wherefore the Lord hath been provoked against them to confound them, and overturn them, and we have often told it them, and also the Hypocrisie and deceits, and sinfulness of Teachers, we have seen &amp; testified against, &amp; our witness to them both is and will be found true, and Gods justice will be fulfilled upon them both, <hi>&amp; these things we have observed,</hi> even the <hi>heinous guilt of sin against God in both Rulers and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, &amp; the abominations that have been committed both in Civil, and Church Government</hi> (so called) <hi>also,</hi> and many People have loved to have these things so, and we have been sensible how the Lord hath been provoked to overthrow the Governors of this Nation, because hereof; and this we have <hi>foreseen</hi> and <hi>Prophesied of,</hi> even <hi>that Iudgement</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi> would come upon <hi>the Government, the Rulers,</hi> and <hi>the Teachers;</hi> but particularly when and after what manner, judgment &amp; overthrow should come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, was left to the Lord, who hath brought to pass his own will according to Justice, and it may prove to be a just Jugdment from the Lord, upon the <hi>Unfaithful</hi> and <hi>Treacherous,</hi> and <hi>Unjust

Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> which I have mentioned, and the Lord may justly avenge himself upon them who have abused his Mercies, and not improved his Deliverance to his glory, but perverted the end wherefore they were at first raised up, I say the Lord may justly be avenged of them by this means, of this mans comingin, and he may be in the hand of the Lord a very smiting Rod to correct and rebuke, and may be a heavy Judgment upon many in this Nation, even from that <hi>cause,</hi> and for <hi>that end</hi> as before I have expressed.</p>

And what are your Observations of the present proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Are the present Times and Seasons, and the proceedings, and transfactions in Mercy, or in Iudgment to the King, and his Subjects? If in Mercy, to whom is it Mercy?

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes we dare declare <hi>our Iudgment</hi> concerning <hi>the Times</hi> and <hi>Seasons,</hi> for we have received the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> in our Spirits, and never <hi>have been,</hi> nor <hi>are we afraid</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>Truth,</hi> so far as Truth is necessary to be declared; and we say <hi>the Times</hi> and <hi>Seasons</hi> are in the hand of the Lord, and the <hi>motions of them</hi> are very swift, and the Lord gives <hi>to whom,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52872:10"/>
and takes <hi>from whom,</hi> (Times and Seasons) as he pleaseth, even as it were in an instant doth the Lord <hi>give,</hi> and <hi>change,</hi> and <hi>alter, Times, Authorities,</hi> and <hi>Things;</hi> and mortal man ought not to glory <hi>in Times</hi> or <hi>Seasons</hi> as if they were <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to him; for behold the <hi>Motions</hi> of <hi>Times</hi> flyeth away, and <hi>Seasons</hi> removeth their course, and the most confident of men have no certainty thereof, and that because they are in the hand of the Lord that turneth them about, and often contrary to mens will and pleasure; <hi>and therefore let every man be good in his time, and fulfill the will of the Lord in his Season,</hi> before <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Season be no more, but removed from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for our <hi>Observations,</hi> they are very many of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>proceedings</hi> and <hi>transactions; first,</hi> we do observe that there is not any thing of all these <hi>transactions</hi> that are come to pass, but there is a secret hand of the Lord God, <hi>through them,</hi> and <hi>in them;</hi> either <hi>doing of them,</hi> or suffering of them <hi>to be done;</hi> and either as the <hi>cause</hi> by secret purpose, or as the means of their accomplishment; it is not <hi>without him</hi> that these things cometh to pass, but <hi>his eye</hi> &amp; <hi>his hand is</hi> over them, &amp; that man is only bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>which hath respect unto him in all these things,</hi> that he may do or suffer for the Lord, and that he may not rebell against him, in what is brought to pass by him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we observe how that the Lord <hi>hath given</hi> unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men <hi>a Day</hi> and <hi>a Time,</hi> and tryed them what they would do for him, and whether they would rule in <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and in <hi>Equity,</hi> but many have proved <hi>deceitful,</hi> and not answered to the Lord what he expected <hi>from them;</hi> and therefore the Lord hath <hi>confounded them</hi> in their Counsels, and suffered them <hi>to Clash</hi> one against another, and made them <hi>overthrow</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and one <hi>self-seeking man</hi> hath been the ruin of another (as bad as himself) and even many by their own proceedings have prepared <hi>a rod</hi> and <hi>judgment,</hi> even for themselves, and through their blindness of heart, <hi>which they have been given up to,</hi> because of their <hi>wickedness,</hi> they have destroyed themselves, and given their <hi>very enemies</hi> advantage over them <hi>to afflict them,</hi> and this <hi>we have observed of present proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, We observe that there is <hi>a rude prophane spirit,</hi> highly abounding throughout this Nation, that brings forth much <hi>bad fruit,</hi> as <hi>drunkenness</hi> and <hi>wickedness</hi> in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52872:10"/>
which may justly provoke the Lord to wrath and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the Land, if it be not forsaken, though it be lifted up in this <hi>wonderful rudeness</hi> in a pretence of <hi>glorying</hi> on the behalf of the <hi>King,</hi> and his Government; yet <hi>it vexeth the Lord</hi> and <hi>it works Sorrow</hi> in the hearts of many <hi>Sober People,</hi> who are pondering what <hi>the End of this Government may</hi> be, that is thus rude and prophane <hi>in its beginning,</hi> saying in their hearts, how shall the Lord blesse <hi>these</hi> proceedings, and make <hi>the end of them happy,</hi> which are thus void of the fear of God <hi>in the first part of them;</hi> and if <hi>a stop</hi> be not put and <hi>a limitation</hi> upon the Spirit, it will provoke the Lord <hi>to</hi> work <hi>sudden destruction,</hi> and <hi>overthrown</hi> the Nation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We observe, that many <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>dubble mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men,</hi> are afraid, and <hi>terror</hi> hath Surprized them, who have taken the profession of <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Religion,</hi> on them for <hi>a Cloak,</hi> and hath been in the <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> for earthly ends, <hi>such</hi> are <hi>afraid,</hi> and their <hi>ends</hi> are <hi>frustrated,</hi> and they are turned into <hi>confussion,</hi> and a prophane Spirit abounding over their Hypocrisie, and <hi>such</hi> will deny their <hi>Principles</hi> and their Faith, and will <hi>fawn</hi> &amp; <hi>slatter</hi> to save themselves, &amp; this is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; but men that have been and are <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wars God in their way, they are not <hi>afraid,</hi> but are confident in the Lord, and are given up in his will, whether <hi>to do</hi> or <hi>suffer for his Names-sake,</hi> and they have <hi>no terror</hi> upon them because of <hi>any guilt,</hi> because they have been <hi>upright,</hi> in that way which they were perswaded <hi>to be right,</hi> and such lives in a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and quiet life, and are contented whatsoever comes to pass, because they have the witness, that they have not followed their Religion <hi>for self ends,</hi> nor taken the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> for <hi>a Cloak</hi> as many others have, upon whom this <hi>overturning</hi> falls very heavy: And these things with many more the like, we do observe <hi>from the present transfactions,</hi> which are fallen out in <hi>Mercy</hi> to some, and in <hi>Iudgment</hi> to others, even a <hi>Iudgment</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that do not <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> but walk in wickedness, and that have been <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and <hi>hard-hearted,</hi> and <hi>cruel,</hi> and to all that doth <hi>not repent</hi> of their sins, <hi>these things,</hi> and <hi>the end of them,</hi> are, and shall be <hi>great Iudgments,</hi> and shall be turned into bitterness, even their <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>rejoycing,</hi> into <hi>howling,</hi> and great <hi>Lamentation, this shall be the end unto all the ungodly: but unto all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52872:11"/>
that fear the Lord and departs from Iniquity, even unto such the end of all these things shall be good, even Mercy, and Peace, and their sorrow shall be turned into joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>for us,</hi> we are not <hi>faint-hearted,</hi> though it be supposed <hi>that we are in our last dayes,</hi> and as though <hi>our ruin were nigh to come,</hi> but we believe <hi>other wise,</hi> for we have <hi>clearness</hi> of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>all men,</hi> and walks in Faith and patience, and knowing this assuredly, <hi>that if we be persecuted</hi> and <hi>afflicted</hi> in <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Estate</hi> by you that now are in Power, yet it is for <hi>Righteousness sake,</hi> and for <hi>the Lords sake,</hi> and not for the guilt of any Rebellion against you, that you have or ever can have to Charge upon us, for we cannot befound in these things <hi>for we can neither secretly flatter to make peace with you,</hi> neither <hi>can we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly rebell against you, or resist you; but as our right from God and you, we claime the LIBERTY of the Exercise OF OUR CONSCIENCES, in the Matters of Faith and a holy Life to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God,</hi> that we may mind the things of <hi>Gods Kingdome,</hi> and may so walk and worship, as to have peace <hi>with God</hi> in our Consciences, that no burden <hi>of Sin</hi> and <hi>Iniquity</hi> may lye upon us, but that we may <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> in peace with God, <hi>this is all we Claime of you;</hi> But and if you will <hi>not allow it us,</hi> but will <hi>persecute us,</hi> and seek <hi>to destroy us</hi> only for our <hi>Conscience-sake,</hi> and because of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> if you do make and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute <hi>Laws</hi> against us, in opposition to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>our God,</hi> that you may take an occasion against us <hi>to destroy us</hi> because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>then Innocent blood and cruel suffering will be upon you, and the weight of it will sink you into confussion,</hi> when <hi>your measure is full;</hi> and if you should <hi>destroy these vessels, yet our Principles you can never extinguish,</hi> but <hi>they will live for ever, and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other bodies to live,</hi> and <hi>speak, and act through other vessels, for our Principles are standing and unchangeable through Ages, and Generations,</hi> and may be <hi>clouded but can never be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,</hi> for every man <hi>hath a Light in his Conscience</hi> which <hi>Christ hath inlightened them withal;</hi> which <hi>Light</hi> reproves Men <hi>for sin</hi> and with it <hi>they know</hi> they should not <hi>Lie,</hi> nor <hi>Swear,</hi> nor be <hi>Drunk,</hi> nor <hi>deal doubbly,</hi> nor walk <hi>in any sin:</hi> but and if they do these things, and live contrary to the <hi>Light in their own Consciences,</hi> then they <hi>deny Christ</hi> and are <hi>unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and they are <hi>condemned,</hi> and have trouble in their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52872:11"/>
but if men do <hi>own that Light</hi> in their Consciences which doth reprove them <hi>for sin,</hi> then it leads them to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and to the forsaking <hi>of all sin,</hi> and they cease <hi>from all Iniquity,</hi> and receive <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> and <hi>his blood</hi> to cleanse them. And the Light of the Spirit of God <hi>leads them into all Truth,</hi> to do, and speak the Truth <hi>in all things,</hi> and then he hath peace with God in his Conscience: And these are some <hi>of our Principles,</hi> which can never be Subdued <hi>by all the Powers of the Earth,</hi> though the vessels which now retain these were out off, yet these Principles are unchangeable in themselves, and can never be extinguished; so that this our Religion cannot come to ruin, <hi>but they that think so, they are indeed deceived,</hi> and whosoever shall seek to destroy that which Gods purpose is to exalt, <hi>woe shall be unto them;</hi> and as they purpose towards others <hi>so shall it come upon them, from the Lord in his Day and Season.</hi>

            <p>THE Lord God who is greater than all, that doth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he will, hath given you a Day, and you are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up again out of your Suffering State; Oh that you would consider the end of it, and wherefore the Lord hath done, and suffered it to be done; and that you would make right use and improvement unto God and this Nation, of this your Deliverance and Promotion; for certainly there hath been an absolute purpose in the Counsel of the Lord, that these
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52872:13"/>
things should be thus, and his hand hath even suffered it to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, even in a strange and marvellous way, through the confounding of your Enemies, and giving of them up to the folly of their own hearts in their Councils, that they should destroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and bring in you over their heads, and make you a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and break down their Mountain, and make it as a low Valley; and certainly these things are in the Iustice of the Lords hand, and it will be well for you if you can consider it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it: You have been a suffering People it is true, for these divers years, and Orignally your Suffering was partly just as from the Lord, for there was a great measure of Iniquity and Oppression fulfilled in this Nation, on the part of <hi>Kings,</hi> and your Sins were great against God; wherefore the Lord was Iust in bringing Affliction and Tribulation upon you, to humble you, and he might Iustly raise up others to reprove you, and to subdue you before them for a season; and thus far even because of your Iniquities which were great in the sight of God, your Sufferings and Afflictions were Iust: But as for those that the Lord made use of in the Execution of your Afflictions; they are not justified in all what they did towards you, but they went beyond (in Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Cruelty upon you) what the Lord called them unto; and thereby they brought a great measure of guilt of Injustice and Cruelty upon their own Consciences, in proceeding towards you beyond Iustice and Equity: Though some of them might be more sincere and upright in the beginning of these things, when they began to War against you; yet it too well appears that many of them soon lost the Iust Cause, and began to have respect to your Estates and Titles of Honour, more than to free the Nation from Oppressions and Vexations, though they pretended much thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, yet so it was that they became fouly corrupted in their way; and though they Subdued you, yet did they not free the Nation, but became Oppressors themselves no less than others before them, and they possessed your Riches, and Titles, (yea and in great measure Unjustly) and then were exalted in Ambition and Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, and began to strive amongst themselves who should be the greatest, and set up this, and the other, and some cryed one way of Government, and others another, and they pulled down and set up as they would, and cast down and exalted whom they would; and thus they continued for some years, rowling up and down in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52872:13"/>
Confusion, and yet the Nation under very great Oppression and Vexations, each one crying his Burthen was the greatest, while they were exalted in their Pride and Riches, and lived at ease, notremembring the end wherefore they were first raised, nor keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to sincere Principles, but caused them to suffer deeply that were faithful to the Lord, and walked with him in sincerity; and all this while you were as asleep, and not thought upon by them, as if ever you should call them to an Account; but they thought that their strength was great, and their number many, and therein they gloryed having no true respect unto the Lord; and because hereof the Lord justly confounded them in their Counsels, when their measure was full, and made them weak as water; and you are now justly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up to reprove and correct them, even those, that have abused Gods Mercies to them, and that have forgotten God and sought to exalt themselves for ever, and had no respect unto the Lord and his People; though these things are not said of them, to upbraid them, nor to kindle your fury against them, to add Misory upon their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they have already been told of their Treachery, and what would come to pass; And Oh that they could now humble themselves before the Lord, and confess to the Iustice of this their Affliction; they might yet partake of his Mercy, through great Iudgments.</p>
            <p>And as for you, Oh that you would consider these things, and by whose purpose you are restored, and from what cause, and for what end it is accomplished! Oh that you would mind what your work now is, and that you would not exceed your Permission! for you are raised up for an end, and there is a work for you to do, Oh that you could do it with respect unto the Lord, it should be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you; Oh those men that have long Sate as <hi>Princes</hi> in this <hi>Nation,</hi> and Pretended, and Vowed, and promised Reformation in Church and State, but they have not done it as they ought, but as great Oppressions and Injustice, as great Superstitions and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, both in Church and State, were continued and carried on in their dayes, as in dayes before them; Oh how abominable have these things been! (multitude of words might demonstrate) but now their reproof and Iudgment is come, and their fall is just upon them; Who should pitty them, or mourn for them, seeing they have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all this and much more which has yet happened unto them? as some of them may confess; and those things (their Treachery, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness, &amp; Oppressions I mean) must needs be avenged one way
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52872:14"/>
or another: How often hath it been foretold them, yea it hath been often said unto them, that God would bring them down and destroy their Power? they have been told that these things were not right, neither could they escape unavenged, and it new appears as if the day were come; and if you must be their Executioners, and must execute the wrath upon them, who shall prevent you; or say unto you, stay your hand? Or rather who of them that sees these things, shall not be patient while you take vengeance for ths Lords sake, and for the sake of his People, whom they have long Vexed and Opppessed? Nay, who of the Lords People shall not say, let the Lords will be done, and his Iustice Executed upon his Enemies? If this be your work that you are called to, must it not go on till it be finished? They have been Hard-hearted, and Oppressors towards others; and by a Hard-hearted People, may not the Lord justly deal with them, and be a Plague unto them in that very manner, that they have sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him? for this is usual with the Lord, even to destroy Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors by the Wickedness of others, and often he Rebukes the sin of a People, by a People as bad as themselves; he may justly give unto men from the hands of others, what they love in their own hearts; and even as those men have loved Pride and Ambition over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Oppression and Hard-heartedness towards others; even so, and much more may justly be done unto them, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Will of the Lord; and if this be your work designed you by the eternal hand, who shall prevent you? But yet, Oh that you would consider, and that you would have some respect unto the Lord, lest you out-go the end of your Restoration: You would indeed be happy, if you could forgive your Enemies, if you could reward them good for their evil; and you would be happy if you could not exceed the measure of your permission; be not too Hard-hearted towards them but shew Mercy: And Oh you must take heed lest you cause the Righteous to suffer with the Wicked, and that you cause not the Innocent to groan and mourn in your execution of Gods purpose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ungodly, you must be a ware lest while you punish Offenders, you smite not them that are free; Oh that you had hearts this to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, and that you could walk in the path of fulfilling Gods pleasure, and not go further, (I mean) though you may be raised to be a Plague upon Hypocrites, and Disobedient and Treacherous men, and to avenge Gods Cause and his Peoples; but you are not raised to be Oppressors of the Lords People, nor to destroy his Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52872:14"/>
this is not your work; God hath not called you to Destroy and Persecute them that fear his Name, and tremble at his Word, though you have Power to be avenged on your Enemies: And Oh that your hearts could understand this, that you might distinguish in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, between executing of Iustice upon Transgressors, &amp; Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for Conscience-sake; the one you have to do, but the other is forbidden you of the Lord, and you ought not to do it; for if you Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute any for good Conscience-sake, or because they are of such and such an Assembly of People, and Worships in such a way; if you inflict Tribulation upon any because hereof, or because they are such or such in their Profession and Religion, then you persecute for Conscience-sake, and you go beyond the End, and by the Path for which you were raised; and if you turn your Hand and Power to persecute for good Conscience-sake, then you divert the End and Purpose of this your Restoration, and the Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of you, if that you go beyond his Permission and Assignment, and go beyond his Pleasure in Persecuting his People, and so turn your Power to a wrong Use and End; O then the Lord shall suddenly confound you, and he will find out instruments that shall fulfil his Wrath, and Iustice upon you, as he hath found you fit to execute Wrath upon others; and therefore do not, O do not persecute any for Conscience-sake, if you have nothing against them but concerning their Faith and Worship, and their Religion, do not lay your hand upon them, nor let them be touched; for if you do, the Lord will take it as a heinous offence against him, and in this life, or hereafter, he will Plague you for it, and you shall not escape unpunished: and therefore I say once more to you, as the advice of your Friend, let no man be persecuted for his Faith, and for his Religion-sake, but make a distinction between inflicting wrath upon offenders that have been hypocritical and deceitful, and that have made themselves rich through the ruins of others, and that will how to any thing, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of Worship for their own ends; and between such who have a Principle and do stand by it, and are humble and acted in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of sincerity, and follows that way of Religion which they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and are perswaded is the best, and the rightest; all such ought to have their Liberty under you in their Profession, and Faith, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and ought not to be Persecuted while they live Peaceably as men with one another, and towards all men; and the God of Heaven requires it of you, and your Standing, or your Fall, the Blessing or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52872:15"/>
the Curse unto you, depends hereupon; and this you shall find to be true unto you in the day of Gods Righteous Iudgments: O therefore be not stout against the Lord, but fear and tremble before him; let his Dread be upon your Spirits, and do not offend him, nor provoke him against you and this Nation, lest he tear you to pieces, and number you for destruction, lest he overturn you suddenly, and deface your glory in its morning: Oh how happy would you be if you would regard the Lord and reverence him, and take him before you, and not go beyond in any thing what his purpose and pleasure is, who hath given you this one day to try you, if so be that any of you shall learn his fear and turn from your Iniquities, that you may be blessed and not confounded; Oh therefore consider what the Will and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Lord is towards you, and wherefore you are raised up, and may fulfil his purpose, and not your own: Oh then this day should be made happy unto you; but the contrary works, I mean, if you do Oppress, and Persecute, and seek to destroy his Heritage, and Rule in Oppression and Tyranny, then the God of Heaven shall cut your day short, and diliverance he will bring to this poor Nation without you, and even contrary to you, and his hand shall be turned upon you, and your Mountain though never so great, and high, shall be laid low, and an Infant of the heavenly birth shall leap over it, and shall say, Where is that lofty <hi>Babel</hi> that exalted it self ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

            <p>And as for us, we are a very poor, contemned and despised People, even since we were a People unto this very day, and have nothing at this present, nor heretofore to glory in from any Power that hath ruled; but the Power, Spirit, and Presence of God in our Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Afflictions, Persecutions and unjust Sufferings, these things have been our portion, even from all; all have troden upon us in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and Scorn, and accounted us as Sheep for the slaughter, and we have not to glory in, any Government that hath been since we were a People; we cannot justifie one or another, but we say they have all been Oppressors, and we have groaned with deep sighs unto the Lord under the burden of their unrighteous dealing; and herein we assent with you, if you say they have been unjust men, we say the same; and if you say their Government hath been Oppression and Unequal, we say the same; if you say you have suffered cruelty and unrighteously by them, we say the same; if you lay they have Ruled by Will and Forci, more then by Law and Equity, we verifie the same; and if you can say you have suffered Afflictions and Tribulation by them, so have we in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52872:15"/>
another manner, and far more unjustly: Wherefore we cannot justifie them, nor will not plead for them in opposition to you; but we partly beleive we may receive as much Equity and good Reason from some of you, as we did from some of them; and thus we have been a suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People even without cause: And at this day we are threatned by the rage of men as if we should be cut off and destroyed; but we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not those things, but do respect the Lord, whom we fear and Worship in our hearts; and if we outwardly perish among them that may perish, yet it is for Righteousness sake, and because of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gods Kingdom, which we hold; and if you do Destroy us for this cause we are clear, and Innocent blood will be upon you, and the guilt thereof will sink you into misery here, or hereafter. Oh take heed and desilenot your selves, nor load your Consciences with our guiltless suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings as many others have done before you, even to their ruin and wofull destruction; you are yet in a great measure clear from our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; we have not much Iniquity yet to charge upon you in our Cause of Afflictions: Oh it will be well for you if you keep your selves clear, the less will be your Iudgement, and the better success will you have in your Cause; for Friends, the weight of Innocent Blood it hath a loud cry, and God will hear it; and if you burthen yourselves with it, it will soon overweigh you, therefore keep clear, and condemn them by your Practises, that have said they would not Persecute for good Conscience sake, but have done it, even contrary to all Pretences and Engagements; and if you who professe not so much in words towards that thing, would do it, how should your Practise condemn their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie in the Sight of God, Men, and Angels? but however I warn you, and do leave it at your door; and do say unto you, Persecution for Conscience sake, is the crying Sin, which drawes down vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kings and Governments, be you warned through the fall of others least confusion come upon you, as it hath come upon many others for that cause; and be not too confident in your way, nor too furious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your enemies, but remember your breath is in your nostrils, and he that gave it you, can soon take it away.</p>
            <p>And as for you, we have no enmity towards any of you, nor do we sick the hurt of your Persons, nor can we rise up in Rebellion against you, or seek your Destruction by Craft or Policy, neither indeed can we seek Covenant or League with you by flattery; it is true you are yell in Authority over us outwardly, and as you are so, we shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Oh what destroying of the good Creatures! it greives the hearts of the Righteous, and vexeth the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber minded to consider it; and also their is a great deal of Hipocrisie and deceitfull-heartedness amongst many: I have considered this thing, and it is a vexation to the Lord, and cannot but be detestable to you; even in that many contrary to their Principles, Engagements, and Promises, Covenants, do now cry you up for to save themselves, their Lives and Estates, who have been deeply engaged against you publiquely and privately, and yet now in Hypocrisie are fallen in with you; such their proceedings are loathsome to God, and your present Cause is no better because of such; though as for some of you

that have stood to your Principle, and suffered for it this long while, in your state, you are more honourable and rather justified.</p>
            <p>Oh, let the King fear and reverence the eternal God, knowing he is but mortal man, and his breath in his Nostrils, and let him keep himself clear from Persecution for Conscience-sake, for that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy Kings and Governments who are guilty thereof; and let him be Meek and Sober, and take the Lord before him in all his proceedings, or else he cannot prosper; his Day, and Time is now present, that Gods purpose is to try him, if he Rule in Righteousness and Truth, in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Iustice, he may be blessed; But if otherwise he Govern, and walk not in reverence to the Lord and spare his People; the God of Heaven shall rebuke him, and deliver his People another way.</p>

external Iudgements</hi> upon you and the Nation, even <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of <hi>Pestilence</hi> and <hi>Famine?</hi> And do not you proceed in the very path hereof? Is not your spending <hi>the Creation</hi> in such <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive</hi> manner, in <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> and wasting the good Creation after this manner as you do; Whether is not this <hi>a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cause</hi> to bring <hi>want</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi> and also oppressing your very bodies with <hi>Excessiveness</hi> in <hi>Drunkenness, Inflaming</hi> your selves through <hi>Excessiveness</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Beer,</hi> and through the abounding <hi>of Lust,</hi> and <hi>uncleanness,</hi> through <hi>excesse;</hi> and as well <hi>Defiling,</hi> and <hi>Oppressing</hi> your very Persons, as wasting the Creation by so doing; Whether this is not a very <hi>Natural Cause</hi> to bring and beget <hi>Pestilence</hi> and <hi>Famine</hi> (besides your provoking the Lord through this means) as being works in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>hateful</hi> and <hi>abominable</hi> in his sight, and for which <hi>Cause</hi> he may justly bring <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Iudgements,</hi> even <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Famine,</hi> if there were no other <hi>Cause</hi> for it? And whether you ought not seriously <hi>to Consider</hi> of <hi>this thing,</hi> and to <hi>Turn</hi> from these <hi>Transgressions,</hi> which are <hi>Natural Causes</hi> of great <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and also provokes the Lord to hasten and inflict <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> Oh that the Sober minded among you would lay this to heart.</p>
            <p>Consider these Queries in the Spirit of Soberness, for they are worth your regarding, &amp; be not high-minded, nor wicked in your way, least the Lord who hath all Power in his hand meet you, and bring you down and destroy your <hi>Cause,</hi> which he can do, if you provoke him.</p>
