            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE INTRIGUES OF THE Conclave, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Doctrine of the Pope's <hi>Infallibility,</hi> upon which hang almoſt all the Articles of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, is a Banter of that Nature, that I think the Aſſertors of it, who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well enough acquainted with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> are much more to be wondered at, than the Soothſayers were by <hi>Cato,</hi> if they hold their Countenance when they look upon one another, I am ſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can equal their Impudence who pretend to be ſerious in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch a Cauſe, but the Impertinence of thoſe who by Dint of ſolid Argumenrs endeavor to confute them, ſince there is no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Perſon but muſt know that it is impoſſible that they themſelves ſhou'd believe what they wou'd fain Put upon the reſt of Mankind.</p>
            <p>When we ſhall here take a View of the <hi>CONCLAVE</hi> where this Infallible Pope is Forged, and behold what ſcandalous Qualifications generally recommend Perſons to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair as they call it. What baſe and deteſtable Practices are uſed by the Managers of the ſeveral Parties and Factions, to promote thoſe whom they think likely to prove ſubſervient to their private, and commonly wicked and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Deſigns, I am ſure none will imagin that they who are concern'd herein, tho' their Blaſphemous Cant is all the while of nothing but Divine Inſpiration, can think their Proceedings to be influenced by the Holy Ghoſt, or indeed deſire they ſhould.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97104:3"/>
For the better underſtanding of the following Relation, and for the Reader's ſatisfaction, I ſhall, before we go any further, give a ſhort Account of the Manner of the Election of <hi>Popes</hi> in former Ages, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a more particular Deſcription of the <hi>Proceedings</hi> of the <hi>Conclave</hi> in our Times. But, by the way, I cannot forbear taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a very Formal Story that is told us in the Book of the Sacred Ceremonies now uſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſays that St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> whil'ſt Biſhop of that See, inſtituted a College of Four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Senators, who afterwards, in the time of Pope <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Cardinals, that is Princes of the Church. Theſe, and no other were to have a Vote or Suffrage in the Election of their Biſhop, and if any other uſurped that Right, it was by Intruſion or Violence. Now I wou'd fain know whether all thoſe Popes, which by the Confeſſion of the ſaid Book itſelf were choſen either by the Clergy and People in general, or nominated by the Emperors for ſo many Ages together, are to be accounted more duly Elected, than they that are ſtiled Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks and Antipopes? If not, what will become of that uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Succeſſion which of late Years has been ſo much boaſted of?</p>
            <p>It is certain that for the firſt Five Centuries the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were Choſen by the joint conſent of the Clergy and People, to whom they were accountable for their Adminiſtration, and ſo far were they from arrogating that unlimited Authority over the Church which the Popes of the later Ages have pretended to, that they were ſubject in matters of Faith to the Cenſures of the Clergy of their own Dioceſs, by whom <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Firſt was interdicted from Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating Divine Service until he had renounced the Hereſie of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothelites.</hi> After the Death of <hi>Simplicius Odoacer</hi> King of the <hi>Heruli</hi> makes a Law, under pretence of remedying the Diſorders that often happen'd at the Elections of Popes, by which he forbad both Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Clergy to proceed to the Choice of any until they firſt knew his pleaſure concerning the Perſon that was to be Elected. This Law was Twenty Years afterwards aboliſhed at the Fourth Council of <hi>Rome</hi> by the conſent of <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the <hi>Goths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>Arrian</hi> Prince toward the later Years of his Reign was ſo far from preſerving thoſe Priviledges which he had reſtored to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he took upon him to Create the Popes himſelf. <hi>Felix</hi> the Fourth deriving his Authority wholly from his Nomination. The Gothiſh Kings that ſucceeded him followed his Example herein, only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97104:3"/>
they were content to approve of the Perſon whom the Clergy recommended to them. When <hi>Juſtinian</hi> had driven the <hi>Goths</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> he retain'd the ſame Power over the Popes that they before had aſſumed, both he and his Succeſſors obliging the New Elect to come and demand a Confirmation from them, for which they were to pay a round Sum of Money before they could exerciſe even their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Function.</p>
            <p>And becauſe of the Diſtance between <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the then Seat of the Empire, and <hi>Rome,</hi> the Exarch of <hi>Ravenna</hi> had often power delegated to him, to enquire into the Merits of the Perſon Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and if he found nothing Objected againſt him, he was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of his Election. Thus <hi>Iſacius</hi> the Exarch made a Journey on purpoſe to Confirm <hi>Severinm.</hi> This Cuſtom continued until <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Emperor, Sirnamed <hi>Pogonatus</hi> out of the great Veneration he had for the Sanctity of <hi>Benedict</hi> the ſecond, ſent him a Decree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was eſtabliſhed, That he whom the People and Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould Chuſe, ſhould for the time to come be forthwith acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor, without expecting the Authority of the Emperor, or his <hi>Exarchs.</hi> But this Decree was never, as I can find, much regarded by that Emperor's Succeſſors, for the Popes were never Conſecrated without their Conſent and Approbation.</p>
            <p>When the Empire of the Weſt fell into the hands of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> he retain'd the ſame right ſtill, and transfer'd it to thoſe of his Race. The <hi>German</hi> Emperors kept it as long as they could, but when they grew weak and feeble, the Popes inſtead of ſubmitting to their Approbation, pretended that they had a Right to diſpoſe of even the Empire it ſelf, ſo that at laſt, tho' not without a great deal of Squabling, it was carried, and Decreed, by <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, That the Election of the Popes ſhould entirely remain in the power of the Cardinals. This Canon was afterwards confirmed by ſeveral Popes and Councils. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third ordained, That he only ſhould be eſteemed Canonically Elected, that had the Votes of at leaſt Two Thirds of the College of Cardinals; and this is that way of Election that has obtain'd ever ſince, and which we are now going to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>After the Funeral Rites of the Deceaſed Pope are Celebrated, the Cardinals enter the <hi>Conclave,</hi> which is held for the moſt part in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where in a long Gallery are erected ſmall Apartments, called Cells, hung with Purple Cloth, for the reception of every
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97104:4"/>
Cardinal. When they are ſhut up they are allowd but two Servants a piece, or Conclaviſts, as they call them, who are generally the Craftieſt Fellows that can be met with. During the time that the <hi>Conclave</hi> laſts, the City Militia are always upon Duty without Doors, and the Maſters of the Ceremouies continually walking about the Gallery within, to prevent any private Correſpondence, or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand dealing, inſomuch that the very Diſhes that are ſent in to their Eminencies are ſearched, leſt there ſhould be any Letters concealed in them. Commonly before they proceed to any Election, there are certain Articles drawn up, relating either to the better Government of the Church, or Reformation of Abuſes, and preſented to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred College in General, which every one ſubſcribes, and ſwears that if he ſhall be Choſen Pope, he will Religiouſly Obſerve; but this Oath, tho' taken in the moſt ſolemn manner, is ſeldom or never kept, the new Pope generally handſelling the plenitude of his power in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving himſelf.</p>
            <p>There are three different ways of Election now made uſe of in the <hi>Conclave, Scrutiny, Acceſs,</hi> and <hi>Adoration,</hi> there was a Fourth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly uſed, but now quite left off, called <hi>Compromiſe,</hi> which was when the Cardinals found it impoſſible for them to agree, amongſt themſelves, conſented to Chuſe out of their own number three, or five, giving them power to Elect whom they pleaſed. This Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was performed ſomewhat after the manner of our Auctions, by Inch of Candle, for it was to be concluded and determined during the time in which a Taper, lightedby common conſent, continued Burning, but if they could not agree before it went out, the Commiſſion expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>SCR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TINT</hi> is performed after this manner, Every Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal has ready prepared for him a Scroll of paper folded in to five pages, on the firſt of which the Conclaviſt writes the name of the perſon for whom his Maſter gives his Vote, with theſe words, <hi>Ego Eligo in Summum Pontificem Dominum meum Cardinalem.—</hi>The Cardinal never writes this himſelf, unleſs he counterfeits another hand, for fear leſt his Character ſhould be known; on this fold two others are doubled down, and all three faſtned together with ſome Wax, and marked with two different Seals made for that purpoſe. On the Fourth page the Cardinal writes his own Name, which he covers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the like manner with the Fifth. At the time appointed for the Scrutiny all the Cardinals take their places in their Order, in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otina</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97104:4"/>
Chappel, with the Scrolls they have prepared in their hands. Then every one in his turn goes up to the Altar, before which is placed a Table cover'd with a Purple Carpet, and upon it a Chalice with a <hi>Patina,</hi> or Plate ſet thereon, on each ſide of which ſit the firſt Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Biſhop, and the firſt Cardinal Deacon. Here every one kneeling, makes a ſhort Prayer, and then puts his Scroll into the Chalice, which done, the <hi>ſenior</hi> Cardinals of every Title, that is, Biſhop, Prieſt, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, go to the Chambers of them that are ſick, and gather their Votes, which are prepared with the like Care and Circumſpection as the reſt, when all the Scrolls are put into the Chalice, the Cardinal Biſhop turns them all out upon the <hi>Patina,</hi> and takes the firſt that comes to his hand, and gives it to the Cardinal Deacon, which he reads with an audible Voice, the Cardinals noting with their Pens how many Votes each perſon hath. If it happens that any one has two Thirds, he is made Pope, without proceeding any further, and then all the Billets are opened, and every one's Name that conſented to the Election read publickly. But this happens ſo rarely, that it was accounted a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous thing that <hi>Adrian, Charles</hi> the Fifth's Tutor, was choſen at the firſt Scrutiny: But if this happens not, then the Maſter of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies comes in with a Pan of Coals, and turns all the Papers out, ſo that no Man is known for what perſon he has given his Vote.</p>
            <p>When the Election cannot be determined by Scrutiny, then it is tried by <hi>Acceſs,</hi> which is thus performed: Each Cardinal riſing from his Seat, goes and makes a profound Reverence to him whom he wou'd have Elected, ſaying, <hi>Ego accedo ad Reverendiſſimum Dominum meum.—</hi>The reſt in the mean time writing down the Names of thoſe both to whom the <hi>Acceſs</hi> is made, and who make it. This has ſome reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to the ancient manner of giving Votes in the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, when they that concurr'd in the matter propoſed went from their places to the perſon who made the firſt motion, from whence came the Saying, <hi>In ſententiam ire,</hi> which is not unlike the Cuſtom of our Parliaments, when the Houſe divides itſelf into <hi>Yea's</hi> and <hi>No's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which makes the greateſt Noiſe and Buſtle in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> is the way of <hi>Adoration.</hi> which is ſeldom put in practice but when ſome young and hot headed Cardinals reſolve to become Maſters of the Election, and when they ſee they cannot accompliſh their Deſign in a peaceable manner, endeavor to do it by plain Force, theſe being generally the Nephews of the deceaſed Popes, and conſequently at the Head of all thoſe promoted by them, who are obliged in Honour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97104:5"/>
(nay, ſome make it Conſcience) not to bauk at any thing wherein they may ſerve their young Maſters, they having firſt laid their Plot amongſt themſelves, watch their opportunity, when the reſt of the Cardinals are in a hurry and confuſion, to fall down on their Knees before the perſon whom they deſign to chuſe, and adore him as Pope. Thoſe that have not been made acquainted with the Contrivance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fearing leſt the Adorers ſhould have a ſufficient Number to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs their Ends, or ſuſpecting the Courage and Conſtancy of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, are often forced to do the like, by which means every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling by his ſtanding out to incur the diſpleaſure of him who he thinks will be Elected without him, ſtrives to ſeem as forward as he can, and thereby oftentimes becomes the main occaſion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of One for whom perhaps he has the greateſt Averſion. This is the manner of Election by way of <hi>Adoration,</hi> which, thô ſufficient of itſelf, is ſtill confirmed by Scrutiny; yet the Managers thereof take care that it ſhall receive no prejudice thereby.</p>
            <p>There was another way frequently practiſed in former Ages, which was called by <hi>Inſpiration</hi> or <hi>Deſignation</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt. That is, when the Cardinals were aſſembled in the Chappel, the firſt Biſhop aroſe, and in a ſhort Speech exhorted the Fathers to make Choice of one, who for his Piety and Wiſdom was worthy of ſo great a Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; then he Demanded by which way they thought fit to proceed by <hi>Compromiſe,</hi> or <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> telling them withal, that if his Opinion might prevail, he thought—was the fitteſt Perſon. If all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or two Thirds of them concur'd in the perſon Nominated, he was without any Scrutiny pronounced Canonically Elected.</p>
            <p>The Pope that is Choſen after any of theſe Methods, is conducted into the <hi>Sacriſtia,</hi> and is there Cloth'd with the Pontifical Robes, from thence he is brought, with a Rich Mitre on his Head, into the Chappel, and ſeated on the Altar, where the Cardinals perform the Ceremony of Adoration to him, every one in his order Kiſſing his Feet, Hands and Mouth. This done, the Doors of the <hi>Conclave</hi> are opened, the Pope ſhews himſelf to the People, and Bleſſes them. Then the firſt Cardinal Deacon proclaims with a Loud Voice theſe Words, <hi>Annuntio vobis Gaudium Magnum, Papam habemus, Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſimus Dominus Cardinalis—Electus eſt in ſummum Pontificem &amp; elegit ſibi nomen.—</hi>Then his Holineſs goes to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals leading the way, with a Croſs carried before them; when he comes to the Altar, he there takes off his Mitre, and Kneeling down
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97104:5"/>
gives thanks to God, and the Apoſtles, and then Ariſing ſits upon the Altar. Here firſt Biſhop Kneels and Sings the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> then the Adoration is again performed after the ſame manner as it was in the Conclave, which with a ſhort Office concludes that Days ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Theſe are the outward Formalities of the Conclave. But how the private Deſigns and Intrigues of the ſeveral Factions are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, we ſhall ſee in the two following Relations. But he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires a true Specimen of all the little Arts and Tricks, whereby the Candidates themſelves procure the Votes of others, will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt be fully ſatisfied with the Behavior of <hi>Montalto,</hi> known af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the Name of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, an account of which take as ſollows,</p>
            <p>It is certain that never any perſon more craftily concealed a proud and aſpiring Mind, with a profound Diſſimulation, than this Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal did: For thô he had in his Youth play'd all thoſe Pranks in little, which after his Advancement to the Holy Chair, made ſome of the greateſt Princes in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to tremble, and had, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, expreſt a moſt haughty and turbulent ſpirit. Yet he was no ſooner promoted to the Purple, and had begun to caſt his eyes upon that mark to which all the deſires and hopes of the Sacred College are continually directed; But inſtead of the <hi>fiery</hi> and arrogant <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retti,</hi> he was preſently transformed into the meek and humble <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto.</hi> Before nothing cou'd make him more proud, than to ſee himſelf admired and envy'd by all Mankind; now the very heighth of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was to become the moſt deſpicable Object of Contempt and Scorn to all the Cardinals. He ſo ſmother'd that vivacity of Spirit which was always uſed to ſparkle in his Diſcourſe and Actions, that now he was become Famous for an Example of a dull and blockiſh ſtupidity. He was naturally of a ſtrong and vigorous Conſtitution, yet he now counterfeited ſo many Diſeaſes and Infirmities of old Age, thô he had ſcarce paſt Threeſcore, that he never appear'd in publick, but he ſeem'd as if he were juſt ſtooping into his Grave. Theſe little Arts of his had that happy Succefs, that to his great Joy he ſoon found that the beſt Titles his Brethren could give him, were thoſe of <hi>A La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> and the Aſs of <hi>La Marca.</hi> Perhaps one born under our dull and <hi>Northern</hi> Climat, may think theſe ſtrange Qualifications, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend one to the Sovereign Pontificat, yet we ſhall find that they only were the cauſe of <hi>Montalto</hi>'s Exaltation.</p>

Upon the Death of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, before the Cardinals enter'd into the <hi>Conclave, Montalto</hi> makes a Viſit to <hi>Farneſe,</hi> Dean of the College, one who had always expreſt the greateſt Contempt imaginable of him. To him he makes a moſt Lamentable Complaint of the Infirmities of his Age, and deſires the favour of him, that he would diſpence with his Appearance at the <hi>Conclave,</hi> if he thought it would laſt long, for the time of his Diſſolution drawing near, he could not expect to live to ſee a new Pope Choſen. <hi>Farneſe</hi> adviſes him not to abandon the Intereſt of the Church, upon an occaſion of ſo great a concern; to which he replies, That if there were any hopes that his Suffrage would be in the leaſt Service able to Holy Church, he would reſolve to meet Death in the <hi>Conclave.</hi> As he was going on in the ſame Cant,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Farneſe</hi> takes him up ſomewhat ſharply, ſaying, <hi>My Lord, I wou'd have you take a little care of your own Concerns too, for I cannot believe but you have as great an Affection to the Holy Chair as another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montalto</hi> ſomething ſurprized at this Reparty, calmly replies, <hi>That the Cardinals muſt neceſſarily be quite blind, if to ſo great a perſon as his Lordſhip they wou'd go to prefer one who had neither Merit nor Experience, nor any thing good in him, beſides an ardent deſire of ſerving his good Friends and Patrons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Diſcourſe he us'd to all the reſt of the Cardinals, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Heads of Factions, and thoſe that had any pretentions to the Papacy; telling every one in particular, <hi>That it would be a great prejudice to the Church if the Government was committed to any other Hands, and that if he had a Hundred Votes they ſhould all be at his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Forty Two Cardinals that compos'd this <hi>Conclave</hi> were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Five Factions; Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> appear'd at the Head of the Firſt; the Second was led by <hi>Eſte;</hi> the Third by <hi>Aleſſandrino;</hi> the Fourth was directed by <hi>Altemps;</hi> and the Fifth, which equal'd them all in Number, was that of <hi>Buon Compagno,</hi> Nephew of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, whoſe Creatures they were. The pretenders were Fourteen; <hi>Farneſe</hi> and <hi>Savelli</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> the Thirds Creation; <hi>Santa Croce Paleotto,</hi> St. <hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Sirlet,</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourths; <hi>Montalto Ceſis,</hi> St. <hi>Sevarina,</hi> and <hi>Albano,</hi> of the promotion of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth; <hi>Fachinetti</hi> commonly called <hi>Santi Quatri; Della Torre, Mondovi,</hi> and <hi>Caſtagna,</hi> Creatures of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97104:6"/>
               <hi>Altemps Medici,</hi> and <hi>Aleſſandrino,</hi> upon the firſt entrance into the <hi>Conclave</hi> had plotted together to make <hi>Ceſis</hi> Pope, and thus they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged their deſign. After the Bulls are read, all the Cardinals have liberty to go out of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> upon condition, <hi>That they return again béfore Night.</hi> This they thought the fitteſt time to put their project in execution, for as ſoon as the Cardinals, who as they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected would exclude <hi>Ceſis,</hi> were gone out, they intended to carry him into the <hi>Paolina,</hi> and there proceed to a Scrutiny, and Elect, and Adore him without any oppoſition. But this was not kept ſo ſecret, but the Cardinal <hi>Di San Siſto,</hi> who had always declared againſt <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> was informed of it at his going out of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> he thereupon immediately returns, and ſends for the reſt that were ingaged in the ſame Intereſt. This unlucky Accident quite broke the meaſures of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> Party, for it made ſo many declare againſt him, that his Favourers durſt never ſo much as mention his Name again in the <hi>Conclave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him <hi>Serlet</hi> was propoſed, <hi>Altemps Medici,</hi> and all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth appeared zealouſly in his behalf, and had certainly ſucceeded, had not <hi>Farneſe, Eſte,</hi> and <hi>Storza,</hi> as ſtifly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them; their reaſon for excluding <hi>Sirlet</hi> was, becauſe he had been excluded once before, for they were reſolv'd never to truſt one whom they had offended. Another cauſe of his Misfortune was, his Familiarity with Cardinal <hi>Como,</hi> who had formerly diſobliged moſt of the Sacred College, whilſt he was Secretary of State to <hi>Pius</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> they therefore now thought fit to take their Revenge upon his Friend. Beſides, <hi>Farneſe</hi> humbly conceived himſelf to be far the better Man of the two, and therefore knew no reaſon why <hi>Sirlet</hi> ſhould be prefer'd before him. <hi>Caſtagna</hi>'s turn came next, but the old Cardinals thought their Honour was concern'd, not to let one of the laſt Promotion get the ſtart of them, and ſo they excluded him, tho' for his Vertue, Learning and Moderation, he was counted a Perſon as Worthy as any to fill the Holy Chair.</p>
            <p>The Perſon next mention'd was <hi>Savelli,</hi> who for his Vertue was eſteem'd not much inferior to the former; but the prodigious number of his Baſtards was feard would be a Charge and Scandal to the Holy See. But <hi>Medici</hi> ſupported him as far as he could with his Credit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Colonna</hi> and <hi>Ceſis, Savelli</hi>'s declared Enemies, told him plainly, that they would abandon his Intereſt, and go over to <hi>Farneſe,</hi> if he perſiſted; <hi>Medici</hi> thereupon thought it more convenient to forſake his Friend; then cauſe a Rebellion amongſt his Creatures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97104:7"/>
give <hi>Farneſe,</hi> for whom he had no great Affection, an occaſion of becoming Maſter of the Election.</p>
            <p>By this time ſeveral Intrigues were on foot in behalf of <hi>Della Torre,</hi> who was then abſent from <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Farneſe</hi> and <hi>San Siſto,</hi> who expected him every Hour, did what they could to protract the time till he came; they had laid a Deſign, that when he entered the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, they and their whole Party ſhould meet and receive him at the Door, and Crying out, <hi>Long Live the Pope,</hi> carry him to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and there fall to Adoration. Thinking, not without reaſon, that it was impoſſible for any Cardinal to have the Courage to oppoſe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Medici</hi> being informed of their contrivance, was not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted thereat, for he ſaw plainly, that ſhould <hi>Della Torre</hi> be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Pope, <hi>Farneſe</hi> having ſo much Influence over him, muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engroſs all the power to himſelf, and conſequently would cauſe ſuch a Number of Cardinals to be made, who being wholly at his Devotion, ſhould Elect him if he ſurviv'd the Pope, as in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability he would, he being the Younger, and more Healthy of the Two.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations ſet <hi>Medici</hi>'s Wits at work, but not being able to find amongſt his own Friends a ſufficient number to form an Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he began to grow deſperate, till at laſt he perceived, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſlandrino</hi> and <hi>Eſte</hi> were practiſing under-hand in <hi>Montalto</hi>'s Favour; the former, becauſe he was a Creature of <hi>Pius</hi> the Fifth, his Uncle; the other, engaged thereto by <hi>Ruſticucci,</hi> who had great Influence over him. To theſe <hi>Medici,</hi> to rid himſelf of the fear of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> makes ſecret propoſals of a Union; offering his own and Friends Votes for <hi>Montalto.</hi> This Motion was readily received, and agreed to. <hi>Medici</hi> had Credit in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was ſure of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction. <hi>Aleſſandrino</hi> had many Friends amongſt them, and <hi>Eſte</hi> was Chief of the <hi>French</hi> Faction; ſo that now both Crowns agreed in the Choice of one Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montalto</hi> all this while kept himſelf cloſe in his Chamber, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that there was ſo little Notice taken of him, that he ſeemd to be abandond and forgotten by all Mankind. He ſeldom came out, except it were to Maſs, or into the <hi>Paolina,</hi> to aſſiſt at the Scrutinies, but he ſeemd ſo little concernd at the Intrigues there, that he was thought not ſo much as to mind what he was doing. But he knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well that nothing could better advance his own Affairs, than this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97104:7"/>
ſeeming neglect of them; nor indeed was he leſs Induſtrious than thoſe who make the greateſt noiſe and ſtir, when ever he met with any of <hi>Buon Compagno</hi>'s Party, he would ſay, <hi>That the Cardinals ought to make choice of one that was agreeable to him, the Sacred College owing that Deference to the memory of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, who had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd the Church with ſo much Zeal and Charity.</hi> When he had any occaſion to ſpeak to a Friend of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> he Launched out in his praiſe, ſaying withal, <hi>That he was Aſtoniſh'd, and could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the meaning of People that he was not yet Choſen.</hi> To thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon <hi>Medici,</hi> he ſpoke of him, <hi>As one of the greateſt Deſerts in the whole College.</hi> In ſhort, he always took an occaſion to ſpeak well of every Body, but would never want a Panegyrick for thoſe whom he thought either his Enemies, or to have any Credit or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the <hi>Conclave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aleſſandrino, Medici</hi> and <hi>Eſte,</hi> having made the League we have ſpoken of amongſt themſelves, came privately to <hi>Montalto</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to inform him thereof. <hi>Aleſſandrino</hi> ſpeaking in the name of the reſt, <hi>Bids him be of good Courage, for they were come to bring him the good News of their Reſolution to make him Pope;</hi> which he no ſooner heard, but he fell a Coughing, as if he were ready to give up the Ghoſt; as ſoon as he found himſelf able to ſpeak, he told them, <hi>That if that were their Intention, God knows his Reign could be but ſhort, ſince Life it ſelf was a Burthen to him; and conſequently the Cares of the Church would be much too heavy for him to bear, without a great deal of Succors and Aſſiſtance.</hi> The Cardinals told him, <hi>That God without doubt would give him Force ſufficient to Govern his Church.</hi> But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his Diſcourſe, told them, <hi>That he was reſolv'd never to accept of the Papacy, of which his want of Experience renderd him <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy, unleſs they would promiſe him before hand to take upon them the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Conjointly with him, for he could not in Conſcience undertake it alone. Medici</hi> told him, <hi>That they would take care that he ſhould not want Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Ay,</hi> ſays he, (after ſome time ſpent in ſpitting and ſpawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) <hi>if you make me Pope, you will do the ſame as if you placed your ſelves in the Chair, we ſhall divide the Pontificat bewixt us; I will have the Name and Title; I will be Pope in appearance, and you ſhall have the Power and Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing could give greater Encouragement to theſe young Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to proſecute the Enterprize they had undertaken, than the ſly Old Man's Diſcourſe, who now thought they had gotten a Pope after
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97104:8"/>
their own Heart. And as ſoon as they had parted from him, began to reckon amongſt themſelves the great Advantages they ſhould make of a ſilly Old Coxcomb, that had neither Senſe nor Underſtanding; who had, as they vainly imagin'd to themſelves, ſo fully diſcover'd the great weakneſs both of his Body and Mind. They promiſed to themſelves nothing leſs than an Abſolute Power both in Church and State, <hi>For how can he,</hi> ſay they, <hi>undertake to concern himſelf in any Buſineſs of Moment when Pope, who whilſt a Cardinal was content to be led by the Noſe by others; and to whom ſhould he commit the Government of himſelf, and the Care of all things, but to them who had raiſed him? as for his Nephews they were born and bred rather to manage the Plow, than State-Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They ſo far pleas'd themſelves with this Fancy, that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd no Obſtacles ſhould retard their deſign. <hi>Medici</hi> neglected the Honour of his Family, which upon ſome private Diſguſts was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged againſt <hi>Montalto: Aleſſandrino</hi> deſerted his Old Friend <hi>Albano,</hi> who beſides his Perſonal Merits had obliged him by all the ties of Gratitude to his Intereſt, and was particularly recommended to him by his Uncle on his Death-Bed. But he put them them off who ſpoke in his behalf upon the account of his Merits, by telling them, <hi>That he was too Wiſe a Man for the Papal Chair, ſince the</hi> Spaniards <hi>would never conſent to the Election of one who was no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of a far more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> But they were both now content to Sacrifice their Honour to their Ambition, yet they repented of what they had done, before they went out of the Conclave.</p>
            <p>But at preſent they thought every hour, before they had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed their Deſign, a year of their Reign loſt, <hi>Montalto</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recommended by them in all haſte to the reſt of the Cardinals, as one of a quiet, peaceable, and obliging Temper, of a good and eaſie Nature, and one who had a Kindneſs for all the World, and wou'd give diſturbance to no Body. And, in ſhort, that had all the good Qualities that were requiſite in ſuch a Pope as they deſired. I ſhall not ſtay to recount all the little Arts which they uſed to gain over to their Party every one in particular, their chief Intrigues being level'd at the Heads of Factions. <hi>San Siſto</hi> had the whole Creation of <hi>Gregory</hi> V. under him, and had already engaged himſelf to <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe.</hi> In the firſt place they thought it moſt convenient to debauch ſome of his Followers, in which having ſucceeded, by letting them know how their Intereſt lay that way, they began to make their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97104:8"/>
upon him. But the greateſt Obſtacle was, <hi>Gregory San Siſto</hi>'s Uncle had diſobliged <hi>Montalto,</hi> by taking away the Penſion that had been aſſign'd to the poor Cardinals, of which number he was one, notwithſtanding that a little before he had dedicated his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to him, upon which account <hi>San Siſto</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt ſome fear of <hi>Montalto</hi>'s Reſentment. To remove which diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty they made uſe of his Confident Cardinal <hi>Riario,</hi> who being ſick of the Gout at that time, order'd himſelf to be carried to <hi>San Siſto</hi>'s Chamber, to whom, with a great deal of ſeeming Concern, he ſaid, <hi>That the Faction of</hi> Montalto <hi>was grown ſo powerful, and his Election ſo far advanced, that he wou'd Infallibly be Choſen; ſo that it was but Time loſt to endeavor to retard a thing which wou'd ſucceed, to the Confuſion of all thoſe that oppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It was not a ſmall Surprize to <hi>San Siſto</hi> to hear this Diſcourſe, but his Aſtoniſhment was much encreas'd, when <hi>Riario</hi> had ſcarce taken his Leave, but in comes <hi>Guaſtavillano,</hi> another of his Creatures, (the Buſineſs having b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>During all theſe Intrigues, <hi>Montalto</hi> continued ſtill quiet in his Cell, without diſcovering that he had the leaſt thoughts of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When thoſe that manag'd for him came to give him an account how things paſt, his general Anſwer was, <hi>That if the Difficulties in the</hi> Conclave <hi>ſeemed great, what were they to expect in the</hi> Vatican? <hi>He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured them therefore never to entertain any Thoughts of chuſing him except they would firſt promiſe him to take upon themſelves the whole Government of the Church.</hi> Had this been ſpoken by any other perſon, the Cheat muſt certainly have been diſcovered, but he acted his part ſo well, his words exactly correſponding with his actions, that what would create a ſuſpition of Affectation in others, only ſerved to increaſe the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion every one had of his pure and natural ſimplicity.</p>
            <p>But thô he ſeem'd thus retired from all the World, yet as he wou'd never let ſlip any opportunity of cringing to, and fawning upon all the Chiefs of the Factions, he wou'd ever be telling of the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations he had to Cardinal <hi>Aleſſandrino,</hi> and ſay, <hi>That if he were Lord of many Worlds, he ſhou'd never be able to repay the Favors he had receiv'd</hi>

When he made his Court to thoſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, he wou'd be ſure to look and talk as ſillily as he cou'd poſſibly, and this gain'd the very Hearts and Souls of them: For they knew very well that their Maſter hated nothing more, than to ſee a Man of Senſe placed in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, for fear leſt he ſhou'd prove a bad Neighbour to his Dominions in <hi>Italy:</hi> But as for <hi>Montalto,</hi> they took care to publiſh that he had the greateſt reſpect imaginable for him.</p>
            <p>One day <hi>Montalto</hi> making a Viſit to Cardinal <hi>Altemps,</hi> told him, <hi>That he was ſo much obliged to him, and the Marquis his Son, that he was reſolv'd entirely to devote himſelf to their ſervice, and ſhou'd be proud of having an occaſion to acknowledge his Lordſhip as his only Benefactor and Maker of his Fortunes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Altemps</hi> was ſo tickled with the Compliment, that he preſently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>That if it lay in his power, he might aſſure himſelf of being Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montalto,</hi> upon this, calls God to witneſs, <hi>That he had no Ambition of ſo eminent a Dignity of which he knew himſelf both incapable and unworthy: But if he ſhou'd be upon any account induced to deſire it, it was only that it might be in his power to give a Teſtimony to the World of the profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Eſteem he had for his Friends, but more particularly for his moſt Illuſtrious Lordſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Diſcourſe he uſed to <hi>Madruzzo,</hi> who had his Catholick Majeſties Inſtructions at this <hi>Conclave,</hi> and indeed to every one whom he thought any way able to be ſerviceable to him.</p>
            <p>The time being come when they were to proceed to the <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> and all the Cardinals having taken their places in the <hi>Paolina</hi> for that purpoſe, whilſt the Bulls of Cardinal <hi>di Vercelli</hi> were a reading, he being newly come into the <hi>Conclave, Aleſſandrino,</hi> upon a Sign given him by <hi>Eſté,</hi> taking <hi>San Siſto</hi> aſide out of the Chappel, <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſays he, Altemps <hi>and</hi> Medici <hi>have reſolved that</hi> Montalto <hi>ſhall be choſen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, our Friends have generally concur'd with them, ſo that the buſineſs is as good as done already, only we have forborn to put the laſt hand to it, out of the reſpect we bear to you. We have left it in your power to chuſe whether you will oblige the new Pope ever to acknowledge you the Author of his Greatneſs, or have the diſpleaſure of ſeeing one made againſt your Will and Conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>San Siſto</hi> conſidering this Diſcourſe, and recollecting what had been before told him by <hi>Riario</hi> and <hi>Guaſtavillano,</hi> began to forget his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97104:9"/>
with <hi>Farneſe,</hi> and promiſe he had made never to give his Vote for any one without his advice and concurrence; whereupon he ſends for all his Creatures, to conſult with them what was beſt to be done upon this occaſion. A great part of them had already engaged themſelves for <hi>Montalto,</hi> who were not now wanting to recommend him to their Patron as the fitteſt perſon to fill St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, the reſt ſeeing his party ſo powerful, durſt not ſo much as open their lips againſt him.</p>
            <p>Every one wondred that <hi>Farneſe</hi> the Dean of the College, one of a working Head, and great Experience in the Intrigues of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> did not more vigorouſly oppoſe one whom he had hitherto declared againſt, and had always treated with the greateſt contempt and ſcorn; but he relied upon <hi>San Siſto</hi>'s promiſe, who, if he had continued firm, had certainly together with him excluded <hi>Montalto.</hi> It was from this ſecurity of his that the adverſe party made their greateſt advantage. Beſides, the mean opinion he always entertained of <hi>Montalto,</hi> made him the more negligent in oppoſing him; he thought it impoſſible for one of ſuch a cadaverous Look, ſhould trouble him many days: And that his ſimplicity was ſuch, that there was no fear of his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it ſeemed indifferent therefore to him whether ſuch a ſtupid and wretched Creature was made Pope, or continued Cardinal. Wherefore when he asked <hi>San Siſto, Why he conſented to this Election?</hi> and was told by him, <hi>that it was becauſe the perſon was of a calm and eaſie Nature, under whom they ſhould enjoy all the Liberty they deſired.</hi> He returned Anſwer, <hi>That he was much in the right on't, for</hi> Montalto <hi>was one that had not Wit enough to do any Miſchief, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding to do any Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>San Siſto</hi> having felt the pulſe of his Creatures, thought it now his beſt policy to agree to their Sentiments, and ſeem as forward as he could in declaring for <hi>Montalto,</hi> putting himſelf therefore at the head of them, he enters the Chappels, where whilſt ſome were propoſing a <hi>Scrutiny,</hi> he, to enhance his Merits, joining himſelf with <hi>Aleſſandrino,</hi> goes immediately to <hi>Montalto,</hi> whom theſe both Compliment, by cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>The Pope, The Pope.</hi> The greateſt part of the College ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded what they had done, and approved of it, by imitating their Example. But the Dean <hi>Farneſe</hi> not liking this Tumultuary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, order'd them all to their places again in order, to proceed in a regular manner to the <hi>Scrutiny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97104:10"/>
               <hi>Montalto</hi> hereupon ſliſly whiſpers <hi>San Siſto,</hi> deſiring him to ſee that it may be done without prejudice to the <hi>Adoration</hi> already performed, which made both him and <hi>Aleſſandrino</hi> cry out twice, <hi>Without prejudice to the</hi> Adoration.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Montalto</hi> perceived that above half the Votes were for him, without ſtaying till the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> was ended, leaps out of his Seat, throws away his Staff, that had hitherto ſupported him inſtead of a Crutch, into the middle of the place, and begins to ſtretch out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, inſomuch that he ſoon appeared half as big again as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: But that which was moſt ſurprizing, he fetches ſuch a luſty Hem, that a young Man of Thirty could ſcarce reach. We may well think that the Cardinals were ſtartled at this ſudden Alteration. The old Dean began immediately to ſee Repentance in the Countenances of <hi>Aleſſandrino</hi> and <hi>San Siſto,</hi> faid aloud, <hi>Let us not go too faſt, there is an Error in the</hi> Scrutiny. But <hi>Montalto</hi> knowing that the time was now come wherein he might ſpeak for himſelf, reſolutely told him, <hi>That the</hi> Scrutiny <hi>was good, and according to Form.</hi> And a little after, he that within an hour or two had ſcarce ſtrength ſufficient to enable him to Cough, Roared out the <hi>Te Deum</hi> with ſuch a thundring Voice, that the Roof of the Chappel began to ſhake.</p>
            <p>As he was kneeling before the Altar, according to the Cuſtom to make a ſmall Ejaculation, the Maſter of the Ceremonies obſerving the uſual Formalities, asked, <hi>If he accepted of the Papal Dignity?</hi> He putting on a Grave and Majeſtick Countenance, anſwer'd, <hi>That he had received one Popedom already, which conſequently he could not accept of again: But if they had another to give him, he was ready for it; for, Thanks be to God, his ſhoulders were ſtrong enough to bear double the weight of what was yet put upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Farneſe,</hi> as well as the reſt of the Cardinals hearing theſe words, turned to <hi>Santa Sevarina,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>They thought they had placed an Ideot in</hi> St. Peter<hi>'s Chair, but now I perceive we have gotten a Pope who will make Fools and Aſſes of us. Santa Sevarina</hi> ſhrugged his ſhoulders, but could return no other Anſwer, than <hi>the Lord have mercy upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Maſters of the Ceremonies were putting on his Pontifical Robes, he, as if he were weary of that formal and decrepid poſture which he had ſo long kept himſelf in, ſtretch'd out his Limbs with that Vigor as aſtoniſhed all the Beholders. <hi>Ruſticucci</hi> hereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming upon his former Familiarity, ſaid to him, <hi>Holy Father, I perceive the Holy Chair contains a Sovereign Remedy for all Diſtempers, ſince it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores</hi>

               <hi>Health, and Youth to Old and Infirm Cardinals.</hi> To which he ſcrewing up his Face as formerly as he could, replyed, <hi>I Feel it.</hi> When <hi>Medici</hi> told him, <hi>That he ſeemd now to have different Mine and Air from what he had whilſt a Cardinal. I was looking then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for the Keys of Paradice, and therefore held down my Head, but now I have found them I lift up my Eyes to Heaven, having nothing elſe to ſeek for on Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was no unpleaſant ſight to <hi>Farneſe,</hi> when he beheld <hi>Eſte, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi> and <hi>Aleſſandrino,</hi> inſtead of expreſſing their Joy for having a Pope of their own Creation, look very Melancholy upon it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid to <hi>Sforza,</hi> as he was going out of the Conclave, <hi>That</hi> Charles <hi>the Fifth having Abdicated the Empire in the Morning, repented of what he had done before Night, which I believe continues he, thoſe Three Cardinals are not to begin to do now. I ſhall count them happy,</hi> replys <hi>Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, if their Repentance laſt no longer than that Emperor's did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As ſoon as <hi>Siſto Quinto,</hi> for ſo <hi>Montalto</hi> had ſtiled himſelf, was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Lodgings prepared for him as Pope, he could not reſt till he had found an opportunity of letting thoſe that had Advanced him know how he was reſolved to bank their Expectations, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Commands, <hi>That the Cardinals,</hi> Aleſſandrino, Medici, Ruſticucci, Eſte, San Siſto, AItemps, <hi>be invited to Sup with him.</hi> But here I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Omit a Story that they tell of him, to make us the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Change that was made in him, His <hi>Maeſtro di Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi> according to his conſtant cuſtom, while he was Cardinal, came and Asked him, <hi>What he would be pleaſed to have to Supper.</hi> He putting on ſuch a Stern Countenance as ſeemd to reprove the Fellows Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, replyed, <hi>Is this a Queſtion to be asked a Soveraign Prince? Go,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues he, <hi>and provide me a Magnificent and Royal Entertainment, out of which I ſhall chuſe what pleaſes me beſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinals that were Invited being all come, except <hi>Eſte,</hi> who ſuſpecting the Entertainment they were like to have, excuſed himſelf, <hi>Aleſſandrino</hi> ſeeing the Pope ſtirring about buſily, began to wonder that he had not taken any Repoſe after that Days Fatigue. But he told him, <hi>That Buſineſs was his chief Repoſe. But Your Holineſs,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys <hi>Aleſſandrino</hi> ſomething too familiarly, <hi>did not ſeem to have ſo much ſtrength Yeſterday, nor the Day before.</hi> He ſmartly taking him up, Anſwered, <hi>Yeſterday and the Day before I was not Pope, but now I am. Ruſticucci</hi> ſeeing ſome of his Robes not ſit as they ſhould, began to put them in Order, but he told them, <hi>That it did not become him to be</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:97104:11"/>
               <hi>ſo Familiar with the Pope.</hi> But theſe Two Cardinals who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelves ſo much Authority, could not yet contain from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But as they were giving Orders for what they thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent about the Popes Apartment, <hi>His Holineſs,</hi> very ſeriouſly, <hi>deſired them not to put themſelves to ſo much trouble, for he being Maſter there, would take care to Command things to be done according to his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they were ſat down to the Table, he preſently began in a long Diſcourſe to Preach to them concerning the Power that Chriſt had given to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in making him his Vicar upon Earth, He often repeating, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I Build my Church;</hi> upon which words he would ſay, <hi>How profound are the Judgments of God! Jeſus Chriſt has left upon Earth but one</hi> Peter, <hi>one Sovereign Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife, one Onely Vicar, one Head; To him only has he entruſted the Care of his Flock; Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>that is, Thou only art the High-prieſt, to Thee will I give the Keys of Heaven.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt have an Abſolute Power over all things, without Exception, to Bind and to Looſe. It is to Thee only, to Thee alone, that have given Power and Authority to Govern my Church; to Thee that art my Vicar, and not unto others that are thy Inferiors and Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was no hard matter for the Cardinals to comprehend the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all this. They plainly ſaw that his Diſcourſe was only le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veld at thoſe Caſtles in the Air which they had been ſo long Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but that which Mortified them the moſt, they were forced to let him, run on without daring to give him the leaſt Interruption; for if any did but offer to Mutter, he was ſure to give him a ſevere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand, and put him in mind of his Diſtance. At laſt <hi>Ruſticucci,</hi> ſomething bolder than the reſt, ventur'd to ſay, <hi>It is a great ſurprize to me,</hi> Moſt Holy Father, <hi>when I conſider, that you often uſed to ſay in the</hi> Conclave, <hi>That it was impoſſible for you to Govern the Church without Aſſiſtance, but now your Diſcourſe tends the quite contrary way. You ſay true,</hi> (Anſwers <hi>Siſto</hi> very gravely,) <hi>but I ſaid it then, becauſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd ſo; but to Day God has endued me with ſo much ſtrength, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve no ſuch thing.</hi> With this Compliment he diſmiſs'd them. And now I ſhall take my leave of him, being afraid that I have ſtraid too far from my Subject, my Title Page informing me, that I have no buſineſs at preſent out of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> I ſhall therefore now give the Reader an Account of what paſſed in it at the Election of <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth.</p>

The Sacred College was at that time divided into Three Principal Factions. The Firſt of which was the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> whereof <hi>Madruzzo</hi> was the Leader. His Catholick Majeſty had Nominated Five to them, out of which they were to procure the Election of one, <hi>Viz. Colonna, Como, Paliotto, Santa Sevarina,</hi> and <hi>Madruzzo</hi> himſelf. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Sevarina</hi> was the Man who in outward appearance ſtood the faireſt in the Opinion of this Party, tho' it was not doubted but many of them had By-Ends of their own, which ſubdivided them into many petty Factions, one whereof favoured <hi>Madruzzo,</hi> who ſecretly aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Papal Dignity himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Second Faction was of thoſe who were Creatures of <hi>Siſto Quinto,</hi> and conſequently were obliged, by what they call Honour and Gratitude at <hi>Rome,</hi> blindly to ſubmit themſelves to the Conduct of <hi>Montalto</hi> his Nephew, who, tho' he had in a former <hi>Conclave</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly oppoſed the Exaltation of <hi>Santa Sevarina,</hi> yet now contrary to the Maxims of his Nation, he appeared as ſtoutly in his behalf, and join'd Forces with the <hi>Spaniards, Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Florentines.</hi> It is uncertain whether he did this the better to make his Court to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Great Duke, who tho' of different Intereſts, yet both appeared Zealouſly in the behalf of <hi>Santa Sevarina,</hi> or elſe to ingratiate himſelf with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction; ſo that if the Perſon they had pitch'd upon fail'd, one of his Creatures might ſerve.</p>
            <p>The Third Party was that of the Creatures of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, who tho' at firſt deſpicable, upon the account of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Number, being no more than Fifteen againſt Thirty Seven, yet by their Courage and Conduct, and firm Adherence to one another, we ſhall find them perform Miracles in the <hi>Conclave.</hi> It is requiſite, for the better underſtanding of the ſubſequent Relation, that I here give the Reader a Liſt of the Names of theſe Perſons who have ſo far ſignaliz'd themſelves. They were <hi>Arragona,</hi> Old <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Paleotto, Como, Altemps, Canano, Mondovi, Lancidotto, Aſcoli, Sforza, Sfondrati, Pallavicino, Boromeo, Aquaviva,</hi> and <hi>Platta.</hi> But here we muſt take notice that young <hi>Colonna,</hi> who was of the Adverſe Party, had promis'd his Uncle, that at any time when he could inveſt him in, or deprive him of the Papacy, he would decline his Vote for <hi>Santa Sevarina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This little Party being Exaſperated at the Bravado of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who publickly gave out, that they had the Papacy in their Hands, bound themſelves under a ſolemn Oath to uſe their utmoſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97104:12"/>
endeavors to work the Excluſion of <hi>Santa Severina.</hi> This Enterprize ſeem'd to every Body elſe almoſt impoſſible to ſucceed, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd that nothing ſhould diſcourage them in their Reſolution; and in order to effect their deſign, they were not wanting to inform the Cardinals of the great Severity of <hi>Santa Severina</hi>'s Life, a Topick which they, not without reaſon, thought would Create an extream Averſion to him in the Minds of the Sacred College. They likewiſe did what they could to raiſe Jealouſies betwixt him and <hi>Montalto,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Florentines.</hi> They thought to take off <hi>Montalto</hi> by telling him how he would advance his Glory and Intereſt, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of one of his own Creatures. The ſame Arguments were uſed to Debauch <hi>Madruzzo.</hi> They told the other Competitors how eaſie a matter it was to attain their Deſires by their Aſſiſtance, which ſhould never be wanting to them. We may well imagine by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that theſe Inſinuations were ſwallow'd by moſt of them, tho' for the preſent every one was afraid to let his Sentiments be known, leſt he ſhould be found ſingular.</p>
            <p>Thus were the Minds of the Cardinals diſpos'd when they entered the <hi>Conclave,</hi> after the Preliminary Ceremonies were perform'd, it was the Opinion of <hi>Montalto,</hi> and the Wiſeſt of <hi>Santa Severina</hi>'s Party, that they ſhould attempt his Adoration the firſt Night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving time to thoſe of their own ſide to cool, or their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to work upon them. If this Advice had been follow'd, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had certainly been done that Night, conſidering the Heat, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and Darkneſs, they were then in, whilſt every one Jealous of his Neighbour, would think, ſhould he refuſe to comply, that he thereby markt out himſelf as the only Object of the future Popes Indignation. But this was an Enterpriſe too haſtily laid for the more Staid and Politick <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, who by ſtaying in the <hi>Conclave</hi> till 'twas late in the Night, taking his Wiſe and Impertinent Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with the Graver ſort of Cardinals of his Party, let ſo fair an opportunity ſlip.</p>
            <p>The Night was employd by <hi>Madruzzo, Spinola</hi> and <hi>Montalto,</hi> in encouraging and confirming their ſeveral Adherents. Early in the Morning they Muſter up all their Forces and March to <hi>Santa Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Cell, at the Head of them; whom they Salute and Honour as Pope, from hence they Conduct him to the Chappel <hi>Paolina</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Ceremony of Adoration. Here it was no unpleaſant ſight to ſee what a Buſtle and Clutter their Eminencies made, in ſtriving
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97104:12"/>
who ſhould appear moſt Officious at his Exaltation. Young <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Colonna</hi> ſhew'd himſelf as Induſtrions as any Man. Old <hi>Greſualdi</hi> the Dean, who could not run as faſt as the others, coming laſt into the Chappel, was ſain to make the moſt wretched Grimaces, that a little Joy might appear in his Countenance.</p>
            <p>We may well imagine the ſad Condition the poor Excludents were in at this time. But nothing could quite caſt down their Courage, they reſolving to beſtir themſelves to the laſt. Time would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to make any Congregation among themſelves, leſt whilſt they were conſulting, their Adverſaries ſhould make the Pope; all that they could now do, was to Order, that none of their Party ſhould go into the <hi>Paolina,</hi> leſt he ſhould be tempted to comply, or unadviſedly do ſomething that might be interpreted a Conſent, but that all ſhould do their utmoſt amongſt their Friends and Relations to gain one Vote only, or, at leaſt, to prevail that it might be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arragona Colonna,</hi> and <hi>Altemps,</hi> tho' ſick of the Gout, Orderd themſelves to be carried into the Hall, hoping by their preſence to prevail with ſome one perſon. Here they had the Mortification, to behold all things carried according to the deſire of their Enemies. <hi>Altemps</hi> was preſently Aſſaulted by the Cardinal <hi>Del Monti,</hi> who with a Gay Countenance told him, <hi>That by the direction of the Holy Ghoſt they were going to Adore</hi> Santa Sevarina, <hi>and deſired his Concurrence, that the Honour and Merit of ſo great an Action might be attributed wholly to him. Altemps</hi> who before was in a very ſurly Humour, now in great Rage and Fury told him, <hi>That he ſcorn'd his Advice, and bid him go Worſhip the Devils, Pope himſelf, if he pleas'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Sſorza, Sfondrato, Boromeo,</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva,</hi> were not idle, but were continually tampering with as many as they could lay hold on, but all to no purpoſe; <hi>Sfondrato</hi> and <hi>Boromeo</hi> at laſt faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on <hi>La Rovere,</hi> who as yet continued in his Chamber. Him they thought to gain over to their ſide, by putting him in hopes of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> for himſelf; but <hi>Montalto</hi> and <hi>Mattei</hi> ſoon got him out of their hands, and carried him in Triumph with them thrô the Hall to the <hi>Paolina.</hi> This Sight put poor <hi>Altemps</hi> out of all patience, inſomuch that he could not forbear treating the Reverend Old Man with the moſt ſpiteful and virulent Language.</p>
            <p>The Cardinals in the Chappel were now all ready to proceed to the <hi>Adoration,</hi> their <hi>Antagoniſts,</hi> to leave nothing unattempted, ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97104:13"/>
the Door, endeavouring to diſturb and diſtract their Minds, by raiſing what Confuſion they could amongſt them. Their Malice had its deſired ſucceſs, for as the others were juſt going to worſhip <hi>Santa Severina, Sforza</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva</hi> began to bawl out, <hi>That they neither ought, nor could proceed any further without a</hi> Scrutiny, ſaying, <hi>They were not ſure they had a competent Number to complete the</hi> Adoration; <hi>And that if they came to an Election contrary to the accuſtomed manner, they were reſolved to proteſt againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon there was ſuch a Hubbub and Tumult rais'd in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that nothing could be ſeen in it but Confuſion and Diſorder. Some cryed there was no Notice to be taken of any ſuch <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> ſome were for, others againſt, the coming to a <hi>Scrutiny.</hi> Some ſaid that the Votes were not to be gather'd before the <hi>Adoration,</hi> others that it was altogether needleſs. But the Dean, to prevent all Objections, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors to appeaſe the raging of this giddy-headed Rabble, and ſets about the gathering of the Votes himſelf. This he attempted ſeveral times, but never could reckon above Four, but ſome impertinent Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal or other would be always interrupting and confounding him.</p>
            <p>They within perceiving at laſt that all this Stupefaction proceeded from the Excludents, who ſtood at the Chappel door, doing all the miſchief they could, ordered the door to be ſhut, which was oppoſed by <hi>Sforza</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva;</hi> whereupon they had like to have fallen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Ears. At laſt, the Secretaries of the College, and Maſters of the Ceremonies were ordered to number the Voices, but ſuch was the Diſorder amongſt them, that they bungled more at it than the Old Dean did; hereupon ſeveral Cardinals undertook this difficult Task, and by their medling with it, made it ten times more intricate than ever. It is a ſtrange thing that theſe profound Maſters of the moſt refin'd Politicks in the World, ſhould be thus brought to their Wits end, they knew not how nor for what. We ſee here poor <hi>Santa Severina</hi> fail'd of becoming St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Infallible Succeſſor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they that were to make him ſo, were not able to count Thirty ſix. Hereticks will take this for an odd ſort of a Reaſon, why <hi>Holy Church</hi> ſhould continue for ſome conſiderable time without Her ſo much boaſted of Supreme and Unerring Judge. Had the <hi>Conclave</hi> been made up of our <hi>Goathamitiſh</hi> Sages, the Buſineſs had been by this time effected: For allowing any one of them not to count himſelf, yet there remained Thirty five ſtill, which made up two Thirds of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97104:13"/>
the Cardinals, and conſequently was a ſufficient Number to make a Pope.</p>
            <p>But that which was ſtill more ſtrange, the Excludents well knowing how many were in the <hi>Paolina,</hi> and moſt of them beginning now to think of yielding, and to curry Favour with the New Elected Pope, as they thought <hi>Santa Sevarina</hi> muſt neceſſarily be; <hi>Aquaviva</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute thô in a defperate Cauſe, ſends his <hi>Conclaviſt</hi> into the <hi>Paolina,</hi> to number the Cardinals that were there, who, as if it were Fatal to all perſons to blunder that day, brought him word that there were but Thirty four, thô nothing is more certain than that there were Thirty ſix preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aquaviva</hi> ſuſpecting ſome miſtake, ſends him again on the ſame Errand, and he returns with the ſame Anſwer. This News put new Life into the Excludents, who began to aſſault the reſt afreſh, but all to no purpoſe, till old <hi>Colonna</hi> bethought himſelf of the promiſe his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew had made, who ſends a Note to him by his <hi>Conclaviſt,</hi> to put him in mind of it, charging him withal to come out, leſt by his ſtay there he ſhould be the Ruine and Confuſion of his whole Family, and beſt Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſcanio</hi> took ſome time to conſider of this Meſſage, but at laſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was in his power to make <hi>Santa Sevarina</hi> Pope, or hinder him from it, reſolves to go out; what pulling and haling there was at the door by each Party to keep him in, and get him out, was to be ſeen by his Robes, which were torn in pieces.</p>
            <p>How agreeable his Deſertion was to the Excludents, ſoon appeard in Old <hi>Colonna</hi>'s Face, who could not chuſe but Weep for Joy at the ſight of him; but this laſted not long, for thoſe in the Chappel, now grown more Cautious, Orderd the Door to be ſhut, intending to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed immediately in a more regular manner to the Scrutiny; for which they had Votes enough ſtill left, for the Perſon concern'd may give his Vote for himſelf, tho' he cannot Adore. But <hi>Altemps</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to take heart again, and turning to the Young Cardinals, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to make a Vigorous Aſſault upon the Door. Whereupon <hi>Sforza, Aquaviva, Boromeo,</hi> and <hi>Sfondrato,</hi> began to ſtorm with ſo great a Noiſe and Clamour, that they forced it to be opened. They within deſire a Parley, and ſend <hi>Greſualdi</hi> and <hi>Madruzzo</hi> to Treat with the Excludents, but it was impoſſible for them to come to any agreement, for both Parties pretended to an equal ſhare of Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Holy Ghoſt, only it is thought that the Truſtees had
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97104:14"/>
ſome under-hand-dealing with the Excludents in their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p>But they returning without effecting any thing, they were ſent about the Includents, after a long Debate, reſolv'd to proceed to the Scrutiny, Maſs was Ordered to be Celebrated, and the Cardinals to prepare to receive the Communion according to Cuſtom, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Party were ſent to, and deſired to join with them, which they fearing ſome Trap might be laid for them, refus'd, and receiv'd the Euchariſt by themſelves in the Chappel of <hi>Siſto</hi> from the Hands of <hi>Sfondrato,</hi> which being perform'd on both ſides, <hi>Sforza</hi> and <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viva</hi> were deputed by the Excludents to go into the <hi>Paolina</hi> to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how things were managed at the Scrutiny. In the mean time <hi>Gaetano</hi> goes to <hi>Canano</hi>'s Chamber, where he found him ſick of the Gout, or at leaſt pretending himſelf ſo, <hi>Gaetano</hi> uſes all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he can to allure him to his Party, by telling him, <hi>What a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious and Heroical Act it would be for him to make</hi> Santa Sevarina <hi>Pope.</hi> But he having ſome ſmall pretentions for himſelf refus'd to go, or be carried out, upon pretence of the great pain that was in one of his Toes, tho' it was evident that it lay more in his Head, than in his Feet. <hi>Santa Sevarina</hi>'s Conclaviſt ſomething more ſubtle than the reſt, came a little while after to him, and with a ſeeming Joy told him, <hi>That his Maſter was Elected Pope, and deſired to ſee him.</hi> But the Crafty Old Fox was not to be caught with a Banter, but told the Conclaviſt, <hi>That he would take time to conſider of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding his, and his Aſſociates refuſal to comply, <hi>Santa Sevarina</hi> had ſtill a ſufficient Number of Votes to complete his Election, of which he ſeemd ſo ſecure, that he began to declare how he would forgive all thoſe that had oppos'd him; and in Teſtimony thereof, he gave out, <hi>That it was his deſign to take upon him the Name of</hi> Clement.</p>
            <p>All things were now ready for the Scrutiny, and ſince the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Santa Sevarina</hi> had already given their Votes for him, by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting him Pope, and carrying him from his Cell to the <hi>Paolina</hi> to Adore him, it was thought fit that the Votes ſhould be given pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly; for thereby it was ſuppoſed, that none durſt refuſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which he had given for ſo many Hours together. This put <hi>Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> and <hi>Aquaviva</hi> to their laſt Shifts, who now plainly ſaw, that without ſome Bold and Deſperate Reſolution their Ruin was unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. They therefose very Impudently affirm'd, <hi>That this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:97104:14"/>
               <hi>was contrary to all the ancient Cuſtoms and Liberties of the Sacred College; and that if the</hi> Scrutiny <hi>was not made ſecretly, they would proteſt againſt the Election, commanding the Maſters of the Ceremonies to take Notice of this their Proteſtation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One may well wonder at their Confidence, in putting ſuch a Sham upon the Sacred College, there never having been any Bull which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the <hi>Scrutiny</hi> to be done in publick. But the Folly of the reſt is inexpreſſible, who ſuffer'd themſelves to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> led by the Noſe by their profeſt Enemies, but it was <hi>San Sevarina</hi>'s Fate to be chouz'd of the Papacy, and his Parties yielding this Point to their Adverſaries, was the only means to bring it about: For it being carried that a ſecret <hi>Scrutiny</hi> ſhould be made, whereby it was in the power of any perſon to withdraw his Vote without being known, there were found but 30 for him, Four having privately deſerted; which, together with his own, would have completed his Election.</p>
            <p>It is not in my power to expreſs the Joy the Excludents made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon this occaſion, much leſs the confuſion of the contrary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when they found themſelves ſo ſhamefully cheated. But to give <hi>Santa Sevarina</hi> his due, he bore his adverſe Fortune with the ſame Magnanimity as he did his Proſperity, when he went into the Chappel attended by ſo great a number of Cardinals, and continued there as Pope for ſome hours. This imaginary Advancement works no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in him, nor did he appear in the leaſt dejected when he came out, no more than an ordinary Cardinal. Returning alone to his Cell, he found it plunder'd by the <hi>Conclaviſts,</hi> as the Cuſtom is, when any one is declared Pope. The ſight of which, notwithſtanding his former Philoſophical Humor, was obſerv'd to force ſome few Tears from the good old Man.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Montalto</hi> was reſolved not to be diſcouraged for all this, but without pulling off his Robes, whil'ſt the reſt went to Dinner, he calls all his Creatures together about him in the <hi>Paolina,</hi> and with a long Harangue, which I don't think worth my while to write down, exhorts them all to Unity and Perſeverance in the ſame Cauſe. Old <hi>la Rovere</hi> begans to be ſomewhat reſty hereat, and let's <hi>Montalto</hi> know, <hi>That this violent Zeal for</hi> Santa Sevarina <hi>look'd, as if he thought none of his own Creatures fit for the Papacy, amongſt whom there was a great Number of very worthy Men, wherefore he thought fit to tell him, that if he would nominate one of them, he ſhould command his Vote; which in point of Honour and Gratitude to his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> Siſto, <hi>was wholly at his</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97104:15"/>
               <hi>Service, otherwiſe he would make bold to follow the Dictates of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhould grow tedious if I went to relate the laſt Efforts and Struglings of <hi>Santa Sevarina</hi>'s dying Party, his Opponents following their Blow ſo cloſely, that it was impoſſible for him to recover any ſtrength, or rally again his ſcattered Forces. The endeavors of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druzzo</hi> and <hi>Montalto</hi> proving ineffectual, their Zeal began to cool, eſpecially the formers, ſince the other Faction, the better to draw him off, had perſuaded him to ſet up for himſelf. But this had like to have raiſed Civil Diſſentions betwixt them two, and a Mutiny amongſt <hi>Montalto</hi>'s Creatures, who openly declared againſt <hi>Madruzzo;</hi> which made him peaceably lay aſide his Pretenſions, rather than loſe his Credit by vainly perſuing them: And this he was the rather induced to do, for fear leſt by breaking with <hi>Montalto,</hi> he ſhould thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite him to ſet up one who might eſpouſe contrary Intereſts to thoſe of his Catholick Majeſty.</p>
            <p>After him <hi>Como</hi> and <hi>Paleotto</hi> were named, as perſons recommended by the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> but <hi>Montalto</hi> having had ſome Claſhings with them in former Conclaves, was reſolved not to truſt them with the Sovereign Power. Next to theſe old <hi>Colonna</hi> began to conceive ſome ſmall hopes of himſelf, he expecting the Excludents to ſide with him becauſe he was of their Party, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Votes becauſe he was one of the perſons nominated by that King, and <hi>Montalto</hi>'s by reaſon of the Affinity between their Families: But he finding his Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to forſake him at a dead lift, imitated <hi>Madruzzo</hi>'s prudence, and retreated, whilſt his Honour was ſafe. Some were of opinion that <hi>Ruſticucci</hi>'s old Age, and the expectation of his approaching death might ſomewhat recommend him, but his hopes, as well as his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns, ſoon vaniſhed into ſmoke:</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral other little Pretenders not worth the naming, whoſe buſineſs was ſoon done, becauſe they were none of <hi>Montalto</hi>'s Creatures, whoſe Intrigues had that ſucceſs, as that now he found it abſolutely in his power alone to make whom he pleas'd, the greateſt part of the College continually importuning him to name the perſon that ſhould be Pope. Hereupon he at laſt diſcovers his Deſign which he had long kept ſecret, and propoſes <hi>Aldobrandine;</hi> his Choice was immediately confirmed with almoſt an univerſal Conſent of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, only <hi>Madruzzo</hi> ſtood out for ſome ſmall time, alledging, <hi>That derogated from his Maſter's Honour, to have one choſen who was not</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:97104:15"/>
               <hi>recommonded by him; and that</hi> Aldobrandino <hi>not having yet declared himſelf for any Faction, it was to be ſuſpected that inſtead of favouring</hi> Spain, <hi>he would rather ſtand Neuter.</hi> But the true Reaſon was, that which in <hi>Italy</hi> is generally the cauſe of an irreconcileable Enmity, he thought that he had formerly injured him, when in the Conclave of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VII. he was the onely perſon that worked his Excluſion: But finding now that it was not in his power to ſerve him ſuch a Trick again, he thought it moſt conducive to his own and Maſter's Intereſt, by a ready Compliance, to expiate his former Offence. His affected Forwardneſs in ſeeming to promote what he could not hinder at laſt put an End to this tedious Intriguing and Turbulent <hi>Conclave.</hi>

            <head>AN ESSAY To Prove, that according to the <hi>Vndeniable Principles</hi> Of the Preſent Church of Rome, There has not been a True and Lawful POPE ever ſince <hi>SIXT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> the Fifth.</head>
            <p>I Suppoſe, that from a bare Relation of theſe Two <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claves,</hi> any Man of Senſe may perceive by what Spirit the Elections of Popes are generally influenced. But if <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> would be guided by the Dictates of Right Reaſon, I don't know of any Controverſie depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and us that had not been long ſince determined. To comply therefore with their Humour, I ſhall here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97104:16"/>
to prove from ſuch Maxims which cannot be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd, without denying all the Authority that ever they pretended to be in their Church, that there has been no Pope duly Elected, and conſequently had any lawful Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, ever ſince the Election of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I hope to make it evident, that either there never was any ſuch thing as Infallibility in Pope, or Councils, or both together; or if there was, it ſerves now only to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that it is at this preſent totally extinquiſhed.</p>
            <p>There are none I am ſure can deny, but that <hi>Simony</hi> is Decreed by the Univerſal Conſent of Innumerable Popes, Canons, and Councils, to contain Hereſie in it; ſo that he that is guilty of the former, muſt alſo be a Heretick; and that if any Perſon gets into the Pontifical Chair by <hi>Simony,</hi> he becomes thereby Heretical, his Election is Null and Void; and he is not only not Head of the Church, but Inferior to all other Chriſtians. <hi>Julius</hi> the Second in his <hi>Bull</hi> to this Purpoſe Decrees, <hi>That whoſoever procures the Suffrage of any Cardinal by any Promiſe, Obligation, or Compact, made by himſelf, or others, tho' his ELECTION be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimous Conſent of the whole College of Cardinals, and Confirmed by Adoration, it is yet Void, and of no Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and the Perſon ſo infected with</hi> Simoniacal Hereſie, <hi>is to be accounted by all Men as no Pope, or Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>but an Apoſtate and Arch-Heretick, and Incapable of all manner of Juriſdiction and Authority in Matters both Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal; and from that time forward deprived, (even without any Declaration,) of his Cardinalſhip, and all other Benefices, or Dignities whatſoever; nor can any ſubſequent Acts of Obedience done to him by the Cardinals, Inthroniſation, or continuance of Time, make good his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Aſſumption to the Pontifical Chair.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:97104:17"/>
Now from theſe Principles which are founded upon the greateſt Authority in the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> I ſuppoſe it eaſie to ſhew, That there has ſcarce a Pope been Choſen for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hundreds of Years, whoſe Election has not been Tainted with <hi>Simony,</hi> which if made out upon any one, is ſufficient to Prove an Interruption in the Succeſſion; and then all thoſe Prerogatives which by it the Popes pretend to derive from St. <hi>Peter</hi> fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>We have already ſeen in the <hi>Conclave</hi> of <hi>Sixtus</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts, Promiſes, and Obligations, with a Witneſs, but I have reſerved one paſſage for this place, which to take away all Contradiction, will clearly Evidence that his Election was carried directly contrary to the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Julius.</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>d' Eſte</hi> before he would engage himſelf and Followers to Eſpouſe <hi>Montalto</hi>'s Intereſt, Bargained with him, <hi>That if he were Pope he would never raiſe to the Purple. Hieronymo Matthei,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop, whom <hi>Eſte</hi> Mortally Hated, which <hi>Montalto</hi> not only promiſed him, but in a formal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument drawn up for that Purpoſe, gave him his Hand and Seal upon it. But when he came to be <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, he made it his Chief Care and Study to Mortifie thoſe that had Ad anced him. <hi>Matthei</hi> was made a Cardinal amongſt the firſt that he promoted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eſte</hi> finding himſelf deceived in this, as well as his other Expectations, was ſo Netled thereat, that to be Revenged of the Pope, he ſent the Original Contract made between them to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second King of <hi>Spain.</hi> His Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty was ſo far concern'd at the Scandal that muſt neceſſarily ariſe from hence to <hi>Holy Church,</hi> that in the Year 1589 he ſent the Duke of <hi>Seſſa</hi> his Ambaſſador to <hi>Sixtus</hi> to intimate to him the neceſſity of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97104:17"/>
concerning his <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Election, and to require the Cardinals Created by his Predeceſſors to appear at the ſaid Council, which he deſign'd to hold at <hi>Sevil.</hi> But upon the Duke of <hi>Seſſa</hi>'s coming to <hi>Rome</hi> the Pope Dies, ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this Council for a New Election came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtus</hi> his <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Entrance into the Chair being thus Notorious to all the World, it neceſſarily follows, that all the pretended Cardinals of his Creation had no lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Act as ſuch. Yet we find after his Death that of Fifty Three Cardinals that made up the <hi>Conclave,</hi> Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Five of his making bore the greateſt ſway therein, who under the Conduct of <hi>Montalto,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Sixtus,</hi> were the Authors of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Seventh's Election. A few Days after they did the like for <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fourteenth; and next to him, for <hi>Innocent</hi> the Ninth. But let any unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Romanift in the World Judg of the Validity of their Election.</p>
            <p>We have already ſeen how powerful that Party was in the <hi>Conclave</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, who was himſelf one of <hi>Sixtus</hi> his Creatures, and owed his Advancement who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the reſt, ſo that he was under a double Incapacity of being Choſen. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> tho' they above all other <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> are the moſt Devoted to the Holy See, were ſenſible enough of the Unlawfulneſs of <hi>Clement</hi>'s Election, eſpecially when he began to Act contrary to their Intereſt; for when he Abſolved <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and thereby acknowledged him King of <hi>France,</hi> They did not ſtick in ſeveral Books written by them to that purpoſe, publickly to Aver, That he had no Authority to admit that Prince into the Communion of the Church, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97104:18"/>
nothing to do therein himſelf; for if <hi>Sixtus,</hi> ſay they, was guilty of <hi>Simony,</hi> then by the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> of <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, he was no true and lawful Pope, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could not make Cardinals, nor they who derived their Power from him Elect a Pope.</p>
            <p>Now I might carry down the ſame Argument to prove the Invalidity of the Election of all the ſucceeding Popes, but left it ſhould be worn Thred-bare, the <hi>Conclave</hi> of this <hi>Clement</hi> has furniſhed us with a freſh one; but in the firſt place it will be covenient to premiſe, that according to the Canons, He that hath the Suffrages of Two Parts in Three of the Cardinals, ought from that very Moment to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted duly Elected; and he that is ſet up during his Life, is no other than an Antipope. As for the Ceremonies of Inthroniſation, Adoration, or Kiſſing the Foot, they are no more than the Effects and Conſequences of a true Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and no way Eſſential to it, which as the Canon, <hi>[In Nomine Domini,]</hi> does allow, may be omitted if op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, either by Force or Cunning of any that Diſſent from the reſt.</p>
            <p>This we have ſeen to have been exactly the Caſe of <hi>San Sevarina,</hi> he was taken from his Cell by above Two Thirds of the Cardinals, and carried by them into the Chappel, and there placed in the Pontifical Chair, and publickly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and Adored as Pope; and ought certainly to have continued ſo, notwithſtanding his being Cheated of his Right by the Infidelity of his Followers, and the Tricks of his Adverſaries, who made ſhift to cauſe <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> to Joſtle him out of the Holy Chair. But tho' He kept poſſeſſion of it, yet was his Title very much queſtion'd and diſputed at <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as in <hi>Spain;</hi> nor can I ſee any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97104:18"/>
Reaſon in the World why he ought not to be counted an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> I thought it worth the while, I might proceed to make out, that none of the ſucceeding Popes had any better Title: But I think there is enough ſaid, not only to prove a Failure in the Succeſſion, but to Unchurch the whole Communion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o as it is impoſſible for it to be ever reſtored. For allowing the abovementioned Perſons to have been Intruders into the <hi>Holy Chair,</hi> neither the Cardinals of their Creation, nor thoſe whom they Elect, can have any other Authority than what they received from them. And the Holy See and Sacred College being thus become Heretical and Schiſmatick, this Contagion of neceſſity muſt diffuſe itſelf into the whole Communion: For the Fountain Head being once poyſoned, it is impoſſible for the ſtreams that flow from it to be uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. So that according to the preſent Conſtitutions of that Church, it is not in the power even of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to Reform it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with my Advice to our <hi>Romiſh</hi> Friends, <hi>that they would henceforward ceaſe to cavil at ſome pretended Irregularities which they would fain make us believe they have eſpied in the Conduct of our Reformers, ſince our Church is not at all founded upon the ſandy Foundation of Human Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; And tho' we have the greateſt Veneration imaginable for thoſe great Men, yet we ſtill acknowledge them to have been Men, and conſequently not exempt from a poſſibility of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
