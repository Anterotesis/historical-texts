            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whereupon, there aroſe ſuch a cloudy miſt out of my ſeeming groſſe ignorance, that thoſe heavenly illuminations were wrapt up in a cloud of ſelfe-conceit. The meaning whereof, is more plainly thus: I having in my private devotions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with many rare mens workes, framed a Booke of briefe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon all the Holy dayes in the yeare, according to our Church Liturgie, which I intuled, <hi>An Annuall world,</hi> or the world in the yeare; and therein ſhewed, how thoſe dayes may fitly have a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the ſeven Planets, fixed Stars and Elements, fit for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41957:3"/>
private devotion. Which work I compared to the <hi>Sun,</hi> for as <hi>Sol illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat Mundum,</hi> ſo thoſe Feſtivities enlighten and ſtirre up the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all true zealous godly men. Whereto, I annexed briefe Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Meditations upon the Day in generall, and all the Dayes in the Week; which Booke, I compared to the <hi>Moone,</hi> for I do humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, ſome expreſſions therein are borrowed from the radient <hi>Sun</hi> of divine <hi>Du Bartas</hi> his Weekly Dayes. But before theſe I had fixed a <hi>Star</hi> (intituled, <hi>Liber Amoris</hi>) in a ſeeming <hi>bright</hi> firmament of favour, which was transformed into a <hi>Meteor</hi> of diſcontent; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, aroſe flaſhes of lightening, with terrible thunder, from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, geſture, and tongues of ſome maliciouſly inſtigated, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers malignantly affected to my honeſt endeavours. Wherefore, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt of men, ſuch as the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, doth acknowledge, That <hi>ſometime he ſpake unadviſedly with his lips.</hi> And <hi>Auſtine, Origen,</hi> and other learned men, have made large Volumes of Retractations, which formerly they had ſpoke or writ; I that have little learning, and no way qualified with ſuch ſpirituall gifts as thoſe men were, may not think it any diſparagement to make recantation of what I have done publiquely amiſſe. And therefore, firſt, I confeſſe it was not wiſely done in me, to ſeeke the favour and good will of a young Damſell to be my wife, by making good Books. But for that folly, I have loſt two or three hundred pounds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other worldly goods, which otherwiſe I might have had by the favour of great perſonages. Yet as I was fooliſh in that, ſo I know I did not amiſſe to ſhew my honeſt intentions, and induſtrious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in the good or well ſpending of ſpare time. Secondly, the matter of my Books conſiſt in Divinity, Morality, and Fancie. For my Divinity, though it is not ſo exquiſitely performed, as by a learned quill it might have beene, yet it ſhews the devotion of my ſoule; which was diſeſteemed by ſome maliciouſly affected to my honeſt endeavours, and ſuch malignant parties at this time do abundantly multiply, and oppoſe themſelves againſt all good order in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Secondly, for the Morality in my <hi>Meteor,</hi> I do acknowledge, it ſeems to be too ſatyrically ridged in the applicatory part therof privat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhibited, but if you would be pleaſed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the occaſion as wel as the thing, you ſhall not finde it altogether ſo fault-worthy. In pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Abſtract of all Sir <hi>Iames</hi> his Legacies, I do acknowledge
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41957:3"/>
that I have given my Lady and the Executours juſt cauſe to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eſpecially my Lady, who forewarned me to do the ſame. And becauſe, that it may come to the hands of ſome who know them not, and therefore may imagine, that there was ſome great ſtrife betweene my late judicious Maſter and his vertuous Lady, becauſe he therein hath bequeathed her little more then what was agreed upon at the time of their Matrimoniall Contract: which ſome ſay is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to them both. But I would intreat them to be pleaſed to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That though therein my Maſter ſeemed to be over juſt, yet with the plentiful overplus of his eſtate, he hath ſhewed himſelf to be ſo truly charitable, that what is defective in the one, may be ſupplied in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore, in the opinion of all godly, judicious, learned men, ſuch a famous Teſtament ought not to be ſmothered in oblivion, to ſtirre up all rich mens hearts to make this their preſident for them to follow, according to my <hi>Paterne of Iuſtice, and Mercy, and Apologie:</hi> for his charitable Legacies, though I doubt not of the performance thereof by the worſhipfull Executours, yet I feare they may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwayed by others, that ſeek to expulſe me out of the ſervice where I have been imployed in the moſt troubleſome buſineſſe above the ſpace of a yeare, and in a cloſe manner diſgrace me for revealing the ſecrets of the Executours, whoſe actions ought to be ſo even and equall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partiallity, that they may endure the triall of the moſt niceſt and ſharpeſt Satyricall quill. And therefore, I think my late honoured Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter knew well what he did, when he left no Overſeer but God, and conſciences of the Executours, in the diſpoſall of thoſe Legacies; for he knew my ſpirit was ſuch, that, if I was ſo bold with him, on whom my livelihood and welfare in this world did depend, and whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards me then, I had as little cauſe to ſuſpect, as I have of my Ladies now, having taſted thereof in ſuch a meaſure, as my printed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and manuſcripts declare, I would not feare his Executors, though never ſo potent. Then why ſhould I fear the greateſt Lord in the Land or moſt Potent hypocrite in this City which ſhall finde fault with any of my fantaſticall or rather ſatyricall labours; for I have in that manner named none but ſuch as will apply it to themſelves.</p>
            <p>But if ſome will be maliciouſly quarrelſome, and take it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Let them underſtand that I fear none of them; for I ſhall then prove them to be much more hypocriticall, then my late judicious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41957:4"/>
honoured Maſter was like <hi>Laban</hi> or <hi>Nabal,</hi> and ſo far from <hi>Scandalum magnatum,</hi> that it ſhall appear <hi>verbum veritatis,</hi> for if they ſeek utterly to aboliſh the Book of Common Prayer and then to erect an Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall or Democraticall Juriſdiction in this Kingdom which hath been ſo long governed under many Royall Monarchs, or at leaſt ſhall finde fault with my induſtrious labour in my making of Bookes which was onely to clear my ſelfe of what I had writ in my Meteor, I proteſt and affirme that they are a company of hypocrits that do ſuch acts: and therefore I thought good to marke them which ſo cauſe diviſions in Church and State, according as is related in his Majeſties Declarations and other mens writings, for many of them are ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of: 2. <hi>Timothy</hi> 3.6. <hi>Who creep into houſes and lead captive ſilly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men laden with ſins led away with divers luſts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> And truely I fear it is this kinde of people that endeavour now as they did when my Maſter was living, to ſeek my utter ruine, meerly for doing good as well to themſelves as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if they were not maliciouſly minded: for theſe my works of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fortitude, Pitety and devotion in my <hi>Annuall World and Sacred Poems. In my Paterne of Iuſtice and Mercy, with my Star and Meteor, and in my Diſaſter; Paradox and Vindication</hi> for Book making, is approved and commended by two that are Knight Baronets, nine Knights and Aldermen of London, fifteen that are Aldermen, and others judicious and able Citizens of London, and eight or nine that are learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines Schollers and writers of Bookes in print, as by two Certificates under their hands may appear, which in juſtice and charity they would not deny: Yet I do beleeve if they had known I would have put them in print they would have refuſed their ſubſcription, becauſe theſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times they would not be ſeen to animate or incourage my angry and ſatyricall quill: And for my Reverend Patrone he was ſo far from adviſing me, that he did utterly diſlike and diſwade me from it as by his letter may appear; for ſince I have made my Diſaſter, I have not ſeen him, which grieves me to the very heart, that ſuch men as he ſhould be kept in obſcurity, and not ſuffered to preach and write the word of God as in former times. For my Lady and other my friends have been ſo far for incouraging me, that they have threatned me to put me out of their ſervice, and tell me in the words of <hi>Samuel, that obedience is better then ſacrifice; &amp; to hearken then the fat of Rams: for who hath required theſe things
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41957:4"/>
at my hands: And who ever rejected the councell of the wiſe and did proſper,</hi> with other ſuch like exhortations which I did very well conſider: But yet being continually upbraided for my works w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> my conſcience tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me is well done, &amp; therin is no wrong to any but ſuch galled backs as found themſelves prickt to the quick, I was not carefull to anſwer them in verball expreſſions, but in print for which I was wronged: And ſure I think I am divinely called thereunto, and therefore it is better to obey God then man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, and in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or neceſſity like a broken reed, will rather grieve then help the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the afflicted, as experience of this time makes too manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: for if God hath put a ſeaſonable word into my heart that aimes at his glory and good of other: ſhall I not write it? if God hath ſtirred up my ſpirit as he did the Prophet <hi>Daniels</hi> in the 45. and 46. verſes of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſannas</hi> Story, ſhall I fear to ſay that I am clear of, or from all the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood that hath been ſhed in this unnaturall Civill War? No I will not: for with <hi>Balaam</hi> the word that the Lord hath put into my heart that will I write though I might gaine a houſe full of Gold, nay all Sir <hi>Iames</hi> his Legacies, I will not leave till I have vanquiſhed all my malicious adverſaries: And therefore to thoſe that wiſh me to deſiſt I ſpeak in the words of our Saviour, <hi>Get thee behinde me Satan, for thou ſavoureſt of the things of men and not of God.</hi> And to my friends I ſpeak in the words of Saint <hi>Paul, what mean you to weep and to break my heart; for I am ready not to be bound onely but alſo to die at Ieruſalem for the name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> And therefore intreate them onely to pray that God would ſend me a quiet minde, for if they be righteous I am ſure their prayer will prevail with God. And in time I ſhall have good ſucceſſe. And I could wiſh all England eſpecially London would take my ſatyricall labours as a warning peece diſcharged from a good conſcience but not from the Cannon oath, &amp;c. nor ordinances Illegall, &amp;c. For though they may ſeem to be fancies, dreams or Chymera's of my own brain, yet they may prove as fatall to ſome as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Bakers did, and to others ſuccesfull as his Butlers. For I would that all people in the land did ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, not onely mine, but the reſolved conſcience of all true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned men ſuch as Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>That it is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, nay damnable to reſiſt, much more oppoſe the higher powers, who are as</hi> Saint <hi>Peter deſcribes them, Firſt the King and thoſe that are ſent by him, and not thoſe that ſet up themſelves againſt him</hi>; Then there would not be ſuch

warlike preparations and bloody maſſacres againſt Parliamentary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, free ſpeaking, as now there is on both ſides; for now an honeſt man, may not ſpeak, much leſſe write his minde freely according to the word of God, and the Proteſtation which I have taken, unanſwerable by argument, as I praiſe God my works are, but he ſhal be counted a Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and threatned to be plundred, pillaged or impriſoned, as by wofull experience it is too manifeſt. But I with Saint <hi>Paul having fought with beaſts after the manner of men and overcome all my malicious adverſaries:</hi> As barking of <hi>Dogs,</hi> grumbling of <hi>Cats,</hi> hiſſing of <hi>Serpents,</hi> and with <hi>David</hi> freed my ſelf from the paw of the angry <hi>Lyon,</hi> &amp; ravenous <hi>Bear,</hi> do not fear nor care for the crafty ſlights of the <hi>Fox,</hi> the malicious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the <hi>Wolf</hi> or tyrannicall juriſdiction of any cruell <hi>Tyger</hi>; but hope in time to overcome even great <hi>Goliah</hi> himſelfe. And if I come into trouble for this my fancy, I am confident that the Lord in good time, will deliver me, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Though many are the troubles of the righteous, the Lord will deliver him out of them all; he keepeth all his bones ſo that not one of them is broken, evil ſhall ſlay the wicked, and they that hate the Righteous ſhall be deſolate: But the Lord redeemeth the ſoule of his ſervant, and none that truſt in him ſhall periſh, Pſal.</hi> 43.19.20. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude with this heavenly Soliloquium of the prophet <hi>David,</hi> whoſe actions of conqueſt I deſire to imitate, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.37. <hi>Why are thou caſt down, O my ſoule, and why art thou diſquieted within me, hope thou in God, for I will yet praiſe him who is the health of my countenance and my God, Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>ult. The Lord grant us right underſtanding in all things.</hi>
