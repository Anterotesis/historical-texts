            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">As it was delivered in Low-dutch to the Scheepens and Iudges in Amsterdam, in the month of October <hi>1676.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>R. <hi>Iacob Cats</hi> late Pensionaris of <hi>Holland, Iohn Corcelis</hi> and others became bound by their writing obligatory at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> dated 29 Iuly 1631 unto <hi>Sr. William Courten</hi> in the Penalty of 3000 pounds for payment of 2080 pounds to the said <hi>Sr. William</hi> his Executors or administrators according to the Laws and Custom of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the year 1636 the said money continuing at interest, <hi>Sr. William Courten</hi> died indebted to many persons, and left <hi>William Courten</hi> his Son and Heir his sole Executor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the moneth of September 1643. the said <hi>William Courten</hi> became insolvent for his own debts, and absented himself from his Creditors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. On the 31 of Octob. 1653. <hi>William Courten</hi> at <hi>London</hi> assigns the said Obligation of 3000 pounds to <hi>Iacob Pergens,</hi> upon pretence of an old debt due to the said <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> from <hi>Sr. William Courten,</hi> and gives him procuration to sue for the said mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney accordingly.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the year 1645 <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> summoned <hi>Sr. Iacob Cats</hi> before the Provinciall Court of <hi>Holland,</hi> and instituted his Process for the said debt and dammages.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the year 1647 <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> (during the Civill warrs in <hi>England</hi>) procured Letters from the late <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>States Generall</hi> and the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> in favour of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against <hi>Sr Iacob Cats,</hi> and the East-India Company.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the year 1653. <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> gave 400 pounds to the Comissioners concerning Banckrupts to release their right to the money due from <hi>Sr. Iacob Cats,</hi> and to assign their pretence unto <hi>Pergens salvo jure</hi> of other men.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In the year 1655. depending the said process against <hi>Sr. Iacob Cats, William Courten</hi> the Executor died in <hi>Florence</hi> intestate.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In the year 1660. Letters of Administration of <hi>Sr. William Courtens</hi> Goods, debts and effects unadministred by <hi>Will. Courten</hi> Esquire (with the Testament annexed) were granted by the Prerogative Court of <hi>England</hi> to the said <hi>George Carew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. In the year 1661. the Provincial Court of <hi>Holland</hi> pronounced a Sentence in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> against the Heyrs of <hi>Sr. Iacob Cats,</hi> who appealed to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Court of Iustice at the <hi>Hague,</hi> from the same.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In the moneth of May 1662. <hi>George Carew</hi> Exhibited his Request unto the High Court, and intervened in the said Cause, praying that his right might be preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to Law; and in consequence thereof, that the Heirs of <hi>Sr. Iacob Cats</hi> might be ordered to pay the money to him in right of his Administration; and that <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> should be likewise enjoyned to deliver up the bond as an unadministred Effect of <hi>Sr. William Courtens</hi> Estate.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:108471:2"/>12. Whereupon <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> refused to answer unto the principall demand, but made his Exception in writing, that he was a Burger of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and ought to be impleaded before his Competent judges there, notwithstanding he dwelt then in the <hi>Hague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. After severall pleadings, repliques, duplicques and advertisments of right with severall advices upon the case transmited from the Judges of <hi>England</hi> to the said High Court of Iudicature; the Lords nevertheless admitted the exception of <hi>Iacob Pergens,</hi> and renvoyed <hi>Carew</hi> before the Scheepens of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> with Compensation of Costs.</p>
            <p n="14">14. On the 6 of November 1663 <hi>George Carew</hi> cited <hi>Iacob Pergens</hi> before the Lords of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> and exhibited his request, as aforesaid, for the recovery of his right, desiring a precise day as a stranger. Yet the <hi>Scheepens</hi> ordered the process to be written by demand, answer, replicque and duplicque: as by the acts of the Court inventaried appears.</p>
            <p n="15">15. However on the 34 of October 1664 the High Court at the <hi>Hague</hi> proceeded to a Sentence in favour of <hi>Mr. Pergens</hi> against the Heirs of <hi>Sr. Iacob Cats.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lords ordered them to pay the money with interest, and Charges to the said <hi>Pergens,</hi> which amounred unto 4200 pounds Sterling: And directed <hi>Pergens</hi> to assign the said bond with power to sue the other obligers. Although the Iudges of <hi>England</hi> had intimated <hi>Mr. Carews</hi> right, to the said high Court, and subscribed the same before <hi>Major Wright</hi> and <hi>Iohn Daniel</hi> two Publique Notaries in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. In the years 1669 and 1670 <hi>Mr. Iames Boeve</hi> sollicited the said Process and caused the writings and papers on both sides to be inventaried and exchanged by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters <hi>Francis Meerhout</hi> and <hi>Arnold Vingbooms</hi>: then by a contrivance between <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> and the sons of <hi>Peter Boudaen, Iames Boeve</hi> was arrested at the <hi>Hague</hi> upon a vexatious action out of the Admiralty of <hi>Zealand,</hi> which they bought purposely to trouble <hi>Mr. Boeve:</hi> whereupon he was detained a Prisoner, and so obstructed the prosecution in this Cause some time longer.</p>
            <p n="17">17 In the year 1672 <hi>Mr. Carew</hi> arrived at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> and desired his Advocate <hi>Mr. Paulus Buys</hi> to draw an Advertisment of right to be delivered over with the pieces and papers to the Lords, which was retarded yet longer by reason of the warr with <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Carews</hi> detention in prison at the <hi>Hague</hi> upon pretence of being an Enemie to the countrey for demanding common justice.</p>
            <p n="18">18 In the moneth of May 1676 <hi>Mr. Carew</hi> arrived again at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and applied himself to <hi>Advocate Buys</hi> to make an advertisment of right, that the Sentence might be pronounced thereupon; who refused to serve any longer in the Cause, pretending that he had married a kinswoman of <hi>Mr. Pergens</hi>; yet demanded his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie of 116 Gilders for perusing the papers drawn by <hi>Advocate Caw</hi> and others, (yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no disparagement to <hi>Mr. Buys</hi> his abilities) although he never pleaded in the Cause.</p>
            <p n="19">19. In the moneth of August last <hi>Mr. Paulus Buys</hi> and <hi>Arnold Vingboom</hi> summoned <hi>Mr. Carew</hi> before the Magistrates at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> for their respective Salaries, and arrested his Goods for the same: whereupon <hi>the Lords</hi> condemned <hi>Carew</hi> to pay their demands accordingly: <hi>Mr. Buys</hi> having interdicted all Others to serve in the Cause before he was paid.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Then <hi>Pergens</hi> and <hi>Boudaens</hi> having published a scandalous Book against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedings of <hi>Carew</hi> and <hi>Boeve,</hi> it was answered by another Book, many whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof they caused to be taken away by <hi>Inglebreght</hi> the <hi>under-Scout</hi> of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> from <hi>Stephen Swart,</hi> A Bookseller near the Exchang by order of the president Scheepen, as <hi>Inglebreght</hi> pretended.</p>
            <p n="21">21. In the moneth of September last <hi>Mr. Carew</hi> having then gotten his papers and writings from <hi>Mr. Buys</hi> and <hi>Vingboom,</hi> paid them both their Salaries and proceeded to the advertisment of rights: following upon which he craves the Iudgement of the Honoerable Lords the <hi>Scheepens.</hi>
