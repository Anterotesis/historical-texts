            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere be foure partes of Arithmeticke, <hi>Addition, Multiplication, Substraction,</hi> and <hi>Diuision,</hi> whereof the first two take their beginning from the right hand, and doe multiplie and increase: and these bee GODS numbers: the other two begin from the left, and doe substract and diuide, and these bee the Deuils. When God had marryed Adam and Eua together, God said to them both, increase, multiplie and replenish the earth: this is Gods Arithmeticke. But when the Deuill substrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Dalila from Sampson, the Leuits wife from her husband, and diuided Micholl from Dauid: this was the Deuils Arithmetick. <hi>Diuisum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium cum Ioue Daemon habet,</hi> two partes for God, and two for the Deuill. <hi>En quatuor <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

dwel Adam, Noah, Lot, Seth, Enoch, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac, Iacob, Ioseph, Moses, Iosua, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Ezechias, Iosias, the Apostles of Christ, all which by Multiplication replenished the earth, and by Addition enriched Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But in the Deuils dwell the Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, the Marcionites, the Saturnites, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, the Adamites, the Encratites, the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, the Mahometanes, the Anabaptistes, &amp; that great Dragon of Rome Pope Gregorie the seuenth, otherwise called Hildebrande, all which by Substraction either condemned, or by Diuision contemned Gods Arithmeticke, and bannished out of the bondes of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that most famous and glotious Empresse Ladie Matrimonie and exalted in her Throne fained Dame Chastitie, which beeing pure is not to be preferred before holy Wedlocke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we will say that the Daughter hath a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence aboue her mother, for Virginitie is the daughter of Marriage, and through mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is made a Citizen and In-dweller of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, which also without mariage, should nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be, nor yet possesse Paradice.</p>
            <p>The auncient Fathers and Philosophers haue singularlie extolled the knowledge of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Arithmeticke, beeing one of the seuen liberall Sciences, when they considered the deepe deuises, the profound practises, &amp; cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:7426:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conclusions therein contained: and also that it is the Key and entrance into all other Artes and Learning: as well approued the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Philosopher Pythagoras, who caused this Inscription to be written vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Schoole doore (where he taught Philosophye) in great Letters: <hi>Nemo Arithmeticae ignarus hic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grediatur:</hi> Let none enter heere, that is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in Arithmeticke.</p>
            <p>But the commendation of this heauenly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticke, is so excellently depainted and dignified in Scripture, that it needeth neither the penne of Father nor Philosopher, nor the praise of Angelles. Not Romulus of Rome, not Solon of Athens, not Minos of Crecte, not Lycurgus of Sparta, nor vnsatiable Art-sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Aristotle did institute it, nor any other Creature eyther in heauen or in earth, but God himeselfe that most high Maiestie, who after he had created Man and VVoman in his owne Image, he commaunded neyther angell nor Archangell to marrye and couple them together, but he himselfe, as I may so speake, supplyed the place of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and marryed Adam and Eua toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Neyther was it instituted in this wretched
<pb facs="tcp:7426:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and wicked world, which is nothing but a vale of teares and sorrowes, but in Paradice, that Garden of most sweete and ioyfull pleasures. Vpon which holy and honorable estate the holy and blessed Angelles attende, as we may see in the storie of Abraham and Sara, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the hauing of a sonne, and in the booke of Iudges, how the Angell of the Lord came to the wife of Manoah about the birth of Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and in the first of Luke, how Gabriell the Angel brought word to Zacharie, how his wife Elizabeth should bring forth Iohn Baptist.</p>
            <p>Wee reade also how the reuerend Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the sage Iudges, the noble Kings, the holy Priestes, the heauenly inspired Prophetes were all marryed, which examples doe not a little grace this estate. In the new Testament wee read, that the Sauiour of the world was born of a Virgin espoused and marryed, &amp; graced this his Fathers ordinance with the firstfruites of his miracles, himselfe being present with his Mother and his Disciples. Wherevpon Saint Augustine saith in his booke <hi>De bono coniugali: Bonum coniugii Dominus in Euangelio confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mauit, non solum quia prohibuit dimittere uxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, nisi ex causa fornicationis, sed etiam quia venit inuitatus ad nuptias.</hi> The Lord in the Gospell doth commend the goodnes of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb facs="tcp:7426:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not onely because he vvill haue no <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, but for fornication, but also because he commeth vnto a marriage being inuited. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage also is an holy Misterie of the Vnion of Christ and his Christian Congregation.</p>
            <p>Therfore exceeding Derogatorie to the Wisdome of God is that Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent vvhich maketh Chastitie and Priestes marriage opposite, quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie both to the commaundement of God, and the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of his Saints. God hath done that for the matrimonie of priestes, vvhich he neuer did for the Matrimonie of King or Kesar, or of any other mortall creature. For in his holy Lavv giuen by Moses, he appoynteth euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vvhat Woman the priestes should marrye. Are not these his vvords Leuit. 21.? Let not the priest take a vvife, that is an Adultresse, or defiled, nor put from her husband, for such an one is holie vnto his God. He shall take a Mayde vnto his Wife: but a Widovv, a diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vvoman, or an Harlot he shall not marrye, but shall take a Maide of his ovvne people to vvife. By the Prophet Ezechiell he saith also, Chap. 44. The priestes shall marrie no Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovv, neyther one that is put from her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: but a Maid of the seede of the house of Israell. Saint Paul also setteth foorth vvhat manner of VViues the spirituall Ministers
<pb facs="tcp:7426:6"/>
should haue. Their Wiues must bee (sayth he, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Timoth. 3.) honest, no euill speakers, but sober and faythfull in all things.</p>
            <p>For the practise of Gods Saintes, the holy Scriptures and auncient writings make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. The priestes of the olde Testament were marryed, and their Children succeeded them in the Ministery. Ieremie the prophete, who was sanctified in his Mothers wombe, was Helkiah the priestes sonne. Ezechiel the Prophet, to whom marueysous Visions and great Misteries were reuealed, was Buzi the Priestes sonne.</p>
            <p>In the newe Testament, Saint Iohn the Baptist, of whom Christ giueth this wttnes, that he was more then a Prophet, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which were borne of VVomen, arose not a greater then he, was the sonne of Zachary the Priest. The Apostles of Christ were marryed men, as the Monuments of the auncient Writers testifie. Saint Mathew, Saint Marke and Saint Luke make mention of Peters wiues mother. The Histories declare euidently, that Saint Petronilla was Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Daughter. And there are that write, that Saint Marke the Euangelist was Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters naturall Sonne. Saint Paule in his first Epistle to the Corinth. Chap. 9. testifieth, that the Apostles, of Christ led their wiues with
<pb facs="tcp:7426:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, when they went about preaching the Word of God. Saint Luke Acts 21. maketh mention of Phillip the Euangelist, and his foure Daughters which were Virgins and did prophecye.</p>
            <p>If wee search the Histories of auncient writers, wee shall see that many reuerend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and vertuous ministers were marryed in the primatiue Church, &amp; many hundred yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res after. Spiridion Bishop of Cyprus was married, and had a Daughter called Irene. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius Bishop of Syracusa had both wife and children: Gregorius Nazianzenus was a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops sonne, and succeded his Father in place and Office: Policrates Bishop of Ephesus said: Seuen of my Fore-fathers by order were Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of this See, and I am the eight: Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonius was a married Bishop, as Chrisostome testifieth. Cheremon a Bishop in Egypt of the Citie Nilopolis was married: Philias also both Bishop and Martyr was marryed. Adolphus Bishop of Colen had a VVife: The Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctor Tertulian was mariyed. Saint Hillary hauing wife and Children was made Bishop of Pictania: Basilius Magnus was a marryed Bishops sonne, and Epiphanius Archbishop of Constantinople was a marryed Priestes sonne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7426:7"/>
The grauest and prudentest among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, as the Romanes &amp; Grecians, haue great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuerenced and honoured marriage. The Romanes made a Law, that such as liued amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them vamaried till they were aged, should pay certaine great summes of money for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and mainteinance of the common weale, and that they should bee iudged and counted the enemies of the state. The noble Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians made a Law, that if any among them remayned vnmarryed, til he was past 37. years of age he should by no meanes be suffered in Summer time to come vnto the playes, Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, sports &amp; such other publike spectacles or fights, as were vsed among them for their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and delight. The Grecian Ladies (as Homer reporteth) count their age from the time of their marriage, not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the day of their birth, and if they be demaunded how olde they bee, they beginne to recken from their marriage, &amp; so answere accordinglie, for then onelie, say they, wee beginne to liue. And surely there is nothing in this world that makes a life more vitall and pleasant, then this societie doth. Without friendship and loue no Man can liue either in prosperitie or aduersitie. It is friendship that maketh prosperitie more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and aduersitie more tollerable. But in no kinde of society hath this friendship more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<pb facs="tcp:7426:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
appeared, nor more constantly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, then betweene man and wife. Which we shall presently yeelde vnto, if wee goe no further then to the stories of the Heathen: The friendship of Pilades and Orestes, of Damon and Pythias, of Achilles &amp; Patroclus, so much admired and extolled of the Grecian Writers, for continuance was neuer more stable, for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall dutie and helpe more requisite, or for ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes of affection and sincerity of true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayned loue and loyaltie more commendable, then the loue of Alceste to her husband Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metus, who vnderwent the weightie burthen of death for him. Or of Tiberius Gracchus to his wife Cornelia, who for her tasted of the same cup, that Alceste did for her husband, so that it is a matter vndecideable, whether Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceste loued her husband, or Gracchus his Wife better. Damon and Pythias are much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for beeing each others pledge in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall case, and for the returne at the prefixed day: But if you poyse with Damon and Pythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the loue of the Mynian wiues to their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and the loue of the wife of Theopom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus the Lacedemonian to him, the VVomens scale will farre prooue the weyghtyer.</p>
            <p>Achilles hearing tell of the death of his friend Patroclus, so miserably lamented his losse, that he could scarcely be restrained
<pb facs="tcp:7426:8"/>
from laying violent handes vpon himselfe. But Plancus the Romane for the death of his deare Orestilla could not be restrained. Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea killed her selfe vpon the carkasse of her slaine husband: Portia the Daughter of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Cato, hearing of her Brutus death, swallowed hote burning Coales to follow him.</p>
            <p>For breuitie sake I referre the admirable loue of the Indian Wiues to their Husbandes, to be read in the fift Booke of Tullyes Tuscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</p>
            <p>Exceeding admirable was the loue of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma the Galathian to her Hushand Sinatus, as appeareth by reuenging his death vpon the murtherer Sinorix with the losse of her owne life.</p>
            <p>But that I may not bee too tedious in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearcing examples, which are almost innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, I heare breake of, and briefely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, that there is no friendship more true, nor amity more honourable, nor any societiy more sacred or profitable, then that which is coupled together by marriage bondes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore verie truely speaketh Propertiu:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Omnis amor magnus, sed aperto conigue maior,</hi>

                  <l>Great is all loue, it maketh sweete mans life:</l>
                  <l>But greater is the loue between man &amp; wife:</l>

For what shall we call it? doth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon heere set out an <hi>Arithmomachia,</hi> a combat of nombers? doth he after a fantas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall manner compare nomber with nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? or Poetlike for triall of his wit, doth he oppose <hi>Vnitie</hi> against <hi>Duplicitie, one</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>two,</hi> and <hi>two</hi> against <hi>one,</hi> to make <hi>one</hi> and <hi>two</hi> to fight together? or as he wrote of Trees, Birds, Beastes, and Fishes, so did
<pb facs="tcp:7426:10"/>
he writ of nombers too? Or was there an errour in them that gathered his writinges together to foyst in this saying of Salomon the Philosopher, amongst the sayings of Salomon Ecclesiastes the Preacher, and so to mingle his Philosophye with his Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie? Surelie no, there is no such matter, but it is euen the saying of that sober spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which sayd Gen. 2. <hi>It is not good for man to be alone, let vs make him an helpe meete for him;</hi> equiualent and of like force and sence with this, <hi>Two are better then one,</hi> as if he should say, while a man is one and alone, it is not well with him, but when a helpe is made, it is better for him; Therefore haue we in this Scripture three things to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>that societie is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>that it is bester then Vnitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>a care that since God hath orday ned it vnto good, that we vse the meanes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it vnto good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the first, <hi>that society is good,</hi> is inferred by the very wordes, for he that saith <hi>it is better then vnitie,</hi> implyes <hi>it is good,</hi> for in reason vvhatsoeuer is good in comparison must
<pb facs="tcp:7426:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
needes be good of it selfe, and so is society a good thing, ordayned for the helpe, the health, the comfort, and good of man, therfore sayth Dauid Psalm. 133. <hi>Beholde how good a thing it is for Brethren to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in vnitie,</hi> not expressing the measure, but admiring it, as if he could not say how good it were: it is like a pleasant oyntment affecting the sence with delight, it is like the deaw of Hermon replenishing the fieldes with profit, if yee feele it, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable: if yee tast it, it is sweete: if yee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, it is beautifull: but if yee haue it, there is no treasure like it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aske the Beasts</hi> (sayth <hi>Iob</hi> Cap. 12.) <hi>&amp; they shall tell thee, or the foules and they shal shew thee;</hi> so say I, if yee will know how good, and what a good societie is, aske the Beastes and Foules and they will declare to thee. The Grashoppers haue no King, yet goe they foorth in bandes, a wonder to see so sillie a worme by society should become a souldier in the fielde. Beside in obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we finde, that the most innocent and harmelesse creatures are by nature sociable, therefore Christ exhortes his Disciples to
<pb facs="tcp:7426:11"/>
imitate those creatures, which were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable and louing one to another, such as are sheepe which goe together in flocks, such as are Doues, which flye together in companies, he resembles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doues, he calles them sheepe, for those be in deed the harmelesse creatures: but Wolues, and Owles, and Lyons, which liue apart and runne into wilde and desert places, those be they, which meditate on mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefe: <hi>Thou leadest thy people like sheepe</hi> (sayth the Psalmist) <hi>by the handes of Moses and Aaron</hi> Psal. 77. But of the wicked sayth Eliphas: <hi>thou scatterest them as the Lyons whelpes,</hi> Iob. 4. Gods people are like sheepe, the wicked as Lyons; these lead, they scattered: these flocking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they diuided a sunder.</p>
            <p>How well God liked of societie, is seene by the creation, for why did God make men and Angelles, but to ioyne them to himselfe, and that which God the Father liked, Christ his sonne disliked not, for why came Christ from Heauen, but to seeke that one sheepe which was lost, and
<pb facs="tcp:7426:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bring it to the folde? Luke the 15. or why did he yeelde himselfe to die, but to gather together into one the children of GOD, which were scattered. Iohn. 11.</p>
            <p>The greate difference betweene Christ and the Deuill, is this, that Christ gathereth thinges together: O <hi>Ierusalem, Ierusalem, how often would I haue gathered thee together,</hi> but the Deuill deuides and scattereth them in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for he is that Wolfe that catcheth the sheepe and scattereth them, Iohn 10. It was he that carryed that one sheepe into the Wildernes Luke 15. it was he <hi>that carryed the possessed into the mountains and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the graues;</hi> Marke. 5. It was he <hi>that ledde Christ into the wildernes, into the mountaines and to the pinacle of the Temple,</hi> Math, 4. If the Deuill see foure together, he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer well till he hath brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to three, for when Noah and his three sonnes were together he culled out <hi>Cham</hi> from among them, Gen. 9. Or if hee see three together, he is neuer well till he hath
<pb facs="tcp:7426:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
brought them to two, for it was he <hi>that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the prodigall childe from his Father, and from his elder Brother</hi> Luke 15. Or if he see two together, he is neuer wel till hee hath brought them to one, it was he that <hi>diuided Lot and Abraham asunder</hi> Gen. 13. for in the Deuils Arithmeticke <hi>three are better then foure,</hi> and <hi>two are better then three,</hi> and <hi>one is better then two,</hi> whereas God saith: <hi>Two are better then one,</hi> therefore it is wel sayd that Addition and Multiplication belong to God, but Substraction &amp; Diuision belong to the Deuill. The Deuill is like a Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, that makes two walles of one, but Christ is like a <hi>Corner stone,</hi> that makes one Wall of two,</p>
            <p>It was giuen for a signe of Christes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, that when he came, <hi>the Wolfe should dwell with the Lambe,</hi> the <hi>Leopard with the Kidde, the Cow with the Beare, and the Calfe with the Lyon,</hi> Esay 11. that thinges of vnlike nature should ioyn in peace, and couple by his comming: but the Deuill by his comming diuides a sunder things of like nature, it was hee <hi>that diuided the starres

from the starres,</hi> Apoc. 12. it was he <hi>that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the Angelles from the Angelles when they fell from Heauen;</hi> it was hee <hi>that set Ephraim against Manasses,</hi> and <hi>Manasses against Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> the <hi>Father against the Sonne,</hi> &amp; <hi>the Sonne against the Father,</hi> it was he <hi>that diuided Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

if Salomon spake of all societie generallye, then is marriage included, which is one so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety among the rest, but that marriage is not onely generally included, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intended, I referre you to the next verse going before, where Salomon reko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth among the miseries of this life, to see one single man, that had neither Brother, nor sonne labouring for the world, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding his soule of pleasure and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth this vpon it: <hi>Two are better then one,</hi> as if he meant, that he who is marryed had a sonne, for whom he laboured, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore defrauded not his soule of pleasure. Of the single life sayth S. Paule, <hi>It is good: It is good for a Man not to touch a Woman</hi> 1. Cor. 7. but of marryage he sayth, <hi>It is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> Heb. 13. To be good is the smallest commendation that can be giuen to any thing, for God made nothing but was good and whatsoeuer is not good, is of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</p>
            <p>But to be honourable is the excellencie and perfection of good, and striues among other goods, like the Sun among the
<pb facs="tcp:7426:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
starres, which when it appeares, they are not knowne to bee. But what if S. Paule sayd, the single life was good? that prooues not that mariage is not good, nay wherein is the single life so good, but marriage is as good? <hi>It is good for a Man not to touch a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> how meanes he that? doth he meane it is good generally for mankinde? No: for Christ sayth, all men cannot take that gift, Math. 19. but it is good particularlye for this man, or for that man, for thee or for mee, but marriage is good generallye for mankinde, and who preferres not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, before a priuate, and the single life but a priuate good? for when he sayth, It is good for a man not to touch a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he meaneth, it is good for that man that he can abstaine from marriage, that is yet more plainely, that it is good for him selfe, because he feedes none but himselfe, he clothes none but himselfe. But heerein doth marriage excell, because it doth good to other, first to her, whom hee takes into his protection, which if all men should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte to doe, then might women goe with
<pb facs="tcp:7426:18"/>
Iephthes Daughter, to bewaile the dayes of their Virginitie. Secondly, it doth good to the Church, in begetting an holy seede to the kingdome of Christ. Thirdly it doth good to all the world, in replenishing it with people, and Lots Daughters <hi>chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lie with their Father, then to leaue the world vnpeopled,</hi> therefore <hi>Two are better then one.</hi> But wherein doth the single such good to himselfe? yee will say in easing himeselfe of care, because he hath none to labour for but himselfe, but looke verse 8. and Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rekoneth that among the miseries of this life to see a man labouring and trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the world, and knowes not for whom, and in deede it is an ease and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort amidst our labours, that when we are gone, we haue to whome to leaue them, which no man hath that is alone, therefore <hi>two are better then one.</hi> Or will yee say the single life is freer from temptation, for that when the sword comes, when affliction or when persecution comes, thou haste none to withdraw thee from GOD, thou haste no wife to tempt thee with teares, thou
<pb facs="tcp:7426:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haste no children to pearce thy soule with pitty, thou haste no hinderance to holde thy heart in thrall. I answere againe, that as the temptation is lesse, so the glorie shall bee lesse, for he that forsooke more, he loued more, and what is more admirable in the Church of God, then to see a man for Christes sake &amp; for religions sake, forsake wife and children? For there is nothing that calles so importunately vpon the heart of man, as the cry of nature in the teares of wife and children, and it is a thing at which the Barbarous Tyrantes are many times ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, to thinke what religion should be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they see that for loue of it, men forsake wife and children, it makes them thinke that there is somewhat in the peace of GOD, which passeth al vnderstanding; Or which of yee all is there, who if yee saw two Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs at a stake, whereof the one was single, the other had wife and children, would not conceaue more reuerently of him that was maryed, because he ouercame the greater temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in leauing wife &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which the single martyr could not, because he had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to leaue? therfore in him that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
<pb facs="tcp:7426:19"/>
patience is more admirable: the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie more honorable, the reward more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, the wages better, therefore <hi>two are better then one,</hi> for Salomon heere sayth, thei shall haue better Wages for their labour: Well, yee will graunt all this, that the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie is more glorious in them that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they doe ouercome these temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but that they seldom ouercome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because of the clogge. Surely this were somewhat if it were true, but amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther slanders against this honourable ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, I must needes avouch this to be one, for let your single Saintes come in, and spread foorth the Ensigne of their honour, what euer was done by men not marryed, but the matryed haue done as much as they, yea I say, as much, as often as honourable? If yee speake of <hi>patience,</hi> whom haue yee to come into the ballance with Iob, &amp; he maryed, ifyee speake of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> whom haue yee like Dauid, a man after Gods owne heart, and he maried, if of <hi>Faith,</hi> whom like Abraham, if of <hi>Wisdom<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:7426:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
like Sampson, and all marryed, and it is no small commendation of marryage, to see all the patternes of perfection in men that were marryed. If yee speake of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <hi>sortitude</hi> in contempt of the world, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage hath been no hinderance, but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried haue hazarded as much as any: Wher euer saw yee such a sacrifice as that of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, who sacrificed his owne sonne for Gods sake? or when euer heard yee such a worke as that of Iudah &amp; Beniamin, who thrust away their owne wiues for Gods sake? or who euer left more then Peter, who left all he had for Christes sake? and they all marryed. The Prophet Ezechiell, Cap. 14. rekoneth vp the three worthies of the world, Noah, Daniell &amp; Iob, though these three men Daniel, Noah &amp; Iob were among them, yet should they saue but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, there were but three worthies in the world, and two of them, Noah and Iob were marryed, and marryage had the odde one. Nay what honourable thing atcheiued in Scripture, but the marryed had a hand in it? or what honour in Scripture ascribed to any, but the marryed had a share in it. The

translation vp to heauen in Enoch, who was maried, the building of the Arke, &amp; preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the world in Noah and his three sonnes, all maryed, the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Salomon, who was marryed. If yee speake of vision and reuelation then against Daniell in the old Testament, and Iohn in the new, I oppose Iacob among the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atkes, Samuel among the Iudges, Ezechiel among the Prophetes, and Peter among the Apostles, who had as many reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and saw as many visions as any. Or if yee speake of Paule the Apostle of the Gentils, of whom it is like he was not marryed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him I oppose Moses the leader of the Iewes, who in deede was marryed, &amp; what was there in the one, which was not in the other? Paule was a great Scholler, a Pharisee, &amp; brought vp atthe feete of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel, Acts. 22. so was Moses a man well seene in all the learning of the Egyptians, Act. 7. to shew that marryage is no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye to learning. Paule was a man feruent in prayer, for by his very prayer he healed the sicke, Acts. 28. so was Moses a man ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement in prayer, for he praied fortie daies
<pb facs="tcp:7426:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and fortie nights, Deut. 9. to shew that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryage is no enemie to a mans deuotion. Paule fought with Beastes at Ephesus and ouercame <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Paule wish: himselfe eternally seperate from God for the Iewes sake, Rom. 9. 3. so did Moses, <hi>If thou wilt not pardon them, then blot my name out of thy booke,</hi> Exod. 32. 32. to shew that marryage is no enemie to a Pastoral care in a spirituall function. Paule was rapt vp into the third Heauen, 2. Cor, 12. but God came downe from Heauen to talke with Moses in the Mount, Exod. 24. and mee thinke his honor was the greater, for Paule went vp to God, but God came downe to Moses, to shew that marryage is no enemie to vision and reuelation.</p>
            <p>Or if yee will obiect out of Matth. 22. that the state of single men is like to the Angelles, because Christ saith of the deade, <hi>phat they neither marrie, nor are giuen in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Math. 22. 2. <hi>God is the King, whose sonne was sayd to bee marryed</hi> and Christ is the sonne of that king which was marryed, and Apoc. 19, 7. <hi>Christ is that Lambe, whose marryage was sayd to bee come, and we are that spouse, which was sayd to make her selfe ready,</hi> therefore if an Argument from resemblance may doe any thing, then since the single state is but like to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles, and marriage like to Christ, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that this is better then that, and <hi>two better then one.</hi>

The Deuill is like that Egyptian, Exod. 2. that singled out one Israelite and smote him when hee was alone, but when Moses came to assist him, that Egyptian was slayne: So is the Diuell in a single combat valiant, yea many times victorious, but when a second comes to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, he takes him to his flight.

Or if her husband be about a good worke, shee must not discourage him, as Micholl did to Dauid. Or if he be about an ill worke, she must not encourage him, as Iezebel did to Achab, for then I cannot say that <hi>Two are better then one,</hi> but that <hi>one is better then two,</hi> &amp; it were good for such a man to be alone.
