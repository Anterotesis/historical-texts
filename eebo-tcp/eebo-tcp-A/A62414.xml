            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

up of a Soule and a Body like <hi>Ananias</hi> the
Puritan, only he worſhips God with both.
Hee has learn't out of the Bible to make a
Leg to the Authority of <hi>Church</hi> and State, and do's the
ſame to <hi>Heaven</hi> the ordainer and diſpenſer of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Hee ha's read the whole Story of <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
from <hi>Chriſt-Croſse</hi> to <hi>&amp; per ſe and:</hi> and yet cannot
finde <hi>Ananias</hi> the Puritan neither in <hi>A.</hi> nor <hi>B.</hi> nor <hi>C.</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62235:3"/>
nor any Age of the <hi>Chriſt-croſs-row,</hi> but quite beſide it:
The Poxe and the Plague ha's frighted him out of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi>
and Mr. PYM out of his <hi>Leg-Religion,</hi> and almoſt
his <hi>Witt.</hi> Notwithſtanding his diſtractions, hee has ſo
much wit yet left, that <hi>Ananias</hi> could not ſee his <hi>Grac<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
through it.</p>
            <p>The Apprentices give him a broad ſide as hee walkes
the Streets by crying no Biſhops, No Biſhops; and never
leave till he cries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No Biſhops too: for which when hee
is ſafe in hous'd, he repents croſſes and bleſſes himſelfe,
and curſes them as things never Chriſtened, or never
Biſhop't.</p>
            <p>To make him cry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No Biſhops, he ſayes is to boile a
Kid in the Mothers milke againſt the Law of GOD and
Nature. When he is abroad, he dares not ſpeake ſenſe
aloud, for feare hee ſhould be knockt o'th' head for't;
but <hi>hum's</hi> and <hi>haa's</hi> in God morrow, and God eeven, and
what a Clock is't. His feare leads his judgement by the
noſe, as Religion leads <hi>Ananias.</hi> All the Sciences he has
skill in but the <hi>Arithmetick</hi> of Sects; which ignorance
the Biſhops he hopes will curſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they become <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick-Lecturers.</hi>
His greateſt feare next the loſs of
one of his Parſonages, is that the City Gentle-women
will put Guſſets and Goures into the <hi>Canonicall Prayer,</hi>
to make it as much too wide for his Faith, as his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
He is ſo extreamly given to ſhort Prayers, as if
hee were ſure the Kingdome of <hi>Heaven</hi> might bee ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
and taken with a Squib: and his Wife thinks him
ſhort in all, as he is in his Oriſons; and ſo (though ſhee
ſeeme Religious in his way) Cuckolds her Beads and
Him. Hee dares take it upon his death that there ha's
not beene a Sermon preach't ſince <hi>Eighty eight</hi> that ha's

had any Theologie or Religion in it, but by Doctor <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi>
and the learned Pupils, after the Order of Saint
<hi>William</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> all Catechiſmes, but that of the
Church he counts Libels againſt Heaven, and eſteemes
them as the People do Articles of PYM. When a zealous
<hi>Woman</hi> goes to St. <hi>Antholines</hi> with her Bible under her
arme, he ſayes ſhe looks like a <hi>Gooſe</hi> with the <hi>Gyſard</hi> trnſt
under her Wing. It grieves him to heare every Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb
crow new Divinitie able to ſtartle the Lion of
the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> A Prieſt after the Order of my
Lord Major hee never lik't till now that the <hi>Browniſts</hi>
have created him Papiſt. It aſtoniſhes him to think that
his cenſurer <hi>Ananias</hi> ſhould eſteeme the bread after his
Conſecration no better then that which baits a Mouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap.
When he enters a Church, eſpecially where there
is an Altar and Organs, hee mutters to himſelfe that of
<hi>Jacob; How dreadfull is this Place! this is the Houſe of God,</hi>
and the very gate of <hi>heaven;</hi> and wonders why he ſhould
be contemn'd for a Formaliſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he ſhewes but ſo
much reverentiall feare as a Turke entring a Moſchit.
If the expreſſion of ſuch a religious feare in Gods Houſe
be not commanded and eſtabliſhed, he thinks that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and himſelfe ſhall not be beholding to the Synod
for a courteſie Six-penny broad. Except hee and many
more of his Order be elected Synoders, hee reſolves to
eſteeme their Determination no more then the <hi>Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices</hi>
doe <hi>Proclamations.</hi> He ſmells like a piece of Ruſſian
Leather of <hi>Arminius;</hi> and for that is ſuſpected of <hi>Popery,</hi>
although he lie <hi>Perdu</hi> upon his owne Wife to catch the
Roman Prieſt in an error of ſuperſtitious Chaſtiry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He
wiſhes that wee may at length ſtutt into ſome Religion
that he may eat Tyth-Pigg in peace. But one thing he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62235:4"/>
deſires above all; That the Chriſtian Sacrifice, as the
Iewiſh alwayes was, may be ſeaſon'd with Salt, the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole
of judgement and wit; and not with Puritan long-Pepper
talke. Roſemary and Bayes hee abhorres more
then <hi>Bel</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and will have none of it in his
Houſe this Chriſtmas becauſe it was prophan'd in the
triumph of thoſe holy Martyrs <hi>Burton, Prinne</hi> and <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
which hee accounts the Schiſmaticall Sectaries of
<hi>Martin Mar-Prelate.</hi> He thinks it impoſſible that a man
ſhould give a better Character of this Age, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of vs Zealots, then that Church-warden ha's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done, who tooke downe the Picture of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and
let the Aſſe upon which he rode ſtand ſtill in the <hi>Church.</hi>
Beſides all this he ha's another ſcurvy fault; he delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
what and how he ſhould ſpeake to God Almighty
in his Prayers, becauſe hee knowes not why delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is the counſell of Reaſon ſhould be ſhuffled
out of Gods Service onely, and be received and prais'd
in all things elſe. The <hi>Scotch</hi> buſineſſe lies ſtill upon his
ſtomack like a Sow-baby upon the ſtomack of a <hi>Scot;</hi> and
Doctor <hi>Baſtwick</hi> can ſee no reaſon why that ſhould make
him ſo ſick. Might hee have had his will the <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould
have had 3000000. Pounds beſtowed upon them to have
ſent them home ſooner: but now he thinks it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

in the higheſt. Moſt of his Diſcourſe is about that old
Devotion which richly endowed the Church, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
the Clergie to tip their Staves with vnvallued
