            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>interests</hi> of those many <hi>parties</hi> which, at present, keep up the <hi>Divisions</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi> are so highly <hi>concerned</hi> in the consequences of my present undertaking; And the <hi>generality</hi> of men are so visibly <hi>partial</hi> in <hi>disputes</hi> wherein <hi>interest</hi> is concerned, so much more inclinable to resent the <hi>severity</hi> of a conclusion that charges them with <hi>dangerous mistakes,</hi> than to think how much indeed it is their <hi>interest</hi> rather to <hi>beware</hi> of <hi>errors</hi> that may prove <hi>dangerous</hi> than to <hi>stand out</hi> in the defence of what they have <hi>once</hi> undertaken to defend, and how much it is therefore their <hi>interest</hi> to <hi>examine</hi> the <hi>premises</hi> with all possible <hi>accurateness</hi> and <hi>candor,</hi> from whence such <hi>conclusions</hi> are deduced; as that I cannot but expect some indications of the <hi>resentment</hi> of <hi>concerned</hi> Persons, though I have endeavoured that the way of management might be as <hi>unoffensive</hi> as was possible. Though my design be <hi>Peace,</hi> yet that it self is enough to <hi>alarm</hi> the Spirits of many in the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Age we live in, who, when they are <hi>spoken to of peace will make them ready to battle.</hi> And therefore I cannot but think my self concerned to <hi>foresee</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> such <hi>prejudices</hi> as may hinder such who most <hi>need</hi> the informations given in the present Work, either from <hi>reading</hi> them, or from <hi>benefiting</hi> by them.</p>

               <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:97904:3"/>I MUST therefore warn my Reader in the first place that when he finds the <hi>Title</hi> promise him a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning <hi>SCHISM,</hi> he do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it in the same sense as it has been considered in so many <hi>modern discourses</hi> upon that Subject between <hi>us</hi> and the <hi>Romanists.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>SCHISM</hi> not here considered as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Churches,</hi> but as between <hi>particular Members</hi> and their <hi>own Churches.</hi>
               </note> I do not here consider the <hi>question</hi> of <hi>Schism</hi> between <hi>Churches,</hi> but between <hi>Subjects</hi> separating from <hi>particular Churches</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> from which they <hi>separate.</hi> This is all for which my present design does concern me, and if my reasons prove, that <hi>Subjects</hi> separating from their own <hi>particular Churches</hi> for <hi>unsinful Impositions</hi> are <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> I shall perform what I intended. But the same reasons will not prove a <hi>Church Schismatical</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing <hi>impositions,</hi> though <hi>unsinful,</hi> from <hi>another Church.</hi> For I suppose all <hi>Churches</hi> originally <hi>equal,</hi> and that they have <hi>since</hi> submitted to <hi>prudential compacts,</hi> which though they may oblige them as long as the <hi>reason</hi> of those <hi>compacts</hi> last, and as far as the <hi>equity</hi> of those <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts</hi> may <hi>hold</hi> as to the <hi>true design</hi> of those that made them, and as far as those <hi>compacts</hi> have meddled only with the <hi>alienable rights</hi> of <hi>particular Churches</hi>; yet where any of these conditions fail there the <hi>particular Churches</hi> are at liberty to resume their <hi>antient rights.</hi> And I suppose the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>judging</hi> when these conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fail to be an <hi>unalienable right</hi> of <hi>particular Churches,</hi> and not only to judg with the <hi>judgment</hi> of <hi>private dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> but such a <hi>judgment</hi> as may be an <hi>authentick mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of her <hi>own practice.</hi>

The things which I have sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted plainly shew that the case will prove extremely different, though we consider them barely as <hi>impositions,</hi> not as <hi>sinful impositions.</hi> And to let our <hi>Romish Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi> know that I have already <hi>foreseen</hi> the use they would be likely to make of a discourse of this nature, and how <hi>wary</hi> I have therefore been of using any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that might prove more than I intended, or might <hi>hinder</hi> us from <hi>Principles</hi> sufficient for our own <hi>defence</hi> against them; I shall desire them to consult my <hi>two short Discourses</hi> published with a design to prepare the way for this Work. There they will find such <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>defence</hi> of <hi>our Church</hi> against them, which will not clash with any thing said here, which I verily <hi>believe true,</hi> and which being <hi>supposed true,</hi> I also conceive ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>sufficient</hi> to <hi>vindicate</hi> our <hi>Church</hi> from their imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>SCHISM</hi> for our not <hi>communicating</hi> with them.

The <hi>extraordinary</hi> means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may be <hi>assured</hi> of our <hi>Salvation</hi> are conjectures concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Divine Uncovenanted goodness.</hi> Concerning these it is proved. <hi>1.</hi> That the <hi>assurance</hi> grounded on these conjectures
<pb facs="tcp:97904:16"/>
is not such as can afford any solid <hi>comfort</hi> to the Person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. The extreme difficulty of making application of what might be concluded from this <hi>Divine Uncovenanted goodness</hi> to particular cases. §. <hi>V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X.</hi> The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars necessary for <hi>assurance</hi> in this case are such as God is not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to by his <hi>Uncovenanted goodness. §. XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV, XVI.XVII. 2.</hi> The <hi>comfort</hi> that might otherwise have been expected from these <hi>conjectures</hi> is not comparable to that which may be had from those general <hi>ordinary means</hi> which God hath provided for by <hi>express Revelation.</hi> This proved by three Degrees. §. <hi>XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII. 3.</hi> These expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations from <hi>extraordinaries</hi> not seasonable in our Adversaries case who might obtein the <hi>ordinary means</hi> by concessions not <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. §.

VI, VII. 2. Premisal,</hi> That it cannot be expected that this Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> should be as necessary as that of <hi>Baptism. §. VIII.</hi> The <hi>necessity</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> to <hi>Salvation</hi> proved from the <hi>Mystical style</hi> by which this whole matter is expressed in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> And that by these degrees: <hi>1.</hi> The <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>particular Members</hi> of the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is in the <hi>Scripture</hi> supposed to depend on a constant <hi>repetition</hi> of <hi>vital influences</hi> from the common <hi>vital Principle,</hi> as the <hi>Life</hi> of particular <hi>Members</hi> in the <hi>Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> does. §. <hi>X. 2.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> also supposes the <hi>Life</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Members</hi> to depend as much on their <hi>conjunction</hi> with the <hi>whole Mystical Body,</hi> in order to their receiving these <hi>repeated influences,</hi> as the <hi>Life</hi> of particular <hi>Members</hi> in the <hi>natural Body</hi> depends on their <hi>conjunction</hi> with the <hi>whole natural Body. §. X. 3.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> with which it was supposed so <hi>necessary</hi> for particular <hi>Members</hi> to be <hi>united</hi> in order to their participation of this <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> is plainly supposed to be the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>this World,</hi> and that <hi>visible Society</hi> of them which joyned in the same <hi>publick exercises</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in that Age when these things were written. §. <hi>XI, XII. 4.</hi> The <hi>Reasons</hi> used by the <hi>Sacred Writers</hi> for this purpose are such as concern the <hi>Church</hi> as a <hi>Church,</hi> and so as suitable to the later Ages of the <hi>Church</hi> as those <hi>earlier</hi> ones wherein they were used first. §. <hi>XIII. 5.</hi> In order to this <hi>Mystical Union</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> it is absolutely <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> as far as an <hi>ordinary means</hi> can be so, that we partake of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> This proved from <hi>1 Cor. x.17. §.

for any to neglect any <hi>means</hi> of continuing his <hi>Union</hi> with his own <hi>particular Church,</hi> unless he may be <hi>assured</hi> that, whilest he <hi>wants</hi> it, he may notwithstanding continue <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>Catholick Church. §.

XXIV. 4.</hi> Hence it follows, That all that can be done by <hi>other Churches</hi> receiving a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>separated</hi> from the <hi>Communion</hi> of his <hi>own Church,</hi> can

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Peace of the Church is a thing at present so extremely desirable, not only in regard of its <hi>intrinsick Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness,</hi> but its many happy <hi>influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> on our <hi>dearest Interests,</hi> not only <hi>Sacred</hi> but <hi>Secular,</hi> that he must be as <hi>Imprudent</hi> as <hi>Impious,</hi> as <hi>Inhumane</hi> as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconscientious,</hi> as little deserving the name of a <hi>Friend of his Country,</hi> as of a <hi>Lover of his Religion,</hi> who can still be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for a design (I do not say of such <hi>worth,</hi> but) of such <hi>importance for our settlement.</hi> For though there are few so <hi>Prudent</hi> as to foresee Inconveniences at a distance, or of so <hi>tender sense</hi> as to be vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned for Absurdities in Reasoning, or of so <hi>Spiritual</hi> an <hi>apprehension</hi> as to be moved by the purely <hi>Spiritual</hi> Threats or Rewards of the Gospel; yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is apt to be affected by his own <hi>Experiences.</hi> And accordingly we find, not only the <hi>Practicers,</hi> but, the very <hi>Enemies,</hi> of Religion to be now more than ordinarily inclinable to a Reconciliation: Not only such who are endued with that <hi>Modesty</hi> which would hinder Men from Imperious Dogmatizing or easie Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97904:30"/>
of Dissenters; or that <hi>ardent Charity</hi> for their Brethren of the same Profession, which would hinder them from either giving or taking any Offence which were by any Lawful means avoidable; or that <hi>Humility</hi> which would incline unskilful Persons to submit to the Judgment of Persons more skilful, at least in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherein they might be convinced of their own Unskilfulness, and would make them diffident, if not in their <hi>Judgment,</hi> yet, at least in their <hi>Practice,</hi> when contrary to the sense of the more Judicious (which would very much conduce to secure the Church from disturbing Innovations) or that Pious Prudence which would make Men especially cautious of Errors, either in Opinions or Practices, which would prove extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily <hi>mischievous,</hi> if Erroneous, as those must do which are destructive of the <hi>Government</hi> of that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to which the Erroneous Persons are related, and yet more especially Cautious in such Cases wherein their <hi>past Experiences</hi> might be sufficient warnings against <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Inconveniences,</hi> as they may here, where Men may find how little available the goodness of their Intention is for preventing the dangerous Events of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, when they have found themselves transported or deluded into Events very distant from their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal designs. But even the <hi>Enemies of Religion</hi> seem so far, at least, desirous of the Reconciliation of the Religious, as they think nothing of Religion worth contending for with that eagerness and bitterness which they find so very prejudicial to their worldly Interests. And considering that Providence has thus found out inducements to prevail with all Parties and all Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests to be thus Inclinable to <hi>receive,</hi> if not Industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to <hi>promote</hi> and <hi>offer,</hi> terms of Reconciliation; it will now less than ever become the <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> the <hi>Subjects of the Prince of Peace,</hi> the <hi>Professors of the Gospel

And I am the rather induced to believe that this is indeed the best way of managing these Disputes, because it does not only best comply with, and preserve, that temper which would most of all accomplish an useful Controvertist, and best fit him for publick Service; but also, because it will in regard of the Considerations now mentioned, answer the most Prudent Advices for the manner of their manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

they digress to <hi>Personal Quarrels</hi>? And such, as they are perfectly <hi>useless</hi> to the <hi>Publick,</hi> so they have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill influence on such as might otherwise prove <hi>useful.</hi> For by that means they are blinded in the search of Truth, and indisposed for following their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions where they know it, and inclined to engage the Publick in their private animosities. It makes them favourable to such Principles, not which are <hi>true,</hi> but which are <hi>for their purpose</hi>; It naturally loosens and and emasculates that closeness of Discourse which is absolutely necessary for our security where the <hi>Truth</hi> is <hi>obscure,</hi> and the <hi>Error dangerous</hi>; It takes them off from that <hi>awe of Conscience</hi> which would both quicken their <hi>Diligence,</hi> and oblige them to <hi>Sincerity</hi>; It na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally diverts them from <hi>sober reasonings</hi> to <hi>Popular flourishes</hi> and <hi>Rhetorical Arts of insinuation.</hi> And the shame of owning their <hi>mistakes</hi> in matters wherein they had been extremely <hi>confident,</hi> or of <hi>yielding</hi> to a <hi>despised,</hi> yet <hi>upbraiding,</hi> Adversary, or of losing their <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> in a Party which had admired them, when they cannot be <hi>Ingenuous</hi> at any lower rate than that of a <hi>publick Penance</hi> for their Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, does many times necessitate them to poor and palpable contrivances of Evasion.

To which might have been added that <hi>averseness to conviction,</hi> to which such a way of dealing does naturally incline the Adversaries for whose conviction such Discourses are designed; how little they can value their <hi>Authority</hi> when they find them so palpably swayed by other motives than the

               <hi>merit of the Cause</hi> and the <hi>real conviction of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi>; with what <hi>regret</hi> they must be likely to bear with any <hi>Victory,</hi> though even of <hi>Truth</hi> it self, from such an Adversary who gives such indications of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness</hi> and <hi>hostility</hi> against their very Persons; how very <hi>unwilling</hi> they must be to prove <hi>mistaken</hi> when they must expect to be <hi>upbraided with their mistakes</hi>; how glad of any shifts that may silence either their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries or their own Consciences.

For considering that the <hi>Catholick Peace</hi> of the Christian Churches within themselves and with each other is an End not only <hi>worthy</hi> of the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> but <hi>actually designed</hi> by him; and considering that it is not agreeable to the Divine Prudence that he should have designed an <hi>End</hi> without <hi>Means,</hi> or with <hi>Means repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to it; and particularly in our Case that he should design an <hi>End</hi> to be procured by the <hi>Church</hi> (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in all Bodies Politick whatsoever is necessary for the preservation of its publick Peace is inseparably and peculiarly the Province of its <hi>Governours</hi>) without <hi>Means in the power of the Church</hi> for procuring it, or with <hi>Institutions directly contrary</hi>; and considering withal that God in dealing with the Church, has not considered her <hi>Abstractly,</hi> but as she is at present in this Life, under all her <hi>frailties</hi> and <hi>disadvantageous Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi>: We may therefore argue both <hi>Positively,</hi> that whatever is necessary for preserving this <hi>Peace of the Church in this Life</hi> as consisting of Persons, though <hi>well-meaning,</hi> yet generally <hi>frail,</hi> and obnoxious both to <hi>mistakes</hi> and <hi>Prejudices,</hi> that has certainly been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by God; and <hi>Negatively,</hi> that what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily destructive of that <hi>Peace,</hi> (I mean with a <hi>Moral Necessity</hi> considering the frailties of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, even of well-meaning Persons) that is certainly contrary to the true design of God. So that though we had no other Argument against our Adversaries <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> but this, that <hi>Catholick Peace</hi>

I am aware what ill Arguments some Men have deduced from this Topick, whilst they argue what God <hi>must have done,</hi> or <hi>not have done,</hi> independently on Revelation. But then I consider also that their mistakes are not deduced from this Proposition in the <hi>general</hi> and <hi>indefinite</hi> way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have expressed it, but from their <hi>particular Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> whilst they gratuitously presume either that an <hi>End</hi> was <hi>intended by God</hi> which was not, or that some <hi>Means</hi> was <hi>conducive</hi> or <hi>necessary</hi> for it, which has proved otherwise on a particular Examination. And I confess that before this can be applyed to our Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brethrens Case, it will need several other more particular improvements.

Consciences were sufficiently convinced of the Indifferency of such meats in regard of themselves, to yield their own Right rather than offend their weaker Brethren, who might take their eating them for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Idol, and might be tempted not only to hard and undeserved censures of such a Precedent, but might be induced, by Authorities so revered by them, to believe such honours innocent, and by degrees to give those honours which themselves conceived to reach the Idol, which, in regard of Consciences so perswaded could be no better than downright Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In such a Case as this he professes himself so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the welfare, even of such weak Brethren, and so willing to abridg himself even of his own Liberty where it might prove prejudicial to it, that he would rather never eat at all than scandalize a weak Brother by doing so.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> VIII.13.</note> Which way of accommodation seems rather to silence the Disputes than to decide them, and is thought as suitable to the office of a Peace-maker in these Controversies which occasion our present Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as in those which occasioned those Discourses of the Apostles, both of them being alike conceived to concern only things indifferent.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XXXI</label> BUT the Answer will be very easie, whether we consider the <hi>reason of the thing,</hi> or the <hi>Authority of the Apostle.</hi> I confess it is very agreeable with the Office of a <hi>Peace-maker</hi> not to interpose with any earnestness in such Controversies which are not momentous for <hi>Peace,</hi> and wherein his earnest interposition may weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Authority with that Party with which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages, especially then when he foresees his Authority not to be so great with the contrary Party as to oblige them to acquiesce in his determination (which is a Consideration of more efficacy now when no particular Person whatsoever can pretend to such an Authority
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97904:45"/>
with those of a different Perswasion as the Apostle might then) and I confess withal that this is a Case very applicable to many of our present Controversies, that either they are no more than mutual <hi>misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,</hi> or if <hi>real</hi> (like those in these Texts) yet they are not worth contending for, especially when they are debated betwixt private Persons, whereof nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are under the others Jurisdiction. But does it therefore follow that, even in such as these a <hi>Peace-maker</hi> may not declare his Opinion, and offer his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in a way Modest and unprovoking? Nay is it not warrantable by the Apostles Precedent, who plainly takes their part who <hi>esteemed all meats alike,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV.14.</note> the Controversie then so fiercely disputed? Or do they, think it unbecoming a <hi>Peace-maker</hi> so far to interess himself in a Party, as to let Dissenters understand the reason they had, rather to yield to those for whom he had declared? Did not the Apostle even so, whilst he defends his own Party as <hi>strong,</hi>

                  <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</note> and only excuses the other as tollerable in their <hi>weakness</hi> and frailty?

Is it that, though we do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to, yet, we also do not disswade Superiors from, the prosecution of Dissenters? But this is plainly none of the Apostles Case, who had not to do with Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt Superiors and Subjects, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt private co-ordinate Christians. So he argues: <hi>Who art thou that Judgest anothers Servant?</hi>

For sure it will not be denyed but that there are some Controversies of that sort, that, Men differing in their <hi>Judgments</hi> concerning them, and <hi>Practicing</hi> consequently to such <hi>Differences,</hi> must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to violate the publick Peace.

It is easie to discern how improperly the Topicks, on which our Adversaries would have us insist, are applicable here, so easie as that I cannot think it necessary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in them. Nay indeed the very same reason which would prove it advisable for Controvertists not to abett Parties in matters of inferiour concernment, will, I do not say, prove it only <hi>advisable,</hi> but <hi>oblige</hi> them to do it here. For can there be a more suitable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a <hi>Peace-maker</hi> than to shew his Zeal against the <hi>obstacles of Peace</hi>? And can any <hi>obstacles of Peace</hi> be more mischievous than such as necessarily engage Men into <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Factions,</hi> and when they are once so engaged make their differences <hi>irreconcilable</hi>? And what can more effectually do this than <hi>Dividing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>? For what can more <hi>seriously terrifie</hi> well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons from their complyances with <hi>Men,</hi> than to think that such complyances cannot be purchased at an easier rate than the loss of their Peace with <hi>God</hi>? Or what can make them more implacable to one another, than when all <hi>Moderation</hi> is interpreted as a defect of <hi>Zeal</hi>? Nay when they are not only actually so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97904:46"/>
but even in their cooler humors can have no reason to be perswaded otherwise as long as they were serious in the belief of their first Dividing Principles? For such there are no other Means of making them Peaceable than either the <hi>Contradiction,</hi> or the <hi>better Information,</hi> of their present Consciences; and I am confident our Brethren themselves are more Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than to assert the former only for avoiding the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But besides this agreeableness to the Office of a <hi>Peace-maker</hi> to engage in Controversies necessary to be abetted for the interest of Peace, I might have added farther, that it is very suitable to the Office of a <hi>Lover of Peace</hi> to be favourable to such endeavours; which how near it will concern our dissenting Brethren as they would approve themselves <hi>Lovers</hi> of it, themselves will easily understand without any application of mine.

So that this real Prejudice which is likely to be incurred by the Subject in Case of Disobedience, is very necessary to be discovered from the nature of the Constitution of the Church, as it is expressed in the Scripture, even in order to the clearing the Nature of the Duty, and the extent of the obligation of this Authority.</p>

For seeing that a Society of this nature cannot imply any <hi>External Coercion</hi> of the <hi>External Act,</hi> all the Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion she can pretend to, can be no other than a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of those Priviledges which are enjoyed and may be pretended to by virtue of her <hi>visible Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> and an exposing the Person so deprived to all the Calamities consequent to such a Deprivation.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>II</label> FIRST therefore, <hi>for proving our Obligation to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into External Communion with a visible Church, and of that part of it for which we are at present more particularly concerned, it is not requisite to prove that we must otherwise be excluded from all hopes of Salvation, but it is abundantly sufficient to make it appear that we cannot otherwise be so well assured of it; And this want of so good Assurance of Salvation out of a Church-Communion as may be had in it, is sufficient to oblige a Subject to submit to all unsinful Impositions (how grievous soever otherwise) of them who have the power of such a Communion, rather than suffer himself to be excluded from Communion by them for want of such submission.</hi> Here are two things to be considered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly: 1. Negatively, that <hi>for this purpose it is not requisite to prove that we must otherwise be excluded from all hopes of Salvation.</hi> For supposing that their <hi>exclusion</hi> from all <hi>hopes</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> could not indeed be <hi>proved</hi>; Yet what possible security can we have, upon that account, to conclude that it is not <hi>true?</hi> It is certain many things are actually <hi>true</hi> whose truth may not appear to us who are so short sighted in our Informations, and so easily seduced in our Reasonings. And the uttermost that, in any <hi>Prudence</hi> can be concluded from this way of arguing is, only that, for ought we know, the Salvation of such may be <hi>possible,</hi> and that, considering the <hi>unavoidableness</hi> of this case to some <hi>particular Persons,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Goodness</hi> and <hi>Indulgence</hi> in such cases as are <hi>really</hi> unavoidable, and the Divine <hi>Arbitrary freedom,</hi> if not in <hi>inflicting</hi> Punishments, yet, at least, in <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing</hi> them, and in the dispensation of his <hi>Favours,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his <hi>Covenant,</hi> it may be also <hi>Probable.</hi> But what then? Can any of our Brethren assure themselves that this is their case, and that they are in these <hi>Pardonable Cercumstances,</hi> and intituled to these <hi>extrordinary unpromised favours?</hi> No prudent consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative person can think that they are as easily excusable who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97904:57"/>
find conviction, when <hi>offer'd</hi> to them, as they who never had it offered. And is not this exactly their case? If they should prove mistaken, and they should really, as we suppose them to do, deprive themselves, by their separation, of the <hi>Ordinary means</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi>; can they to excuse themselves pretend that they want any evidence of which the Cause is capable, or of which their dissenting Brethren are able to informe them?</p>
            <p>NOR must they think that the supposition of their being mist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aken is precarious or unseasonable here where we are discoursing concerning the excusableness of such a mistake so supposed. For this is sufficient to shew that the confessed <hi>excusableness</hi> of the case of some Persons not communicating with the Church, and consequently the <hi>possibility</hi> of the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>such Persons,</hi> is not sufficient to infer the possibility of the Salvation of our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> unless their case be proved equally pardonable with that of those whose Salvation is acknowledged <hi>possible</hi>; so that in both cases a mistake is plainly supposed, and its excusableness is the only thing disputed of.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

None can think them who separate only for <hi>indifferent Practises</hi> and <hi>probable Opinions</hi> as excusable as they who do not <hi>separate,</hi> but are <hi>driven out,</hi> because they cannot profess to <hi>believe</hi> gross <hi>Falshoods,</hi> and to <hi>approve</hi> undefensible <hi>Immoralities.</hi> None can think them who <hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97904:58"/>
Can they still assure themselves so well of their Title to them as to venture all that is pretious and valuable, their very Souls and their Eternity upon it? If notwithstanding all these heavy ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, <hi>Schismaticks</hi> may still be rationally confident of the security of their condition; I must then indeed confess that <hi>Schism</hi> will be no more than a <hi>Theological Scare-crow</hi> (as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for it has been pleased to stile it) and it will then be so generally true that their Salvation is <hi>possible,</hi>

               </note> as that the Cases must be rare where they can be presumed likely to fail of it, which must perfectly overthrow the terror and abhorrency which God as a <hi>Prudent Governour</hi> must necessarily be supposed to have obliged men to, against a Sin of so extremely malignant influence on the <hi>Publick</hi> as this is.</p>

Who would not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choose that side on which the most probable presumtions lay, and where fewest miscarried? Who would not think it safer to yield to any Imposition, how <hi>heavy</hi> so ever it were, if it were not directly <hi>sinful</hi> than so much as to <hi>hazard</hi> the guilt of a sin so criminal and mischievous as <hi>real Schism</hi> is? Especially considering that the cases wherein a Possibility of Salvation is to be allowed to persons out of Ecclesiastical Communion, must be rare and difficult, that the condition it self may be rendred formidable; and the very hazarding such a guilt rather than yield to an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> that is not <hi>sinful</hi> is certainly none of the most excusing Circumstances. Though it were possible for such a Person to nourish some <hi>hopes,</hi> yet it is not so easily intelligible how he could rationally enjoy any <hi>comfort.</hi>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>VI</label> THIS I am sure seems agreeable to the common sense of mankind, and I think I might appeal to the Judgment of our dissenting Brethren themselves concerning it, where they are disinteressed. It is well known what advantages the <hi>Romanists</hi> make of the Ingenuity of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a <hi>Possibility of Salvation</hi> to particular Persons of their Communion; and it is as well known how unreasonable as well as unequal they are thought by <hi>Protestants</hi> in this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97904:58"/>
And yet there are no Arguments producible by them to prove it unreasonable, which may not be applyed to shew the unconclusiveness of our dissenting Brethrens supposal of the security of some persons out of the <hi>External Communion</hi> of the <hi>visible Church</hi> to prove the <hi>Prudence</hi> of their venturing on it. For will they say that, notwithstanding <hi>this Salvability</hi> of <hi>particular Persons</hi> in the <hi>Romish Communion,</hi> yet it is so little to be ascribed to their being of that Communion, as that their being so is rather a <hi>Prejudice,</hi> than an Advantage, to their <hi>Salvation,</hi> to be rather <hi>excused,</hi> than <hi>recommended</hi>; nay that their <hi>danger</hi> is so great, and the escapes so rare, and so incapable to be made out to the <hi>comfort</hi> of the Person concerned, as that not only that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot <hi>Prudently</hi> be chosen upon equal terms where a better may be had, but that all <hi>tolerable terms,</hi> that is, all that are not <hi>sinful,</hi> are rather to be born with than that a better should not be actually obtained? And is not this a plain Confession that a bare <hi>possibility</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> out of the <hi>external Communion</hi> of the <hi>visible Church</hi> is not sufficient to excuse them from submitting to all <hi>lawful,</hi> however <hi>inconvenient,</hi> terms of obtaining this <hi>external Communion?</hi> Especially when it may appear that this state of wanting this external Communion, is, and may be, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this Argument, as <hi>prejudicial</hi> to <hi>Salvation,</hi> and as <hi>dangerous,</hi> and as <hi>rarely escaped,</hi> and as little capable of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string <hi>comfort</hi> to the Party concerned, as that of <hi>Popery.</hi> And this is as much as I am concerned for at present, only to shew the weakness of this Argument, from the acknowledged salvability of some particular <hi>Persons</hi> out of the external Communion of the visible Church to overthrow the necessity of our joyning with it in order to our comfort and assurance of Salvation; whence it also appears clearly how little we are concerned to disprove that <hi>Salvability.</hi>

To shew farther <hi>Positively, that for proving this Obligation to enter into the</hi> external Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a visible Church <hi>it is sufficient to shew that without such an</hi> external Communion <hi>we cannot so</hi> well <hi>be assured of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and that this supposition alone of our</hi> less security <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it is sufficient to prove us</hi> obliged <hi>to submit to all terms not directly</hi> sinful, <hi>however</hi> in-expedient, <hi>in Order to the procuring this</hi> external Communion.

our own Interests, and what may prove conducive thereunto, and to avoid such things as may prove prejudicial to them, as well as an <hi>Authoritative Obligation</hi> to submit to the Impositions of any Superiors whatsoever. Nay this <hi>Rational Obligation</hi> is so far from falling short of that which is <hi>Authoritative,</hi> as some less wary persons may conceive, as that on the contrary it is the Foundation of all Authoritative Obligation. For all <hi>Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Sanctions</hi> are imposed on Subjects only in vertue of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> annexed to them, so that, as he who undervalues the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> can have no <hi>rational inducement</hi> to submit to the <hi>Laws,</hi> so the only Original reason of valuing the rewards and punishments can only be the value of those interests which are concerned in them. And as, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, this kind of Obligation is generally greater than that which is <hi>Legal,</hi> so there cannot be a securer measure for discerning the greater or lesser Obligation of things of this kind than by the greater or lesser momentousness of the Interests concerned in them.

That all terms <hi>not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly sinful,</hi> however <hi>in expedient,</hi> are necessary to be submitted to in Order to the securing this great Interest of our Salvation. For as this obligation to secure our <hi>greatest Interests</hi> in the <hi>first place</hi> is the <hi>first fundamental Principle</hi> of all <hi>Laws,</hi> so the <hi>second</hi> is this, <hi>That for securing our greater Interests we are in prudence obliged to yield those which are inferior.</hi> For this is the reason why we are obliged to Laws even contrary to our own humours and interests of lesser concernment, because the Interest yielded in obedience to Laws is less than the Interest procured by the rewards and other advantages of the society established by them, and because the prejudice incurred by the performance of Duty is less than the Prejudice of the Penalty, or of the Dissolution, or disturbance, of the Society it self. Seeing therefore that all
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97904:59"/>
terms <hi>not sinful</hi> are lesser evils than the loss of our Salvation, it will follow by this second fundamental Principle of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties that they are all to be yielded as far as such yielding may prove necessary for the security of this. But because it is not so much the hazard of our Salvation <hi>it</hi> self, as the hazard of our <hi>assurance</hi> of it, and consequently of our <hi>present comfort</hi> of it, that we can so properly take for granted in our present discourse, therefore it will concern us to shew that though our Condition were never so secure in <hi>it self,</hi> yet even the loss of our <hi>Assurance</hi> that it is so, and of that <hi>Evidence</hi> which is requisite for ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>prudent rational Assurance,</hi> is a mischief to us greater than any we can suffer by the most, I do not say <hi>Imprudent,</hi> but <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive, Ecclesiastical Constitutions,</hi> if they be not <hi>sinful.</hi> Which will therefore by these principles of Obligation, oblige us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to yield to all compliances of this nature than to hazard the <hi>loss</hi> or considerable <hi>diminution</hi> even of this <hi>Assurance.</hi>

These things I conceive so easy as that I cannot think it necessary to digres so far as to prove them: and accordingly we find that no man can be rationally induced to <hi>enter</hi> into any <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> or to <hi>submit</hi> to any <hi>Impositions</hi> barely on account of the real <hi>conduciveness</hi> of such <hi>submissions</hi> to his greater Interests,

unless he may be rationally convinced that they are his <hi>real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi> which are promoted by such <hi>submissions</hi> and that they are <hi>really promoted</hi> by them. So that, in order to our present design, it comes to the same purpose in reference to our present actings, whether we lose our Salvation <hi>it self,</hi> or lose the <hi>comfort</hi> of being secured of it by our being deprived of the <hi>External Communion</hi> of the <hi>visible Church Submissions,</hi> and that they are <hi>really promoted</hi> by them.

to our purpose it is what they discourse concerning the <hi>Salvability</hi> of <hi>particular Persons</hi> either <hi>out of</hi> Church Society, or <hi>independently</hi> on it.

Nay I very much doubt whether they themselves, when the Case is thus truly stated, will differ from us in asserting the much better security of a <hi>Communicant,</hi> where Communion may be had on terms <hi>not sinful,</hi> than of a Person out of Communion.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:97904:61"/>
suffers himself, to avoid such yielding, to be transported into such a violation of his Duty. Our Saviours words are very express, That <hi>whosoever shall break the least of</hi> his <hi>Commandments,</hi>

               <note place="margin">St. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.10.</note> And certainly he that is so, cannot be <hi>so well assured</hi> of his Salvation. And if it be not so much as the violation of a <hi>Positive Command</hi> to abstain from <hi>actual Communion,</hi> I do not see how they can avoid denying the Divine Authority to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the Sacraments (for if they acknowledged it to be so they could not deny the Sinfullness of resisting it) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently denying the perpetual Obligation of the Sacraments.

That we be, upon our own <hi>Endeavours,</hi> assured of those <hi>Supernatural Divine Assistances</hi> without which our unassisted <hi>natural Endeavours</hi> are not likely alone to prove sufficient. For
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97904:63"/>
               <hi>Rewards</hi> promised to <hi>impossible performances</hi> cannot afford us any <hi>comfort,</hi> and without these Assistances our Duty would prove <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> to us. And yet, notwithstanding these Assistances, we are still obnoxious to so many inadvertencies and impure mixtures by reason of the faint concurrence of our Wills, as might render our best performances unacceptable if God should deal in rigor with them, so that even these Assistances themselves could not sufficiently secure us of the Event, unless 3. We may also be Assured further that neither the frequent Imperfections and faileurs to which the most regular Lives here are obnoxious shall be rigorously insisted on to the Prejudice of the principal Duties to which they do adhere; nor that even those lapses into Sins, to which Sincerely-meaning Persons are sometimes inclinable, shall hinder their reception again upon a serious <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> And yet further after all Heaven is a <hi>Supernatural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and therefore not <hi>due</hi> nor <hi>proportionable,</hi> to our performance of Duty though it had been more accurate than we can pretend it is; and therefore it is requisite 4. That we be assured actually of these <hi>Supernatural rewards</hi> on <hi>performance</hi> of these <hi>Duties,</hi> which, though performed by the assistance of Divine Grace, and expiated from their appendent weaknesses and Imperfections, do very much fall short of an adaequate proportion to so glorious a reward. These are the true inducements to all those Duties which are required of us in the Gospel, and upon these depends all that <hi>rational comfort</hi> of our Consciences which we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving in this Life even from the performance of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore those are the Means of our Salvation by which we may be secured of them.</p>

the Gospel, at least in regard of the greatest part of Mankind, no better than such indefinite Conjectures concerning the Divine Goodness, yet God may alter that Case, and actually has done it since the Gospel, and clear and express Revelations of his Will when they are made are as capable of being the <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> whereby Mankind may assure themselves of their Security in these Particulars as those indefinite Conjectures to which they had been necessitated formerly for want of better Evidence. But we do not call <hi>express Revelation</hi> an <hi>Extraordinary Means,</hi> though it had been concerning a <hi>particular Case</hi> which is the only possible pretence for calling it Extraordinary.</p>

And therefore all the Assurance of which a Person is capable whose Case is so singular as that it cannot be Judged of by the general provisions of the Gospel, and who therefore can derive no comfort from any Topick deducible from thence, can only be grounded on those general indefinite Notions of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodness,</hi> whereby he is ready to <hi>pardon</hi> unavoidable fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to <hi>accept</hi> of our Wills and sincere designs for Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance even <hi>in order to the reward</hi> which he had designed for us upon performance, when it is not our own fault that we are hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from <hi>actual performance.</hi> I shall therefore endeavour to shew 1.

Nor will I deny further that even after God has been pleased to provide better for us Ordinarily, by admitting us into Covenant with him, and by giving us express Revelations, yet he may be merciful to <hi>particular Persons</hi> wanting the <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> with out any fault of their own, that is, when they are in a place where they cannot be had at all, or where their <hi>Fallible Superiors</hi> are so unreasonable as that they cannot be admitted to them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Sinful complyances.</hi> This is a thing so universally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, as that it is not denyed by the <hi>Romanists</hi> themselves who are the most rigorous Assertors of strict Discipline, and blind Obedience, who hold Ordinary Superiors generally <hi>Fallible,</hi> and others Fallible at least in <hi>matters of Fact,</hi> of which kind some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is generally mixed in most exercises of <hi>Ecclesiastical Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi> And I am so sensible that this is an undue deference to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Powers to make all their Censures even where mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken

For though it be indeed most certain that God is <hi>good,</hi> and that his <hi>Goodness</hi> does exceed infinitely that of the best natured Men; yet it is withal as certain that he is not <hi>Fond,</hi> and that his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> must be reconciled, not only with his other Attributes, but also the <hi>Intrinsick Merit</hi> of the thing, especially as it may have influence on the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> and particularly on that of <hi>Mankind,</hi> that is, that his <hi>Goodness</hi> cannot prompt him to do any thing but what, on some of these accounts, is <hi>really rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.</hi> Now in this regard many things may be so pernicious, not only in respect of their <hi>intrinsick malignity,</hi> but also of the ill influence of their Example for encouraging others by their <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity,</hi> as that even his <hi>Goodness</hi> may not hinder him from an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to punish them.

concerning any particular Action; and withal considering the weakness of our Faculties either for discerning or judging with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prejudice; and Considering that what may indeed be great in regard of Us or that Society for which we are concerned, may yet be very little in comparison of the great designs of God for the Universal good of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and on the contrary; so that it may be as <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Obliging,</hi> for any thing we know to the contrary, to destroy whole Nations for the good of Mankind in general, as it is confessedly obliging, notwithstanding any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Obligingness of <hi>Goodness</hi> to pardon, to destroy many Criminals for the good of a particular Nation; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering particularly what Liberty our dissenting Brethrens <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinistical Principles</hi> allow God in the actual exercise, not only of his <hi>Justice,</hi> but, his <hi>Soveraign Dominion,</hi> notwithstanding any <hi>Obligingness</hi> of his <hi>Goodness</hi> to the contrary; and Lastly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Sin of <hi>Schism,</hi> of which they must prove guilty if by their own faults they are deprived of actual Communion, is of that sort which is mischievous to the <hi>Publick</hi> and for whose Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment God is therefore more concerned, and wherein his Relation of a Governour confines that Liberty he might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have of pardoning it: I say, all these things being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially considered, it cannot be thought so easy a matter to assure him of his good condition that, upon any account so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is deprived of actual Communion, as our Brethren con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>

For by rewarding them in the other World God sufficiently corresponds with his natural <hi>Goodness</hi>; and yet by making their condition uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in this World he does no more than what becomes him as a <hi>Governour</hi> to deter others from imitating them without the like necessity; Seeing nothing but a like necessity can make it any way Prudent to venture on a State in it self so extremely dangerous and uncomfortable.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XI</label> BUT besides this extreme difficulty in making application to particular Cases even in those very Instances wherein God may be supposed <hi>Obliged,</hi> by his <hi>natural Goodness</hi> to do something for them (without which <hi>particular application</hi> it is impossible that <hi>particular Persons</hi> should enjoy any solid comfort) I consider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the particulars now mentioned, for which we are at present concerned, are such as purely depend on his <hi>Arbitrary pleasure,</hi> and to which he is not obliged by that <hi>Beneficence</hi> which is natural to him as he is the <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of the World. And when this is proved it will then appear how little ground there can be for any to be confident of any comfort in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition so as to venture on it on any <hi>avoidable,</hi> that is, on any <hi>unsinful</hi> conditions. For how can any one assure himself of Gods actual will in things depending on his Arbitrary disposal without particular express Revelation? And I have already given warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that that is not to be expected in this Case of <hi>Extraordinary Means</hi> of which I am now discoursing. And yet this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear true in all the Particulars now mentioned.
<hi rend="margQuotes">For neither is he <hi>obliged</hi> by this <hi>Natural Beneficence</hi> to do any <hi>good</hi> to his Creature as <hi>Offending,</hi> but only as <hi>Obedient</hi>; Nor does any necessary reason <hi>oblige</hi> his <hi>natural Goodness</hi> to <hi>pardon</hi> that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of which his Creature must be supposed Guilty Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to his Indulgence; Nor, if he would <hi>pardon</hi> the <hi>offence,</hi> does his natural Goodness <hi>oblige</hi> him to give his <hi>further assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> for <hi>future Obedience</hi>; Nor, if he would do this, is he <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>reward</hi> his Creature having once <hi>offended,</hi> and much less to accept of an <hi>imperfect</hi> instead of a <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> in order to a reward; Nor, if he would be further pleased to

I desire it may be remembred that I am not now speaking of the Divine Goodness as <hi>inducing,</hi> but as <hi>Obliging,</hi> God, that is, only of that precise degree of <hi>Goodness</hi> which is necessary to be exerted by him if he would approve himself a <hi>gracious God</hi> and a <hi>good Governour.</hi> And so the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will proceed with greater cogency. For if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing our <hi>Sins</hi> God be <hi>Obliged</hi> by his <hi>natural Goodness</hi> still to do us <hi>good,</hi> and especially if he be obliged to shew his <hi>Goodness</hi> to us in the instances now mentioned, <hi>to forgive us our Sins and to receive us to Favour and Rewards,</hi> &amp;c. So that he cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himself a <hi>good God,</hi> and a <hi>gracious Governour,</hi> without it (and it is impossible that he should not act according to the <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of that <hi>natural Goodness,</hi> as impossible as it is for him to cease to be a <hi>good God,</hi> and a <hi>gracious Governour</hi>) than it will be plain that our <hi>Sins</hi> can prove no hindrances to his <hi>Goodness</hi> to us.

For my present design it is abundantly sufficient that by the same reason whereby we Judg any thing else <hi>free</hi> to God. (and it must be a great violence to our own Faculties and a contradiction to the Current of the Scripture totally to deny the <hi>Divine Liberty</hi>) we have also reason to believe that he <hi>freely</hi> distributes the good things for which we are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent concerned.

               <hi>free</hi> to him would be only this, that we should conceive those things as <hi>free</hi> to him for which <hi>we knew</hi> no necessarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging reason, and we must necessarily be ignorant of such a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in such things which exceeded our natural capacities. And therefore considering that, Antecedently to <hi>Positive Revelation,</hi> the only reason which we can conceive as <hi>obligatory</hi> to God, to do any good to his Creature, is his Relation of a <hi>Creator</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> to it, whatsoever is not <hi>obligatory</hi> to him on these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts must, in this way of proceeding, be conceived as <hi>free</hi> to him. At least our <hi>Ignorance</hi> of any <hi>obligatory Cause</hi> is perfectly sufficient for my present design, to shew how little ground of comfort we can have from such an expectation on these Terms.</p>

               <hi>NOR did any necessary reason oblige his natural Goodness to pardon these Offences of his Creatures, at least no such reason as is discoverable by us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from these Relations of his being our good Creator and Governour.</hi> This appears clearly from the Revelations of the Gospel by which we know that we were, upon account of our Offences, perfectly liable to the <hi>actual inflictions</hi> of his <hi>Justice.</hi> If we had not been so, what need had there been of the <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> and sufferings of Christ for attoning the Divine Justice for our Sins Antecedently to our admission into the Evangelical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant? And if we were, it must necessarily follow that he was not <hi>obliged</hi> by his <hi>Providential Goodness</hi> to pardon us.

forgive. For in this Case the very <hi>Right</hi> of his <hi>Justice</hi> must be overpowered by his <hi>Goodness.</hi> And it is further considerable in this Case, that his <hi>Justice</hi> does as well concern him as a <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> as his <hi>Goodness</hi>; whence it will also further follow that, if the <hi>Justice</hi> of his <hi>Government</hi> will <hi>permit</hi> him <hi>actually</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, then the Goodness of his Government cannot <hi>oblige</hi> him <hi>actually</hi> to forgive. For no <hi>actual Practice</hi> of God can possibly oppose any <hi>Obligation</hi> of his Nature. Nay further yet it is to be remembred that the <hi>Obligation</hi> of his <hi>Justice</hi> it self is indeed no other but a <hi>higher Obligation</hi> of his <hi>Goodness.</hi> For it must not be conceived that the <hi>essentially-Good</hi> nature of God can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to inflict any <hi>evil</hi> whatsoever as an <hi>evil.</hi> But that he is <hi>obliged</hi> to punish the offences of particular Persons, when either a <hi>greater good</hi> is promoted by the <hi>punishment</hi> than could be by the <hi>Impunity,</hi> as none can doubt but that the good of the <hi>Publick</hi> is greater than that of a <hi>particular Person,</hi> and more concerning God as he is a <hi>Governour</hi>; or even when the mischief likely to befal even the particular Person himself, if permitted to go on without <hi>Punishment</hi> is indeed greater than that of the <hi>Punishment</hi> it self (which may also be applied to our present Case, not that any <hi>evil</hi> can be greater to the <hi>Individual</hi> than <hi>Damnation,</hi> but that <hi>real Damnation,</hi> which may be avoided by the <hi>fear</hi> of it in <hi>this Life,</hi> is indeed incomparably a greater mischief than the <hi>fear</hi> it self) this is indeed only a <hi>higher Obligation</hi> of his <hi>Goodness,</hi> and therefore uncapable of being taken of by such an <hi>Obligation</hi> of the same Attribute as is certainly <hi>inferior.</hi>

For his being pleased to condescend so far as to enter into Covenant being only a <hi>higher instance</hi> of his Goodness cannot be conceived to disoblige him either from <hi>being</hi> or <hi>appearing</hi> as Good as he was formerly, and whatever is necessary to make him <hi>appear</hi> so, being necessary on account of its own nature, must be so unalterably and eternally. And though it be certain that God is not by his <hi>natural Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Goodness</hi> obliged to be <hi>alike Good</hi> to all; yet that it self is not pleadable in our present Case, as if he might on this <hi>Arbitrary account</hi> in the actual Dispensation of his Goodness be expected better to those who are not in <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, than to those who are. For they who are so far favoured already as to be admitted into Covenant with him are not only thereby intitled to the further Favours which are expresly treated for in the Covenant, but also to the indefinite expectations of his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Goodness.</hi> For by admitting them thus far, he plainly owns them as his <hi>peculiar Favorites</hi>; and Favorites are always looked on as the most likely Candidates for <hi>unpromised,</hi> as well as <hi>promised,</hi> and <hi>Covenanted, Favours.</hi> And as they who are thus far owned have, even in this way of Arguing from the <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>reasonableness</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> it self, a much fairer Title, and consequently a much better Argument for assuring themselves in their pretensions to those <hi>indefinite Favours</hi> than they who are not; so they have above them that evidence of <hi>express Revelation</hi> of which the condition of others is not capable.

For how obscure soever they are to us, yet they are sufficiently clear to God, on whose Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony it is that we are obliged to believe what he has been pleased to reveal. And when we are thus assured of a Truth by the Testimony of him who infallibly knows it, we are not then so much concerned for other things which may have a connexion with it, either as Objections or Arguments, because we are sure such a Testimony is a much better Argument to prove it <hi>true</hi> than any deducible from such Topicks, either for proving or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it.

So that both of them are alike necessitated to depend not on its <hi>Letter,</hi> but its <hi>Equity.</hi> And it is withal as clear that this <hi>Equity</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:97904:70"/>
cannot be pleaded independently on the <hi>Letter,</hi> from any other Topick but only the Divine <hi>Essential <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncovenanted Goodness</hi>; and that what is either obliging to God in regard of his <hi>Essential Goodness,</hi> or the <hi>Equity</hi> of his design in promulging the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Covenant,</hi> is alike obliging to him in respect of <hi>Heathens,</hi> who never heard of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as in respect of those who have heard it, but cannot assure themselves of their Interest in it by their performance of its Conditions, <hi>Ritual,</hi> as well as <hi>Moral.</hi> For the only Favour he can be thought to entertain for <hi>Christians</hi> not performing Conditions is only this, that, by making that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance more possible to them, he has thereby admitted them to better advantages for gaining a <hi>Legal Title</hi> to the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> But upon any faileur in performance of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the <hi>Divine Goodness</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> is so far from giving them any advantage above others, as that they are <hi>less excusable</hi> than others to whom that performance is not <hi>so possible</hi>; and none can doubt but that they, who may be admitted to <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> by compliances <hi>not sinful,</hi> and willingly want them rather than they will submit to such compliances, must be much more culpable than they who cannot be admitted to them by any compliances whatsoever. And therefore by the same reason whereby it has appeared that these Conjectures from the <hi>Divine Goodness</hi> are improper, and insignificant for comfort, in the Case of <hi>Heathens,</hi> without <hi>express Revelation</hi>; they will also be as insignificant to <hi>failing Christians.</hi> For it is altogether as <hi>Arbitrary</hi> to God whether he will excuse the non-performance of, even <hi>External, Conditions</hi> when they may be performed without <hi>Sinful</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as even such things may not be despaired of by such, to whom as he is naturally thus <hi>well affected,</hi> so they are not conscious to themselves of any <hi>neglect</hi> on their part that might <hi>demerit</hi> or <hi>diminish</hi> this <hi>Affection.</hi> So that it is plain that the whole reason of this hope is their <hi>present Interest</hi> in Gods <hi>good will</hi>; which if they have forfeited, God may still wish as well to his <hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> as formerly, yet so as that his well wishes can administer no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them who have lost their Title to it. And how is it possible that he should have the <hi>confidence</hi> to expect <hi>Extraordinary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> from God, who has through any neglect of endeavour on his own part failed of those that are <hi>Ordinary?</hi> How can he with any <hi>reason</hi> expect any of those Favours to which God is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely <hi>Obliged</hi> by that <hi>Goodness</hi> which is <hi>natural</hi> to him as a <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Governour,</hi> whose actual performances have been so little endearing that he has nothing that can recommend him to this <hi>natural Love</hi> of God but precisely that he is his <hi>Creature</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi> though an undutiful one? How can he expect that God should condescend so far as to vary from his own <hi>General Rules</hi> and <hi>Ordinary Provisions,</hi> and not only to <hi>excuse</hi> his <hi>deviations</hi> from them, but to <hi>contrive Extraordinary Means</hi> for his particular Salvation, who in the mean time is so unwilling for his sake to part with his own humour in compliances <hi>not Sinful?</hi> But this, as it comes also exactly home to our dissenting Brethrens Case, so, I conceive it so clear as not to need any further prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Gods care for the Salvation of one Nation, the <hi>Jews</hi> alone, induced him not only to perform Miracles at the first Publication of his will to them, but also to a perpetual Succession of Miracles to future Ages.

            </argument>
            <p>NOW the <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> of assuring us of the Divine pleasure herein, either concerning his <hi>Supernatural As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances,</hi> or concerning his <hi>Indulgences</hi> to our ordinary failings, or of his rewarding our weak and imperfect performances with <hi>Supernatural Felicities,</hi> being all of them things depending on his Arbitrary pleasure can be no other than <hi>Promises</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi> solemnly confirmed to us. That they are things perfectly at his <hi>Arbitrary disposal</hi> plainly appears from all that has now been said, by which it has been proved that he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97904:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is not necessitated to them by any <hi>Obligation</hi> of his <hi>naturally Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Nature,</hi> nor by any <hi>Relation</hi> by which he is necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to us as our <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Governour,</hi> which might further endear him to us. And as for any further <hi>Relation</hi> to which he is not so naturally determined, the very Favour of entering into such a one is as arbitrary as any thing else that depends on his free disposal, and therefore cannot prejudg against the freedom of all the Favours consequent to it. Now in <hi>Arbitrary things</hi> wherein God is, as to any Obligation of his Nature, indifferent which way he determines himself, it is impossible to know which way he will be pleased <hi>actually</hi> to determine himself without <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>express Revelation.</hi> And because the actual performance of these things must be <hi>future</hi> as well as <hi>present,</hi> not only as to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> but as to the <hi>Assistances</hi> also without which we could have little security of the <hi>possibility</hi> of our <hi>Duty,</hi> or consequently of the <hi>comfortableness</hi> of our <hi>Condition</hi>; we can upon these terms enjoy no solid comfort unless we may be <hi>assured,</hi> not only that it is his will at <hi>present,</hi> but that it shall be also for the <hi>future,</hi> which <hi>actual Revelation</hi> of his will for the <hi>future</hi> performance of good things to us is that which is properly called a <hi>Promise.</hi> But it is certain that God does not multiply these <hi>Promises</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the multiplicity of the Cases of the Persons concerned in them. And therefore the <hi>Promises</hi> being only General, the only way how particular Persons can assure themselves of their Interest in them, can only be by their Interest in that <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Community</hi> to whom they are made.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97904:74"/>
thought reasonable in Contracts of the same nature where the Party Covenanting does not <hi>Personally</hi> appear, by delegating and empowering sufficient Proxies who may Seal it in his name, and by whose Act he may therefore declare himself obliged. These things are certainly so essential to the Notion of a <hi>Covenant</hi> properly so called, as that that <hi>consent</hi> which may in some Cases be presumed without them, yet cannot for any of these defects deserve the proper name of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> or infer that <hi>Legal Obligation</hi> which is the advantage of a <hi>Covenant</hi> above other <hi>Contracts</hi> which are not transacted with the like solemnity in order to our <hi>Comfort.</hi> And therefore as this Conveyance of a right to <hi>Promises</hi> by a <hi>general Covenant</hi> is the only <hi>ordinary way</hi> whereby we may be assured of a <hi>Title</hi> to them, so the <hi>application</hi> of this <hi>Covenant</hi> by these <hi>Solemnities</hi> is the only <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> whereby we may be <hi>particularly</hi> assured of our <hi>Interest</hi> in the <hi>Covenant.</hi> But that I may more distinctly shew, not only, that, in <hi>reason,</hi> this is <hi>fit</hi> to have been thus contrived, but also that it has been <hi>actually Observed</hi> in the <hi>Evangelical Covenant,</hi> and that I may bring the application more home to our particular Case; I therefore proceed to</p>

Communion,</hi> that I may prevent those Exceptions which many are ready to make in behalf of our dissenting Brethren; that they do already Communicate with Us in 36. of the 39. Articles, which they believe as well as We; and that they heartily wish well to all good Men of what Party soever; and that, at least, they Pray <hi>for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> where they cannot Pray <hi>with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> For these, if they could; in any propriety of Speech, be stiled Acts of <hi>Communion,</hi> which no good Christian can deny even to real <hi>Schismaticks</hi> themselves, with whom notwithstanding all, who hold that there is such a thing as real <hi>Schism,</hi> must not hold it lawful to communicate; yet most certainly they are not Acts of <hi>External Communion.</hi> By this therefore I only mean a participation in those External Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises whereby the Church subsists as a distinct Society, that is, a joining in the Ordinances administred in it, but especially in the Sacraments. I say the <hi>Visible Church,</hi> purposely to obviate that pretence of the Church's consisting only of the <hi>Elect,</hi> who, as they are supposed themselves not Visible, nor united among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by any Visible commerce, so they think (and very conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to this Notion) that Communion may be maintained with them in an Invisible way by likeness of design and Sympathy of Affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And therefore by this <hi>Visible Church</hi> I mean that Visible Society which is maintained by an acknowledgment of the same common Visible Ecclesiastical Government and by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal participation of the same common Sacraments. So that my meaning in this whole Proposition is, <hi>That a Legal Right, to these Evangelical Promises and Covenant, which are the Ordinary Means whereby we may be assured of our Salvation on performance of Conditions, is not conveyed to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s otherwise than by our partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of these external Ordinances whereby we profess our Selves Members of such a Visible Society which is maintained by those Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, of which none can be partakers without consent of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Ecclesiastical Governours, which must therefore oblige all to a Subjection to those Governours.</hi>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">This will be clear in discoursing concerning these particulars: 1. That the only <hi>Ordinary Means,</hi> whereby we may <hi>assure</hi> our Selves that we in particular have an interest in his <hi>Promises</hi> of any of the things now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as necessary for our Salvation, is by our <hi>assurance</hi> of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged in <hi>Covenant</hi> with him; 2.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>V</label> 1. THEREFORE, <hi>the only Ordinary Means whereby we may assure our Selves that we in particular have any Interest in these Divine Promises</hi> (without which assurance it has appeared to be in vain for particular Persons to challenge any comfort) <hi>is by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring our Selves that we in particular are in Covenant with him</hi>; so that, at least the <hi>Negative</hi> way of Arguing (for which alone I am at present concerned) will hold here, <hi>That he who cannot as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure himself that he is in Covenant with God, can also never (in an ordinary way at least) assure himself that he in particular has an Interest in the Divine Promises.</hi> For proving this I desire it may be Observed 1. That it is only the <hi>Obligatory force</hi> either of the Divine <hi>Promise,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> that can be a solid ground, (I do not say, of <hi>comfort</hi> in general, but, at least) of any <hi>positive Assurance,</hi> and consequently, at least, of that <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>comfort</hi> which requires <hi>positive Assurance.</hi> This appears from what has been already discoursed under the former Head. 2. Therefore it is to be Observed further, that <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> are <hi>Legal transactions,</hi> and that God himself herein condescends to the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of his Creatures, so that they may be capable of judging him obliged to them by the same <hi>Legal</hi> rational measures whereby they are capable of entring into Obligations to one another. That it was Gods design that his Creatures should understand him as thus obliged is very easie to be understood from his using ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions plainly significative of a <hi>Legal conveyance</hi> with all its Circumstances according to the Customes of those Nations. Thus the name of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> of a <hi>Testament,</hi> of a <hi>Surety,</hi> of <hi>Sealing,</hi> of giving an <hi>earnest</hi> and <hi>First fruits,</hi> &amp;c. are plain terms of Law, and allusions to the Customes of <hi>Legal conveyances</hi> in those times, and therefore were so most obviously intelligible by those Persons (who were concerned in them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and to whose capacities they were immediately fitted) of a <hi>Legal Obligation,</hi> and consequently were in all likelihood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by God himself so to signifie. Unless we can suppose that he designedly made use of Expressions which, by all Regular and Prudent measures of Interpretation, were likely to be misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97904:76"/>
by his Creatures concerned in them, which it not reconcila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with his <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Veracity.</hi> Besides this appears from his doing this in Writings of a <hi>Popular stile,</hi> and particularly fitted to the <hi>vulgar capacities,</hi> who were certainly like to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him thus where they found their own familiar Expressions used, and their Terms alluded to; nay from the many instances in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> especially, where that Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himself has given us Precedents of Arguing from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Legal</hi> Notions, concerning the nature of <hi>Contracts</hi> (that <hi>Testaments are not of force till the death of the Testator,</hi>

THEREFORE it hence follows that the nature of the <hi>Obligation</hi> of these Divine <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in a <hi>Legal way.</hi> And that not only by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> in general; but also, in many instances, by those then prevailing among the <hi>Hellenistical Jews</hi> (for whose use the <hi>New Testament</hi> seems to have been primarily designed) those of the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and those of their <hi>particular Nation.</hi> But especially the securest arguing in this kind will be from the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> and the <hi>general</hi> rational Notions concerning the <hi>Obligation</hi> of this sort of <hi>Contracts,</hi> not only such as are <hi>really</hi> agreeable to the nature of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but also such as were <hi>conceived</hi> to be rational and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the natures of the things by the unanimous consent of <hi>civilized Nations,</hi> and of the <hi>Masters of reasoning</hi> whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was then had in general veneration. For though God be not any farther, than he pleases himself, <hi>obliged</hi> by particular <hi>positive Constitutions,</hi> because he is not subject to the <hi>Authority</hi> by which they are established; yet by virtue of the essential rectitude of his <hi>Will</hi> whereby it is necessarily conformed to the Rule of <hi>right Reason,</hi> we cannot conceive any thing necessarily <hi>obliging</hi> in point of <hi>Reason,</hi> and yet conceive him <hi>indifferent</hi> to its observation. And therefore whatever, I do not say is, but, is by us conceived to be, <hi>rationally obligatory</hi> in the nature of these <hi>Contracts</hi>; that we may presume to be <hi>obligatory</hi> even to <hi>God himself,</hi> when he is pleased to enter into such Contracts with us. For the very design of all <hi>Contracts</hi> being to give mutual secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for performance on both sides, it is very <hi>rational</hi> that we be the same way assured of performance on <hi>Gods part</hi> as we give security for performance on <hi>ours.</hi> But this cannot be unless the same reason of obligation be supposed equally cogent in both Cases. Now it is plain that our own obligations are measured by our own Notions; and therefore unless we may Judg of Gods obligations by the same measures, we may conceive our Selves to give security where none is given us, which is not agreeable with that <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>fair dealing</hi> which we must needs conceive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable from <hi>Divine Contracts.</hi>

Yet so as that this enlargement of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is not so to be understood as if every Individual Person of other Nations might immediately challenge these Priviledges, by virtue of the <hi>Evangelical Covenant,</hi> upon performance of the <hi>Moral Conditions,</hi> but that now all are capable of being admitted into the <hi>Covenant</hi> it self; which will conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently intitle them to those <hi>Priviledges,</hi> without being obliged to leave their <hi>National Customs,</hi> or to incorporate themselves into

For whosoever reads their Story, and considers the dull and sensual humour of the generality of that Nation cannot believe them more inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> than the generality of other civilized Nations; so that they were not likely, by bare performance of

To which purpose it is to be remembred that the reason why God has been pleased to admit Mankind to this favour is not his own <hi>essential Goodness</hi> alone, but the consideration of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> by which it is purchased, and by which it is made reconcilable with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Government</hi> to admit of this <hi>Impunity</hi> of our offences without any fear of inconvenience that must otherwise follow from such an example of <hi>Impunity</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> to Persons so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending. Whence it will further follow that, seeing they are the purchase of <hi>Christs</hi> blood, they are to be considered as belonging to his Right, and therefore as disposable only according to his pleasure.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XV</label> NOR indeed can I conceive how the Notion of a Covenant is otherwise explicable in these <hi>Evangelical Transactions.</hi> For considering that that does imply not only a <hi>Legal,</hi> but a <hi>mutual,</hi> Contract; it must follow that there must be <hi>mutual promises,</hi> and <hi>mutual Obligations:</hi> and therefore that as <hi>God</hi> is pleased, in this Covenant, to oblige <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> in a <hi>Legal way</hi> to the performance of our Duty; so we may expect that he would also be pleased to oblige <hi>himself</hi> by <hi>promising</hi> some advantages to <hi>us,</hi> to encourage us in it. If he had in another way exacted our Duty, on the bare account of his <hi>absolute Authority</hi> over us, without any <hi>Promises</hi> on his part; it might indeed have been called a <hi>command,</hi> but could never have been properly stiled a Covenant. And if God obliged himself to any <hi>promises</hi> in this <hi>Covenant</hi> with us, it is least of all credible that he should leave out those <hi>promises</hi> which are of all others the most considerable, as these are of which we are here discoursing. Besides that indeed the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>promise</hi> inferring a <hi>Legal Obligation</hi>; it is not likely that God would so far condescend as to make them, but upon the like <hi>Legal security</hi> of <hi>Duty</hi> to be performed by his <hi>Creatures,</hi> which when it is mutual on both Parties we call a <hi>Covenant.</hi> And these <hi>promises</hi> of <hi>Duty,</hi> confirmed in a solemn way by a Covenant <hi>on our part,</hi> being the only rational inducement likely to prevail with God to make these <hi>promises</hi>; it is not credible that he would design those favours for any but such as give him this solemn security which may induce him to it.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XVI</label> I AM aware some of our <hi>Calvinian</hi> Brethren may be tempted to think this Discourse for proving the confinement of the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> to such as have an Interest in the <hi>New Covenant</hi> purchased by Christ, to be both needless as to themselves, and to be disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to our own Principles in the <hi>Remonstrant</hi> Controversies: <hi>To be needles as to them,</hi> because they are for a greater confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than we can approve of; so as not only to confine them in the <hi>Event,</hi> but also as to the <hi>Original design.</hi> So that as to others they conceive neither the <hi>Promises</hi> to have been designed for them <hi>on performance of Conditions,</hi> nor yet that <hi>Grace</hi> which might have enabled them for that performance. <hi>To be disagreeable to our other Principles</hi> when we prove both the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> to have been designed for the Salvation of all. I confess if we understood the <hi>Church</hi> in the same sense as our Brethren ordinarily do when they produce these same Texts for their own purpose in the <hi>Remonstrant Controversies,</hi> only for the <hi>secret number of Gods Elect</hi>; And that by the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not being designed for them <hi>as scattered Individuals</hi> we meant; not only that his <hi>Death</hi> should not be <hi>available</hi> for them <hi>as scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Individuals,</hi> that is, <hi>whilst they continued so scattered</hi>; but also that it should not as much as purchase that <hi>actual Grace</hi> for them, even in that Condition, which might put it in their power to be <hi>Incorporated</hi> into the <hi>Church</hi>; there had been some ground for this mistake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But these senses are far from being ours. Nor is it indeed our interest that we should <hi>own</hi> them. For they would fail us when we should have occasion to use them, that is, when we should undertake to shew that they are not in the <hi>Church,</hi> and their danger in continuing so. Nor is it less disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to our design to suppose that Persons out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Church</hi> are so deprived of the <hi>Promises</hi> by their being so as to want that degree of <hi>Grace</hi> which is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for making their return to it <hi>possible.</hi> If that were their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97904:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Case, to what purpose should we endeavour either to <hi>convince</hi> them of the dangerousness of their present condition, or <hi>perswade</hi> them to come out of it? To talk to People of <hi>doing</hi> that, which we already know they <hi>cannot do,</hi> is not to <hi>perswade,</hi> but to <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid</hi> them. And it were not <hi>Good will</hi> to them, but <hi>Inhumanity,</hi> as much as to discover to them that danger which we knew it were impossible for them to escape. It would but add to them the trouble of their present fears over and above the future mischief of it when it should befal them.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XVII</label> OUR plain meaning therefore is that we believe Gods design to have been unfeignedly for the Salvation of <hi>all Mankind,</hi> as well those who are <hi>out of the Church</hi> as those who are <hi>within it,</hi> yet so as that this general design is not actually available for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any <hi>particular</hi> (in an <hi>ordinary way</hi> so as that the Person may have the <hi>comfort</hi> of it) <hi>without the Church,</hi> nay not <hi>within it</hi> without Universal and Sincere Obedience. And the effect of this design to Persons <hi>without the Church,</hi> is, to promise <hi>Salvation,</hi> and a <hi>gracious acceptance</hi> of them· on condition of their <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating</hi> themselves into it; and in the mean time to give that <hi>Grace,</hi> which, if not resisted by their own <hi>free Wills,</hi> may be sufficient to invite them into it. So also the present effect even on <hi>vitious Livers</hi> in the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is not, that they shall be <hi>actually Saved</hi> whilst they continue so; but that by virtue of their being in <hi>Covenant</hi> they can <hi>challenge</hi> acceptance upon <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>plead Promises</hi> upon <hi>performance of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and can have a free and open access to the ordinary chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>enable</hi> them to perform Conditions, none of which can agree to Persons <hi>without the Church</hi> who cannot as yet be supposed to have any <hi>actual Interest</hi> in the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And upon these Supposals it will be easy to conceive how, not only the <hi>actual performance</hi> of, but the very <hi>Title</hi> to, <hi>Promises</hi> may be <hi>confined</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and yet God may sincerely design the <hi>universal Salvation</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi> For I think none can Question but a design on <hi>performable Conditions</hi> may be easily conceived to be <hi>sincere,</hi> though it should fail of the <hi>Event,</hi> through a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Non-performance of Conditions <hi>on the Creatures part</hi>; and it hence appears that such a confinement of the <hi>Promises</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> is very reconcilable with such a <hi>design</hi> as this is for the <hi>

For our Notion of a <hi>Church</hi> is more obvious and ordinarily intelligible in that Age and even in the Scripture it self than that which they pretend to; And it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly agreeable with the design of God in erecting the <hi>Church</hi> a <hi>Body Politick,</hi> thus to oblige Men to enter into it, and to submit to its Rules of Discipline, however the <hi>Secular State</hi> should stand affected; And it is better suited to the capacities and practice of even the very <hi>Vulgar</hi> of that Age, for whose use principally the Scriptures seem to have been Written in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending stile in which we find them (for what use can there be in Practice of either of these Discourses if the Persons hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them cannot make out their interest in them? And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly more easy for the most <hi>Vulgar capacity</hi> whatsoever to prove their interest in a <hi>Visible Church,</hi> than in an <hi>Invisible</hi> one consisting only of <hi>Elect Persons.</hi>) And I do not know but they may indeed find that it is this <hi>Election</hi> to Grace <hi>actually,</hi> and to Glory <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,</hi> which the Scripture generally speaks of, and that this <hi>Election</hi> to <hi>Grace</hi> does not so much imply an infallible and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual influence of Grace on the Person so elected as his actual introduction to the <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> which others had been permitted to reject, which amounts exactly to our present design of <hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> as I have now explained it (which though it be a Notion I think exceedingly defensible, yet I would not engage the stress of my present Cause in a Discourse so seemingly exotical to our design any further than needs I must) And it will not engage us to Answer that current of Scripture which seems directly opposite to the meaning imposed on these places by our Adversaries; And less is requisite to justify our Sense than theirs who therefore ought to have more and greater proof for what they add beyond our Assertions.</p>

That he who would pretend any <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Promises,</hi> must in order thereunto prove his <hi>Interest</hi> in the <hi>Covenant.</hi> For if the <hi>Promises</hi> be Gods part of the <hi>Evangelical Covenant,</hi> none can challenge them but he who has a <hi>Legal Title</hi> to them; And none can have a <hi>Legal Title</hi> to

them who has not an Interest in the <hi>Covenant</hi> on which such a <hi>Legal Title</hi> at least must be founded, because the Covenant is indeed it self the Legal conveyance; And it is only such a <hi>Legal challenge,</hi> that can give us <hi>comfort,</hi> and <hi>confidence,</hi> that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to us. And as by our Interest in the <hi>Covenant</hi> we may argue <hi>Positively,</hi> that we have an Interest in the <hi>Promises</hi> not <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>absolute,</hi> but upon <hi>performance of Conditions</hi> (which is more than can be pleaded by Persons not yet <hi>admitted</hi> into the <hi>Covenant</hi>) so the <hi>Negative</hi> way of Arguing (for which we are at present concerned) is much more certain, That he who cannot prove his Interest in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> whatever his <hi>performance of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> may be, cannot challenge a <hi>Legal Title</hi> to the <hi>Promises.</hi> And as I have shewn that even the <hi>things promised</hi> cannot be hoped for by one in such a Condition, upon any grounds so secure as a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Person might safely venture on with any comfort or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; so indeed a <hi>Promise</hi> as a <hi>Promise</hi> is it self a <hi>Legal</hi> way of conveyance, and therefore, as it is the nature of all like convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, cannot, I do not say, easily, but not, at all, be challenged on any but a <hi>Legal Title.</hi> But I proceed.</p>

And such certainly must be the omission even of these <hi>external Solemnities.</hi> For if they had not been thought <hi>necessary</hi> in regard of their influence on the <hi>Publick,</hi> that is, if even this Solemnity of conveyance had not been <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally necessary</hi> for securing the Equity of particular conveyances, so that if such grants were ordinarily passed without such <hi>Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> they would in all likelihood prove <hi>unequal</hi> more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than <hi>Equal</hi>; it is not probable that the <hi>Solemnities</hi> would ever have been settled at first by such a Power as must be presumed unwilling to impose any further on the Liberty even of its <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Subjects</hi> than it finds it <hi>necessary</hi> for the <hi>Publick</hi> to do so.

Besides the necessity of <hi>formal Bonds</hi> in order to a <hi>Legal proof</hi> seems
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97904:85"/>
especially to have been designed for the security of well-meaning Simple Persons, from the Cheats of those who are more subtle, to which they would frequently be betrayed by Precipitation; just as the Roman Axes carried before their Consuls were bound up with the <hi>fasces,</hi> purposely that if the Consuls were hasty in their Decrees, or too severe, they might, whilst they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loosening, gain time for the enterteinment of milder counsels (as it is plain that they have been thus solicitous for the security of weaker Persons, by disannulling such Contracts, even in other Cases, as would otherwise have been thought sufficiently obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory as to the nature of the things themselves, and such as might in the <hi>particular Cases</hi> have been transacted with sufficient <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Deliberation,</hi> such as the <hi>Promises</hi> of <hi>Minors,</hi> and the <hi>private espousals</hi> of Persons to be married) but that in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the nature of these, concerning which I am at present Discoursing, neither of these Reasons will seem to hold. For neither does there seem to be that danger of <hi>Precipitation</hi> where the Case is <hi>clear,</hi> and clear to <hi>all,</hi> even the <hi>meanest,</hi> capacities that are concerned in it, as it is here, both that our <hi>Baptismal Promises</hi> are otherwise our Duty whether we promised them or not, and that the Promises on Gods part are highly conducive to all our <hi>Interests,</hi> both <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi>; Or, if the Benefit had been less considerable, yet there is no dangers of <hi>Precipitation</hi> where there is no danger of <hi>Prejudice</hi> to be suffered by it, though we had been guilty of it, as it is also most certain, even to the meanest capacity, that is capable of being <hi>rationally</hi> Religious, that there is no danger of prejudicing themselves by being so. Seeing it is certain their <hi>Duty</hi> can do them no <hi>hurt</hi> in the final <hi>Event,</hi> and that they cannot possibly fail of <hi>Gods Promises</hi> whilst they perform their <hi>own,</hi> and that God will never take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of captious Expositions of their words to ensnare and entangle them, but accept of their Practice in the same Simplicity in which it was designed by themselves. Nor is there here that inconvenience of pleading a <hi>Legal Obligation</hi> from <hi>private Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> seeing that however <hi>private</hi> they may be in regard of <hi>Men</hi> yet they are <hi>notorious</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> who, though he be indeed a <hi>Party</hi> in these Contracts, yet is withal to be considered as the only possible competent <hi>Judg</hi> of their performance.

Especially considering that in all Contracts of this kind the <hi>pains</hi> that are to be taken are looked on as valuable Considerations, and according to the greatness or inconsiderable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of them the value of the things is heightened or lessened; so that what is only <hi>equal</hi> in it self must with the Addition of further Conditions prove <hi>disproportionable,</hi> and the exchanging of a thing of less value for things more valuable is that which is reputed foul and over-reaching in this way of <hi>Commutative Justice.</hi> But in our Case the matter is clearly otherwise.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97904:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that God does not only oblige us to such Religious Duties as concern us <hi>singly considered,</hi> but also to <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>solemn</hi> ones,<note place="margin">

Nor are the <hi>multitude</hi> even of <hi>particulars,</hi> even as <hi>singly obliged,</hi> sufficient to engage for it, seeing there is requisite some further obligation when the interests of all the particulars shall be prejudiced by it (as they are like to be in times of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution</hi>) and when it may therefore be presumed that many will of themselves be backward in it. Seeing therefore that these are Duties required from us by God, it will concern him as a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter</hi> to see that we be obliged to the <hi>performance</hi> of these as well as others. And because the performance of these <hi>publick Duties</hi> cannot be effectually secured without a power of <hi>Commanding</hi> in some and a Duty of <hi>Obedience</hi> in others, therefore it is requisite that some be invested with that power, and all others be obliged to this Subjection, without which it is impossible for us to engage for these parts of our Duty. And yet it cannot be supposed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to expect that God, even as a <hi>Covenanter,</hi> should think himself <hi>obliged</hi> to perform his Promises which are only Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for the security of our Duty, till we have given him the like security of a <hi>Covenant</hi> for the performance of all that he requires on our part. Thus the very nature of Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> with us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires on our part a <hi>Body Politick</hi> for securing the performance of it; And that the Constitution of a <hi>Body Politick</hi> will be best secured by confining the claim of private Persons to its <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> to its <hi>external Solemnities</hi> I shall have occasion to prove when I consider Gods obligation hereunto as a <hi>Governour.</hi>

Especially considering that this <hi>backwardness,</hi> in our Case, of not being willing to yield to any <hi>unsinful condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> for Gods sake must plainly arise from such a perversity of disposition as would hinder us from the actual advantage of the Covenant, though we had been <hi>Legally</hi> instated in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may with greater <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> hinder us from our admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to it, seeing a much less misdemeanour may suffice to hinder the Promise of a favour at first, than can afterwards hinder the performance.</p>

his <hi>own satisfaction</hi> as <hi>our good,</hi> viz. <hi>that by this means he might exercise us to that vigor of Resolution which is necessary for rendring us capable of the favours designed for us,</hi> which seems to be the same common reason of all the positive Injunctions he has been pleased ever to lay upon us.

And yet unless the observance even of these <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Solemnities</hi> be so far exacted from us as that our failing in them, on any other reason <hi>short of Sin,</hi> may proportionably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat our expectations of the favours designed by them they can have no influence on us for this purpose, even by way of <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi>; for these are the only seasons of <hi>tryal,</hi> and without tryal they can never <hi>exercise</hi> us.</p>

Observation is that, whether this were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the true state of this affair or not, that the Observation of these external Solemnities is necessary to be thus punctually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, yet <hi>at least as to our means of knowing whether it be so we have no reason to judg otherwise, and consequently have all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that can be to practice accordingly.</hi> For it is certain that we cannot as much as pretend to any reason to prove them unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary on the account now mentioned of <hi>Exercise,</hi> though possibly we may as to the nature of the particular Acts. And it is also further certain that they may be <hi>really</hi> necessary though we could not <hi>prove</hi> them so. But in such a Case as this is where neither side is capable of evident proof the only way of securing a prudent Practice, is plainly, not to fluctuate in matters whose practice may, for further designs with which we are not acquainted, prove so very considerable, whatever we may think of their immediate design as far as we are capable of judging concerning it. Now upon this supposal that <hi>one side</hi> is necessary to be practiced, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be difficult to judg <hi>whether side.</hi> For upon our observation of the <hi>external Solemnities</hi> of the Covenant we can plead a <hi>Legal Title</hi> to the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promises</hi> on performance of its moral conditions. But whatever claim may be grounded on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of these Conditions otherwise, yet certainly it is not

               <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>express,</hi> nor such as we are capable of judging of with any certainty, (as has been already shewn) and therefore cannot, by any Rules of Prudence, amount to such a proof as might any way stand in competition with that which is produci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the necessity of observing these <hi>external Solemnities,</hi> nay indeed can amount to no <hi>Proof</hi> at all, but only to <hi>Conjectures,</hi> which no wise man can think fit to be followed where he may have <hi>direct</hi> Arguments for his <hi>direction,</hi> though they were only <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> But then considering this necessity in Prudence for these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Practices, not as permitted to the general Laws of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which may undoubtedly <hi>permit</hi> many mistakes that may, in the event, redound to the prejudice of such a multitude of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, as, in regard of the narrowness of our knowledg, may seem very considerable to us; but as particularly designed and contrived by God by this way of management of things which can afford us no evidence for disobliging us from these Practices: And considering withal that we can more certainly assure our Selves of the Divine pleasure in particulars of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by his <hi>general provisions</hi> than by <hi>particular Cases,</hi> for which we cannot suppose God obliged to provide otherwise than as they are reducible to <hi>generals:</hi> We have reason to presume that these Rules of Prudence to which he has generally left us for our direction were designed by him as means of manifesting his pleasure to us, independently on any actual express Revelation, as we usually expound the minds of those with whom we deal by <hi>rational consequences</hi> as well as by <hi>express words.</hi> Which yet is more reasonably to be presumed in our Case because we cannot suppose any consequence, how remote soever, if <hi>rational,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to God, and therefore undesigned by him, as we may very well suppose some such to have been unknown to the most rational sagacious Creature. And when we consider further how unlikely it is that God would have obliged us, especially in the Gospel, to any thing which he did not judg necessary for us (and his <hi>judging</hi> any thing necessary is with us a sufficient Argument to assure us that it is so) we shall have reason to believe that the thing is <hi>indeed</hi> necessary to which he is pleased in this <hi>rational</hi> way to oblige us, if not for its immediate influence, yet at least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely for the ends of his Government, of which we can better assure our Selves from his pleasure who alone is privy to the true nature of our Souls, and the intrigues of his own Government,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97904:92"/>
than from any evidence derivable from the nature of the things themselves. And it is Analogous to the Principles of all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the penalties may very justly be inflicted on <hi>particular Persons</hi> for neglects prejudicial to the <hi>publick interest</hi> as well as for such as are immediately hurtful to <hi>themselves.</hi> Nay it is further Analogous to the same design that the Governours of Societies take care that such Penalties be generally inflicted, which must discourage particular Persons in hoping for <hi>indulgence.</hi>

For as a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanter</hi> he is only concerned to furnish <hi>Ecclesiastical Governours</hi> with so much power as may qualify them for entring into <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with him for its performance by their own Subjects as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Authorized to transact with him in the name of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Societies, and then to oblige them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by virtue of their <hi>Covenant,</hi> to employ their Authority for that design for which it was intended by him when he gave it them. So that in this regard they are to be considered as concerned on the part of <hi>Mankind,</hi> on which account I have already shewn the necessity of investing them with such an Authority. But considering God as a <hi>Governour,</hi> they will be related to him under that Notion as <hi>Subordinate Governours</hi> to their principal <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>Authority.</hi> And so they will be concerned, not on <hi>Mans part</hi> of the Covenant but on <hi>Gods,</hi> so that He will be more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concerned in the Duty and respect that is paid to them; and consequently the principal Duty Covenanted for, on our part, being a <hi>submission</hi> to the <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> and a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all his Commands, <hi>Temporary</hi> and <hi>Prudential,</hi> as well as of such as are <hi>Eternally Obligatory</hi>; We cannot perform our Covenant with God without being Dutiful to them because they are invested with his Authority. As he is accounted a Rebel against his Prince, who resists any of his inferior Officers who are Legally empowered and commissioned by him, not only in things for which they have his particular express Warrant, but also in such as are to be presumed to have been left to their <hi>Prudence</hi> to Determine by Virtue of their General Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

Indeed this might have been the Case, if they had been consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered only as <hi>our Representatives,</hi> and God had withal permitted

us to our natural Liberty, both to <hi>appoint</hi> them, and to allow them what <hi>degree of trust</hi> we had pleased. For then we might as well have allowed them a <hi>limitted power</hi> as some <hi>Democratical Governments</hi> in the like manner derived from the consents of their <hi>particular Members</hi> have confessedly done. And then, by the Fundamental Rules of <hi>Democracy,</hi> all Persons being Subject to the Multitude in all such instances wherein they had not been <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly empowered,</hi> and all <hi>power</hi> being derived from the <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>; it will follow that, if they should presume to transgress the limits allowed them, they were still <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>surpers,</hi> and therefore still <hi>Subject,</hi> and accountable for such misdemeanors to those who had empowered them.

And much more, if we consider them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned on <hi>Gods part</hi> of the Covenant; So it will plainly appear that they must derive their Authority wholly from <hi>God,</hi> and therefore can have no other bounds than he is pleased to prescribe them, and even in Case of their transgressing these they can be accountable for such Transgressions only to <hi>God,</hi> not to the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, from whom as no <hi>Authority</hi> was in this Case <hi>derived,</hi> so none could be <hi>reserved</hi> from them, which might make the <hi>Multitude</hi> their <hi>competent Superiors.</hi> So that the nature of this manner of conveyance of Government must make the <hi>Governours</hi> to whom it is conveyed <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>unaccountable,</hi> at least to any <hi>humane Judgment.</hi> At least if the <hi>Multitude</hi> would challenge any Jurisdiction this way, they ought to derive their claim from the same Original, by as clear and express <hi>donation</hi> from <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> as their <hi>Governours</hi> do, which is not, that I know of as much as pretended to. And it is a very strong Presumption against them that <hi>Ecclesiastical Government</hi> was never derived from them, that indeed they never were in a condition of doing it. The <hi>Primitive Converts,</hi> were never united into a <hi>Body</hi> Antecedently to their admission into <hi>Christianity,</hi> but were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by <hi>single persons,</hi> and <hi>successively</hi>; And such could not, even by the Rules of <hi>Democracy,</hi> be supposed to have a power of

disposing of the Original <hi>inherent Rights</hi> of the <hi>Multitude.</hi> Besides it is plain that the first propagators of <hi>Christianity,</hi> Christ himself and the Apostles, had a Right of forming a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety <hi>independent</hi> on the consent of its <hi>particular Nembers,</hi> and their admission of all the first Believers into their Society by <hi>Baptism</hi> does plainly shew that they <hi>acted,</hi> and <hi>owned themselves to act,</hi> by a power that could not have been derived from them.

That no Society whatsoever is governable only by <hi>general</hi> and <hi>immutable Laws</hi> without <hi>particular prudential</hi> accommodations to <hi>present circumstances,</hi> both of which must be derived from the same Authority; and therefore that there must be also in the Church, if it be governed by God, as well <hi>particular Divine Commands</hi> for things which are for the good of it in <hi>particular Circumstances</hi> as for those which are to <hi>immutably</hi> and <hi>eternally.</hi>

And therefore, as in other Cases wherein a Prince cannot be consulted with in things belonging to his Authority, that is to be presumed to be the Princes pleasure which is proposed as such by his <hi>Ordinary Officers,</hi> and Disobedience to such Injunctions of Ordinary Officers is punished as if it had been committed against the Prince himself; so God must also be supposed to have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for such Cases by that general Power which he must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give to Ecclesiastical Officers, whom we are therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to revere as we would approve our Selves obedient to God himself.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97904:96"/>
to their Decisions, and of <hi>compelling Subjects</hi> to submission in their <hi>practice.</hi> For if Subjects be <hi>willing</hi> to perform their Duty, and able to <hi>discern</hi> it in all particular Cases, there would be no need of Authority. But if Authority be supposed necessary, and that some Subjects will, in all likelyhood, prove <hi>disingenuous</hi> as well as <hi>mistaken</hi>; the Society can never be mainteined without a coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive power over such, vested in its Governours, nor without a power of deciding of such Laws <hi>Authentically</hi> in order to <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi> For this power of <hi>Authentical Exposition</hi> is as necessary for preserving the Society in a <hi>Succession</hi> as the <hi>Legislative power</hi> it self was for its <hi>first establishment</hi>; and therefore perfectly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for those Governours which are to keep up the <hi>Succession.</hi> Especially considering that, as I said, no <hi>Authentick Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> are now to be expected from God himself.

For if the Appeal be good, the exercise of Government ought to be suspended till the Cause be decided by the Power to which the Appeal is made, which, if it cannot be expected in this Life, will consequently hinder, in this Life, all exercise of Government by the Persons invested with it, and so leave such a Society destitute of the means necessary for its own preservation in such Cases, that is indeed, in all which the <hi>frowardness</hi> and <hi>mistakes</hi> of the <hi>Appellants,</hi> as well as the <hi>Justice</hi> of their <hi>Cause,</hi> might make such.

shall we know that Persons of a violent temper and Seditious may not pretend the commands of God to be contrary to those of their ordinary Ecclesiastical Governours, not that either they themselves believe them to be so, or that they are at all solicitous for doing Gods will; but meerly that so they may make use of a plausible pretence for gratifying their Seditious humours without the infamy of being thought Seditious? It is certain many may do so, who may either not be guilty of any inclination to any of those scandalous vices which are of ill repute with the Vulgar; or if they be, yet they may count it politick, not only to conceal them, but also to make an open solemn profession for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in order to the gaining of a reputation to their ill designs.

If we consider them as <hi>confederations</hi> into a <hi>Body Politick,</hi> that is, as <hi>Baptism</hi> does admit a <hi>Member</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> and as the <hi>Blessed Eucharist</hi> does, not only <hi>signify,</hi> but, <hi>perpetuate</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> that <hi>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97904:104"/>
the <hi>Right of Governours.</hi> For in all Governments the Right of <hi>admitting Members</hi> into their <hi>Societies</hi> at first, or <hi>continuing</hi> them in it in order to the instating them in the Legal Priviledges of such Societies, is never conceived to belong to <hi>particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> but only to <hi>Governours.</hi> So that if a particular <hi>

For considering that this admission and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Members in a Society does withal intitle them to all the Priviledges of it, if the power of this admission and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be not confined to the Governours, they must consequently be deprived of the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> (for indeed the <hi>Priviledges</hi> Men gain by being of any <hi>Society</hi> are the only <hi>Rewards</hi> that are proper and natural to invite Men to it, or continue them in it, and the <hi>deprivation</hi> of those <hi>Priviledges,</hi> especially if they be so necessary for their Preservation as that the loss of them must inevitably expose Persons so deprived to the greatest incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, are the only <hi>natural Punishments</hi> to discourage Men from doing any thing contrary to the Will of the Governours of such a Society.) And how possible it is for any <hi>Government</hi> to be mainteined in a Society where the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> are not at the disposal of the <hi>Governours,</hi> I believe our Brethren themselves will never be able to explain. And therefore, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant to these Principles, for my part I must confess I do not understand how the validity of <hi>Laicks</hi> and much more <hi>Womens Baptism</hi> (who by the Apostles Rule are much less capable of <hi>Ecclesiastical Authority</hi>) can be defended, unless it may possibly be by that general <hi>Delegation</hi> which may be conceived to have been graunted to them by the <hi>Governours</hi> by those Customes and Constitutions which permit them to administer it. But it would then be a further Doubt, How far such Persons as these are capable of such a <hi>Delegation?</hi> To which I do not intend at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to digress.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XVIII</label> NOW this is the plain Case here. The reason of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition against other Tribes, besides the <hi>Levitical,</hi> intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with <hi>Sacrifice</hi> seems wholly derived from the Notion of <hi>Consecration,</hi> which is a part of that <hi>Natural Religion</hi> which, being obligatory by its intrinsick reasonableness, concerns all Mankind independently on Revelation. So because God had set the <hi>Levites</hi> apart for himself above all the other Tribes of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and had appointed Ceremonies of <hi>Consecration</hi> of which they alone were capable, therefore they alone were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to intermeddle with the <hi>Solemnities</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> because their <hi>Consecration</hi> it self was understood as a solemn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of them to the Right of officiating in the <hi>Solemnities</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and therefore they who were not thus admitted were reputed as Intruders. And the same reason may be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably applied to those higher Offices which were appropriated to the several <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Priest-hood</hi> by virtue of their different <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Consecration</hi> above the other Ordinary <hi>Levites.</hi> For from the Examples of <hi>Korah</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> it plainly appears to have been as piacular and Sacrilegious for ordinary <hi>Levites</hi> to invade the Offices of a higher Consecration as for ordinary <hi>Laicks</hi> to have invaded the <hi>Levites</hi> Office without any <hi>Consecration</hi> at all. And accordingly we find that when <hi>Korah</hi> murmured against the appropriating of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> to <hi>Aarons</hi> Family his Argument was that all the <hi>Congregation</hi> was <hi>Holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

which was transacted by these <hi>external Solemnities</hi> of <hi>Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) that could give them this advantage above others in order to their having the <hi>Priesthood</hi> appropriated to them. And <hi>Moses</hi> by way of reply plainly graunts this, but withal tells them that God would <hi>shew who were his, and who were Holy</hi>;<note place="margin">v.5.</note> that is in that <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> which was then disputed of. Which was neither any <hi>internal Holiness</hi> of their <hi>Persons,</hi> nor all <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>relative Holiness</hi> on account of <hi>Solemn Consecration.</hi> For of some such degrees it was notoriously true that the <hi>whole Congregation</hi> had been indeed consecrated to God by their <hi>Circumcision</hi> and other <hi>external Solemnities</hi>) but in regard of that <hi>particular degree</hi> wherein the Priests had plainly the advantage of them in regard of those <hi>particular Solemnities</hi> of consecrating them to their Office, which the <hi>Ordinary Levites,</hi> and much less the <hi>Ordinary People,</hi> could not pretend to. However we plainly see that <hi>Moses</hi> did not put the issue of this Dispute to that express prohibition, That <hi>the Stranger</hi> (that is, as it is explained here, <hi>Numb.</hi> xvi.40.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> iii.10.</note> He who was not <hi>of the seed of Aaron) who should come nigh,</hi> (that is, to officiate in the Priests Office) <hi>should be put to death</hi>; but on this, Who of them should be found to be more <hi>Holy</hi> in regard of this <hi>relative Holiness,</hi> and the evidence God was to give of his own choice of the Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> above others.</p>

deals, will also be affected with them. For generally their Judgments of others is grounded on their Experience in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and therefore what they presume others to be fearful of, of that it seems they are fearful themselves, and by the same Rule, that of which every Man supposes another to be fearful, of that they feel themselves to be fearful.

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XXXII</label> AND 5. The way of trying <hi>Experimentally</hi> of which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations Men are <hi>most confident</hi> is to Observe in which they do more <hi>ultimately acquiesce.</hi> For it is plain that all Persons are not trusted upon the same Obligations, but according to the Opinion Men have of the <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Resolution</hi> of the Person with whom they deal, so they desire <hi>greater,</hi> or are contented with <hi>lesser, Assurances.</hi> And it is as plain an Argument that <hi>New Obligations</hi> are <hi>desired</hi> when the former are, at least comparatively, <hi>distrusted,</hi> and that even where they are not <hi>altogether diffident</hi> of the former, yet that they are <hi>more confident</hi> of the later. So that that Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to which Men have <hi>ultimate recourse</hi> after Tryal of all others, is that of which they are <hi>most confident,</hi> and every one is by so much the <hi>more</hi> trusted by how much it approaches <hi>nearer</hi> to it. Now by this way of Tryal it is plain that many Men are trusted on their <hi>publick solemn Promises</hi> who would not be trusted on their <hi>private ones</hi>; and that not only in regard of the remedy the Persons to whom they are made may have to force them to performance by proving them (as <hi>Solemn Promises</hi> are more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>proof</hi> than <hi>private</hi>) for even such Persons are more
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97904:110"/>
trusted on their <hi>Solemn Promises</hi> as are subject to no exterior compulsion, as <hi>Princes</hi> (to whom the greatest trusts are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and from whom it is therefore very just and reasonable to expect the <hi>sacredest Assurances</hi>) and there must be something supposed in them more likely to prevail with the Person, who made them, to performance than if they had been made without such <hi>Solemnity.</hi> And it appears also further that these Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental <hi>Solemnities</hi> are of the nature of those Obligations to which Men have their ultimate recourse in their Gradations of Trust. First they who are believed <hi>truly-Conscientious,</hi> and to have a perfect <hi>command</hi> of their own desires are trusted on their <hi>bare word.</hi> Then they, whose repute is more liable to Exception, are yet trusted if the same <hi>Promises</hi> be made before <hi>Witnesses,</hi> which kind of <hi>Promises</hi> not only they will revere who are <hi>truly-Conscientious,</hi> but as many also as are desirous to preserve the reputation of being <hi>accounted so.</hi> But even they who neither value the <hi>Conscience</hi> nor the <hi>reputation</hi> of being <hi>Just,</hi> have yet a natural horror of the mischief that may befall them by being otherwise, especially from an <hi>Invisible Being</hi> whose <hi>Knowledg</hi> cannot be <hi>avoided,</hi> nor his <hi>Power resisted,</hi> and then more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when this punishment of their <hi>Persidiousness</hi> is not only likely to befal them on account of Gods <hi>general Providence</hi> whereby he governs the World, and punishes Mens offences whether they will or no, but also on account of a <hi>voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation</hi> of themselves to it, as it is in <hi>Oaths</hi> which are always understood to have <hi>Imprecations</hi> either <hi>expressed,</hi> or <hi>implied,</hi> in them. For the <hi>Punishment</hi> thus feared is both conceived more dreadful, when it is inflicted not only for the <hi>Injustice</hi> of non-performance, but also for the <hi>Impiety</hi> of making God a voucher of their falshoods (for Men have naturally a greater horror of <hi>Impiety</hi> than <hi>Injustice</hi>) and more <hi>inevitable,</hi> when they have thus devested themselves of an Apology by contributing to their <hi>own Punishment</hi> by their <hi>own Act.</hi> But then an <hi>Oath</hi> is thought most formidable when it is <hi>deliberate</hi> and <hi>solemn,</hi> in matters of the greatest consequence, and where the <hi>Punishment</hi> to be feared, in Case of <hi>Perjury,</hi> is therefore to be expected <hi>most severe,</hi> and where all this is performed before <hi>many Witnesses,</hi> so that the <hi>Perjurer</hi> must lose the <hi>Reputation,</hi> as well as the <hi>Truth,</hi> of being <hi>Conscientious.</hi>

<hi rend="margQuotes">Supposing, that this partaking in the <hi>External Solemnities</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical Covenant</hi> had not been so necessary to confer a <hi>valid Legal Title</hi> to the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi>; yet certainly <hi>it is necessary in Order to our Satisfaction, that we in particular have any Title to them.</hi>
               </hi>
And this alone will be sufficient for my present design. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>we</hi> may be satisfied of <hi>our Interest</hi> in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> we can have no comfort of it; and it has already appeared that this Consideration alone of being <hi>better assured of Pardon</hi> and <hi>Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> and <hi>Acceptance</hi> on the performance of Duty in the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and being <hi>better secured</hi> from the danger of miscarriage than we could have been out of it (especially when it also appears that the Ordinary Arguments of <hi>Probability</hi> are for the advantage of those who are in Communion, and all the

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>II</label> NOW in Order to the proof of this I desire that these three things may be considered:
<hi rend="margQuotes">1. That in Order to our <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> out of the <hi>Churches Communion</hi> it is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that there are no <hi>Positive Arguments</hi> against us to prove us certainly liable to Damnation, but there are also requisite <hi>Positive Arguments</hi> to prove the <hi>Security</hi> of our present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; 2. That no Arguments concerning even the <hi>Security</hi> of our present Condition can <hi>comfort</hi> us but such as may <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally appear,</hi> and so be capable of being <hi>judged of</hi> by the <hi>Persons concerned</hi>; And 3. That though the thing might be true, That we might indeed have even a <hi>Legal Title</hi> to the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical Covenant</hi> without partaking in the <hi>External Solemnities</hi> of it; yet the <hi>External Solemnities</hi> are the only Arguments whereby <hi>we can judg</hi> of our <hi>Title,</hi> and therefore that where <hi>we</hi> want them there <hi>we</hi> must at least want such Arguments as <hi>we</hi> can judg of. Of these very briefly now, because I have elsewhere discoursed something concerning them.</hi>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>III</label> 1. THEN, <hi>It is not sufficient for our comfort and satisfaction out of the Communion of the Church that there are no Positive Arguments to prove us certainly liable to damnatation, but there are also requisite Positive Arguments to prove the Security of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Condition.</hi> This is plain from the common Experience of Mankind. For no man in a storm thinks it a ground of <hi>Positive comfort</hi> that there are no <hi>certain</hi> Arguments of <hi>actual Shipwrack,</hi> as long as there are also no Probabilities of <hi>escaping it.</hi> The want of such Positive <hi>contrary Arguments</hi> may indeed in reason pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his perfect <hi>despair</hi> (if indeed his contrary discouragements do not make him uncapable of so very little supporting reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) but cannot so much as <hi>in reason</hi> be thought a sufficient ground for any <hi>Positive comfort.</hi> At least no Prudent Person, (let his temper be never so inclinable to hope, and therefore let him be never so ready to lay hold on any Arguments for this purpose) can think this hope so valuable as to be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it if he might be relieved from it on any <hi>tolerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Conditions</hi>;

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>IV</label> BUT indeed we find by Experience that the predominating Argument is that which determines Mens Affections. They will therefore not fear at all if all <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>Probable</hi> Arguments perswade their <hi>confidence,</hi> and very <hi>few</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> ones <hi>discourage</hi> them. And we find withal by the same Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that this want of contrary Arguments is of all weak Arguments that which has the least influence on humane Nature. No Man thinks it a Prudent Argument of <hi>Fear</hi> in passing the Streets because he is not sure that the next Tile he passes under shall not fall on his head.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>VI</label> BUT besides, in our present Case, it is very considerable that the <hi>want</hi> of all Means necessary for an Escape is by all Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Persons counted a sufficient Argument to prove the imminent danger of the Person wanting them; so that this alone is sufficient to have all the influence of a <hi>Positive Argument</hi> on a Person who is concerned. For in several Cases the effect does follow as certainly and inevitably from the <hi>want</hi> of the interposition of a Cause that may <hi>hinder</hi> the present natural Course of things, as if it were proved immediately from the <hi>influence</hi> of the Causes themselves; in which Case, the present Causes <hi>not hindred</hi> do certainly determine the effect, and all the use of the <hi>Negative proof</hi> is only to shew, that they shall not actually be hindred. It is thought a <hi>certain</hi> Argument that a Man falling down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice shall assuredly come to the bottome, if we be assured that nothing else shall interpose to hinder him, or if we be assured also that even those Causes, which we can apprehend as only capable of interposing, shall not actually interpose. Even in this Case we think our Selves <hi>Morally Certain</hi> of the <hi>Event.</hi>

Our Brethren them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves acknowledg a <hi>sufficient Cause,</hi> not only for <hi>falling short</hi> of the <hi>rewards</hi> of the Gospel, but also for <hi>incurring</hi> the <hi>Punishment</hi> of it, if unrelieved by the favours of it, that is, <hi>Original Sin</hi>; And therefore they, above all others, are very Pathetical in ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating the inevitableness of Mans l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ss without <hi>Christ.</hi> Thus far therefore it is as certain with them that all must actually perish for whose rescue God does not especially interpose for <hi>Christs</hi> sake, as it is certain that a stone must fall downwards, if it be not hindred and supported by the interposition of some other Cause. And seeing also that there is not any other Interposition to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in this Case, even by our Brethrens own Principles, but that of the <hi>mercy</hi> of God through <hi>Christ,</hi> that which will take away all hopes of this <hi>Interposition,</hi> must in all reason and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence make us proportionably <hi>fearful</hi> of the <hi>Event,</hi> that is, must, at least, perfectly ruin all <hi>hopes</hi> of escaping, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> in our present condition. If therefore it may appear that there are no Arguments to put us in hopes that God will interpose; there can, upon these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, be no hope nor comfort at all, at least, not sufficient for our dissenting Brethrens purpose, to make it <hi>safe</hi> for any <hi>wise man</hi> to acquiesce in this condition when he may change it by <hi>unsinful condescensions.</hi> For indeed for that I have proved it requisite that this continuance out of the Churches Communion had been righter and safer than having it on these Terms, and therefore that the Probabilities making for it had been more, and more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant than those which made against it.</p>

Title</hi> to the <hi>Promises</hi> on Gods part; And a <hi>Covenant</hi> as <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> in a <hi>Legal way</hi> does necessarily imply such a <hi>Legal Notoreity</hi> as that both Parties may be mutually assured of the others Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.

Now this is the Ordinary method observed by such Princes in their <hi>promulgations</hi> that all their Acts must be promulged by their <hi>inferior Officers</hi> to whom we may be capable of having an <hi>immediate access,</hi> and that they be <hi>Sealed</hi> with their <hi>Seal,</hi> and that nothing which is not thus <hi>attested</hi> should be presumed to be the Act of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magistrate,</hi> seeing that the very constitution of such a Method of proceeding was purposely designed to let Subjects know the <hi>true Acts</hi> of such Princes from <hi>Counterfeits.</hi> And therefore God having made the same External provisions of <hi>Visible Officers</hi> to represent him, and <hi>Visible Seals</hi> to confirm what is Covenanted for in his Name, it is the same way to be presumed that he would not have any Covenant trusted to as his which is not thus <hi>managed</hi> and <hi>sealed</hi> by his <hi>Visible Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XII</label> THIS, for my part, is a very considerable Motive to incline Me to believe that those general Preachings of <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> upon the Conditions of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> which the Ministers are Obliged to declare in Gods name to <hi>all Men,</hi> even Antecedently to their <hi>actual initiation</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> were never intended for <hi>immediate Covenants</hi> with them upon performance of those Conditions, but only as preliminary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations to <hi>dispose</hi> themselves for an <hi>actual Reception</hi> into his Covenant by qualifying themselves by these <hi>Conditions</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</hi>

I say, it seems to me a very just reason to believe that those <hi>general Invitations</hi> are no <hi>Covenants,</hi> because they are never Sealed <hi>in general,</hi> but only then when Persons so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed are <hi>actually Admitted,</hi> which had indeed been needless if it had been general on <hi>Gods part,</hi> Obliging <hi>him</hi> to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, only on the performance of those <hi>Moral Conditions,</hi> without any further Act of God for the consummating his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation in a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Law.</hi> But whether there may be <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> or not, Antecedently to <hi>Sealing,</hi> I am not at present concerned. This, at least, seems clear that <hi>Seals</hi> are designed as Instruments of <hi>Notoreity,</hi> and therefore that no Obligation can be <hi>Authentical,</hi> that is, such as may assure <hi>us</hi> of its validity, without them. This I have already proved sufficient for my purpose, and shall not need any more to repeat the Arguments whereby I have proved it to be so.</p>

That the Ordinary Means of Grace are now confined to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; 2.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>III</label> 1. <hi>The Ordinary Means of Grace are now confined to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</hi> Before I prove this, it will be necessary that some things be premised. 1. Therefore I am not now considering the Sacraments as they are Ceremonies of initiation into the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Covenant, or of continuing in it; but as to the particular Benefits for which they are designed. In the former regard I have considered them already. And in that Notion there can be no doubt but that all the Benefits of this Covenant will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them. For as they who have no Title to the Covenant it self can pretend no Title to any of the Benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, so they who are not validly initiated into it, or continued in it by the External Solemnities appointed for that purpose, cannot have a Legal Interest in the Covenant it self. So that by this way of proceeding the <hi>Negative</hi> way of arguing is best secured, "<hi>That they who do not partake of the Sacraments as External Solemnities of transacting this Covenant can have no Legal Title to forgiveness of Sins,</hi> or the Holy Spirit, or any Supernatural rewards, or any other such Benefits which God is obliged to do for us only by virtue of his Covenant. But though this alone be very sufficient for my purpose, yet that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how exactly our general <hi>Hypothesis</hi> suits with the nature of the Sacraments themselves; I shall here endeavour to shew that the loss to be susteined by the deprivation of the Sacraments, I mean, the loss of those Graces which the Sacraments <hi>Convey,</hi> as well as <hi>signify,</hi> to us by virtue of their Divine Institution, is indeed as great as that of the loss of a Legal Interest in the Covenant it self, at least incomparably too great to be hazarded for want of any condescension that is not Sinful. So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we should not consider the Sacraments as Solemnities of investing us into a Legal Right to the Covenant, but only with relation to those <hi>Graces</hi> for whose conveyance they were
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97904:117"/>
immediately instituted and designed, yet even these are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable as to oblige us to depend on them who are alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with the power of administring them. And certainly the least prejudice that can be thought to be susteined by them who want the Sacramental Symbols rather than they will purchase them by unsinful condescensions, must be at least the loss of those Graces for whose conveyance they were purposely designed by God as the only Ordinary Means by which Men might expect them. Especially when the <hi>voluntariness</hi> of such a want is as well a <hi>crime</hi> as a <hi>neglect,</hi> and therefore must so justly cut them off from all hopes of relief by <hi>Extraordinaries.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>IV</label> NOR is this suitableness of this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> with the nature of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and the great Probability which will thence follow, that both of them must be true when they are found thus exactly to agree, the only reason why I am willing to add this proof from the particular nature of the Sacraments themselves to that general consideration of them as Seals of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The truth is I am unwilling to lay the stress of my present design upon a form of speaking so new, and so liable at least to Dispute, as that of the Sacraments being Seals of the New Covenant. I am not so cautious, as if I doubted whether this were true, at least concerning Baptism, that that is indeed a Seal of the New Covenent; but because I had rather, where I can have choice, insist on Principles least liable to contradiction. Nor yet could I think it altogether fit to wave that Argument, both because it is so very apposite for our purpose, and so easily granted by our Adversaries, and so more likely to prevail with them than Arguments less questionable in themselves; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I think so much of it really solid as is necessary for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <hi>Valid Baptism</hi> being only to be had from the <hi>regularly-Ordeined</hi> Clergy is a great Obligation to a dependence on them. And if we only wave the word <hi>Seal</hi> we may take in the other Sacrament also under the general term of the <hi>Solemnities whereby the Evangelical Covenant is transacted and mainteined.</hi> Which as it is equally subservient to our purpose, so I have rather chosen to make use of it because I conceive it really more justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable.</p>

to the Sacraments.</hi> By the former no more is implied but that worthy Communicants do, in the use of these Sacraments, partake of this Grace, which may be very true though God had appointed other Ordinary Means by which the same Graces might be obteined by them who cannot have the Sacraments. But if this were the Case, the <hi>Negative Argument</hi> (for which we are alone concerned at present) would not hold, that they who want the Sacraments must, even in this ordinary way of proceeding, be presumed to want the Sacramental Graces also. For they who want one <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> may still make use of another for obteining the same thing, where there is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a variety; and even in this Case they might have comfort and confidence without the desperate recourse to <hi>Extraordinaries.</hi> My design therefore being to shew that they must want the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Graces</hi> who want the <hi>Sacraments</hi> themselves upon the terms now mentioned, this later thing must be that which I am principally obliged to prove. I confess there are many Errors current among our Brethren concerning the virtue even of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> in general, especially where they think themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged rather to contradict than to lay down any thing positive. And I withal confess that they are their Errors of this kind which have rendred the true Notion of the Sin of SCHISM so very difficult to them. Nor can it be thought strange that their Practice of Schism should unawares betray them into Errors on a Subject whose right understanding would go so far to recover them out of Schism, and to let them see its <hi>mischief</hi> as well as its <hi>Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> And though I think we have as great advantage against them on this Topick as on any; and that their Notions herein are so clearly contrary to the sense of <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and so destructive to the true nature of Sacraments, as that they come the nearest, of any Paradoxes mainteined by them, to their being <hi>Fundamental Errors</hi>; yet that I may confine my present design within as narrow limits as can be allowed for dispatching it with accurateness and solidity, I shall at present consider this virtue of the Sacraments no further than as it shall fall in with my design of proving that the Ordinary Means of Grace are confined to them.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97904:118"/>
whereby we may be assured of Salvation; so it is withal as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that our participation in the <hi>External Solemnities</hi> whereby this Covenant is transacted is the only Ordinary Means whereby we may be assured of our Interest in the Covenant; and that God has neither instituted, nor is pretended by our Brethren themselves to have instituted, any other <hi>External Solemnities</hi> of transacting this Covenant besides the Sacraments. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am now considering the Sacraments under another No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not as Solemnities of transacting the Covenant, but in relation to those Graces for the communication whereof they were particularly designed and instituted by God himself, that which I am at present concerned to prove will be, that the <hi>Graces</hi> hereby conveyed are such as that, without them, Salvation cannot ordinarily be expected; and withal that they are such as that God has instituted no other ordinary way of giving them besides the Sacraments. Both these I shall endeavour to prove together as I have already exprest them in the Proposition.</p>

And yet it is very much to be suspected that some of the places, produced by our Adversaries for proving the efficacy of the <hi>Word,</hi> are only to be understood of the <hi>Word</hi> in this sense. So in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. Where we are said to be <hi>born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God which lives and abides for ever.</hi> The <hi>abiding for ever</hi> here is not so naturally intelligible of the permanency of the Decrees of God, as <note n="(g)" place="margin">

For the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here produced is to prove the <hi>permanency</hi> of our <hi>new life</hi> to which we are here born, that that should also endure for ever, because it is the fruit of this incorruptible seed. But for that it had not been so proper to argue the incorruptibleness of the effects of the Divine Decrees; because the same Decrees which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97904:119"/>
are the reasons why some things are incorruptible, are also the reason why others are corruptible. But the subsistent <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is a very proper Argument for concluding the incorruptibleness of those things which partake of it. In this sense <hi>Life</hi> is an usual Epithete of this <hi>Word.</hi> And from our partaking of this quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit, the Apostle concludes the necessity of our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and resurrection. 1 Cor. xv.

At least this will be impossible to be known from the bare Historical Records of these times, wherein so many things in this very Case were extraordinary, which will, at least, suffice to shew how unconcluding such Texts as these are must prove for our Adversaries purpose, without either <hi>express Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> assuring us of their actual continuance, or <hi>immutable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> from the nature of the things: Which will confine their Proofs within a narrow compass.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97904:122"/>
been baptized by St. <hi>Philip,</hi> that we may not suspect that their Case was then thought extraordinary. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, tells us that though they were distributed different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet that <hi>all had some.</hi> And this seems to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the Religion was sufficiently propagated, even to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi>'s times. So far baptized Christians felt that strange and suddain change in themselves which they could not sufficiently admire, and could never have believed if they had not felt it. And particularly ordinary baptized Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans found themselves to have a power over Devils to torment and vex them, and to force them to quit their Oracles, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves to be seducing Spirits. Now as these sensible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications to the Persons themselves are, by the confession of all Parties, long since ceased, so also this reason is ceased of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences themselves, that the Persons who now receive the Spirit do not expect any new conviction of the truth of the Religion by which they receive it, but confess themselves abundantly satisfied with those Credentials which were exhibited at its first publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But it is also further considerable that besides these reasons for the conviction of the Persons receiving the Spirit in those Ages,</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XVII</label>
               <hi>THERE were also</hi> (3.) <hi>others necessary for the conviction of those Persons who were to deal with them.</hi> Especially when they were to be instructed in something new of which they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant before. Thus it was necessary that the Holy Ghost should fall upon <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company upon St. <hi>Peters</hi> preaching to them, and before their Baptism, because else the Apostle had not been so well satisfied that it was his Duty to baptize them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his vision for that purpose immediately before his coming to them. At least he had wanted that satisfaction which had been requisite for his defence to others, who would have been extremely scandalized at him if he had ventured to practise upon a Revelation made only to himself. We find him expressly making this use of it as an Argument for his own direction in this affair. <hi>Who can forbid water that these should not be baptized,</hi>

                  <hi>Acts</hi> X.47. <hi>Acts</hi> XI.17.</note> 
               <hi>who have received the holy Ghost as well as we?</hi> And again, <hi>If God gave unto them the same gift as unto us who believed on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?</hi> The necessity hereof then appears by the Apology he was afterwards obliged to make for himself in this particular. And indeed it was very
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97904:123"/>
agreeable to the methods of <hi>Prophecy</hi> in that Age, for God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct some even inspired Persons themselves by visible signs of his influences upon others. Thus St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> himself was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the knowledg of our Saviour, That whereas he knew him not himself,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> I.33.</note> he who had sent him to baptize with water, had said unto him, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descend and abiding on him, that is he who baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</hi> But much more this was requisite then when the matter was of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal concernment, and where it was convenient for the <hi>Prophets</hi> reputation that others should be satisfied, as well as himself, that he might not seem to impose on them on his single Authority, which was exactly St. <hi>Peters</hi> Case here. Thus the Apostles Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was recommended to the multitude by the visible descent of the Holy Ghost upon them at the Feast of Pentecost.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> II.</note> But now that we have no hopes of any further Revelation either concerning things or Persons; but that God hath left us intirely to our own natural Prudence, both for knowing the manner of administring those Sacraments which have been derived to us from the beginning, and what Persons have a Title to them; all those gifts of the Spirit which, on this account, were given at the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word cannot now be expected by us.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XVIII</label> AND yet farther (4.) even concerning that power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which accompanies the Preaching of the Word, <hi>it is worth considering in what Preaching of the Word it may be expected, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may only be expected in the Preaching of such Persons as are sent and Authorized; Or may also be expected at the Preaching of such as Preach without Authority, nay in opposition to them who are legally invested with this Spiritual Authority.</hi> And it may be, when our dissenting Brethren have thoroughly considered the now mentioned Observations, and shall then recollect their proofs for this influence of the Spirit accompanying the word Preached, which may reach our present Case, and prove it reasonable for them to expect the like influences now, possibly they will find this to be the solidest reason for their purpose to shew the parity of the Case now as in the Primitive times, That, whereas they will hardly find an express and immutable Promise which may reach our times, the only reason why we may expect the like Assistance now, is that the <hi>Apostolical Office</hi> is still continued as to its <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> though it have ceased long since as to its <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaries</hi>; that they who are called by Persons <hi>Authorized by
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97904:123"/>
God</hi> to call them are as properly Authorized by God in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Successions,</hi> as they who were Authorized by him <hi>immediately</hi>; that deriving their Authority from God, he must in reason be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to <hi>second</hi> them in all Exercises of this Authority, relating to the end for which he had designed it, on the same account as every Supreme Worldly Governour thinks himself obliged, by the Principles of his Government, to ratifie and promote all the Legal procedures even of his inferior subordinate Officers; and that God is <hi>rather</hi> obliged to do this than even worldly Princes themselves, because indeed the effect of all their Ministry depends on his immediate interposition, whereas the power of the Sword committed to inferior Magistrates enables them to do many things without immediate recourse to the Supreme.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XIX</label> IF this way of proceeding be allowed, it will plainly resolve all the ground of expecting this influence of the Spirit in the use of their Ministry into the <hi>Legality</hi> of their <hi>Call.</hi> And however <hi>express Promises</hi> might have been found to assure our expectation of the like influences in hearing the <hi>word Preached</hi> even in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age; yet certainly their <hi>actual performance</hi> could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the hearing of any but Authorized Persons, as no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Prince can, in reason, be thought obliged to <hi>ratifie,</hi> or <hi>second,</hi> what any Rebel or Usurper should presume to proclaim or promise in his name. The boldness of such an attempt is so far from a just title to a confirmation from the Lawful Prince, as that it is always thought to deserve the most exemplary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And if this be the Case, it will serve my end as well as if these influences of the Spirit were thought to be confined to the Sacraments themselves. For this will oblige all to as strict a dependance on the Governours of the Church as the other. For both the <hi>Episcopal Clergy</hi> will be found to have as just an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> as unjust a one, to Preach the Word, as to administer the Sacraments; and it is as much in their power to whom they will <hi>Preach,</hi> as to whom they will <hi>administer</hi> the Elements, and consequently it will be also as much in their power to impose Conditions for the one as for the other. And indeed my whole design, in confining these expectations to the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> is only, by this means, to confine them to the <hi>regularly-ordeined Clergy</hi> on account of that Right which they alone have to <hi>administer</hi> these Sacraments. But though these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences had been granted <hi>always</hi> to accompany the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97904:124"/>

For if any Grace <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi> be communicated by the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by <hi>Preaching,</hi> then still the <hi>Sacraments</hi> may be also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the Salvation of such a Person who still enjoys the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>Preaching</hi>; and therefore he may still be obliged to submit to all unsinful Impositions in order to the obteining these Sacraments which, on these accounts, will appear so necessary for his Salvation. But this cannot be much as plausibly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any of the Texts produced for this purpose by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Where are there any Texts that mention the <hi>pardon of their Sins,</hi> or the <hi>sanctification</hi> or <hi>acceptance of their Persons,</hi> or their <hi>actual reconciliation,</hi> barely on account of that Grace which they had received in their attendance on the Word preached? Where are they said to be thereby <hi>united to Christ,</hi> to be made <hi>members of his Body,</hi> and to be thereby intitled to his constant <hi>vital influences</hi>? These are the effects of the Sacraments, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Grace may be otherwise supposed communicated in hearing the <hi>Word preached,</hi> yet, if it fall short of these, it must also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently fall short of administring any solid <hi>security</hi> for the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of the Persons so concerned. But where is it indeed that they can find that either the Persons who had received this Grace, or the Apostles who were sufficiently satisfied that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, ever thought them secure without that additional Grace which they were further to expect in the Sacraments?

               </note> Nay even <hi>Julian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self went so far as to grant, at least, Gods <hi>illumination.</hi> And this is indeed an eternal immutable reason why the Grace of God should accompany his Ordinance of <hi>Preaching,</hi> concerning as well our present Ages as those of the Apostles. For if this be the Case, that we can neither <hi>apprehend</hi> the <hi>reasonableness</hi> of what is preached to us without the <hi>Divine Illumination</hi> extinguishing our carnal Prejudices, and <hi>quickening</hi> and <hi>Spiritualizing</hi> our faculties, nor be <hi>willing</hi> to perform Conditions till the <hi>Divine Grace</hi> has has made us unwilling; it will thence plainly follow that some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace must be granted us Antecedently to the performance of Conditions, namely all that Grace which is requisite to make the Conditions <hi>performable</hi> by us, that is, all that which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to make us willing and able to perform them. And because the Preaching of the Word is the first address made to us in Gods name, and so the first ordinary step to our conversion, therefore here it is very suitable to suppose us rather <hi>Passive</hi> than <hi>Active.</hi> And therefore if God be supposed indeed to be in earnest with us in his invitations here proposed, it will be absolutely necessary that he perform those beginnings for us without which he knows it impossible that we should perform the rest. But when he has thus put it in our power to receive conviction by the Word Preached to us, this Word will direct us whence we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our further supplies, and it will then be in our Power to go thither for them. And when it is thus in our power to receive
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97904:126"/>
those Assistances which he communicates to us in the use of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, it will then be most agreeable to his design in instituting those Sacraments as ordinary Means of conveying those Assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he should oblige us to the use of them by refusing to grant them otherwise. For all the Ordinances being instituted by the same Power, it is for the reputation of the wise contrivance of them that no one Ordinance should supersede the use of the other, and that as every Ordinance has its distinct benefit, so there should be that obligation to keep up the respect due to an Ordinance of Divine Institution, that none should be encouraged to hope for the <hi>benefit</hi> but in the <hi>use</hi> of the Ordinance. And indeed the only way, to keep up a constant <hi>dependance</hi> on an Ordinance, is to confine to it the benefit to be expected by it, and therefore it is not agreeable with the Rules of the Divine Government to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute two Ordinary Means of obteining the same benefit, so that it might be in the power of good Persons to live in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual neglect of one of them, and it might be in the choice of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Person to choose whether of them he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to neglect.</p>

               <hi>NOR is this less agreeable with the Politicks of the Divine Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment than it is with the ordinary methods of the Divine Goodness in other Cases.</hi> Though he be very <hi>Liberal,</hi> yet he is not <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi> Though he distribute favours proportionable to the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of all, yet he contrives no more Ordinary ways for obtein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them than what may make them possible to the generality, Many particular Individuals do want the necessary supports of his Ordinary Providence when they want the Ordinary Means of obteining them. But much more he observes this Method of proceeding when the benefits are very excellent. For these he ordinarily appoints fewer Means, and obliges particular Persons to greater diligence if they will have them, that they may not fail of those few ordinary Means. But <hi>God is yet further more sparing in his Provisions when the benefits expected exceed the power of Nature.</hi>

And however this method of Conversion here described do fit our Brethrens Systems who speak only of the Conversion of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed initiated Christians, from a <hi>bad,</hi> or <hi>careless,</hi> to a <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>considerate,</hi> way of living suitably to their Profession, yet it will certainly better fit those Conversions mentioned in the Scriptures, from a state of <hi>Judaism,</hi> and <hi>Gentilism,</hi> to a <hi>belief,</hi> and <hi>Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> Now if this be the Case, not only the <hi>Grace of Conversion</hi> is to be expected in this Ministry, and that of a Conversion not from one <hi>Life</hi> to another, but only from one <hi>Religion</hi> to another, it will thence appear how little comfort can be expected from an attendance on this Ordinance without the Sacraments. For what comfort can it be only to believe the Christian Religion true without performance of the Conditions prescribed by it? Or to know what the Conditions are without ability to perform them? Or to know where this ability may be had if we do not make use of Means to come by it? Nay, to make application even to our Brethrens Systems, what comfort were it, to be convinced of the <hi>necessity</hi> of a holy Life, nay to be under the greatest and most serious sense of this necessity, if they want that further <hi>Grace</hi> which is necessary to enable them to practise <hi>Holiness</hi>? Conditional Promises cannot indeed be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued as <hi>Promises</hi> to them who find themselves unable to perform the <hi>Conditions.</hi> And therefore if this ability to perform Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be only to be expected from the Sacraments, this will be sufficient to weaken that extreme confidence which many place in the <hi>Word preached</hi> without the <hi>Sacraments.</hi>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97904:127"/>
End proposed by the Orator, and to <hi>direct</hi> them to the most Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Means for obteining that End. And therefore if God do so far assist the <hi>Word preached</hi> in his name by his Ministers as to make it effectually perswasive to such as are not deficient to themselves, and withal the Word Preached direct them further where they may be furnished with all things necessary for reducing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions to Practice, this will abundantly answer the end of the Word Preached. If he be withal pleased to assist them further in the actual Practice of what they are perswaded to be necessary to be practised by them, yet that will not concern him as a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser</hi> of his own <hi>Will,</hi> nor consequently as he uses <hi>Preaching</hi> as a Means suitable for that purpose; but under another <hi>Notion,</hi> and therefore will be most proper for another <hi>Ordinance.</hi> I confess he might have used Words that should at once perform what they represent, as he did in the Creation, and continues to do in the Consecration of the Eucharist, not to the changing of the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the Elements, but to the producing those Graces in the <hi>use</hi> of them, which so much exceed the nature of those Elements. But where we have no more express intimation of his actual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure than we have here, there we have no better way of judging what he is pleased to do than by judging what he is, by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, obliged to do. And whatever may be his design in other words, (as those now mentioned) yet certainly no more than I have said is rational to be expected in Words of address to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and especially when those Words are urged with the usual ordinary Arts of Perswasion, as Preaching is, as practised by Ministers.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XXVI</label> BUT because one great occasion of mistake in this whole affair, is that the Spirit is conceived to accompany the Word Preached, therefore (8.) <hi>it were well our Adversaries would be pleased to consider, Whether by the Spirit he meant only an influence of the Spirit, or the Divine Person of the Spirit himself?</hi> If the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> were given, and ordinarily given, to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Hearers of the Word Preached, by vertue of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Preaching, and this as often as they come duly qualified for hearing it; I should then confess that the Spirit thus given would serve all Ends of the Sacraments, and make them unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to such Persons. For the Spirit thus given would be a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Divine Life</hi> in them, and therefore must renew, and regenerate, and sanctifie, them. It must <hi>unite them to Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:97904:127"/>
for this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> is the Unity of the Spirit; and as they who have not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> are none of his, so they who have it must be his. This must therefore intitle them to all that he has done and suffered for them. It must <hi>purifie</hi> them by his <hi>blood.</hi> It must make him <hi>live</hi> and <hi>abide</hi> in them. It must convey his <hi>influences</hi> to them. It must be a <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> in them <hi>crying Abba Father,</hi> and assuring them that they in particular are <hi>the Sons of God.</hi> And what other favours can be expected from the Spirit which is given in Baptism? It must make them <hi>one Body</hi> with him. And that is all that our partaking in <hi>one Bread</hi> can do; or, at least, will necessarily infer whatever other favour may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the Eucharist. And if we may expect new degrees of influence from it, as often as we come prepared Hearers of the Word Preached, what further interest can we have to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by receiving the Lords Supper, that can either oblige us to receive it, or be taken for a likely reason why Christ should require it from us, who requires nothing from us in the Gospel, but what either already was our interest, or at least has been made so by his Institution of it, and yet for some more momentous reason than the bare exercise of our Obedience? But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain many more are influenced by the Spirit than they who are possessed by him. <hi>Caiaphas</hi>

They are but dispositions and inclinations to good courses; but do not turn to good will, and good resolutions, till they be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented</hi> to. And no man is to be reputed either good or bad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some kind of consent. And yet even when they are consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, they make a man only <hi>willing</hi>; but for <hi>ability</hi> to perform what he is then willing to perform, they leave him in a need of further Assistances. At least they do not suppose the constant abiding of the same Spirit, as a constant certain Principle from whom they may still expect the like influences. Which conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97904:128"/>
alone is sufficient to shew how little confidence is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in them without the Sacraments. Now that these influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which thus accompany the <hi>Word Preached</hi> are of this kind, may appear hence, that wicked Men are as apt to feel them as others in the hearing of zealous Preachers, and may at the same time strive against them to stifle and suppress them, and this with too fatal a success. But they who have the <hi>Spirit</hi> as an <hi>inhabiting enlivening</hi> Principle, must, whilest they have it so, be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly influenced by it.

            <p>THE <hi>Second Expedient</hi> which many are too apt to trust even to the neglect of the Sacraments is <hi>Prayer.</hi> And the reason which makes them inclinable to this excessive confidence in this seems to be, that as it is the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remedy to which Men betake themselves when they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves destitute of other supports, so withal the Benefits to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by it are not confined to any one certain kind. But as it is the design of <hi>Prayer</hi> to make God our Friend, so when he is made so, and that his good will is gained, all things then seem fit to be expected from him which are within his power, which is unlimited. And if this be so, that all things may be expected by <hi>Prayer,</hi> and that <hi>Prayer</hi> is the <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> of obteining them, it must then indeed follow that there can be no obligation in interest to use any other Means. And if the Spiritual things of Religion be so Spiritually transacted in the Soul of Man as this kind of Persons seem apt to conceive, as to depend on no externals, but that rightly disposed Souls are capable of receiving them in all times and circumstances, and Prayer be the Ordinary Means to produce those Dispositions; and that it be withal one great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the <hi>Christian Institution</hi> to restore Religion to its most natural <hi>Spiritual</hi> way of management, so that as the nature of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97904:129"/>
the <hi>Spiritual things</hi> themselves require no <hi>externals</hi> for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication as <hi>Temporals</hi> do, nay that <hi>Temporal things</hi> do so little contribute hereunto as that they cannot communicate them by any <hi>general vertue</hi> received from the Divine Institution, but that God must be present himself <hi>immediately</hi> to do the things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by Externals, it will seem to follow that God may as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently communicate them without them.</p>

And the design, even of these complyances to <hi>sense,</hi> being by degrees to fit Men for more <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> ways of communication, as they which are more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and more agreeable to the nature of the things themselves; therefore by how much the more Spiritual, the more excellent they must be also, and the rather to be preferred by Persons whose improvements are so high as to make them capable of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by them. But <hi>Closet-Devotions</hi> are managed in a much more Spiritual way than these at the Sacraments. And therefore they who, by a devout <hi>Meditation</hi> on the Death and Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ in their <hi>Closets,</hi> can find themselves more sensibly affected with them than by that sensible representation of them, by going under <hi>water</hi> and rising out of it in <hi>Baptism,</hi> cannot think themselves, on these Principles, obliged to use that which they find less sensibly to affect them. And they who by <hi>reading</hi> the Story of our Saviours Passion, or by using a lively well<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97904:130"/>
the Eucharistical Elements. These are the degrees by which Men come from despising the Authorized Communion of the place where they are born, and of the Church in which they, or their Predecessors, were first Baptized, at length to despise all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and from disparaging Notions of these Ordinances which they have first taken up only to defend a <hi>neglect</hi> of them, at length proceed to a <hi>contempt</hi> of them, and, on a pretence of their own proficiency beyond the needs of such weak Assistances, turn <hi>Superordinances.</hi> I could heartily wish that as many of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Brethren as dislike this Consequence would review their own Principles, and, at least, so far reject them as they find them, on such a review, to justifie this Consequence. If they would do thus with that Equity and Candor which would become them, they would undoubtedly grant me such Principles as would much facilitate my present design.</p>

Therefore when it is pretended that it is the Ordinary Course of Men to have recourse to God for such favours as are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from him, I shall desire them to consider <hi>what Men</hi> they mean? And <hi>in what Cases</hi> they ordinarily take this course? It is only the Practice of <hi>wise men</hi> that can be urged for a <hi>Precedent.</hi> And such can never think it a becoming course, nor can ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be heard in such Prayers as are not accompanied with their own endeavours, so that the only Case wherein they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to such Prayers, is only either for a <hi>blessing</hi> on the <hi>Means</hi> when they can procure them, or to <hi>supply</hi> the <hi>want</hi> of them when they cannot. No <hi>wise man</hi> can with any confidence expect that God should as much as supply in his Case the want of ordinary Means till he have used his utmost diligence to procure them, till he have denyed all humours of his own, and submitted to any thing that is no Sin that falls out to be a Condition of procuring them. So that if there be any <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> of procuring his desires, he must first be supposed to have used these before he can with any reason expect that his Prayers can find acceptance. And therefore this pretence of the efficacy of Prayer can never encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage any to the neglect of any Conditions short of Sin that may be requisite to procure the Sacraments themselves. If there be
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97904:130"/>
               <hi>Ordinary Means</hi> appointed for that purpose, it matters not what the reason is why they are appointed, whether it be any <hi>natural efficacy</hi> of the Means themselves, or whether it be only the <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary pleasure</hi> of him who has appointed them: The obligation is still the same. While they do any way put the thing in our power, we must endeavour, if we expect that our Prayers should prove successful. But suppose God would excuse our want of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, yet it is further to be considered,</p>

But whether such a <hi>Prayer</hi> as desires the <hi>Benefits</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> whilest the Persons who prays neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the <hi>use</hi> of them, can be indeed be esteemed by God as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout,</hi> with what <hi>warmth</hi> soever it be offered, and how much soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Person who offers it, pretends to feel himself <hi>ravished</hi> and <hi>transported</hi> in offering it? If it be <hi>sinful,</hi> it is most certain no <hi>warmth</hi> of the Person can make it really <hi>devout.</hi> And if it be in <hi>disobedience,</hi> it is as certain that it is <hi>sinful</hi>; and as certain also that the breach of any Command whatsoever is <hi>Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>

It is only the observing the Divine Institutions that can secure the favour of God, and make him exorable by us. And unless this be first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, we can have no confidence in our Prayers.

They are not the same <hi>Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> that can excuse us here which might excuse us in matters of smaller importance. We ought to be <hi>very sure</hi> of Gods design here before we run the hazard of practising our own thoughts concerning it. But if our Adversaries would be pleased soberly to reflect, what reason can they have to be so confident of their own Conjectures as a Practice of this nature would require them to be? Has God told them what his whole design was? This is not, that I know of, as much as pretended by them. Or are the natures of the Sacraments themselves so very obvious as that whoever considers them must needs discover their design? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thinks so, if any do so, does not consider why they are called <hi>Mysteries,</hi> which is the <hi>Greek</hi> term answering the <hi>Latine, Sacrament.</hi> If God designed them as <hi>Mysteries,</hi> certainly it must have been his design that the <hi>sacredest</hi> part of them should not be known, at least not obviously, but only to Persons very well disposed. And if so, it is not likely that he would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed it in the Scriptures which all may read, at least not so <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viously</hi> as that every one should understand it. And if so, how come they to be so extremely <hi>confident</hi> in a matter so extremely obscure which God hath designed to <hi>conceal</hi> from them?</p>

They have rather all the reason imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to believe otherwise. The <hi>Representation</hi> is so weak, and the <hi>Elements</hi> here made use of so unsuitable, as that any ordinary
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97904:131"/>
prudent Man could have made a better choice, if that had been his only design, so far they are, in that regard, from discovering a Divine contrivance. Besides the design of the Gospel being, as themselves think, so much for Spiritualizing the Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, it is not likely that God would here have instituted new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations merely for Representations sake, when he purpose-came to abolish so many Representations of his own Institution. And certainly it is much rather likely that he would never have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted such Representations whose use should so frequently and so easily fail, than that he would permit them to be neglected as often as they should do so. If particular Persons might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, as often as they find other Means of raising their Affections than the Sacramental Representations, who would almost be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to frequent the Sacraments? They that presumed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>most perfect</hi> (and they are generally the <hi>less perfect</hi> who presume themselves to be so) would think themselves disobliged from coming, because they needed no Representations at all. And, according to the humour of our dissenting Brethren, who gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally disdain all the <hi>Externals</hi> of Religion as not only <hi>vain,</hi> but <hi>useless</hi> to a truly Religious Soul, the number would be great who would absent themselves on this account. But even the weaker sort would not want an excuse, that they could meet with many other <hi>sensible Representations</hi> which they feel more moving to themselves than those of the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> And then what need would there be of such a formal Preparation of <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> and <hi>appointed Solemnities,</hi> when there would be so few, if any, obliged to be present with them? Publick provisions are never made by prudent Governours but upon account of general necessities. And is it probable that God should make such unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Provisions so little permitted to the Prudence of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ordinary Governours, (whose office it is, by the general Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Government to consider and provide for rarely occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring circumstances) for so very few as by these Principles must be obliged to make use of them?</p>

For there may be other ends that may have been designed by God, then for ought they know there are. And then how can they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that this <hi>end</hi> which they pitch on is either the only or the <hi>principal</hi> one? How do they know but as there may be more, so there may be also more considerable ones? And indeed how can they presume to know all the <hi>Ends</hi> of what God has himself designed as a <hi>Mystery?</hi> Is it by the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> But God who designed them as <hi>Mysteries</hi> cannot be supposed to have revealed there what he designed as <hi>Mysteries.</hi> Is it therefore by the <hi>reasons of the things?</hi> But alas! how unable are they to <hi>fathom</hi> the <hi>depths</hi> of Gods designs?

Yet concerning these things, though we do not know the <hi>things,</hi> we do at least know our own <hi>Ignorance.</hi> But how many things more are there which may be accounted for by God in instituting the Sacraments concerning which we do not know so much as our Ignorance? And how can any then be confident that he knows all Gods designs, especially in such a matter as this, merely by the reasons of the things? Certainly all these things being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, it would be much more rational to presume that these things are not <hi>arbitrary</hi> because God has been pleased to continue them under such a Dispensation as the Gospel, than to <hi>presume</hi> them <hi>arbitrary</hi> for no other reason than because we do not know the reasons of them; and much more rational to presume that something more was designed in them than <hi>bare Representation,</hi> because they are imposed in a Dispensation so <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and which has taught us so little to esteem <hi>sensible Representations,</hi> than to conclude their unobligingness to any, because their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal design is only sensible Representation.</p>

At least these other Popular Principles of <hi>Prayer</hi> are so like in their signs, as to us, to the Spirit it self, that it will be, at least extremely hard, if at all possible, to distinguish them.

               <hi>keeping them in his name,</hi> and of <hi>sanctifying them by the Truth,</hi> seem rather to imply the Party they were of, than any peremptory Decree concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them what they should be.

               <hi>called by his name</hi> as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Old Testament, that is their owning him for <hi>their God,</hi> their giving up their <hi>names</hi> to him, and stiling themselves <hi>his Servants,</hi> in opposition to the Gods of the Heathen, and his owning them for <hi>his People</hi> in opposition to all other Peoples whatsoever. So that by <hi>keeping them in his name</hi> is understood a keeping them in that <hi>visible Society</hi> which he was pleased to own for his <hi>People.</hi> And the same thing is generally understood in the stile of St. <hi>John</hi> by the term of <hi>Truth,</hi> the true <hi>Orthodox Party</hi> in opposition to all <hi>erroneous</hi> ones, as appears generally in the same Apostles Epistles, which seem generally to have been written in the same later times of that Apostle as his Gospel was, and on the same occasions, and with the same design, to keep the Persons he wrote to from the Societies of those Seducers who then began to appear. So to <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 <hi>John</hi> 4. 3 <hi>John</hi> 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>walk in the Truth</hi> is plainly to be of the <hi>true Communion</hi> out of which those deceivers had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. And to <hi>have</hi>

I need not multiply instances out of the First Epistle where it seems also to have been the constant language of this Apostle in the matter we are speaking of. St. <hi>Peter</hi> also seems to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:97904:141"/>
have used it the same way, where he <hi>exhorts</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> V.12.</note> and <hi>testifies that that was the true Grace wherein they stood</hi> to whom he then wrote, which he does plainly to prevent their falling away to those deceiver of which he then only Prophesied that they should come, and therefore still understands it of that visible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety wherein the true Doctrine of the Gospel, (which was then frequently called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) was taught and professed. And that St. <hi>John</hi> speaks consonantly to himself even here also in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, appears plainly in this that they who are said to have been <hi>given him by his Father</hi> are they who have <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> XVII.6.</note> 
               <hi>kept his word.</hi> And what that <hi>word</hi> is appears also from <hi>v.</hi> 17. where it is said to be <hi>Truth.</hi> So that as the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> rather implyes the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Christ than his <hi>Commands</hi> (at least when it is made to be the same with the <hi>Truth,</hi> we have seen it explained so by this Author himself in the forementioned passage of his Second Epistle) so the <hi>keeping of this word</hi> as <hi>true</hi> must accordingly rather signifie an <hi>adherence</hi> to the <hi>Profession</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> as <hi>true,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a continuing firm to that <hi>Society</hi> wherein it was taught, than a <hi>practice</hi> of its <hi>Prescriptions</hi> as <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>convenient.</hi> And accordingly when he prays that his Father would <note n="(e)" place="margin">v.17.</note> 
               <hi>sanctifie them in this Truth,</hi> as he plainly implies that they might <hi>be in the Truth</hi> without any further <hi>Holiness</hi> than that of <hi>external Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> only; so the thing he further desires for them is that his Father would further improve this <hi>Profession</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of his Doctrine into a <hi>Practice</hi> of what they believed which was that alone which could effectually <hi>sanctifie</hi> them.</p>

               <hi>to know</hi> either <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Father,</hi> in the same sense as the Disciples are said to have <hi>known</hi> them. And this knowledg is plainly explained in the same place what it is, that it was their knowledg that Christ was <note n="(g)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib.</hi> v.8, 25.</note> 
               <hi>sent by his Father.</hi> It seems therefore that the <hi>World</hi> who in this sense did not know him, were not they only who <hi>denyed</hi> him in their <hi>Works</hi> by not <hi>practicing</hi> as the belief of his true Mission would have obliged them to do, but they who denyed him even as to the very <hi>external Profession.</hi> And on the contrary they who in this sense are said to have <hi>known</hi> him are they who, whatever their
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:97904:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>works</hi> were, yet at least joyned with others in an <hi>external Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of a belief that <hi>Christ was the Son of God,</hi> and the <hi>true Messias,</hi> and a <hi>Prophet sent by God.</hi> And this is the rather credible to have been St. <hi>Johns</hi> meaning, because we find it to have been the pretence of the <hi>Seducers</hi> alluded to by him, that they also pretended to <note n="(h)" place="margin">1 Joh. ii.4.</note> 
               <hi>know</hi> him in owning the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists which they received in his stead. Therefore it is that in opposition to this <hi>pretended knowledg</hi> of theirs; he does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so so frequently make use of the same word though in a more justifiable sense.

               <hi>Gospel</hi> also. As whoever will accurately observe, will find that most of his peculiar terms, which he seems so much pleased with, and which he therefore does repeat so frequently, were such as were taken from the pretences of the adversaries, and by him challenged as justly due only to the Orthodox Communion; and that this is observed in his <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> as well as in his <hi>Epistle.</hi>

               <hi>restoring the Kingdom to Israel,</hi> so that it seems they had so long retained their old fancies that he should be a <hi>temporal Prince,</hi> which must needs put them into very different apprehensions concerning the whole scheme of the Christian Religion from what it really was. But besides the great design of the Apostle being to perswade his Readers to keep to one <hi>visible Society</hi> in opposition to many others, it had been extremely improper to understand the <hi>World</hi> only of <hi>ill Livers,</hi> seeing there might have been many such in the <hi>Society</hi> he perswaded them to continue in, and many otherwise in those which he perswaded them to avoid. But the sense I have given is as opposite as could have been thought of, that being <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>visible Church</hi> they were <hi>in</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and so were excluded from this Intercession of Christ of which we are now speaking.</p>
            <p>And from this way of arguing it will appear that they who were out of the <hi>visible Society</hi> of the Church are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said to be in the <hi>World,</hi> because of the <hi>peculiar</hi> impiety of the Heresies <hi>then</hi> taught by them, or because of the <hi>peculiar</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery of their <hi>lives,</hi> but purely for this very reason, because they did not keep to the <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> This I the rather observe that our dissenting Brethren of the <hi>present Age,</hi> who neither teach such <hi>wicked Heresies,</hi> nor lead <hi>so wicked lives,</hi> may not think themselves unconcerned in this Argument as long as they yet keep themselves at as great a distance from
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:97904:143"/>
the <hi>visible Society</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> as they did then. Now this does plainly follow from the appropriation of the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> who made all who were not of their Sect to be of the <hi>World,</hi> for that very reason because they were not of it, their Sect, which must therefore also hold proportionably here if the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation be made the same way to the <hi>Orthodox Church,</hi> as those <hi>Seducers</hi> had made it to their own party. And besides, it appears from the constant adequate opposition between the <hi>Orthodox Society</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> which must therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily suppose all who are not of that <hi>Society</hi> to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>World,</hi> because there is no third to which they may be supposed reducible.

               <hi>spoke of the World,</hi> and were <hi>heard by the World,</hi> because they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were <hi>in the World,</hi> a plain sign that he had concluded them to have been <hi>in the World</hi> for something antecedent to their <hi>worldly practices</hi> and <hi>interests.</hi> This may suffice to shew, that they who are out of the visible Communion of the Church are expresly excluded from the <hi>intercession</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>

It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore that I now enquire what this <hi>sin unto Death is,</hi> that our Brethren may understand how nearly they are concerned in it. And this will not be so difficult to know as it is commonly conceived if the former observation be remembred, that it is the Apostles whole design in this Epistle to deal with <hi>whole Parties,</hi> and to appropriate to the Orthodox Society what the Societies of Deceivers had been used to appropriate to themselves as signs that they were in the Right, and as invitations and allurements to draw Disciples after them. Now among other things that were then insisted on as Arguments or advantages of the Orthodox Party, this was one that in the Orthodox Party, where-ever it was, <hi>Life</hi> was only to be expected, and that all other Parties or Societies besides were in a state of <hi>Death.</hi> This was granted on all sides. So that the Topicks for managing the remaining di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes of those times, if they were to prove their own Party true, was either to infer that it was the true Party because <hi>Life</hi> was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in it, or to prove the advantage of Life being attainable in it from the other proofs they had that their own was the <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Party</hi>; or if they were to confute their Adversaries, either to prove that their way was wrong, because <hi>Life</hi> was not attainable in the way observed by them, or to prove that they were in a state
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:97904:145"/>
of <hi>Death,</hi> because their way of serving God was not such as had been appointed by him. It had been easie to have shewn that all the Arguments produced by the Apostle upon this Subject are reducible to some of these Topicks, not only in his <hi>Epistle,</hi> but his <hi>Gospel</hi> also. Where he makes use of the Authority of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,</hi> there his own Testimony was a sufficient Argument; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such a Person was indeed most competent for witnessing the Doctrine of his <hi>Master,</hi> and because his Testimony was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revered even by the seducers themselves, as appears from their backwardness to appear publickly whilest any of the Apostles were living, at least it was generally revered by those good well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persons who might otherwise have been in danger of being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them. But where he is more distrustful of his <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> either in regard of the <hi>perverseness</hi> of the persons he had to deal with, or in regard of the <hi>peculiar Principles</hi> of the seducers who denied the Authority of his <hi>Master himself,</hi> which must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently overthrow all his credit as an <hi>Apostle,</hi> which was only to bear witness to the Doctrine of his <hi>Master,</hi> yet still the things he either <hi>says</hi> as an <hi>Apostle,</hi> or <hi>proves</hi> as a <hi>Disputant,</hi> belong to some of these Topicks.</p>

The very design of all the Miracles he had spoken of in his Gospel, himself expresly tells us was, that they, for whose use he wrote them, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. xx.30, 31.</note> 
               <hi>might believe that Jesus was the Christ the Son of God, and that believing they might have Life in his Name.</hi> Where the <hi>name</hi> is taken the same way as formerly for that <hi>Party</hi> which owned him for the <hi>true Messias,</hi> and the <hi>Son of God</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to those other Parties, which then followed the <hi>Antichrists</hi> or <hi>false Christs,</hi> who <hi>pretended</hi> to that name as well as he. And we see that <hi>Life</hi> is immediately made a consequent to his being the <hi>true Christ,</hi> and the <hi>true Son of God,</hi> that he who really was so must give that <hi>Life</hi> to his followers. And when he had thus proved the credit of his <hi>Master</hi> by credentials much greater than any of his rivals could pretend to, from hence he proves his own credit as an <hi>Apostle:</hi>

               <hi>This is the Disciple who testifies concerning these things, and who wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</hi> And particularly he proves his own credibility from his presence at our Saviours Transfiguration, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Joh. i.14.</note> which was at once an Argument of our Saviours being really such as he pretended to be, when he was owned for such by God himself, and of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

of <hi>him</hi> as an <hi>Apostle,</hi> who was made choice of as one of his Lords greatest favourites to be privy to his most secret concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But most fully he insists on this in the beginning of this Epistle. <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Joh. i.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have beheld, and our hands have handled of the word of Life: (And the Life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and bear witness and declare unto you the Eternal Life which was with the Father, and was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested unto us).</hi> And immediately after he tells the reason why he so much urges his Testimony in this particular: <note n="(e)" place="margin">Ver. 3.</note>

Including among those benefits of the Churches Communion, that which he had before so particularly, nay only, mentioned, that of <hi>Life.</hi> And therefore seeing this Life was to be gained by keeping in the Churches Communion, it plainly follows, that till they had that Communion they must be supposed to want this <hi>Life,</hi> and therefore to be in a state of <hi>Death.</hi>

               <hi>forsake the assembling of themselves together, as the manner of some was,</hi> He immediately gives this reason why they should not do so. <note n="(l)" place="margin">V.26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>For if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledg of the Truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery indignation, which should devour the adversaries.</hi> Here, by the connexion, it is very plain that the <hi>forsaking of the Assemblies,</hi> the <hi>visible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is the <hi>sin</hi> here spoken of, which will also give light to other parallel places in this Epistle, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that in the 6th Chapter. And concerning this it is expresly said that <hi>there remains no more Sacrifice</hi> even for the other <hi>sins</hi> of those who are guilty of this. This plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on what he had observed before <note n="(m)" place="margin">V.11, 12.</note> concerning the <hi>several</hi> daily Sacrifices offered under the <hi>Law,</hi> to which the <hi>one only</hi> Sacrifice of Christ was answerable under the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:97904:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
From whence he argues, that they who had forfeited their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in this <hi>one</hi> Sacrifice must not expect any relief by any <hi>other,</hi> because the dispensation of the Gospel affords no other; no, nor any other <hi>repetition</hi> of this one Sacrifice which is but <note n="(n)" place="margin">Chap. x.26.</note> 
               <hi>once offered,</hi> neither <hi>daily,</hi> nor <hi>once a year,</hi> as those under the Law; nor that any further dispensation can be expected by them who fail of a relief by this, because the only reason why the Law allowed a further dispensation was its own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and insufficiency to perfect its observers: but the Gospel is <hi>perfect,</hi> and its Salvation <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for ever.

And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he argues, that they who offer the same despite to the Gospel, not by transgressing its particular Precepts, but by disowning the very Covenant of it (which he supposes them to do who forsook the Christian Assemblies) must be liable to a much sorer punishment. Because hereby he <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ver. 29.</note> 
               <hi>trampled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the Covenant, by which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and had done despite unto the spirit of Grace.</hi> For these are the priviledges of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which he had been formerly so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending above the <hi>old</hi> one of <hi>Moses,</hi> which must therefore ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate any contempt that may be offered to <hi>this</hi> beyond the contempt of the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And accordingly this sorer punishment allotted for this contempt, is greater than that of <hi>stoning</hi> which was the highest that was proper to be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the highest Legal Judicatories, and which was the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment appointed for this very crime, the now-mentioned place of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> Exactly the same way as our Saviour expresses the greater severity of the Gospel Punishment above the Legal by this same instance of <note n="(b)" place="margin">Matt. v.22.</note>

               <hi>Gods</hi> in the language of that same Philosophy, so they are made <hi>Gods</hi> by participating immediately of the <hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>Son.</hi> But as the Sons Deity is not <hi>Archetypal</hi> in regard of the <hi>Father,</hi> but of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> so there will nothing hence follow so dangerous as these men apprehend, who have not acquainted themselves with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of this Philosophy, as if he should therefore have his Deity uncommunicated from the Father.

               </gap>, in the language of this Philosophy, in regard of the <hi>Son,</hi> because they are according to the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> so, by the same Principles, the <hi>Son</hi> cannot be called so, because he is, even as to his Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Father.</hi> But this only by the way to shew the use of this same Philosophy for clearing this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty with which others have been so much perplexed. 7.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. For
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97904:153"/>
this new <hi>Divine Life</hi> was recovered by the awakening of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by aspiring upwards, which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> so much spoken of in this Philosophy, by exercises of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual operations, and by disuse and dying to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But all these things are most properly ascribed to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, according to this Philosophy. I need not instance in particulars, because themselves make application this way as often as they speak concerning these matters.</p>

               </gap> also. And when I consider the several Arguments made use of by the Apostles for proving Christ to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> from the old Testament it self, from such Expositions as were not likely to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to a pure Man, according to the Principles of these Persons; nay, when I consider that <hi>Philo</hi> in his Mystical Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories of the Scripture does expound some things of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> which the Apostles do by way of Argument apply to Christ as acknowledged Characters of the true <hi>Messias,</hi> with those Persons with whom they had to deal; nay, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that all the Spiritual benefits which were expected from a spiritual Messias, such as was most likely to have been own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Persons I am speaking of, were not, according to their other Principles, capable of being expected from any but the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: I say, when I consider these things, I cannot but think it very probable that these Persons did own indeed that the <hi>true Messias</hi> was to be the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Whence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that in all regards <hi>true Life</hi> must be expected from the <hi>true Messias</hi> only, so that they who are separated from the <hi>true Messias</hi> must, for that very reason, be supposed also from the <hi>true Life,</hi> and therefore to be in a state of <hi>Death.</hi> But then this state of <hi>Death</hi> being proved only from Principles proper to the <hi>true Messias,</hi> will only by force of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence agree to Persons wholly separated even from the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Profession</hi> of him, not to them who separate only from any one of the several Parties which all agree in Profession of him, which is our Adversaries Case at present.</p>

these <hi>Hereticks</hi> seem to have granted them) that <hi>Jesus</hi> was the <hi>Christ.</hi> The Question whether he intended to appear again in the Persons of <hi>Simon,</hi> or <hi>Menander,</hi> or any of those other Seducers, was much fitter to be decided from his own <hi>Doctrine</hi> than from the <hi>Enthusiastical pretences</hi> of concerned Persons?

So that the principal Argument made use of against the <hi>Hereticks</hi> was the credibility of the Church's <hi>Doctrine</hi>; and the principal expedient for securing Persons from the danger of those errours, was to recommend their keeping close to those Assemblies which could derive a regular Succession: And this was not only used by <hi>Ignatius, Hegesippus, Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and so downwards, but even in the Apostolical Age it self.</p>

I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observe at present that they are not therefore said to have been disunited from Christ, because they did in <hi>express</hi> terms disown him, which is the principal thing which is urged to shew how different their case was from the present case of our Brethren.</p>

Whatever the <hi>occasion</hi> was, yet the <hi>Argumnets</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by those Primitive Writers to convince those Seducers of the dangerousness of their condition do certainly come home to our Brethrens Case. My meaning is, they do not only prove that the Seducers could have no <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> because they did either <hi>expressly</hi> or <hi>interpretatiuely</hi> deny him; but also because they had no <hi>visible Communion</hi> with the <hi>visible Church.</hi> So I have already shewn that it was a <hi>visible Association</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> meant <note n="b" place="margin">1 Joh. i.3.</note>, when he exhorted them to whom he wrote to communicate with his own Party, because he and his <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with the Father and the Son.</hi> It seems then there was no <hi>communicating</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> however Orthodox a Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they made of him, without a continuance in the <hi>Orthodox Communion.</hi> So the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. x.25, 26.</note> does not make the denying of <hi>Christ</hi> to be the <hi>true Messias</hi> to be the <hi>willful sin</hi> of which he there speaks so dreadfully, but the <hi>forsaking</hi> of the publick <hi>Assemblies.</hi> And the whole reasoning of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in comparing the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> with the <hi>natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> does plainly suppose, that although all Grace be derived from Christ the <hi>Mystical Head</hi> to the several <hi>Members</hi> of his <hi>Mystical Body,</hi> as in the natural Body all the <hi>vital influences</hi> are derived from the <hi>Head</hi> to the several <hi>Members</hi> respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yet there is withall the same mutual necessity of the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> to <hi>each other</hi> for receiving these influences from the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Head,</hi> as there is in the <hi>Natural Body</hi> for receiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences from the <hi>Natural Head.</hi> And therefore it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the <hi>Natural Body</hi> that any <hi>particular Member</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive influences from the <hi>Head,</hi> if separated from its <hi>Fellow-Members,</hi> by which those influences are to be propagated to it; so it will also be as impossible by the same Analogy of reasoning, for any <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97904:156"/>
receive vital influences from <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Mystical Head</hi> of that <hi>Body,</hi> if separated from its <hi>Fellow-Members</hi> of the same <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body.</hi> And it is observable from the <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Gifts</hi> there mentioned that it must be an <hi>external Organical</hi> Body that is there spoken of, in which only it is that those <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Gifts</hi> were capable of being exercised. And from the reasoning, they must not only be the <hi>Gifts</hi> but the <hi>Graces</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which are most properly to be considered as <hi>vital in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,</hi> that are thus derived.

               <hi>Essenes</hi> themselves were less obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant than the other <hi>Jewish</hi> Sects, but the <hi>Theoretical Essenes</hi> seem to have exceeded them as far as they did the other <hi>Jews</hi> in adhering to the <hi>Spiritual design,</hi> even to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> Now this was the Sect that of all others was most inclinable to be brought over to the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> Especially when the Christians took this very same method to recommend their own Doctrine to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> had done to recommend theirs to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,</hi> that is, when they undertook to shew that their own Religion was indeed no new one, but that very <hi>Mystical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism</hi> which these Philosophical <hi>Hellenists</hi> had so much boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. And accordingly we find no mention in the Histories of the first times of Christianity, of any opposition made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion by the <hi>Essenes,</hi> though we find frequent mention of the other two famous Sects, the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi>; and soon after the very memory of them seems to have been extinguished, very probably by reason of their unanimous conversion, not to mention several customs

then used generally by the Christians, which it is most likely the <hi>Essenes</hi> brought over with them upon their conversion, as <hi>Praying towards the East,</hi> &amp;c. that I may not instance in those many other customs common to the <hi>Christians</hi> and the <hi>Essenes,</hi> of which a plausible account may be given how the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> might have received them from other Originals.</p>

Thus against the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Images</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> ordinarily insist on those Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who make <hi>Man</hi> the best and liveliest representation of the <hi>Supreme Deity,</hi> and thence conclude that all other <hi>Images</hi> were to be rejected. So against <hi>external Sacrifices</hi> they quote those passages of the same Philosophers that disparage the pompous <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of the wicked, and make holy Souls acceptable with very <hi>mean Sacrifices,</hi> or <hi>none</hi> at all; nay, indeed make the <hi>Soul</hi> it self the most acceptable <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> The same thing might have been shewn in their Disputes against the magnificent <hi>Temples</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> which the Christians then wanted, and indeed in all their Disputes whatsoever against those external Solemnities which were not practised among the Christians, though generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among their Adversaries.

that what knowledg they might have occasion to shew, might look more like to Inspiration, or that they might have light on some neglected Translations of some little things of that kind, which might have given them those little hints which might have been sufficient for a warm brain to work upon; yet it cannot be admired that they who had by any means light upon those Principles, should also light on a mistake so obvious, and so very popular, and into which unwary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have been always so apt to fall, pursuant to these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>VII</label> Now the Inferences I would make from my foregoing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse are these. 1. <hi>That our Adversaries may not think their Doctrine so singular, but may see that as their Principles were known, and as the Consequences they draw from them very obvious even to the Persons of those Ages themselves; so they have reason to believe that what the Apostles did resolve on in this particular, they did resolve with a particular design upon our Adversaries Case.</hi> And therefore they are not to allow themselves the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of making <hi>conjectures</hi> from the <hi>reason</hi> of the thing, and by that means both <hi>guessing</hi> what the Apostles would have done, if their circumstances and pretences had been pleaded to them, and <hi>avoding</hi> all Arguments deduced from their Authority whilst they may think they can pretend any disparity in their case and circumstances which the Apostles were not obliged to take notice of in fitting their establishments for the Age they liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in. And this observation will make the Apostles establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Argumentative in this Case, though we suppose them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted therein by no higher measures than those of ordinary <hi>Humane Prudence,</hi> as we have reason to believe they were not in some of their <hi>Ecclesiastical constitutions</hi> which they made, not as <hi>Apostles,</hi> providing for all <hi>future</hi> Ages, and all <hi>possible</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; but as the <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Age, and so concerned no further than for their then <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Circumstances. In what they were immediately inspired by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and in what was desired for all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, we have reason to believe that the Holy Ghost him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self foreseeing all Cases, what was so constitueed must have been fitted to all circumstances that should ever happen, and therefore that whatever can be pretended <hi>now,</hi> was <hi>then</hi> foreseen and provided for, if ever it should be likely to be of general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:97904:161"/>
for such things only are in <hi>Prudence</hi> fit to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in general Constitutions. But in <hi>Prudential Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> made by the Apostles as Ordinary <hi>present</hi> Governours of the Church in that <hi>present</hi> Age, there is not that reason to expect that they should have been assisted with higher influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit than <hi>ordinary Governours</hi> are. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must have acquitted themselves well in such things, if what they did was fitted to the circumstances of that Age, those of them at least that the Apostles were acquainted with, though the constitutions themselves had not been otherwise more infallible than those are which are made by Ordinary Governours.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>VIII</label> But however, if we will allow, what is very reasonable to believe, that even in such constitutions as these were, the very <hi>Prudence</hi> of the Apostles to have been so assisted, though not to discover any Truth which had not been discoverable by them in the use of their natural reasonings, yet at least to secure them from error in those reasonings, that they should judg nothing to be true but what really <hi>was</hi> so, and was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>appearing</hi> to be so by virtue of those Arguments which <hi>they</hi> were capable of discovering by their natural faculties: we may then at least conclude, that if this pretence of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> for excusing the Persons so pretending from the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, was a Case with which the Apostles were then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, it is reasonable to believe that in making their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, though only of present concernment, they did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain what they thought fit to be ordained, even in this case also, because, on this supposition, this Case also was of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent concernment. And then supposing further that their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Prudential Constitutions</hi> were yet <hi>Infallibly prudent,</hi> that is, Infallibly <hi>fitted</hi> to the Cases then foreseen; it will follow, that if the Apostles did not then think it fit to make any allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for such Persons pretending <hi>Perfection,</hi> the reason must have been, because it was really unfit that any allowances should have been made for such Pretenders. And if so, this, at least, will follow, that this pretence alone is not even a just excuse from the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> And yet, though the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had not had any greater assistance than that of their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Prudence,</hi> yet certainly every truly-Pious humble Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who will not so far presume as to think himself more
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:97904:161"/>
perfect than he were, cannot choose but pay a great respect, even to their Judgments, in the Case whose assistances seem to have been such as that they did as well <hi>enlarge</hi> their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals</hi> as well as <hi>cultivate</hi> them with <hi>Supernatural</hi> improvements. And that this was a Case very likely to have been extant, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Apostles times, I have endeavoured to shew by this account I have given of its Original.</p>

Of the two, certainly the Provisions of the <hi>Church</hi> are much more <hi>perfect</hi> than those of the <hi>State,</hi> and therefore must require much <hi>greater Perfection</hi> in him who will pretend to have out-grown them, and who will also expect to be believed in such his pretences. And then what confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion must this bring the world to when they shall, by this means, have freed themselves from all restraints whatsoever? when the <hi>worst men,</hi> who are usually the <hi>highest Pretenders,</hi> shall have this Apology allowed them for all the disorders they can make by this pretended exercise of their Liberty?

At least this <hi>general Presumption</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Legislators mind, is much more likely to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by himself as agreeable to his own design in making those determinations, than these uncertain guesses which these interested Persons make both concerning the singularity of their own Case, and the Judgment which the Legislator would have made of it, if he had thought himself obliged to take particular notice of it. But neither does it only thus appear that the Inference which they would make from these mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Titles, is, in the whole kind of it, very weak for such a purpose as they produce them for: But,</p>

This moral use of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as <hi>Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of transacting the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> does rather derogate from the <hi>Perfection</hi> of God, not from that <hi>Perfection</hi> which a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Being</hi> is capable, as it is <hi>Corporeal.</hi> If further in the <hi>Symbols</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Mysteries</hi> there might have been fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed something that in its <hi>own Nature</hi> might influence the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle</hi> of the Soul, and more easily dispose it for receiving <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> influences, which dispositions such Souls as are already perfect might not be supposed to need, if this is not the Case in our <hi>Christian Mysteries.</hi> The <hi>Symbols</hi> here used are such as are familiar among us, and therefore if they had any

               <hi>and having our Bodies sprinkled with pure water, let us hold fast the Profession of our hope without wavering.</hi> That he should add the mention of this <hi>literal Baptism,</hi> after he had already taken notice of the <hi>Mystical Baptism,</hi> which is indeed the <hi>truly beneficial Baptism,</hi> I cannot but think was done with particular design in an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor so accurate as this is to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and who general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lays so much weight on his particular expressions. And when I consider what he immediately infers from it, that they should <hi>hold fast the Profession of their hope without wavering,</hi> then methinks his design seems to be yet clearer. For plainly by their <hi>holding fast the Profession of their hope without wavering,</hi> he means not so much an adhering to the <hi>Practice</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Duties,</hi> as to the <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>external Profession</hi> of the Christian <hi>Religion.</hi> This was the thing that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> then were most in danger of, of relapsing to <hi>Judaism.</hi> As to their <hi>lives,</hi> and their <hi>sincerity</hi> in what they professed,<note place="margin">Heb. vi.9, 10. Heb. x.25.</note> the Author himself gives them a very good Testimony. And soon after he shews again what he means by it, when he perswades them not to <hi>forsake the assembling of themselves together,</hi> that he also meant an adhering to that <hi>external Communion</hi> wherein that hope was professed, as I have else-where observed.<note place="margin">Chap. 11. §. 14, 15.</note> Now for perswading them to keep to the <hi>external Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>external Baptism</hi> was the properest Argument, because this was indeed an <hi>external initiation</hi> into a particular <hi>visible Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> and was not so applicable to the <hi>external Parties</hi> to which
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:97904:166"/>
they might fall when they <hi>deserted</hi> the Communion of the Church, as the <hi>Mystical Baptism</hi> might be pretended to be, by them who should be seduced to a defection. This <hi>sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from an evil Conscience</hi> being a thing transacted inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and so not capable of discovery in it self, could not oblige to one Party more than another, at least it could not be known to what Party it obliged any otherwise than by supposing it confined to the <hi>external Baptism,</hi> which their senses could inform them where it had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. As therefore it was very agreeable to the Authors interest to <hi>urge</hi> the <hi>external Baptism</hi> for such a purpose as this was, so it was as much for his Adversaries interest to <hi>disparage,</hi> and, if he could, <hi>evacuate</hi> the obligation of the <hi>external Baptism</hi> by that Argument which I have already shewn to have been then so Popular, that is, by extolling the <hi>Mystical Baptism</hi> as the only <hi>really beneficial Baptism</hi> as to all those advantages for which <hi>Baptism</hi> was designed. This therefore the Author seems to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, and, to prevent any such evasion, and withal to urge his own Arguments more closely and convictively, immediately adds this mention of this <hi>external Baptism.</hi> If this were really the Authors meaning, then it will afford us a direct confutation of our Adversaries Notion, at least in this particular of <hi>Baptism.</hi> The sense of this <hi>Divine Author</hi> will then appear to be full and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in the case, that this <hi>Mystical Baptism</hi> is not to be supposed separate from the <hi>external Baptism,</hi> and that the receiving this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Baptism</hi> in the <hi>external Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to all who have so received it, not to forsake the <hi>publick Assemblies</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> whereof they are Members, as they would expect the benefit of this <hi>Mystical Baptism,</hi> which on this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is so inseparable from it; nay, that these are <hi>now</hi> as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for entring into <hi>Heaven,</hi> as the <hi>external Lustrations</hi> were then in the time of the <hi>Law</hi>; for the Priests entring into the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> what personal Holiness soever he might otherwise pretend to. For to this he plainly alludes in that part of the context which gave the whole occasion for bringing in those words of which we are at present discoursing. And that this is really the Apostles sense, will appear to him (who shall consider the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Considerations now mentioned) no improbable conjecture.</p>

            <p>AND Lastly, <hi>This sin of withdrawing from the publick Assemblies, on any pretence whatsoever, is highly condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scriptures, and the condition of Persons guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it is described as extremely dangerous</hi>; so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as that it can be no small <hi>matter,</hi> nor no small <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of a <hi>great</hi> matter, that can encourage any <hi>wise considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Person to venture his Soul upon it. I have already shewn something of this on other occasions. In discoursing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the sin unto Death,</hi> I have shewn, that in St. <hi>John</hi> the dispute was between <hi>Parties,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Party</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and those of the <hi>Deceivers</hi>; and that whatever did belong to <hi>Christ</hi> was confined to his <hi>Party,</hi> and the contrary is said of those who joyned with the <hi>Deceivers</hi>: That as <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>Light,</hi> so they who joyn in the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Profession</hi> of him are said to <hi>have Life,</hi> to <hi>walk in the Truth,</hi> and <hi>in the Light,</hi> and on the contrary, that they who deserted this <hi>Party</hi> externally professing him, are therefore said <hi>not to have the Son,</hi> nor those priviledges which are only to be had by him, but on the contrary to be in <hi>falshood,</hi> to be <hi>in darkness,</hi> to be <hi>in the World,</hi> and <hi>in Death,</hi> for that very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. I have shewed, that if they should be mistaken in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this nature, their very recovery it self, how penitent soever they should prove, is described as very hazardous, so <hi>hazardous</hi> as that no slight <hi>reasons,</hi> nor slight <hi>conveniences,</hi> can make amends for it. I have shewn that they have no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that their <hi>own Prayers</hi> should be heard for any <hi>Spiritual good</hi> thing whilest they continue in that condition, nor that the <hi>Prayers</hi> of any <hi>others</hi> should be heard in <hi>their behalf.</hi> I have shewn that the <hi>sin against the Holy Ghost,</hi> which is so usually dreadful to our Brethrens Consciences, is most likely to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred by this Practice of leaving the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But I must not recapitulate what I have there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scoursed, as the several Heads under which I discoursed them
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:97904:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gave way. I only add some few things now which were not so naturally reducible to the former Topicks.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>II</label> That of <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. is a Text which our Brethren find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely afflictive to them, when they are under anguishes of Conscience. I heartily wish they would seriously consider how much more their <hi>separation</hi> may expose them to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it, than those uncertain guesses at the temper of their own Spirits, which according to their way of management does usually occasion their fearful apprehensions concerning it. I have already observed that it is the great design of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this <hi>Epistle</hi> to secure the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to whom he writes it, from falling away to their old Profession of <hi>Judaism.</hi> And accordingly as the greatest part of the Epistle is spent in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, in proving the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> true from the Notions then received amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves concerning <hi>Mystical Judaism,</hi> which he applies to the <hi>Christian Religion</hi>; so the frequent excursions which he makes, as he has occasion, to apply the several Parts of his Discourse, are plainly to confirm them in the <hi>visible Christian</hi> Communion. For otherwise his whole Discourse had signified little, if they might have had liberty of professing this <hi>Mystical Judaism,</hi> as they had done formerly, and as he plainly supposes the <hi>Jews</hi> to do still, when he argues from those <hi>Mystical</hi> Notions as things acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, in the <hi>Jewish Communion.</hi>

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:97904:168"/>
in the many Divisions for which I am at present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. And indeed all their pains had been needlessly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, if our Adversaries Notion of a <hi>Church</hi> had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. What need had there been to have been so solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for an <hi>invisible Church</hi> consisting of <hi>Elect,</hi> which could never <hi>fail</hi> how much soever they had neglected them? And why should they have been jealous of them, of whose present condition they often speak, as well as themselves could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, if they had thought they could not <hi>fall</hi> from that <hi>Grace</hi> which they had once received? Certainly our Brethren them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves cannot understand these things of any other <hi>Church</hi> than a <hi>visible</hi> one, wherein these <hi>Elect</hi> Persons were not so distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable from others who were <hi>not Elect,</hi> which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for a solicitousness for all, when they knew not who they were that were in danger. Besides, the Apostles Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses do plainly suppose some to have fallen, and that so noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously as that others might beware of their example, and the Persons themselves could not deny a change from what they had been formerly. But if they might have had the benefit of their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and their <hi>Moral invisible</hi> Dispositons in <hi>another Party,</hi> their fall could never have been so notorious.</p>

Their departure from the <hi>Church</hi> does not imply their taking <hi>Christ</hi> himself for a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> but their think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>them</hi> deceived, from whom they depart, in pretending to a <hi>Succession</hi> from him. And therefore as far as this <hi>special ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation</hi> of the <hi>crime</hi> is a <hi>particular reason</hi> of the <hi>severity</hi> of the <hi>Punishment,</hi> so far I shall ingeniously confess that I think our dissenting Brethren unconcerned in it. But then withall it will be fit to be considered that this disparity of their Case can only be as to the <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Persons,</hi> not as to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Thing.</hi> They who in those times and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deserted the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> to go over to his professed Adversaries, must have been more sensible of this consequence of their doing so, because the party, to which they went, did <hi>in terms</hi> profess to believe our Lord an <hi>Impostor,</hi> which was
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:97904:173"/>
the Principle from which all these dreadful consequences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And their <hi>knowing</hi> this must needs have been an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <hi>aggravation</hi> of their Crime. But as to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> the Case is the same <hi>now</hi> as <hi>then.</hi> Whosoever deserts <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>School</hi> must necessarily imply that he is not such as he pretended to be, that is, not so <hi>Authorized from God</hi> as himself pretended; for if they thought him so they could never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any reason why they should desert him. And then all the other consequences follow out of Course. For whoever pretends an Authority from God when he has it not, must be supposed so wicked for doing so, as that there is no other crime chargeable on him by his greatest Adversaries, but it may then prove likely for him to have been guilty of it. So that in this regard the Cases of our present Adversaries, and those of the Apostles times, would be like that of two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons assisting a <hi>Rebel,</hi> who should <hi>pretend</hi> a Commission from his Prince, but <hi>falsely.</hi> The one of them, I suppose, <hi>knows</hi> the <hi>falshood</hi> of his <hi>pretence:</hi> the other does not; but thinks that whilest he serves him he serves his <hi>Prince.</hi> Both of them are alike guilty of the same Crime, and both are as <hi>real Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> and may do as much <hi>real mischief</hi> in prosecuting the <hi>Rebellion:</hi> Only the Crime is not alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable to him who knows what he does to be <hi>Rebellion,</hi> as to him who mistakes it for <hi>Loyalty.</hi> So if they be as <hi>really Enemies</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> whom our Adversaries mistake for his <hi>Friends</hi> as they were in the Apostles times who did not so much as <hi>pretend</hi> to be his <hi>Friends</hi>; if they <hi>really</hi> disown the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in disowning his <hi>Regular Successors</hi> in that <hi>Chair,</hi> though they pretend only to disown the <hi>Men</hi> who are at present possessed of the <hi>Chair</hi>; the Crime of deserting this Chair <hi>now</hi> will prove as grievous as it was in the <hi>Apostles days,</hi> though it be not now so <hi>imputable</hi> to the Persons guilty of it as it was <hi>then</hi> when they had better information. However it will highly concern our Brethren by no means to <hi>neglect</hi> the <hi>real guilt,</hi> whatever they may think of the <hi>imputation,</hi> if for no other reason, yet for this, that the <hi>neglect</hi> will certainly <hi>ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate</hi> the <hi>imputation.</hi> Besides, that the <hi>imputation</hi> it self may prove really <hi>greater</hi> than they are aware of.</p>

how <hi>great</hi> the <hi>guilty</hi> is, and how liable our <hi>Adversaries</hi> are to the <hi>Punishment</hi> suitably to their proportion of the <hi>guilt.</hi> And this is rather <hi>implyed</hi> here than <hi>exprest,</hi> when it is said to be so great as to need a <hi>Renovation.</hi> For it is hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that all they enjoyed before is so totally lost by this fall as that nothing remained of it, and if they would recover any of the advantages of the former state, they must recover them by a <hi>new admission</hi> into that state, and an admission <hi>so intirely new</hi> as if they never had been of it, so little benefit they could expect from their <hi>former Admission,</hi> even in order to the making their <hi>second Admission</hi> more <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Now this <hi>Renovation</hi> it self does also refer to <hi>Baptism.</hi> So <hi>Baptism</hi> it self is expressly called <hi>the laver of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of the renewing of the Holy Ghost,</hi>

for my present design against our modern Adversaries, who as they are, thus far at least, guilty of the same Crime in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting</hi> the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> so do thus far also <hi>deserve</hi> the same <hi>punishment,</hi> that is, they do equally <hi>deserve</hi> that <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> which is proper and proportionable to this <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>guilt,</hi>) but the <hi>means</hi> on which this loss does naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, according as things are settled by Christ's own establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He supposes that their <hi>falling away</hi> from <hi>Christs School</hi> must deprive them of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is his <hi>internal instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and so <hi>proper</hi> to his <hi>School,</hi> and his <hi>Disciples,</hi> as any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour means</hi> of Teaching are <hi>proper</hi> to <hi>ordinary Schools,</hi> as well as the Teaching of the <hi>principal Master.</hi> Whoever leaves one School to go to another, does as necessarily lose the Teaching of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>sher</hi> as of the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>School</hi> which he is supposed to leave. And therefore as our Brethren by their <hi>deserting</hi> the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> are supposed, in the way of arguing used by this Sacred Author, to lose the Title they had to <hi>Christ</hi> as their <hi>Master,</hi> who by this means ratifies the Acts of his <hi>Successors</hi> in his <hi>Chair,</hi> that they who are not of <hi>their School,</hi> shall not be of <hi>his,</hi> as the same thing was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Successions</hi> in <hi>other Schools</hi> from whence the precedent was taken in the first establishment of <hi>Christianity</hi>; and as it is also necessary that they who have not <hi>Christ</hi> for their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> must also lose all the <hi>particular means</hi> he makes use of for communicating his instructions to his Disciples; so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary it is, by this way of Arguing, which this Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds on, that our present Adversaries, as they are also guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the same <hi>desertion</hi> of <hi>Christ's School,</hi> should also lose this <hi>internal Teaching</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> which he makes use of for communicating his instructions to them.

               <note place="margin">St. Joh. xvi.v.14, 15.</note> but his <hi>Fathers that sent him,</hi> which will very justly intitle the <hi>Father</hi> to the Title of a <hi>Master</hi> in the <hi>School</hi> we are speaking of; so he withal tells us of the <hi>Spirit</hi> whom he designed to send, that he should take of <hi>Christ's</hi> (no doubt of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as he immediately says, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Father</hi> hath is his, and he had elsewhere told us that it was his <hi>Doctrine</hi> which he had received from the <hi>Father</hi>) and <hi>shew it unto them.</hi> So that <hi>Baptism</hi> in the <hi>name</hi> of the three Persons, will imply an admitting <hi>Disciples,</hi> not as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Baptisms</hi> of those times did pretend to do, only to some eminent <hi>men</hi> who were to be the <hi>Masters</hi> of the <hi>Sect</hi> to which <hi>Baptism</hi> did admit them, but to <hi>God himself</hi> in all the three Persons, who yet were not to be taken for <hi>three Masters,</hi> but <hi>one.</hi> For, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> by preaching his <hi>Fathers Doctrine</hi> is said to <hi>glorifie</hi> his <hi>Father,</hi> in owning him as the <hi>original Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>; so the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by inculcating the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> is said to <hi>glorifie</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> by still owning the <hi>Son</hi> as the <hi>Master</hi> of those instructions which were thus inculcated by him.

I shall elsewhere have occasion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce instances, and therefore shall forbear them now. I only observe at present that if this be so, the <hi>Mastership</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is no other than the <hi>Mastership</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And so indeed
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:97904:176"/>
it should seem, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> is to <hi>Christ</hi> as the <hi>Shechinah</hi> was to <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and the <hi>Temple,</hi> and accordingly these <hi>Shechinahs,</hi> or visible appearances, are more frequently ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the <hi>Spirit</hi> than to any other Person of the Trinity. And indeed, when the <hi>Spirit</hi> is called the <hi>Spirit of Glory and of Christ,</hi> it seems to be called so, as being, indeed it self, the <hi>Glory</hi> by which <hi>Christ</hi> manifests himself in the Soul. As therefore <hi>God</hi> himself was said to be present with the <hi>Israelites</hi> when his <hi>Shechinah</hi> was <hi>present</hi> with them, and as he is said to <hi>remove his presence</hi> when that was <hi>withdrawn</hi> or <hi>removed</hi> from them; so, according to this way of explication, wheresoever the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>present, Christ</hi> himself will be present also. And therefore, if they who desert his <hi>School</hi> must thereby lose the <hi>presence</hi> and <hi>Mastership</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> they must by necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence lose his <hi>Spirit</hi> also. Now the deserting of the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> I have already shewn to concern our present Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries as nearly as it did them who lived in the times of the Apostles.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XVIII</label> TO proceed therefore in my Explication of this passage of this Divine Author, I now come to that which is indeed most difficult in it. That is, the <hi>impossibility of renewing</hi> such Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers as are here spoken of <hi>to Repentance.</hi> And here it will be convenient to shew, 1. What is meant by <hi>renewing them to Repentance.</hi> And then, 2. What is meant by the <hi>impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of it. As to the <hi>former,</hi> we have already seen that the <hi>fall</hi> here described is a <hi>fall</hi> from their <hi>Baptismal state,</hi> and therefore the <hi>renewing</hi> them implying a putting them in the same state wherein they were before; the <hi>renewing</hi> here spoken of will be most obviously intelligible of a restitution of them to the state of their <hi>Baptism.</hi> And not to lay any stress on the Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal importance of this term <hi>Renovation,</hi> I have also shewn that <hi>Renovation of the Spirit</hi> is peculiarly ascribed to <hi>Baptism,</hi> though it be given there to Persons who never had it before, as it is a <hi>Renovation</hi> of that <hi>Spirit</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> had in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,</hi> and we might all have had from him if he had <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi> in his Innocence. And that the <hi>Renovation</hi> here descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed is said to be <hi>to Repentance,</hi> that also very well agrees with this Notion of our being hereby restored to the state of <hi>Baptism.</hi> For <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Baptism</hi> are always joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,<note place="margin">Act. ii.38.</note> 
               <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you,</hi> says St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:97904:176"/>
And it seems to have been the design of the common <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms</hi> there used, to expiate them from their former impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as well as to admit them to a purer way of living for the future. So St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> before his <hi>Baptism</hi> preaches <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and he charges those who were <hi>baptized</hi> by him to <hi>bring forth fruits worthy of Repentance.</hi> And the same was the design of the <hi>lesser Mysteries</hi> among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> to which <hi>Baptism</hi> was thought answerable among the <hi>Christians.</hi> They were <hi>Purgative,</hi> as the greater were <hi>Perfective.</hi> These things therefore being thus supposed, both these terms of <hi>Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>renewing to Repentance,</hi> will be conveniently intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Baptism</hi> it self. And so the force of the Argument will be, that a <hi>Restoration</hi> to their <hi>Baptismal state,</hi> that is, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again admitted as <hi>Christ's Scholars,</hi> and so the entitling them to the priviledges of <hi>Christs School,</hi> among others, that of the <hi>internal instructions</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is not regularly to be expected without a repetition of their <hi>Baptism</hi> it self, because that is the Ceremony of <hi>admission</hi> into it, so that as they who were not at <hi>first baptized</hi> were never <hi>Christ's Disciples,</hi> so they who cannot be <hi>baptized</hi> the <hi>second</hi> time, are not capable of becoming <hi>Disciples</hi> a <hi>second</hi> time on supposition of a <hi>Relapse.</hi> But <hi>Christs</hi> Institution admits of only <hi>one Baptism.</hi> Whence the Author might infer the same Argument for the difficulty of the restitution of <hi>Lapsers</hi> to the <hi>Church Communion</hi> here, as he does in the tenth Chapter. As he there infers that they who had their <hi>sins once forgiven</hi> them upon their coming to <hi>Christ,</hi> on account of his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> being offered for them, could not expect that they be a <hi>second</hi> time forgiven if they fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from their <hi>first state</hi> which intitled them to forgiveness, because the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is not like that of the <hi>Law,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <hi>often,</hi> but offered up <hi>once,</hi> and that for <hi>ever</hi>; so here, <hi>Christ</hi> having instituted but one <hi>Baptism,</hi> by which men are to be admitted into his <hi>School,</hi> they who forfeit the benefit of their <hi>first admission</hi> by deserting the <hi>School,</hi> can never expect the benefit of a <hi>Second.</hi> And if remission of <hi>sins</hi> be the effects of this <hi>Baptism</hi> which is here described as a <hi>renewing to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> it will then follow, that they who cannot be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a <hi>new Baptism,</hi> must, on that account, be excluded from those hopes, which a <hi>second Baptism</hi> might have given them, of the remission of their <hi>sins.</hi> If this Exposition be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:97904:177"/>
for the true sense of this Author, then the impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will be understood strictly and properly, that as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unpossible for them to get a <hi>second Baptism,</hi> so it will be also impossible to gain that <hi>Renovation</hi> which cannot be expected without it.</p>

The plain reason therefore must have been that God had instituted no <hi>Ordinary means</hi> with a <hi>design</hi> for their <hi>reception,</hi> and that, in this regard, it was <hi>impossible</hi> it should be done because it was indeed <hi>impossible</hi> in the course of <hi>Ordinary</hi> means. But then the reason given is not to shew why it should be <hi>impossible</hi> to <hi>God</hi> himself, but why <hi>God</hi> might make it <hi>impossible,</hi> in the sense now mentioned, by providing no means how it should be done. And can our present Adversaries then plead any thing which may allow <hi>them</hi> better hopes than the <hi>Apostates</hi> of <hi>that Age,</hi> of being received again. Can they now pretend better than they could then to a reiteration of their <hi>Baptism?</hi> Was it just for God to make no provision for their recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after that aggravation of an <hi>interpretative Crucifixion</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in regard of the <hi>Party</hi> to which they joyned themselves upon their desertion? And is it not also <hi>just</hi> (for the other was only <hi>just</hi> not <hi>Obligatory</hi>) for him to inflict the same Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in regard of the <hi>interpretative Crucifixion</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> which we have shewn our present Adversaries to be guilty of, in the desertion it self? Can they shew any thing peculiar in the

               <hi>Christian Religion</hi> why <hi>Lapsers</hi> to <hi>Judaism</hi> should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived again into the <hi>Christian Communion,</hi> rather than the <hi>Lapsers</hi> into any <hi>other Sect?</hi> Nay, is not <hi>Baptism</hi> equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to the <hi>Penitents</hi> who return from <hi>other Sects</hi> as from <hi>them?</hi> and are they not received and reconciled upon their <hi>Repentance,</hi> by the <hi>Absolution</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> as familiarly as other <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?</hi> And if it were only on account of the general establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>one only Baptism</hi> that they were then discouraged to hope for a reconciliation, Why should not our present Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries think themselves as much concerned in that as the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Apostates</hi> to <hi>Judaism.</hi>

               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:97904:180"/>ANOTHER <hi>sin</hi> that our Brethren are usually troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with when they are under any anguish of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, is that <hi>against the Holy Ghost,</hi> concerning the <hi>irremissibility</hi> whereof the expressions are indeed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dreadful. If therefore they be in danger of the guilt of this by their falling away from the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> this I presume, themselves will account such as ought not to he ventured on, but on very <hi>great,</hi> and very <hi>real</hi> necessity; not on so <hi>mean accounts,</hi> and so <hi>little probabilities,</hi> as those are whereby they usually defend their <hi>Separation.</hi> And if the fear of a <hi>little sin</hi> in <hi>obeying</hi> their <hi>Superiors</hi> be taken for so just a reason to excuse their <hi>disobedience</hi> to their <hi>Superiors</hi>; and not only their <hi>disobedience,</hi> but their <hi>resistance,</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> from them; they certainly, when they shall find that by their <hi>suffering</hi> themselves to be <hi>cut off</hi> from the <hi>Church,</hi> and much more by their <hi>voluntary separating</hi> themselves from their <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors</hi> rather than they will pay them the <hi>obedience</hi> which is due unto them, they shall bring themselves into the danger of being guilty of a sin incomparably <hi>greater</hi> in it self, and <hi>more difficultly pardonable</hi> than that is, which themselves can fear they should prove guilty of by their <hi>obedience</hi>; this will certainly oblige them in all Prudence, when they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves put upon the necessity of a venture, to venture on a <hi>lesser evil</hi> rather than a <hi>greater,</hi> and to account that evil <hi>no evil</hi> at all, at least not such as shall be <hi>imputed</hi> to them as an <hi>evil,</hi> when they find themselves forced upon it by the unhappy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of so hard a choice. I know it is a Plea of late much insisted on by them, that even the <hi>appearance</hi> of a <hi>sin,</hi> nay, the <hi>suspicion</hi> of it, is sufficient to excuse them from the otherwise <hi>lawful commands</hi> of their <hi>Superiors</hi> as long as their <hi>private Consciences</hi> cannot free themselves from that <hi>Suspicion.</hi> And this pretence would have indeed a greater appearance of Truth, if their <hi>Obedience</hi> to their <hi>Superiors</hi> were indeed as <hi>indifferent</hi> a thing as they suppose it to be when they make this pretence to excuse themselves from it. No doubt a <hi>suspicion</hi> of <hi>sins,</hi> especially if that <hi>suspicion</hi> be thought <hi>probable</hi> by the Person who is under the <hi>suspicion,</hi> is sufficient to <hi>excuse</hi> him from a performance otherwise <hi>indifferent.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>II</label> BUT if our dissenting Brethren would state the Case right,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:97904:181"/>
they should suppose a <hi>sin</hi> in both Cases, on the <hi>one side</hi> the <hi>sin</hi> of doing the things required from them, and on the <hi>other</hi> the <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>disobedience</hi> to their <hi>Superiors,</hi> and <hi>dividing</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And then no doubt they would not scruple but the securest resolutions of their Consciences in such a Case would be to choose that which were likely to prove <hi>less sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>more pardonable.</hi> Nay, when themselves say that in this Case of <hi>probable evidence,</hi> or at least of the <hi>appearance</hi> of such <hi>probable evidence,</hi> their <hi>disobedience</hi> can be no <hi>sin,</hi> it can only be on this account that they can pretend it, that their <hi>Duty</hi> to obey <hi>God</hi> in such an instance is <hi>greater</hi> than their <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> to their <hi>Superiors,</hi> if indeed they own them as <hi>Superiors,</hi> and acknowledg any <hi>Duty</hi> to them. If therefore it may appear on the contrary, that the <hi>sin</hi> they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of by dividing themselves from the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>greater,</hi> and <hi>less pardonable</hi> than the <hi>sin</hi> they would incur by <hi>submitting,</hi> or at least by paying <hi>passive Obedience</hi> to a seemingly <hi>sinful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>; if they may be convinced that the <hi>sin</hi> of setting up or countenancing <hi>opposite Conventicles</hi> is <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty pardonable</hi> than the <hi>sin</hi> of wearing a <hi>Surplice,</hi> or kneeling at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> &amp;c. Then by the Rules of their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning it will follow that these instances, which otherwise had been <hi>sinful,</hi> are notwithstanding in this Case <hi>no sins</hi> at all, and therefore can be no sufficient reason to excuse their <hi>Separation</hi> from being <hi>sinful.</hi> And that this is so, as I have proved already, so I now proceed to shew particularly from this Topick of the <hi>sin against the Holy Ghost,</hi> which I presume themselves will not deny to be a <hi>sin</hi> both <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly pardonable</hi> than any of those which they pretend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse their <hi>Separation</hi> from being <hi>sinful.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>III</label> NOW for clearing this <hi>sin,</hi> which seems hitherto to have been so little understood, I consider that it is usual in the Old Testament, when it is to express a <hi>provocation</hi> of <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>highest</hi> kind, to express it by a commotion of mind suitable to that which is in <hi>men,</hi> when they are <hi>extremely angry.</hi> And therefore as in <hi>little Angers</hi> in <hi>men,</hi> though they be violent for the time, yet they soon pass away, and leave no great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance on the <hi>mind</hi> of him that is <hi>angry</hi>; but in great ones the very <hi>mind</hi> is disordered, and so the transports become more <hi>lasting</hi> as well as more <hi>vehement,</hi> and the Person who is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

to be so <hi>angry,</hi> is also made by it <hi>more implacable,</hi> and less capable of accepting any terms of <hi>reconciliation</hi>; so the Scripture represents the <hi>Anger</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himself. That the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> of <hi>men</hi> was thus expressed according to the form of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing used in those Countries, we have instances, not only in our <hi>Saviour</hi>

               <hi>Genesis,</hi> and <note n="d" place="margin">Is. lxiii.10.</note> elsewhere.

Then he makes his <hi>Decree,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confirms it with an <hi>Oath.</hi> Thus in <hi>Genesis</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. vi.3.</note> when he had resolved that his <hi>Spirit</hi> should <hi>no longer strive with them,</hi> he immediately resolves that <hi>their days should be an hundred and twenty years,</hi> that is, that that should be the respite he would allow them before the <hi>deluge.</hi> And elsewhere when his <hi>Spirit</hi> is said to be <hi>grieved,</hi> then follows the mention of the judgment which elsewhere he inflicted on them who had so provoked him. And above all other <hi>sins</hi> for which <hi>God</hi> is said to be thus <hi>angry</hi> after the <hi>Law</hi> was settled, <hi>Idolatry</hi> is by <hi>Maimonides</hi> observed to be the only one.<note place="margin">

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:97904:182"/>
could be no great violence to apply them this way, on sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that a <hi>Mystical sense</hi> was to be allowed besides the <hi>Literal,</hi> which was a supposition that seems to have been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally approved by these <hi>Hellenistical Jews</hi> of whom I am now discoursing. Thus as the <hi>Son</hi> is taken for that <hi>intrinsick Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> which he is said to have <hi>possessed from the beginning,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. viii.22.</note> and which the Fathers do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly make it as necessary that he should have <hi>possessed it from the beginning</hi> as that he should have been <hi>wise</hi> from the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>; so the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is by the Apostle made as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>Spirit of a man</hi> is to a <hi>man.</hi> For so he argues:<note place="margin">1 Cor. ii.11.</note> 
               <hi>Who knoweth the secrets of a man but the Spirit of a man which is in him. Even so no man knoweth the things of God, but the Spirit of God.</hi> As Properly therefore as the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man</hi> is said to be <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>disturbed</hi> when the <hi>man</hi> himself is <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>disturbed,</hi> so properly this <hi>subsistent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> may be said to be <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>disturbed</hi> when the Spirit of God is said to be so. And as when a <hi>man</hi> is said to be excessively <hi>grieved</hi> it is all to one purpose whether we say that he <hi>himself</hi> is <hi>grieved,</hi> or that his <hi>Spirit</hi> is so, because the <hi>grief</hi> of the <hi>man</hi> is supposed to be in his <hi>Spirit</hi>; so also, by the rule of the same proportion, when <hi>God</hi> is said to be excessively <hi>grieved,</hi> we are to understand all those places of a <hi>grieving</hi> of his <hi>Spirit</hi> as properly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if it had been expressly mentioned.</p>

And particularly in this very Case of great <hi>provocation</hi> of his <hi>Spirit</hi> he is described as if he suffered the same transports <hi>as revengeful Persons</hi> do when they are under the like disturbances.

these <hi>Passions,</hi> which is so familiar with the Prophets, he is described as implacable and as much bent upon <hi>revenge,</hi> and delighted in it, as revengeful Persons are when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like disturbance.

And therefore seeing this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Spirit</hi> for a <hi>subsistent Being</hi> was, at least, received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, they must have been most likely to understand all those passages of the Old Testament wherein the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is said to be <hi>grieved,</hi> of this <hi>Spirit</hi> of which I am now discoursing.</p>

Supposing therefore, as upon these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is most reasonable to suppose that our Saviour spoke to them in a Language with which they were already well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Old Testament, or at least, from the LXX Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of it, I conceive the account now given from thence most probable how they were likely to understand these expressions.</p>

For it is an inseparable Royalty of the <hi>supreme Governour</hi> to have the nomination of <hi>subordinate Governours,</hi> either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or by his Laws. And where the nomination is made of the Persons by the <hi>Laws</hi> it is always to be presumed as much the Act of the <hi>supreme Governour,</hi> as if it had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him in his own Person, and will as strictly oblige Subjects to Obedience to them; and will make their resistance as properly a disowning of the supreme Authority.

applying the instances of the Old Testament to this purpose; I consider that the Authors who were then for the <hi>Mystical Expositions</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> (as we have seen that the <hi>Christians</hi> both by their <hi>Genius</hi> and their <hi>interest</hi> were for these <hi>Mystical Expositions</hi>) those Authors, I say, supposed that even the <hi>Historical parts</hi> of it were not delivered by the sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters purely for the sake of the <hi>Histories</hi> themselves, but with relation to <hi>future Ages</hi> wherein they might be useful, and yet more especially, with relation to the times of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> Now on this supposition, it was not proper for them to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any <hi>Histories</hi> but such as were designed for <hi>Precedents</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Posterity when Circumstances should prove exactly the same. Nor was this only supposed to have been designed by the <hi>sacred Writers</hi> themselves, but also by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> by whom they were inspired; nay, by <hi>him</hi> rather than by the <hi>Writers,</hi> and these <hi>Mystical secondary</hi> applications were thought more <hi>principally</hi> disigned by him than the concernment of the <hi>Original History</hi> as to the Persons who were at first concerned in it. So that on this supposition it was as rational even to ground Arguments for <hi>present Expectations</hi> on those <hi>past Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> how <hi>Personal</hi> soever they might otherwise seem in their Original design, as no man doubts but it is rational to plead <hi>Precedents</hi> in our <hi>ordinary Courts,</hi> because they were at first designed for that very purpose.

               </gap>imes of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> because the whole Old Testament was thought to have a pecular regard to <hi>those times.</hi> Thus it was as rational for the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Promise made to <hi>Joshua,</hi>

And therefore, 1. This must plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suppose that the <hi>sin</hi> against which the Apostle writes, is exactly of the same <hi>nature</hi> and the same <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Guilt</hi> with those produced by them from the Old Testament. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>Apostates</hi> from the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> must, in this regard, be supposed as criminal as that of the <hi>Angels,</hi> and the <hi>old World,</hi> and the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the <hi>Wilderness:</hi> so that if one be against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the other must be so too. And therefore the same proofs which prove the <hi>Old Testament-sins</hi> to have been against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> must prove the <hi>New Testament-sins</hi> too have been so too, and on the contrary whatever proves the <hi>New Testament-sins</hi> to have been against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> must also prove that the <hi>Old Testament-sins</hi> were so also: so that, on this supposal, each of them will afford the other a <hi>mutual</hi> confirmation. And, 2. As the <hi>sins</hi> are supposed <hi>equally grievous,</hi> so the <hi>Punishments</hi> must be supposed too. For indeed the very design of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in the <hi>New Testament</hi> is from the <hi>equal Guilt</hi> of the <hi>sins</hi> to infer an <hi>equal grievousness</hi> of the <hi>Punishments</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for those <hi>sins.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Punishment</hi> to be feared by <hi>Apostates</hi> from the <hi>Gospel-Dispensation</hi> must, in this way of reasoning, be supposed to be <hi>as grievous</hi> as any of the instances now mentioned. And they are certainly of the <hi>highest kind.</hi> And, 3. I can hardly think but that what the Apostles, on occasion of their mentioning the Old Testament-instances, are pleased peculiarly to remark, that they meant to note as an <hi>instance</hi> wherein they thought them Parallel.

And therefore in <hi>Esau's</hi> Case it being peculiarly noted that he <hi>found no place for Repentance though he sought it carefully and with tears,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. xii.17.</note> I suppose the Author meant that they who should desert the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> as he did, our Worldly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations should expect to find the same difficulty of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, even upon <hi>Repentance,</hi> as he did. And 4. That this <hi>Mystical</hi> way of Arguing requires something suitable in the <hi>other World</hi> to what the <hi>Old Testament sinners</hi> suffered in <hi>this,</hi> which will beget a further dreadful aggravation of their Case who <hi>sin</hi> against the <hi>Gospel-Dispensation,</hi> if the Punishment of these must be as grievous in the <hi>other World</hi> proportionably as the Punishment of those was in <hi>this,</hi> that is, if it must be in the most afflictive part and degree of <hi>Hell</hi> it self.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XXVI</label> TO this Objection it will not be very difficult to answer as far as I am concerned in it.

For the Scripture plainly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses that <hi>all have sinned,</hi>

If therefore it may appear that all Persons <hi>unbaptised</hi> are under the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> till they be <hi>baptised,</hi> it will plainly follow that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievable from that <hi>guilt</hi> by any other means but <hi>Baptism.</hi> For if there were any other means <hi>antecedent</hi> to <hi>Baptism</hi> whereby <hi>sin</hi> might be remitted; then such Persons as might make use of those means might be freed from their <hi>sins antecedently</hi> to <hi>Baptism,</hi> and so could not, when they come to be <hi>baptized,</hi> be supposed under any such <hi>guilt.</hi> This will bring the proof home to the <hi>Negative,</hi> for which I am, at present principally concerned. For my design at present is not hereby to prove that <hi>Baptism</hi> is a means of obtaining <hi>forgiveness</hi> of <hi>sins,</hi> but that it is the <hi>only ordinary means</hi> of obtaining that <hi>forgiveness.</hi> For from hence alone it will clearly follow that it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for every one to be <hi>baptized</hi> who desires that <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>

               <hi>not the putting off the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience as to God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</hi> So I think the Text may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated more agreeably to the sence of the Original than as we have it in our common Translation.

And this <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi> is very properly ascribed to the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> For as our <hi>going under the Water</hi> represents the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Burial</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and does not only <hi>represent</hi> it, but <hi>apply</hi> it to us as if

               </gap>, in the likeness of his Death;) So, I say, by the same way of arguing, our <hi>rising</hi> out of the <hi>water</hi> represents the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and does not only <hi>represent,</hi> but <hi>apply</hi> the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> to us, so that it must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in us a like <hi>signature,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XXXVIII</label> TO sum up therefore this Argument more closely, it hence appears, 1. That the <hi>Salvation</hi> here spoken of consists in our Participation of the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second Resurrection.</hi> And that is a Notion as high as our Brethren themselves can desire to see proved, that it is confined to <hi>Baptism</hi>; And, 2. That all our hopes of <hi>Salvation</hi> in this sence, that is, all our hopes of an interest in the <hi>first</hi> or <hi>second Resurrection,</hi> depend on the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>our</hi> interest in it; 3. That <hi>our</hi> whole interest in <hi>Christ's Resurrection</hi> is derived from our <hi>Baptism.</hi> And this in two regards, 1. As our Title to <hi>rising with him</hi> is grounded on our being first <hi>like him in his Death</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</hi> So the Apostle argues, <hi>If we be planted with him in the likeness of his Death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. vi.5.</note> 
               <hi>we shall be also in the likeness of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</hi> And, <hi>If we dye with Christ, we believe that we shall also reign with him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 8. 2 Tim. ii.11.</note> But it is in <hi>Baptism</hi> that the same Apostle in the same place tells us, that we <hi>dye with him.</hi> Therefore it is in <hi>Baptism</hi> also that we receive our Title to his <hi>Resurrection.</hi> For this also answers the Type, that as <hi>Christ</hi>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:97904:208"/>
was first to <hi>suffer</hi> before he was to <hi>enter into his glory,</hi> so <hi>we</hi> must not fail of being <hi>like him</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. xxiv.26.</note> if we desire to be <hi>like him</hi> in the <hi>other.</hi> And, 2. As the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is it self immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately applyed to us in <hi>Baptism.</hi> (1.) <hi>Christ's Resurrection</hi> does not influence <hi>us,</hi> so as to cause a <hi>like Resurrection</hi> in <hi>us</hi> but as it is <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically applyed</hi> to us. (2.) It is not <hi>Mystically applyed</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> but by a sensible <hi>representation of it.</hi> 3. This <hi>sensible representation</hi> it self cannot <hi>apply</hi> it unless it be by virtue of <hi>signs</hi> of Gods own institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it is he alone who can make the application <hi>effectual</hi> as to the influence required from the <hi>Archetype</hi> for impressing its own likeness. And that he will make the application <hi>effectual</hi> cannot be expected from him by any other means than those of his own institution. And, 4. <hi>Baptism</hi> is the only <hi>sensible representative</hi> appointed by God for this purpose. I know Persons already <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi> are also said to <hi>die with Christ</hi> when they <hi>suffer for him:</hi> But this is never spoken of Persons <hi>unbaptized.</hi> And if we speak of <hi>Christ's Death,</hi> not as only <hi>represented,</hi> but as <hi>applyed</hi> with its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, that can only be <hi>assured</hi> to us by <hi>express Promises</hi> which may assure us of his <hi>actual pleasure:</hi> And those can only be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected with <hi>signs</hi> with his own institution. But when men are at first engraffed into <hi>Christ</hi> by these <hi>means</hi> of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it cannot then be thought strange, that, by vertue of that, all their other <hi>likenesses</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> should be reckoned for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of <hi>Christ</hi> himself.</p>

               <note place="margin">Act. ii.40.</note> the event shews by what means it was that he intended that they should be <hi>saved.</hi> For so it follows, <hi>Then they that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his word, gladly,</hi> (particularly this last word) <hi>were BAPTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZED.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 41.</note> So in the ultimate institution of this Sacrament, <hi>He that believeth and is BAPTIZED shall be SAVED,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark xvi.16.</note> 
               <hi>but he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> Where our Brethren do strangely misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the omission of <hi>Baptism</hi> in the latter part of the sentence, as if the meaning were to imply that only want of <hi>belief,</hi> not want of <hi>Baptism,</hi> should be charged on any for their <hi>damnation.</hi> But there is not the least reason for this consequence. For though <hi>Baptism</hi> had been as necessary to <hi>Salvation</hi> as we conceive it to be, yet there
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:97904:208"/>
had been no <hi>need</hi> of mentioning it here, seeing he who does not <hi>believe</hi> cannot be capable of <hi>Baptism,</hi> and therefore must be respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible as well for want of <hi>Baptism</hi> as of <hi>faith,</hi> and therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of the sentence of <hi>Damnation</hi> may be grounded on both, yet so as that there is no need of mentioning any more than the want of <hi>belief,</hi> because the whole <hi>guilt</hi> of the want of <hi>Baptism</hi> in that Case is to be charged on the want of <hi>faith</hi> as the cause of it. But whatever may be thought of the <hi>actual damnation</hi> of Persons who <hi>inevitably</hi> want it, yet when our <hi>Saviour</hi> reckons it among the <hi>requisites</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi>; certainly the least he could mean by it, is, that he would not encourage any to be confident of his <hi>Salvation</hi> on his <hi>belief alone,</hi> if he wanted <hi>Baptism.</hi> Which will at least make <hi>Baptism</hi> necessary as an <hi>ordinary means of assurance of Salvation,</hi> if not as a <hi>means</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> it self. And this necessity of it for our <hi>assurance</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> is alone sufficient for my purpose. I might also reduce to this Topick the passage of St. <hi>John.</hi> But because I have already prevented my self concerning it,<note place="margin">Joh. iii.5.</note> I say no more of it at present.</p>

Therefore it is also further clear that the <hi>one Body</hi> of which we are made <hi>Members</hi> by communicating in this <hi>one Bread</hi> is no other than <hi>Christs Body.</hi> This appears from the words immediately preceding:<note place="margin">1 Cor. x.16.</note> 
               <hi>The Bread which we break is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ?</hi> and besides from the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I have now explained it. For the reason why we come to be made <hi>one Body</hi> by our partaking of <hi>one Bread</hi> being plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the words of Institution in which <hi>Christ</hi> has called that <hi>Bread</hi> of which we partake <hi>his Body,</hi> it plainly appears that the <hi>Body</hi> of which we partake by this <hi>Bread</hi> is no other than his <hi>Body,</hi> and that his <hi>Personal Natural</hi> one. This plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, because the <hi>Body</hi> of which he speaks when he calls the <hi>Eucharistical Bread,</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> is plainly that which he says was <hi>broken for us,</hi> according to St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epistle, and which was <hi>given for us</hi> according to St. <hi>Luke.</hi>

And considering that it was a Principle granted among them that they were obliged to purifie that part which belonged to God, and their only pretence for neglecting the like <hi>Purity</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> was that they conceived it not to belong to him, but to an <hi>adverse Being</hi> whom they were neither so obliged to <hi>please,</hi> nor, if they would please him, was it so probable that he would be pleased with <hi>Purity:</hi> what could be a properer means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their mistake in this particular, and to oblige them to <hi>Corporal Purity,</hi> than to perswade them to give up their <hi>Bodies,</hi> as well as their <hi>Souls,</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and to give him an interest in them by a particular and distinct Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

in this matter, when they thought to excuse themselves for the omission of their Duty on account of the obligations they put on him by offering <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to him. And hence the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> conclude that the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> were only of <hi>Secondary Intentions</hi>; that, because God wanted them not, he would never have required them, if he had not found them already taken up in honour of them to whom they did not so properly belong. In this regard, he could not be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly said to <hi>institute,</hi> as to <hi>translate</hi> them to their proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that if men could not be broken of this way by which they had been used to express their honour to the <hi>Deity,</hi> they might, at least be induced to pay that honour, however ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed to <hi>that Deity</hi> to which the honour was properly due. And if this were his design, then certainly it was his meaning to convey the same Divine influences to the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> used among them, as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had been used to expect from their own <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> from which they had incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably less appearing reason to expect them; and withal to convey the same influences to the <hi>Christians</hi> who were the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Israel</hi> by their <hi>Mystical Sacrifice,</hi> which the <hi>carnal Jews</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by their <hi>bloody</hi> frequent <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> And therefore, by these Principles, whatever <hi>participation</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> is most properly to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> allowed by it. It is very true, that, in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as it is the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and none other, which is received, so it is the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> which was Sacrificed by the <hi>breaking</hi> of that <hi>Body,</hi> and none other that is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented; and as true that that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is <hi>represented</hi> only, not <hi>repeated</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> Yet this representation is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as really to apply the <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as if it had been really <hi>repeated,</hi> and the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants</hi> had feasted on the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> it self.

However, to return to my first design, it appears plainly from this whole <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi> that our being <hi>made one Bread</hi> is the ordinary means, at least, whereby we are <hi>made one Body.</hi> Whence it will follow that they who fail of their being <hi>made one Bread,</hi> after their <hi>Baptism,</hi> do, according to the same proportion wherein they fail of it, fail also of their interest in that <hi>one Body.</hi> If they separate themselves <hi>intirely</hi> from the means of obtaining it, they must, by the same Legal way of estimation, be supposed to <hi>discontinue</hi> their <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership</hi> of that <hi>one Body</hi> as they were <hi>made one Body</hi> by <hi>partaking</hi> of it. If they <hi>discontinue</hi> their receiving that <hi>Bread</hi> where they have means of obteining it, this very <hi>discontinuing</hi> is a proportionable losing their interest in the Body. As a branch of a tree, if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not constant supplies of sap from the root, must gradually die and cease at length to be a branch, though it can no more be told punctually in what moment the vegetative Life ceases in such a branch, than it can be told precisely how long a time of <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence</hi> from the <hi>Sacraments</hi> does deprive the Person guilty of that <hi>abstinence</hi> of his <hi>Spiritual Life.</hi> And that the loss of this <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life</hi> wherein none can have an interest without an interest in the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> which is <hi>enlivened</hi> by it, and the loss of this title to this <hi>blessed Resurrection</hi> of our <hi>Bodies</hi> themselves, are losses of things necessary to Salvation, will not, I believe, be denyed by our Adversaries themselves.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>AND though I know that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> was not yet instituted when our <hi>Saviour</hi> had that Mystical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in St. <hi>John</hi> VI. yet withal I cannot but think that our <hi>Saviour</hi> intended even then to warn them of the necessity of a <hi>Corporal</hi> as well as <hi>Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with himself, and to give them such an account of it, as, though they did not understand it at present, yet they should when they should be fitted
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:97904:228"/>
for understanding it, and when it should be fulfilled. I know it was usual among the wise-men of those parts in their <hi>Mystical</hi> Discourses to represent <hi>wisdom</hi> under the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of <hi>meat.</hi> But to represent it under the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of <hi>mans flesh,</hi> nay, of his <hi>own flesh</hi> who was then discoursing with them, sounded so unusual and harsh to his Auditors, who understood him <hi>literally,</hi> as that we find they were not able to bear it. And certainly he would not have used so offensive an <hi>Allegory,</hi> if he had not designed a greater advantage by it <hi>afterwards</hi> than he enjoyed by it at <hi>present.</hi> And though he usually explained to his Disciples <hi>in private</hi> what he discoursed in <hi>Parables</hi> to the <hi>Multitude,</hi> yet that was as they were <hi>able to bear it</hi>;<note place="margin">Mark iv.33.</note> and with some things he did not think it fit to acquaint them during his Corporal presence among them. Particularly we find him cautious in acquainting them with his <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>ignominious</hi> circumstances of it, which was a thing so contrary to their received Notions concerning the <hi>Messias,</hi> as that it would have weakened his <hi>general Authority</hi> among them, on which the credit of the <hi>particulars</hi> proposed by him did all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, if they had been acquainted with them before they had first been prepared by exercise to endure the scandal of a <hi>suffering Messias.</hi> Yet this had been necessary to have been known by them before they could throughly understand his design in these words, supposing they were meant with relation to the <hi>Eucharist</hi>; which may serve for a just account why he did not speak more plainly concerning it than he did <hi>then,</hi> even to his own <hi>Disciples.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides we have elsewhere examples where it is expressly noted that his Discourses had express relation to things to be fulfilled afterwards,<note place="margin">St. Joh. ii.22. Luk. xxiv.8.</note> and to be understood by his Disciples when they were fulfilled, and not before, that we may not admire at his doing so in this matter.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>II</label> AND as it is probable that our <hi>Saviour</hi> did hereby prepare them that they might, by degrees, understand their obligation to a <hi>Corporal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with him, and of partaking of that <hi>Bread</hi> which he should afterwards appoint as an ordinary means of <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting</hi> that Union; so it is also very probable that the Apostle did also design it for the use of the separaters of that Age wherein he wrote his Gospel, to let them also understand their obligation to keep that <hi>Communion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep. ad</hi> Eph. p. 3.</note> wherein this <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Ignatius</hi> soon after tells us, is only to be had, concerning which our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> had spoken so great things before his institution of it. Any
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:97904:228"/>
one who considerately reads his whole <hi>Gospel</hi> may observe, that those things which were added by him above what had been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the other Gospels, especially the Doctrinal part of them, are generally such things whereby his Readers might be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their obligation to adhere to <hi>him</hi> in opposition to the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists</hi> which then appeared, that is, certainly, to that <hi>Society</hi> which was visibly united in an external profession of adherence to <hi>him,</hi> in opposition to those many other visible Societies which were also visibly united in an external profession of adherence to his <hi>Rivals</hi> and <hi>Adversaries.</hi> And many of the same things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in this case are also insisted on in his <hi>Epistle</hi> which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly written on this Subject, and with more particular regard to this very case. Nor certainly could he have chosen a more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Argument for this purpose than this was, what our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> design was in instituting the <hi>Eucharist.</hi>

I said that the great use of this <hi>fleshly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> was principally to secure us of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our <hi>Bodies.</hi> Accordingly he frequently mentions the <hi>Resurrection</hi> here,<note place="margin">Joh. vi.39, 40, 44.v.58.</note> and that as a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar benefit of this <hi>eating</hi> the <hi>Eucharistical Bread.</hi> So he tells them, <hi>This is the Bread which descended from Heaven; not as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did eat the Manna and are dead, he that eateth this Bread shall live for ever.</hi> Where by <hi>living for ever</hi> must certainly be meant the <hi>life</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> when it is opposed to that <hi>bodily death</hi> which befel their <hi>Fathers</hi> after their <hi>eating</hi> the <hi>Manna</hi> in the <hi>Wilderness.</hi> I said that our title to the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our <hi>Bodies</hi> was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately grounded on our partaking of his <hi>flesh.</hi> This is also our <hi>Saviours</hi> doctrine in this place.<note place="margin">Ver. 54.</note> 
               <hi>He that eateth my flesh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my blood hath eternal Life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</hi> And to this purpose he calls his <hi>flesh meat indeed</hi> and his <hi>blood drink indeed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 55.</note> because it does perform the office of <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> to more effectual purpose than any worldly meat and drink does. The office of <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> is to preserve <hi>Life</hi> which the <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> do only for a <hi>time,</hi> but these for <hi>ever.</hi> I said that this partaking of his <hi>flesh</hi> united us to him; And so says al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so our <hi>Saviour himself, He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 56.</note> 
               <hi>abides in me, and I in him.</hi> This mutual <hi>abiding in each other</hi> are the terms whereby this Apostle usually explains their being <hi>one
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:97904:229"/>
with each other,</hi> and that in the Person of our Saviour himself. <hi>And I have given them the glory which thou gavest me,</hi>

               <hi>that they may be One as we are One, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in One.</hi> I said that by this participation of <hi>Bread</hi> we partake also of his <hi>flesh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. vi.51.</note> So also says our Saviour, <hi>The Bread which I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the Life of the world.</hi> And it is very observable that when he speaks of the <hi>Bread</hi> which himself was to <hi>give,</hi> he still speaks in the <hi>future,</hi> which will make it much more likely that he should mean it of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> which he had not as yet instituted, than of his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> which he was delivering to them at that present.</p>

               <hi>gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the Lord hath spoken, Behold, the Altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.</hi> So in the contests between <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and the <hi>false Prophets</hi> that were his rivals,<note place="margin">Jer. xx.6.xxviii.15, 16, 17.xxix.21, 22, 31, 32.</note> he confirms the truth of his own Mission, and the falshood of theirs, by <hi>predictions</hi> of judgments which should befall the false <hi>Prophets</hi>; and by the course prescribed for knowing a <hi>false Prophet</hi> by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents not answering his Prediction,<note place="margin">Deut. xviii.21, 22.xiii.1, 2, 3.</note> or however that he should not be believed though it should have proved answerable, if he endeavoured to seduce them to Idolatry; it plainly appears, both that <hi>signs</hi> were the usual means for distinguishing <hi>true Prophets</hi> from <hi>false</hi> ones, and that these <hi>signs</hi> were generally <hi>predictions,</hi> by which it will be easie to understand the reason of that which has puzzled so many Expositors, why the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they had <hi>seen</hi> so many miracles performed by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> should yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a <hi>sign</hi> from him, because no <hi>miracles</hi> were counted <hi>signs,</hi> but such as were done purposely in proof of his <hi>Mission,</hi> and vouched by him for such before their performance, and which afterwards in the events punctually answered their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</hi>

not be too expressly and particularly foretold, both that the <hi>Prediction</hi> might not hinder the Persons concerned from enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on the event, and that after it was come to pass it might then be understood the rather to proceed from <hi>God,</hi> by how much it was the less <hi>foreseen</hi> by <hi>second Causes.</hi> And none doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that many <hi>Prophesies</hi> might be certainly <hi>understood</hi> when they were fulfilled, which were not understood before.

THEREFORE the <hi>Spiritual advantages</hi> of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are not immediately conveyed in the <hi>external participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them. And all Laws make a real difference between these two sorts of conveyances, when the <hi>thing</hi> it self is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately conveyed, and when only a <hi>Right</hi> to it is conveyed by which the Receiver may recover it from him who has it in possession. For example, he who is actually put in possession of a piece of Land by him who has no Authority to give him possession, does however continue in possession till he be again Legally dispossest. And the Nullity of such a Givers act does not appear in the immediate effect, but only in this, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can confer no Legal Right, therefore he cannot se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Possession he has given whenever the Law shall take notice of what he has done. But he who has the same Land conveyed to him only by <hi>promises</hi> before witnesses, or by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> or even by <hi>earnest,</hi> is not as yet put in Possession of the Land it self, but is still left to the <hi>Law</hi> to recover the possession of the Land so conveyed, from him who is as yet possessed of it. And if the <hi>Promise,</hi> or <hi>Instrument,</hi> or <hi>Earnest</hi> be given by such a Person who has no <hi>Legal Power</hi> to give them, the <hi>Nullity</hi> of such a grant is such as will never be likely so much as to gain him an <hi>actual Possession.</hi>

IV.</hi> As they were at <hi>first</hi> unjustifiable by the Principles of <hi>Government,</hi> so they can plead nothing which may make that justifiable <hi>now</hi> which was <hi>then</hi> unjustifiable. They cannot plead a <hi>lawful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. §. V.</hi> If they could, yet this Proposition will cut them off from pleading it against <hi>God. §. VI, VII, VIII.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position proved, <hi>1.</hi> From the reason of the <hi>thing. §. IX.</hi> This performed by two degrees. <hi>(1.)</hi> It is <hi>God</hi> alone that has the <hi>right</hi> of disposing the <hi>Spiritual benefits</hi> here conveyed. §. <hi>X, XI, XII.</hi> The reason of the Adversaries mistakes. §. <hi>XIII. (2.)</hi> It is none but <hi>he</hi> that can give <hi>Possession</hi> of them. §. <hi>XIV. 2.</hi> From the <hi>actual</hi> establishment of <hi>God.</hi> No such <hi>Authority actually</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon the <hi>People. §. XV, XVI, XVI.</hi> The weakness of the Argument from bare <hi>Primitive Precedent</hi> for proving a <hi>right conferred</hi> shewn from the many <hi>condescensions</hi> of those times, and the <hi>Prudence</hi> of the <hi>Reasons</hi> that required them. §. <hi>XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV, XXV.</hi> The <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness</hi> of this way of Arguing. §. <hi>XXVI.</hi> There were then <hi>circumstances</hi> proper to <hi>that Age</hi> which <hi>required</hi> particular <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension. §. XXVII.</hi> Though the <hi>Negative Argument</hi> be not good, yet the <hi>Positive</hi> is, that the <hi>actual claim</hi> of <hi>Governours</hi>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:97904:245"/>
then is a good <hi>presumption</hi> that they had a <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>Power</hi> so <hi>claimed</hi> by them. §. <hi>XXVIII.</hi> Persons <hi>extraordinarily-gifted</hi> at length made <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>ordinary Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church. §. XXIX, XXX, XXXI.</hi> This derivation of <hi>Power</hi> rather from <hi>Governours</hi> than from the <hi>People,</hi> agreeable to those <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> whom the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> were most likely to imitate. §. <hi>XXXII, XXXIII, XXXIV, XXXV.</hi> A way proposed for accommodating the several <hi>Interests</hi> concerned, in <hi>Ordination</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>those times. §. XXXVI, XXXVII.</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> unlikely to confer this <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> on the <hi>People,</hi> if left by <hi>God</hi> to their own <hi>Liberty,</hi> according to the Notions which then prevailed among the <hi>Christians. §. XXXVIII.</hi> Remarks tending to the satisfaction of the Lovers of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace: 1.</hi> This way of <hi>arguing</hi> from the <hi>actual establishments</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as it is much more <hi>modest,</hi> so it is also more <hi>secure</hi> for finding out the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> than any <hi>conjectures</hi> we can make from the <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>thing. §. XXXIX, XL. 2.</hi> Though the <hi>People</hi> had this <hi>inherent right</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, yet it cannot exclude a <hi>right</hi> of <hi>God</hi> who may, when he pleases, resume this <hi>right</hi> into his <hi>own hands, §. XLI. 3.</hi> If the <hi>People</hi> ever had such a <hi>right</hi> originally, yet all that has been done <hi>since</hi> for <hi>alienating</hi> that <hi>right</hi> which could be done. §. <hi>XLII.</hi>

from <hi>God</hi> as all other <hi>things</hi> as well as <hi>Authorities,</hi> are derived from him, who is not only the <hi>Supreme Prince,</hi> but the <hi>first Cause</hi> of all things. Nor do I mean only that it must be from <hi>God</hi> the same way as all other, even <hi>Secular Authority</hi> must be derived from <hi>him,</hi> at least <hi>Providentially,</hi> though the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> were <hi>originally</hi> never so much at the disposal of the <hi>Persons</hi> to be governed. For whatever the <hi>Creature</hi> has ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally the disposal of, it must be supposed at first derived from <hi>God.</hi> But yet, in a way of <hi>Providence</hi> God does also frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispose of <hi>Governments,</hi> which had been otherwise in the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> liberty to dispose of, as in those <hi>rights</hi> which are gotten by <hi>just Conquest</hi> and <hi>Prescription,</hi> where the <hi>rights</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> are certainly disposed of by <hi>Providence</hi> without any possible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>consent</hi> in the <hi>Persons</hi> obliged to submit to it. For the <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>Creature,</hi> where-ever it has any, is not to be understood so as to derogate from the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to dispose of them as he pleases, whatever <hi>right</hi> they have, as it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be derived from <hi>him,</hi> if it be indeed any <hi>right</hi> at all; so that derivation does not rob him of any of that which he had before. It is to be understood, not <hi>Privatively,</hi> as they say, but <hi>Accumulatively.</hi> My meaning therefore is, that this <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>administring</hi> the <hi>Sacraments</hi> must be so derived from <hi>God,</hi> not as to exclude the <hi>mediation</hi> of such <hi>men</hi> who have received it in a <hi>Succession</hi> from <hi>him,</hi> but so as to exclude all <hi>right originally</hi> derived from the <hi>Creature,</hi> as far as the <hi>Creature</hi> is capable of such a right <hi>originally</hi> in contradistinction to <hi>God.</hi> That is, that no <hi>men</hi> have a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Government</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affairs</hi> but by a particular <hi>donation</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> not by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that <hi>general right</hi> which <hi>God</hi> has given every one, by his <hi>general Providence,</hi> to take care of <hi>himself,</hi> and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every <hi>individual Person</hi> may for <hi>himself,</hi> and much more whole <hi>Multitudes</hi> may, by common <hi>consent</hi> commit to <hi>others.</hi>

On which Principles, though the <hi>first Dividers</hi> had been guilty of <hi>Schism,</hi> yet it might have been possible that their <hi>present Successors</hi> might have been innocent of it, supposing that their <hi>Prescription</hi> had been such as had been requisite by that <hi>Law</hi> which gives a <hi>Legal force</hi> to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,</hi> that is, that it had been <hi>long</hi> enough, and <hi>peaceable,</hi> that is, particularly with regard to <hi>those</hi> who were concerned in the <hi>injury</hi> which was done at the <hi>first Division,</hi> that is, that the <hi>Bishops</hi> had given some Argument, if not of their <hi>approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> yet at least of their <hi>consent.</hi> Though I cannot but withal warn that I do not know how to clear our dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns <hi>practices</hi> from the charge of <hi>Schism,</hi> even by this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick of <hi>Prescription</hi> it self.

All that I infer from their settlement, is only this, that it is no way likely that they did believe that the <hi>People</hi> had any such <hi>inherent right</hi> in the <hi>Ecclesiastical Government,</hi> as our Brethren conceive them to have, and which the <hi>reasons</hi> and <hi>Authorities</hi> produced by them in this Argument prove, if they prove any thing.

not so <hi>probable</hi> as the <hi>motives</hi> of <hi>credibility</hi> of <hi>those Ages</hi>; I say, besides this, there are other prudent inducements which might in reason make one more confident of the <hi>judgment</hi> of <hi>those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> than of those <hi>Reasons.</hi> We know no <hi>reasons</hi> which they could not know as well as we, but they knew many of which <hi>we now</hi> are ignorant; and besides were much better able to <hi>judg</hi> of the <hi>same reasons</hi> which we both know than we are. <hi>We know none which they could not know.</hi> For the <hi>reasons</hi> from the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> and peculiarly of <hi>Government</hi> as <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> are not proper to any <hi>one Age.</hi> But for bringing these reasonings down to determine the <hi>rights</hi> of any <hi>particular Government,</hi> many particular <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> are requisite to be known, of which <hi>they</hi> were undoubtedly better <hi>Judges</hi> than <hi>we</hi> are.

They better knew the <hi>precedents</hi> from whence they were taken, and the <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al state</hi> how those <hi>precedents</hi> were observed by <hi>them</hi> from whom they were taken.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XLI</label> A SECOND thing I could wish observed in relation to this Argument is this, That though the <hi>People</hi> had this <hi>inherent right</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> originally, as our Brethren pretend them to have had, yet it cannot <hi>exclude</hi> a <hi>right</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who can, when he pleases, take the <hi>right</hi> into his <hi>own hands.</hi> Which
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:97904:261"/>
when he would be pleased to do, <hi>Subjects</hi> were as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to submit to his disposal of them, as if they never had any <hi>right</hi> of disposing of themselves. I have already given my reasons elsewhere, and shall not now repeat them. I only observe at present, how much safer it is, on this account also, to acquiesce in Gods <hi>actual establishment,</hi> than to trust to our <hi>reasonings</hi> from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> which are much more <hi>uncertain,</hi> and <hi>unsecure,</hi> as to our <hi>Duty.</hi> For supposing that by the <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> we should find that the <hi>People</hi> might, by their <hi>internal right,</hi> pretend a title to dispose of the <hi>Government,</hi> this might indeed take them off from making any further enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into Gods <hi>actual establishment,</hi> but could not, in the mean time, secure their <hi>practice.</hi> For if, by his actual establishment, he had reserved the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> wholly in his <hi>own hand,</hi> and had actually subjected us to his <hi>own Rules</hi>; he that should insist on that <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> for defending himself against these <hi>actual impositions,</hi> could not be excused, by that pretence, for his <hi>disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> For though the <hi>People</hi> might have had a <hi>right,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> had left them to themselves, to prescribe or abrogate Rules for the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of <hi>themselves</hi>; yet in case <hi>God</hi> has made use of his own <hi>Prerogative,</hi> they cannot <hi>then</hi> pretend to such a <hi>right,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> has prevented it. And he who, in that Case, should refuse <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> would be a <hi>rebel</hi> against <hi>God,</hi> though he broke no <hi>compacts</hi> made by the <hi>People,</hi> whether <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>without,</hi> his <hi>particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi> This will shew that, how conclusive soever the <hi>reasons</hi> be, yet, for security of <hi>practice,</hi> all must be obliged to depend on <hi>Gods actual establishment.</hi> Which may let our Brethren see their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to enquire into <hi>this</hi> for the <hi>security</hi> of their <hi>Practice.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§ </seg>XLII</label> A THIRD Observation is this, that, if the <hi>People</hi> ever had any such <hi>original right,</hi> yet all has been done for <hi>alienating</hi> it that could be done.

and confirming the sentences of their <hi>Superiors</hi> against such Persons as challenged such <hi>rights</hi> in their <hi>Name</hi>; whatever could be done by a long and uninterrupted peaceable <hi>prescription</hi> against them: Whatever could be done by these, or by any other means, that are by <hi>Humane Laws</hi> thought sufficient to make a <hi>valid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; all this has actually been done to deprive the <hi>People</hi> of this <hi>right,</hi> if ever they had it. And therefore no other <hi>right</hi> could be challenged by them but an <hi>unalienable</hi> one by any <hi>act</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> not <hi>alienable</hi> even by the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, as <hi>Ecclesiastical Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</hi> This alone can justifie their <hi>resuming</hi> such a <hi>right,</hi> though they <hi>once</hi> had it, after so many <hi>presumptions</hi> of a <hi>Legal conveyance</hi> of it from <hi>them.</hi> If they could <hi>lose</hi> it, all was done that could be to <hi>make</hi> them <hi>lose</hi> it. And if they challenged it when they had <hi>lost</hi> it, they challenged it when they had no <hi>right</hi> to it, and therefore all that was done pursuant to such a <hi>claim,</hi> must not only have been <hi>injurious</hi> to their <hi>Superiors,</hi> but a perfect <hi>Nullity</hi> in it self. And therefore, if they will needs decline <hi>Historical Testimonies,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue only from the <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>thing,</hi> it were well they would take care that their <hi>reasons</hi> proved, not only that it was <hi>once</hi> the <hi>Peoples right</hi> to dispose of the <hi>Government Ecclesiastical,</hi> but that it is their <hi>unalienable right.</hi> For if they grant it to have been <hi>alienable,</hi> they will then be obliged to enquire into matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> to know what has been done towards an <hi>actual Alienation.</hi> And I cannot foresee what our Adversaries themselves could desire for an <hi>Alienation</hi> for whose <hi>validity</hi> they were concerned, which they can find missing in the Case proposed for <hi>alienating</hi> this supposed <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi>

And is not the very supposition of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>wronged</hi> of it, of their not having it given them, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Argument that <hi>actually</hi> they have it not? unless possibly they suppose that either they may <hi>have</hi> it without being <hi>given,</hi> or have it from <hi>God immediately,</hi> though they cannot pretend to have it from <hi>Persons Authorized</hi> by him.

And though possibly some particular <hi>persons</hi> might have entertained singular Opinions, yet it is not so secure to presume his conveyance of <hi>Orders</hi> to have been fitted to his singular Opinions, not only because it is not so easie to presume that any particular Person did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a <hi>singular Opinion,</hi> when the generality were so agreed in another; nor only in regard of that resignation of <hi>Judgment</hi> which in those Ages was thought <hi>excellent</hi> in point of <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> on which account many thought themselves obliged to follow the sentiments of their <hi>Superiors,</hi> in contradiction to their <hi>own</hi>; but also because the validity of <hi>Succession</hi> depends on the <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Generality,</hi> of <hi>all places</hi> and <hi>Ages,</hi> but especially of <hi>all Ages.</hi> And though a <hi>particular person</hi> might <hi>intend</hi> differently from the rest of his <hi>Brethren,</hi> yet he could <hi>give</hi> no more than himself had <hi>received,</hi> and what that was depended on the intention of his <hi>Ordeiner,</hi> which again will be best presumed from the sense of the <hi>Generality.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>supreme power</hi> is that which can never be presumed to have been <hi>confined.</hi> At least this is a <hi>presumption</hi> that the Bishops then acted according to the Opinions and Canons then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

Whenever it was vented, it seems to have been vented with particular design, and particular provocation. Not to ascend to the more knowing times, for in truth I am not desirous to touch the reputation any men have gained in the World where it may be spared with the interest of Truth, that is indeed where errors have not been introduced into the World by the Authority of men of undeserved reputation, and there sure none can blame me for complying with so unpleasing a necessity. The first time that it was retrieved after St. <hi>Hierome</hi> seems to have been in the eighth Century, and then with a particular design upon the <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> whose power was then maligned as derogatory to the <hi>Ordinaries.</hi> And the wisest course for reducing them, and withal the least invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, was thought to be, not so much directly to magnifie the power of the <hi>Ordinary</hi> as to magnifie the dignity of them who had been subject to the <hi>Chorepiscopi,</hi> which they endeavoured not only by <hi>degrading</hi> the <hi>Chorepiscopus</hi> to the orders of a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but by <hi>extolling</hi> the office of a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to an equality in some regards with the <hi>Bishops,</hi> to whom <hi>they,</hi> the <hi>Chorepisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> himself, as well as <hi>other Presbyters,</hi> were obliged to pay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as indeed he was. All this dispute was nothing but pure design, and how very disingenuously it was managed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the several Epistles of antient Popes counterfeited in that Age, for this very purpose to prove the <hi>Chorepiscopi</hi> to have been <hi>simple Presbyters,</hi> which may justly make us jealous

This they knew to be a more popular Art to make him odious without discovering their own ambition. And in our present case, we know that this was the reason that made the <hi>Papal Bishops,</hi> even in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> so averse to the asserting the <hi>Divine institution</hi> of their own <hi>order.</hi> And this I believe our Brethren themselves will confess to have been a very corrupt design.

<pb n="507" facs="tcp:97904:286"/>
               <hi>suspicions</hi> were sufficient to have awakened all their diligence for suppressing them. When I consider these things, I cannot but think that the Persons who then mainteined this Opinion concerning the <hi>identity</hi> of the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> must needs have been very far from thinking of any <hi>consequence</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to their present establishments, much less from <hi>attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> any thing in <hi>practice,</hi> till pure <hi>necessity,</hi> as well as <hi>opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> forced them upon it. They did not therefore pretend to excuse <hi>Presbyters</hi> from the least instance of their <hi>Canonical Obedience</hi> to their <hi>Ordinary,</hi> even of that <hi>Obedience</hi> which was prescribed by the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>those times.</hi> So far it is from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>probable</hi> that they <hi>intended</hi> to give them the peculiar <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>ordeining others</hi>; nay, so far do they seem from so much as judging it fit in <hi>Conscience</hi> that this <hi>Power</hi> should be given to them who were then ordein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Presbyters.</hi> And yet from what has been already said, it appears sufficiently that nothing short of their <hi>actual intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to give them this <hi>Power</hi> can suffice to <hi>legitimate</hi> our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns <hi>present Ordinations.</hi>

            <p>BUT though we should suppose those Persons <hi>then</hi> to have been altogether of the same mind which they conceive those to have been of who lived in the <hi>Apostles</hi> times; though we suppose, not only that they thought it fit that the <hi>whole power</hi> of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> should be given to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but that they had <hi>actually</hi> given it them; suppose we that the <hi>Bishop</hi> had no more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>reserved</hi> to him than only to <hi>preside</hi> in their <hi>Assemblies,</hi> that is, to <hi>call</hi> them, and to fit in the <hi>first place</hi> of them when they were convened, that is, supposing that the <hi>Bishops Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> were no more than what was consistent with the <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical</hi> form of <hi>Government</hi> which they conceive to have been observed in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> (though this supposition be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously false concerning the <hi>Ages</hi> I am speaking of) yet I do not see how, even <hi>this way,</hi> our Brethren can defend the <hi>validity</hi> of their <hi>Ordinations</hi> by <hi>single Presbyters,</hi> especially as it is <hi>practised</hi> among them.

of that which must be allowed to <hi>other Presbyters</hi> as <hi>fellow-members</hi> of the <hi>same Assemblies.</hi>
               </hi>
1. <hi>In regard of the power of the Bishop as President of those Assemblies.</hi> For by the Fundamental Principles even of <hi>Aristocratical Government</hi> it is certain, 1. That no <hi>power</hi> can be given but by the act of that <hi>Body</hi> wherein the <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> is originally seated, that is, in our case, of the <hi>whole Presbytery.</hi> It is against the <hi>interest</hi> of all <hi>Societies,</hi> and the <hi>principles</hi> of all <hi>Government,</hi> that <hi>single Members</hi> even of those who have otherwise <hi>power</hi> in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> with others to dispose of the <hi>Government</hi> of a <hi>Society,</hi> should be allowed the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>disposing</hi> of it in their <hi>single</hi> capacities. But it is peculiarly against the <hi>right</hi> of a <hi>Polyarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Government,</hi> because no <hi>particular Member</hi> has the <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>whole Society,</hi> and therefore cannot dispose of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of it, which, whether it be <hi>supreme</hi> or <hi>subordinate,</hi> must imply either a <hi>power</hi> over the <hi>whole Society,</hi> or a <hi>power</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily <hi>derived</hi> from that which is so. Even <hi>subordinate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> must be derived from the <hi>supreme,</hi> that there may be such an essential <hi>dependence</hi> upon it as is necessary for the <hi>safety</hi> of all <hi>Societies.</hi> This will therefore make it a <hi>Nullity</hi> in the <hi>thing,</hi> if <hi>single Members</hi> do presume to dispose of that which is not their <hi>own right</hi> alone, but the <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>whole Body.</hi>

As by the <hi>nature</hi> of this <hi>Government,</hi> the <hi>right</hi> of it must be supposed to be in the <hi>whole Body,</hi> so neither can any <hi>act</hi> be presumed to be the <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>whole Body,</hi> but what has passed them in their <hi>publick Assemblies.</hi> Though <hi>every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Member</hi> for <hi>himself</hi> should signifie his <hi>own consent,</hi> yet it is not taken for the <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> till it be also signified in an <hi>Assembly,</hi> and it is taken for the <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>whole Society,</hi> if it pass them in their <hi>Assembly,</hi> though without the <hi>consent</hi> of every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Person,</hi> so it have the <hi>prevailing</hi> vote; nay, though that <hi>prevailing vote</hi> be not the <hi>greater part</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> so it be only of the <hi>greater part</hi> of those which are <hi>present</hi> in such <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.</hi> For the <hi>reason</hi> of this I say no more at present, but that it is found necessary for all <hi>Multitudes</hi> to agree on these <hi>Rules</hi> for settling <hi>Assemblies,</hi> and for giving this power to what is done in such <hi>Assemblies</hi> to conclude the whole <hi>Societies,</hi> and to the <hi>prevailing vote</hi> of those <hi>Assemblies</hi> to conclude the whole <hi>Assemblies,</hi> before they can pass out of the state of a <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> into that of a <hi>Society,</hi> that is before they can have any
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:97904:288"/>
               <hi>Government</hi> that can solidly <hi>unite</hi> them, at least before they can have any <hi>Government</hi> that can be <hi>practicable.</hi> The same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which make this <hi>fit</hi> to be agreed on in any <hi>one Society</hi> are <hi>common</hi> to all <hi>Societies</hi> as <hi>Societies,</hi> and therefore must be allowed the same force in those that are <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> as in those that are <hi>Civil,</hi> as they are capable of being administred in <hi>this Life.</hi> And therefore <hi>God</hi> himself cannot be supposed to have made a <hi>Government,</hi> even of his own institution, <hi>practicable,</hi> till he have settled these Rules of administring it. And when they are once settled, however they come to be so, whether by <hi>Gods</hi> own appointment, or by the <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> it will then be very <hi>just,</hi> as well as <hi>fit</hi> to conclude, that what is done on pretence of the <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> out of such an <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> cannot validly confer any <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> because, on the Principles of the agreement on these <hi>Assemblies,</hi> they are not to be reputed as <hi>acts</hi> of the <hi>Society.</hi> And certainly, as nothing, but the <hi>Society</hi> it self, can in <hi>Justice</hi> make a <hi>valid</hi> conveyance of its own <hi>right,</hi> so it is not conceivable how the <hi>Society</hi> it self can do it by any thing but its <hi>own act.</hi> Besides, the very reason of agreeing on these <hi>Assemblies</hi> as the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient means for administring the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> seems to be purposely to preclude all <hi>surreptitious acts</hi> that might be pretended in the name of the <hi>Society,</hi> if designing men might be allowed in their <hi>pretences</hi> concerning what might be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted <hi>privately.</hi> And therefore the main design of settling these <hi>Assemblies,</hi> seems to be for the establishment of this <hi>Negative,</hi> that nothing might be taken for the <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> which is not the <hi>act</hi> of some such <hi>Assembly.</hi> But yet proceeding on the Principles on which I have hitherto proceeded in this whole Discourse, the Argument will have yet more force. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that the whole <hi>right</hi> of these <hi>Assemblies</hi> could not have proceeded from the <hi>bare consent</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> but from the <hi>actual establishment</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; the <hi>Society</hi> it self <hi>then</hi> can have no more <hi>power</hi> in the matter we are speaking of, than what it can derive from the constitution of those <hi>Assemblies,</hi> and therefore whatever were <hi>acted</hi> out of these <hi>Assemblies</hi> can never convey a <hi>right</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> how <hi>validly</hi> soever it have been <hi>acted</hi> as to the real <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>particular Members</hi> pretended for it.</p>

but such as are <hi>lawful</hi> ones according to the constitutions of the <hi>Societies.</hi> This is also agreed on in the <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Societies</hi> of this nature by as unanimous a consent as the former. As <hi>out</hi> of <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> they have no <hi>power</hi> to <hi>act</hi> who might act in them, how <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> soever of the <hi>suffrages,</hi> and how <hi>freely</hi> soever also had been gotten; so all those <hi>Meetings,</hi> how <hi>numerous</hi> soever, for <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> if they be not <hi>Legal,</hi> they add nothing of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>particulars</hi> singly considered. They are not, in the eye of the Law, <hi>Assemblies</hi> but <hi>Routs,</hi> and their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, not <hi>consent</hi> but <hi>confederacy.</hi> And as it were <hi>Rebellion</hi> in particular Persons to attempt any thing of that nature concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Government,</hi> without the consent of their present <hi>establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Governours</hi>; so neither is there any thing in such a <hi>meeting</hi> that can give them any more <hi>power</hi> as <hi>united</hi> than they had as they were <hi>singly</hi> considered, that may excuse them from <hi>Rebellion.</hi> Nay rather, by the Principles of all <hi>Societies,</hi> that which had not been <hi>Rebellion,</hi> if done <hi>singly,</hi> is counted so, if it be done in <hi>unlawful Assemblies.</hi> And sure none can think it reasonable that the <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> should be obliged to <hi>ratifie</hi> the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Rebels.</hi> It is not <hi>fit</hi> that any of its Authority should be given into such hands, much less is it <hi>fit</hi> that being given them by Persons as criminal as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> should encourage the like undutifulness in others by <hi>ratifying</hi> what is done by these.</p>

And if the <hi>Society</hi> be not represented by <hi>unlawful Assemblies,</hi> how can it in <hi>Justice</hi> be <hi>obliged</hi> by them? How can any of its <hi>Legal rights</hi> be disposed of by them who are not its <hi>Legal Representatives?</hi> All <hi>Societies</hi> are sensible of the great danger to the <hi>publick</hi> that may follow from <hi>promiscuous Assemblies</hi>; not only what <hi>corrupt Arts</hi> may be used in them for depraving the senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Persons otherwise of themselves never so justly disposed, but also what <hi>seditious practices</hi> may be fomented and driven on for a forcible execution of such corrupt sentences, and embroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the publick in intestine animosities. And therefore the very design of these Rules seems to be for preventing this corruption
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:97904:289"/>
and disorder. And the most natural way of that is by abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the acts of such Assemblies.

THEREFORE, the <hi>indiction</hi> of the <hi>Assembly</hi> by the <hi>President,</hi> is a <hi>right</hi> consequent to the office of a <hi>President</hi> as a <hi>President,</hi> and a circumstance requisite to make the <hi>Assembly</hi> it self <hi>Lawful.</hi> But especially this, by the Rules of all <hi>Societies,</hi> is understood to be the inseparable <hi>prerogative</hi> of that <hi>Office,</hi> when, by the fundamental constitutions of the <hi>Societies</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, no certain places, nor periods of time are agreed on for the keeping of any. For as the very reason of ascertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rules for making <hi>Assemblies</hi> seems to be purposely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain the Liberty of <hi>particular Members,</hi> to assemble when they please, for the inconveniences now mentioned; so withal there must be some who may have the <hi>power</hi> of assembling them when they judg it convenient for the <hi>publick,</hi> and who may withal be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for competent <hi>Judges</hi> of that convenience. For their having no <hi>certain</hi> time allotted for them plainly implies that they are to be celebrated as <hi>occasion</hi> requires. And when every one is not permitted to judg of the <hi>occasion,</hi> and to meet when he pleases, and yet withal it is impossible they should ever meet, unless some be allowed to judg <hi>when</hi> there is a fit occasion, and to oblige others to be determined by them, it plainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that it must be presumed that the <hi>Society</hi> is not destitute of a <hi>power</hi> which is so absolutely necessary for the <hi>practicable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>Assemblies,</hi> and therefore that this power must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to be in some, though none be expresly mentioned for it. But there is none concerning whom this <hi>power</hi> can be so probably <hi>presumed,</hi> none so likely to have been <hi>mentioned,</hi> if any had been mentioned, none to whom all <hi>undisposed power</hi> does, by the common <hi>Rules</hi> of all <hi>Societies,</hi> so naturally escheat, as the <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Assemblies.</hi> Even in the <hi>Assemblies</hi> a veneration is due to him for his <hi>Office</hi> above all other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but much more so <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>Assemblies,</hi> when none is in a likely way to be able to oppose him, by the Laws of the

               <hi>Societies,</hi> whether singly or conjunctly, which must needs give him the preference above all other <hi>particular Members</hi> where none are <hi>expresly</hi> mentioned.

any duty owing by them to any <hi>particular Church,</hi> even to that <hi>particular one</hi> in which they have received their <hi>Baptism,</hi> even so long as they continue in it; When, (4.) they make the <hi>act</hi> whereby they confer <hi>power</hi> to their <hi>Pastors</hi> not <hi>privative,</hi> but <hi>accumulative,</hi> so that they are still supposed to reserve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the same liberty after they have <hi>empowered</hi> their <hi>Pastors</hi> which they enjoyed before: I say, when we consider them as proceeding on these Principles; it cannot be admired that they destroy all <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> especially in regard of place. For how is it possible that such Persons should think themselves obliged to submit to any <hi>particular Jurisdiction</hi> on account of their living within a particular district of <hi>place</hi>; when they neither think themselves obliged to own any Lord of any <hi>place</hi> antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>compacts</hi> of the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi> nor think themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by any <hi>compacts</hi> of their <hi>Predecessors</hi> of former generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which might have given him the Dominion of the <hi>place,</hi> so far as it was in the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> to give it him?

that <hi>God</hi> must have provided some such <hi>means.</hi> And then considering that this distinction of <hi>Jurisdictions</hi> is such a means for <hi>Subjects</hi> to distinguish to <hi>whose Government</hi> they belong; seeing that this was a means <hi>agreed</hi> on by all, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously in use long before the rise of them who first began to question <hi>Jurisdictions</hi>; it cannot be denied to be very becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the care of <hi>God</hi> that this should be settled by him.

It is therefore certain, 1. That <hi>Schism,</hi> as such, is a <hi>dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> and therefore <hi>Schism</hi> in the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> sence is a <hi>disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which is the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of its <hi>

As therefore the <hi>common interest</hi> of the <hi>several</hi> divided <hi>parties</hi> does, in this <hi>way</hi> of <hi>judging,</hi> no farther <hi>oblige</hi> any <hi>one</hi> to <hi>yield</hi> to the others terms than as it may appear that the <hi>common interest</hi> is more its own <hi>particular interest</hi> than the things to be <hi>yielded</hi> in regard of it; so that even the acknowledgment that any thing is indeed for the <hi>common interest</hi> cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige any to yield it barely, as it is the <hi>common interest,</hi> but as it is his own <hi>private interest,</hi> and more so than the <hi>thing</hi> to be <hi>yielded</hi> for it; so also in this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of correspondence,</hi> which is

very well consistent with an <hi>equality</hi> between the several <hi>parties</hi> who are to maintein this <hi>correspondence,</hi> every one is <hi>sui juris,</hi> and therefore very justly to be determined by his <hi>own judgment</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his <hi>own interest,</hi> and cannot be obliged to <hi>renounce</hi> his <hi>own judgment,</hi> in compliance with <hi>others</hi> concerning his <hi>own matters,</hi> how much soever he may value their <hi>judgment</hi> otherwise above his own. This therefore would be the only Notion of <hi>Schism,</hi> if all the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were <hi>equal,</hi> or if all the difference between them were only such as would make a <hi>reverence</hi> due to some Persons for their eminent <hi>personal</hi> accomplishments, so that still it fell short of a <hi>Subjection</hi> due to them in regard of any <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Authority.</hi> And I have accordingly observed that in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute concerning <hi>Schism,</hi>

THEREFORE, the <hi>power</hi> of these <hi>benefits</hi> of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as it is a <hi>Society,</hi> appears plainly, by the Principles of the precedent discourse to be confined to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>order</hi> of men above others, who must therefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be understood to be invested with the <hi>proper power</hi> of governing all <hi>others</hi> who are, by this contrivance of things, obliged to depend on them. It has appeared that the <hi>benefits</hi> of the <hi>Christian Society,</hi> as a <hi>Society,</hi> are <hi>remission</hi> of <hi>sins</hi> and the <hi>gift</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; that the <hi>ordinary means</hi> of conveying these <hi>benefits</hi> are the <hi>Sacraments</hi>; that the <hi>Sacraments</hi> themselves are of no efficacy unless they be <hi>validly administred</hi>; that they are not <hi>validly administred,</hi> unless the Person who administers them be <hi>lawfully Authorized</hi> to administer them; that none can challenge any <hi>Authority</hi> for this purpose from <hi>God,</hi> but they who have derived it from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> nor any in <hi>these days</hi> from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but they who have derived it from them in a continual <hi>succession</hi>; that none can pretend to this <hi>succession,</hi>

It follows, 1. That all our Brethren who live in <hi>particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesses</hi> are properly <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> of <hi>those Diocesses.</hi> If the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> be their <hi>Governours,</hi> it is unavoidable, by the Rules of <hi>Relation,</hi> but that our Brethren must as properly be the <hi>Subjects</hi> of those <hi>Ordinaries.</hi> And, 2. That our Brethren must therefore owe their <hi>Ordinaries</hi> a <hi>duty</hi> not of <hi>reverence</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but <hi>subjection. Reverence</hi> may be due from those who are not <hi>Subjects.</hi> But <hi>Subjection</hi> is the <hi>duty</hi> which properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards <hi>Subjects</hi> as they are <hi>Subjects,</hi> and is therefore as proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due to their <hi>Governours,</hi> as <hi>Governours,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> himself chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges <hi>honour</hi> as a <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> as a <hi>Master.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. i.6.</note> And it is as impossible to own any <hi>particular Governours</hi> for <hi>Governours</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying <hi>particular subjection</hi> to them as it is impossible to own any <hi>particular Person</hi> for our <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Master</hi> without paying them the <hi>honour</hi> or <hi>fear</hi> which are respectively due to those Relations. And, 3. That this <hi>Subjection,</hi> which is due to them, will require that <hi>they</hi> should rather <hi>yield</hi> to their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> than that they should expect that their <hi>Governours</hi> should yield to <hi>them</hi>; nay, that they are bound in <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>yield</hi> in all things that are <hi>lawful,</hi> especially when, upon a modest proposal of their reasons to the contrary, their <hi>Governours</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves dissatisfied with those reasons, and still require the same things from them as necessary for the <hi>publick.</hi> If the matter of the things required in such a case as this be not <hi>sinful,</hi> the <hi>disobedience</hi> must needs be so, because it is injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the <hi>rights</hi> of <hi>Governours.</hi> And therefore by the Rule of our Brethrens own casuistry, they are to chuse it as the
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:97904:319"/>
               <hi>safest</hi> course, rather to hazard the greatest <hi>inconveniences</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that may follow from the nature of the things required, than to hazard the guilt of this <hi>sin</hi> against <hi>God</hi> by refusing the <hi>duty</hi> which he has imposed on them to their <hi>Superiors.</hi> Though I have withal shewn that it were not every <hi>sin</hi> that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them for the neglect of their <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>Governours</hi> but only such a <hi>sin</hi> as were <hi>greater</hi> or more <hi>evident</hi> than the <hi>sinfulness</hi> of such a <hi>neglect,</hi> and that very <hi>few,</hi> if <hi>any,</hi> sins can be so. However, 4. Even in those cases wherein their <hi>Subjection</hi> does not <hi>oblige</hi> them to <hi>active obedience,</hi> yet it does oblige them at least to <hi>passive.</hi> And it has been shewn that this requires not only that they submit to the <hi>punishments</hi> inflicted on them by their <hi>Superiors,</hi> but also that they do not joyn with any <hi>opposite So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi> And it has appeared from the sequels of these Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> as applied to <hi>particular Jurisdictions,</hi> that all <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties</hi> within the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> must be <hi>opposite</hi> who do not own a <hi>dependence</hi> on the <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Jurisdiction.</hi> From all which put together it must follow that the <hi>separation,</hi> of which our Adversaries are guilty notoriously, is destructive of the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Government</hi> of the respective <hi>Jurisdictions</hi> wherein they live, and consequently <hi>Schismatical</hi> in respect of those <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches,</hi> as <hi>Schism</hi> consists in a violation of the <hi>Churches <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and as the <hi>

of the <hi>safety</hi> of their condition which they are capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, even in the <hi>external Solemnities</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the application of the <hi>external Seals.</hi> These themselves they may receive, if not in the <hi>Church</hi> from whence they are <hi>ejected,</hi> yet in some other where they may be <hi>received</hi> upon their <hi>eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> who may have as just an <hi>Authority</hi> to administer the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> which has <hi>ejected</hi> them, and is no more obliged to stand to the judgment of the <hi>Church</hi> who has <hi>eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> them than she is to stand to hers, but is every way as competent a <hi>Judg</hi> of the qualifications to be required from those who are to be admitted to her <hi>own Communion.</hi> This indeed seems to be the true reason why all the <hi>Discipline</hi> of <hi>particular Churches</hi> has been so insignificant, since the <hi>Catholick</hi> has been divided into so many parties who are ready to receive each others <hi>Excommunicates.</hi> They only can be <hi>terrified</hi> to do their duty who must otherwise be excluded from the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> to which alone the <hi>priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> can be thought confined. But for avoiding this, whatever <hi>censures</hi> they lye under from <hi>particular Churches,</hi> two excuses are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious from our Adversaries Principles. Either they make the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> such as that they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in it who are <hi>excluded</hi> from the <hi>visible Communion</hi> of all particulars; or, if they require <hi>visible Communion</hi> with some <hi>particular Church</hi> to <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Catholick,</hi> yet they have been used to contein, under the name of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> all the several divided <hi>parties,</hi> those which are <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical</hi> and <hi>Schismatical,</hi> as well as the Orthodox. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these terms it is impossible for any <hi>censures</hi> to deprive of the whole <hi>visible Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> As the case stands now, the very case of being excommunicated by <hi>one Church</hi> is a recommendation to <hi>others</hi> to receive them. And if none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would, yet it is but the setting up a <hi>new Communion</hi> of their own, which any <hi>censured Persons</hi> may do with as good <hi>right</hi> as many others have done before them.</p>

no extremity whatsoever can warrant that; that for the same reason they do not abet <hi>others</hi> who are guilty of it; that because the <hi>independency</hi> of <hi>Societies</hi> cannot possibly be understood within a <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> already rightfully possessed, without either <hi>assuming</hi> or <hi>abetting</hi> such an <hi>

I am sure it was not so ordinary either in the <hi>primitive Church,</hi> or in the <hi>Western Churches,</hi> for many Centuries before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> to write so many professed Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns on this Subject of the <hi>Covenants,</hi> or to call the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments seals</hi> in ordinary discourse concerning them, as it is now among the generality of our separating Brethren of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denominations. I think there are very few, if any, among them who are at all for <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but they have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these Notions concerning them. And these are the <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Principles</hi> of the precedent discourse, though I have also provided <hi>less doubtful</hi> Principles for those who might doubt of <hi>them.</hi> What is asserted further is only in <hi>consequence</hi> to these <hi>Principles,</hi> and therefore must be admitted by them who grant the <hi>Principles</hi> from whence these <hi>consequences</hi> are deduced. And yet, even of these <hi>consequences</hi> themselves, some of the <hi>chief</hi> and of <hi>greatest importance</hi> to my design, are also generally gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by those parties whom ignorant Persons have reason to regard as <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>competent guides</hi> in affairs of this nature, that is, by such of them as are not led by professed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> but by sober and prudent considerations of the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of that <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> which themselves find necessary by their own <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> when they come to <hi>practise</hi> it, that is, indeed, when they find themselves obliged, by their own <hi>interests,</hi> to consider it <hi>soberly</hi> and <hi>impartially.</hi> And it is only in such a case as that is that it can be <hi>prudent</hi> for <hi>ignorant Persons</hi> to trust them, when they are considering <hi>positively,</hi> what is <hi>true,</hi> rather than when they are thinking only how they may <hi>avoid</hi> an Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

I infer the necessity of a <hi>lawful Mission</hi> for a <hi>valid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> This is also admitted by the generality of those parties now mentioned. Even they who say that <hi>gifted Brethren</hi> may <hi>preach,</hi> yet do not so ordinarily allow that such Persons may administer the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> till their <hi>gifts</hi> be at least <hi>solemnly approved</hi> by such as have, at least, that <hi>power</hi> of <hi>solemnly approving</hi> them. And they who derive their <hi>Authority</hi> from the <hi>people,</hi> yet either do so upon that general popular mistake, whereby they take the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>preaching</hi> the <hi>word</hi> for more essential to the <hi>Ministry,</hi> and for an <hi>exercise</hi> of the <hi>supreme Authority</hi> wherewith they are invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (which <hi>supreme</hi> act of <hi>Authority</hi> infe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
