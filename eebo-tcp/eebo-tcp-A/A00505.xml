         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

they could: they could neuer heale the wound perfectly. So that

ſea euery where, without any exceſſe heate or cold: and beſide,
another cauſe is, the trading and great dealing that the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
haue with the people of <hi>Aſia,</hi> of <hi>Affrica,</hi> and <hi>Europa,</hi> as
alſo with the Ilanders, or a great part of them with whome
they haunt, and liue. By reaſon whereof, beſides that they are
of themſelues verie wittie &amp; ſubtill headed, all cunning ſlightes,
craftie conueyances, and deceitfull coſinages, are ſo proper and
common to them, whereby they can fetch vnder other people,
and are ſo cunning to finger from them their money, and can
moreouer, ſo cloſely couer their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that of a thouſand hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one could euer come within them to perceiue their iugling.
For as any deceit or coſinage finely handled, is not perceiued
but of thoſe which know it, and looke verie néere vnto it, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
thoſe which haue their eye but on the naturall and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1938:6"/>
ſhew: ſo there are none but thoſe which curiouſly ſéeke out
the beginning, the progreſſe and aduancements of the Romane
and Italian gouernment, and the meanes whereby they haue
drawne money from other nations of the earth, ſince the time
of <hi>Romulus,</hi> to this preſent day, who can finde out their fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and ſhifts, or diſcouer the maſkes wherewith they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed,
to aduance and enrich themſelues by the ouerthrow and
pillage of others. Albeit, it is not inough when we haue gone
ſo farre, if beſides we throw not away the mufflers which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
vs of ſounde and true iudgement in things of this world,
as are cuſtome, hate, loue, obſtinacie, and enuy, which are euen
ſo many plagues &amp; corruptions, ouerthrowing quite the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and cleare vnderſtanding of man in all things: for if cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
carry vs away, the Italian may preuaile, not only of
an hundred, but of more then a thouſand &amp; fiue hundred yéeres,
which was the verie time that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> an Italian, pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and ruined, not only <hi>France,</hi> but alſo all other parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
Therefore we ſhould deſerue to be commanded and gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
to the bare bone, for euer hereafter, as wel as in time paſt,
that could looke to theſe matters no ſooner. The cauſe of all,
haue béen but our blinde affections which peruert vs in true
iudgement, the which now we muſt néedes cut off, to haue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reaſon for our guide, which is the true &amp; eſſentiall difference,
that ſeparateth man from other Animals, &amp; maketh him iudge
truly of all things: otherwiſe wee robbe our ſelues of the moſt
excellent and precious iewell we haue, to become as beſtiall as
the bruit beaſtes. From hence ſpringeth then alſo the cauſe of
ſo great diuerſitie of opinions in our Continent, the principall
and chiefeſt part of the world, for that ſome ſuffer themſelues to
be gouerned by the cléere light of reaſon &amp; vnderſtanding, and
other ſome let themſelues be caried away headlong with their
owne affections and cuſtomes, and this is the cauſe why the
inhabitants of the Orientall. <hi>Aſia</hi> vnder the dominion of the
great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartarie,</hi> whoſe Empire is two thouſande
leagues in longitude, do hold him for the ſonne of God in earth,
and why? thoſe which liue vnder the great Turke belieue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet
to be a greater prophet then Ieſus Chriſt: and why? the
Iewes ſcattered in great multitudes follow the cuſtomes of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1938:6"/>
their fathers, reiecting the true Meſſias, to looke for another:
and why? Chriſtendome is ſo troubled by reaſon of the Romiſh
conſtitutions, which ſome beléeue to be holie and neceſſarie to
ſaluation, and others altogither contemne: being none other
meane of reconciliation amongſt vs, but to caſt away theſe
blinde mufflers of cuſtomes, hatred, and conſideration of loſſe
or gaine, &amp; to ſuffer our ſelues to be directed by the cleare light
of the heauenly word, by the vnſearchable workes of God, and
by liuely reaſon clarified with authenticall hiſtories of time.
Putting but this in practiſe once, wee ſhall ſoone diſcouer, and

            <p>NOw I pray thée Reader, be not perſuaded, that I meane
by this diſcourſe contemptuouſly to blame the Popes of
<hi>Rome</hi> in their owne perſons, or any holy conſtitution in the

diſpoſe of Popes, of Kings and Princes of the earth, in ſuch ſort
that they haue got the head and rule ouer them, and fetch round
ſummes of deniers out of their cofers, and from their commons

this, That he commanded indéed all nations, and all the world
trembled at the excellencie of his nature, but yet that his wife
commanded him, and his daughter her mother: giuing thereby
to vnderſtand, that it was they that ruled only, borrowing his
name to authoriſe and eſtabliſh what they liſted. So I ſay, that
whatſoeuer is ratified, publiſhed and receiued vnder the name

the authoritie and ſubtilitie of their Italineſſe, to proſecute the
ruine and vtter ſubuerſion of this eſtate: the which to bring to
a low ebbe: they muſt fill full of ciuill warres, and ſo ouer loade
with ſuch heauie burthens of ſubſidies, taxes, and new rerea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that they poore people remained quite ruined and troden
downe, ſo that it could neuer ſince recouer foote againe: and
the better to feare and torture them thereunto, to locke them
vp in priſons, and there to make them rot miſerably, if they did
not pay their intollerable ranſomes, excéeding in many partes
of <hi>France,</hi> more by the third part then the yéerely reuenue of

            <p>ALthough they haue béen alwaies voyd of all mercie and
compaſſion towardes the poore people, hauing drenched
them drie, and brought them to great miſerie, yet they haue
ſhewed as little fauour as might be to Churchmen, making
them to be gnawen to the bare bone with tenthes, and to be
puld a hole lower by ſale of their goods, maintaining all ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie
amongſt them, making floods of riches to run downe
the héeles of ſome Italianate ſpirits, their coherents, and as for
thoſe who take paines daily in diuine ſeruice, which the French
Romans wil not meddle withal, nor ſo much as with the tip of
their finger to turne ouer one leafe of it, they may haue a ſore
drowth, but the diuell a whit of drinke will they giue them to
coole their thirſt. Their Nobles they were ſaluted ſo often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with ſummonings to aſſemble themſelues, who held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
landes of the Crowne, to bee ſeaſſed for the affaires of the
warres and paiment of ſouldiers, and withall put to ſuch pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and daungers, to ruine one another: with ſuch extreame
coſts and charges raiſed by the vaine enhancings of their gold
chaines of their Order, for all paiments and wages employed
onely for the payes of the Italians, and other ſtrange nations.
As for the Officers, although that their offices were ſold vnto
them in the wane of the Italian power, ten times dearer then
in the raigne of any former Prince or King, they were ſo flée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and pulled away by ſubſtitution of others, that did robbe
them of all the profit and honour that might grow therby, who
in their turne alſo were pilled and brought to nothing, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
the mony that was ſucked from them, that firſt bought
them: ſo that by that time all their landes were counted, there
was nothing to be laughed at on no ſide: but only the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
and their partners, who might wel laugh in their ſléeues,
hauing ſo much the more to drinke, filling their purſes, with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1938:9"/>
the emptyings of others, ſo that by ſuch deuiſes they haue ſo
well ſucked out the ſubſtance of the French, that ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of this Italianeſſe into <hi>France:</hi> they haue picked more
pence out of the coate of this people, then during the raigne of
twelue Kings before. The tokens wherof moſt manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
eſpecially vpon the poore peſants by their nakednes, who
go apparrelled but with old linnen cloth in the greateſt coldes,
and are beſides conſtrained to humble themſelues ſo low, as to
liue vpon Oates and Peaſe like bruit beaſts. The cauſe and
originall of all theſe miſeries procéeding of the marriage of one
Italineſſe in <hi>France,</hi> aſpiring to make way for her adherents,
and to get the Crown into her own hands, making our kings
odious to the whole world: and this ſheweth well, that they
are ſo ingenious, that of the leaſt occaſion that may ſerue to
fauour them: they know how to finde and fetch out greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages,
farre beyond the reach of any nation in the world
beſide. This thou ſhalt eaſily perceiue, if with the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that which goeth before, thou caſt but thine eye of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
vpon the French, to ſée how great a number of the
Kings daughters haue béen married into <hi>Italy,</hi> as Madame
<hi>Renee</hi> daughter of King <hi>Lewes</hi> the twelfth, to the Duke of
<hi>Ferrara:</hi> others to the King of England, &amp; into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to the
Dukes of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> and of <hi>Lorraine.</hi> By meanes of whom, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they were all deſcended of farre more noble houſes then
her, yet the French could neuer by any ſuch occaſion tyranniſe
and impoueriſh theſe people, neuer making the leaſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
thereby, or get any other preferment: but to the contrarie,
they ſtill left behinde them verie much of their owne, as in the
marriages of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and of the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi>
where they got to their ſhares the faireſt fléeces and conqueſts
of <hi>France.</hi> And this may verie well ſhew how groſſe witted
we are in <hi>France,</hi> and how ingenious and ſubtill the Italian is
at euerie opportunitie that may happen. Sée wherfore I wold
faine be able to perſwade the Popes, quite to forſake this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to come into Swicerland, and into <hi>France,</hi> verie curteous
and good people: to deliuer themſelues from the yoake of that
nation which is the moſt corrupt in the whole world: for if one
onely Italineſſe were able to chaine our Kings at <hi>Paris,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1938:10"/>
within a litle therabouts, and with one winke of her eye make
tremble Conſtables, Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> gouernours of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,
and by the leaſt word or letter alter the Parlaments of
<hi>France,</hi> what may ten 1000. Italians do, enuironing a Pope?
It is certaine, they may force his will by violence, depriuing
him of his libertie in his gouernment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church. Or if he bow
not that way which they wold haue him, they wil not ſticke to
giue his holines ſome dramme of ſuch perfume, as they did to

we ſée foure or fiue Popes to die, during the raigne of

whether by degrées it hath eleuated it ſelfe in perceiuing

the rauiſhment of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> perpetrated by <hi>Tarquinius</hi> their

(although it be abſolutely the beſt, when kings rule
as they ſhould do, and behaue themſelues well) and to inſtitute
another, which ſhould exalt them (as they thought moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
aboue all other peoples, and make them all tributarie to
them. Now this was their order, to haue a Senate wherein
men of the greateſt ſpirites, verie well learned and experienced
were only admitted, by whom euery yéere ſhould two Conſuls
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1938:10"/>
be choſen, who ſhould alwaies haue the conduct of warres: and

that wherein they haue béene brought vp, without making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

he will frame himſelfe to the forme of diuine ſeruice
that is there eſtabliſhed: in like manner will hée doe that is
borne among Turks &amp; Iewes, Lutherians, and Catholiks:
the worſt is when he is grounded in one, he wil take no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

nor make none examination of anie other, but will haue

if he had found ſome pretious treaſure of ineſtimable valour,

and humaine religion.</p>
            <p>The Italian is not here to ſéeke how to deale with him,
he can handle the matter ſo well, that he will fetch ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance
from him, without any warre or violence, and at his
owne pleaſure: and to effect the ſame, he hath no more to doe,
but to winne to his ſide the Doctours and Prieſtes, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the people, who may teach them a religion which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
agréeable to their owne nature. But here is the
point of controuerſie, which hath and ſhall be euer betwoone
God and men: that God wil be honoured with a ſeruice agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to him ſelfe, and of the qualitie of his owne nature, to wit,
ſpirituall, diuine, and heauenly: and wee humaine creatures,
cleane contrarie will ſerue him with a ſeruice that is neareſt
and beſt agréeing to our owne nature: for it is his will, that
when we adore and inuocate his holy name, we ſhould lift vp
our ſpirits aboue the heauens: and we deſire to finde him here
below on earth, in our Temples, vnder ſome viſible forme,
which we may ſée and touch, becauſe that our earthly nature
taketh farre greater delight, in that which it ſéeth with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
eyes, then to tranſport it ſelfe in ſpirit aboue the azured
heauens, ſo farre diſtant from vs. In like manner thoſe which
will make their prayers to the ſaintes of Paradice, take great
pleaſure to haue their images here below on earth, ſauing a
long iourney to goe into the kingdom of heauen to ſéeke them.
God will haue his diuine ſeruice procéeding from his diuinitie,
and ſuch a one whereof he himſelfe is the authour: and we take
more delight in that which is humaine, and procéedeth from
our owne braine, becauſe it moſt conſiſteth in viſible things,
to be beholded with theſe our bodily eyes: as are ſumptuous
and goodly Temples, gliſtering with coſtly glaſſe windowes,
triumphantinges, liuely pictures, images exquiſitely carued
forth, moſt precious clothes, of Arras, Chalices, Croſſes of
the fineſt Ducket gold, height of Piramides, Copes of crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin
veluet, others of cloth of gold and ſiluer, which are thinges
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1938:13"/>
moſt pleaſant to the eies to behold. And to delight the hearing
with ſongs of Mnſicke, noyſe of Organs, and ſound of Belles:
al theſe things are delectable in déed, and haue ſome ſhew of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
wiſdom, for all that haue they not God for any Authour:
neither did Ieſus Chriſt nor his Apoſtles euer inſtitute or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie
the like: rather they taught vs to deſpiſe the world, and
all that is therein, to aſpire vp to heauen, inſtructing vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
our ſelues and all the luſtes of the fleſh, to do the holie

            </argument>
            <p>ALthough the Italians hauing aduanced their capitall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and high Prieſtes to ſo high dignitie and ſoueraigntie,
ought to haue reſted content without encroching any further:
yet ſuch is the naturall inclination of this nation, that hauing
an inch granted them, they will take an ell: they begin now to
caſt about and deuiſe ſome meanes to winde vnder their armes
the neckes of Chriſtian Kings and Princes, to bring them to
be their tributarie vaſſals. To make way to this, conſidering
that from the beginning the Popes were not admitted in the
election of Emperors or the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they could not ſo well maſter them, nor turne and winde
them at their pleaſure, becauſe they durſt not enterpriſe againſt
them ſo fréely: the Councell of <hi>Rome</hi> taketh away this obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and worketh ſo wel in the matter, that the election is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to the Prieſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> who are my Lordes, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.
That once diſpatched, ſéeing themſelues greatly aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
thereby, they contriue other meanes which they ſée more
fit to effect their purpoſes, whereof one is to ſtirre vp warres
and debates betwéene Chriſtian Kings &amp; Potentates, wherby
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1938:16"/>
they may deſtroy and weaken them ſelues, by their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
armes, and bow more at eaſe their neckes vnder the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Domination. The other is by the Popes cenſures to ſet
them together by the eares with domeſticall and ciuill quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
and in the meane time while they iarre, to get ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
or kingdom from them into their owne handes: it is
long ſince the Romanes vnderſtood this practiſe: yea a good
while before the domination of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> For deſiring to bring
<hi>Greece</hi> in ſubiection, wherein there were two inuincible
leagues, to wit: of the <hi>Achayans</hi> and <hi>Ethobians,</hi> who held
ſo faſt together, that it was impoſſible to vanquiſh them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
way by armes: they found out this hole to enter in, to make
them fall to warres and diuiſions among them ſelues, ſo to rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
their owne countrie, that they might more eaſily ſet foote
into their prouinces. And if we looke well vnto the violeries
that <hi>Caeſar</hi> won on this ſide the mountaines, the Italians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting
the Switzers, more then any nation in the world,
as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Philippickes,</hi> we ſhall ſée that <hi>Caeſar</hi>
charged them by ſurpriſe, at great diſaduantage, and againſt
the law of armes: they hauing paſſed the one halfe of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
ouer the riuer <hi>Soane,</hi> and the other remaining on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of the riuer, could not come to fight: being as yet then
no declaration made of open warre, betwéene the Switzers
and him. Beſides he tooke <hi>Ariomiſtius</hi> chiefe Captaine of
the Almanes, and all his troupes at vnawares, and aſſailed
them in time of truce: after to couer his ſport, and to make
the matter good, he ſaide that he had diſcouered, how they went
about to ſurpriſe him. By meanes whereof hauing furniſhed
his armie with two ſtrong and warlike peoples, and hauing
by diuiſions that he ſowed euerie where, got moſt of the
Gawles on his ſide: being beſide verie ſkilfull to kéepe good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of militarie diſcipline: it was an eaſiie matter for him to
ouerthrow all other peoples. Amongſt the reſt the Engliſh
withſtood him moſt couragiouſly at the firſt, and gaue him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
but he went another way about with them, for before he
departed, he kindled ſuch quarrels and diuiſions among them,
in the which they were verie hote one againſt another before

            <p>THe Romane Councell hath got ſome more aduantage by
this their pollicie and deuice, ſince the creation of their
Pope: for pretending to bring all kinges, peoples and princes
of chriſtianitie, Catholikes, as well ſpirituall as temporall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

ſpunne the thred of all the warres which haue béene betwéene

            </argument>
            <p>NOw I come to another deuice of theires, by the which
they haue ſo cunningly triumphed ouer the kinges of the
earth, neuer ſtriking ſtroke for the matter, and without any
daunger at al, and yet they haue brought them vnder as much
or more then euer the auncient Romanes did by their Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phées
and great victories, to wit: by excommunication, with
the which they ſo frighted them, that if they had neuer ſo little
diſpleaſed them: by and by they were threatned with rebellion
of their ſubiectes, to haue their ſcepters taken from them, and
others to be inueſted therewith incontinent, hauing no way
in the world to reſiſt or ſaue them ſelues, but in humbling them
ſelues vnder the greatneſſe of their Biſhops, yéelding them
ſelues to be the Popes vaſſals, or in paying them otherwiſe
ſome great and intollerable tributes. By this meanes they
exacted from <hi>Iohn</hi> king of <hi>England,</hi> that all his ſubiectes
ſhould pay him a penny ſterling for fire, for the murther by
him committed on the perſon of <hi>Arthure</hi> Duke of <hi>Britanie,</hi>
his owne Nephew and heire, which tribute the Italians mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from them, more then the terme of trhée hundred yeares,
albeit the fault of this murther was not in the people, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they payed this tribute verie vniuſtly, and againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Yet they found meanes to augment this tribute verie
much, by the death of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cauterburie,</hi> who
was executed by command of the king. Yet had the Italians
nothing to doe in the matter, hauing no intereſt at all therein,
being neither his heires nor children. Another tribute was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1938:17"/>
exacted of the Polonians, for the murther committed on the
perſon of <hi>Stauiſlaus</hi> their Arch-biſhop, to, which is paide for
<hi>S. Peters</hi> tongue. The Pope hauing thundered by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
againſt the duke of <hi>Venis,</hi> he was faine to make
him quiet, to créepe on all foure like a Dog, hauing a rope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

<hi>Granade</hi> for diſobeying him, were diſpoſſeſſed of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
which were beſtowed on <hi>Ferdinand</hi> king of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
yet the Italians did not forget themſelues in this match, as
in déed they muſt nener: for it was vpon this condition, that
they ſhould afterwarde be held of their Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> Pope
<hi>Nicholas</hi> excommunicated the kinges of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicilie:</hi>
and making them turne ouer a new leafe, inueſted the Duke
of <hi>Aniow</hi> brother to <hi>Lewes</hi> the ninth, yet not forgetting him
ſelfe, as we ſaide before: vpon condition to pay him eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ounces of gold yearely reuenue. He excommunicated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<hi>Philippes le Bel</hi> king of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe hee would not
hold his kingdom of him, as his vaſſall: but he being diſcended
of the race of <hi>Hue le grand</hi> Countie of <hi>Paris,</hi> quaked not a
whit at the matter, but with a magnanimious courage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to the kinges of this race, conſtantly reſiſted, and neuer
trembled at the hearing thereof, as other chriſtian kinges did,
whoſe great magnanimitie hath béene continued by his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours.
This was the cauſe that the Italian Councell laide
their heades together to doe their vttermoſt to ruine this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
by forraine forces, making it to bee aſſailed on euerie
ſide, and hauing ſet the Armies of the Empire of <hi>Spaine</hi> and

               <p>That it is a verie falſe pretext that they take, to refuſe
the King for his religion ſake, ſeeing they haue a ſpite
at all his race, and wiſh them no more well, although
they were neuer ſo great catholikes.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THat this hath béene the drift of the Italians, the proofe is
moſt manifeſt in this, that although <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth,
and <hi>Henrie</hi> the third of this name his brother, were the moſt
religious obſeruers of the ceremonies of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and more preciſe then any kinges that had béene before them,
ſparing nothing to ruine and rout out the religion of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> not ſo much as their owne perſons, life,
treaſure, nor liuings, nor their faith and honour beſide, which
is more. Yet for all that, could they neuer winne the fauour
and good will of the Italians, nothing neare other princes,
who had wrought little in compariſon of them. And what
was the cauſe hereof but that the Italians foreſaw that a
race of auncient, and ſo long time inueſted with the Crowne
of <hi>France:</hi> would neuer abide that they ſhould haue anie rule
or prerogatiue ouer them nor in no waies permit that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and couenants made betwéee their predeceſſors, the
kinges, and the Popes for the benefit of their kingdome ſhould
be infringed. This is the reaſon why the Councell of <hi>Rome</hi>
hath ſought all meanes poſſible to enſtall other princes in their
roome, and to bring it to paſſe: haue emploied all their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
begging Friers, and other Eccleſiaſtikes, to vomit out
all kinde of blame and ſhame moſt opprobriouſly againſt the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1938:18"/>
ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> the third deceaſſed, placing him in the rancke
of the moſt abhominable tyrants, &amp; murtherers of the world,
whome by their count, hee ſhould ſurpaſſe in the periode of all
miſchiefe: extolling aboue the heauens with the higheſt titles
of praiſe which they could deuiſe, ſome other Princes, thereby
to adiure them, and make euerie one honour them, loue them,
and make much of them. But to ſhew that the Italians and
their partners meant no good, not onely to the deceaſed Kings
perſon, but alſo to all his race in generall, ſée wée not plainly
that when they had by treaſon cauſed him to bée murthered,
they continue their ſelfeſame practiſes towardes thoſe of the
houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> iſſued of the laſt ſonne of S. <hi>Lewes,</hi> called
<hi>Robert</hi> Countie of <hi>Clermont?</hi> vpon whom, ſeeing they can
laie no blame, for that they are the true and lawfull heires of
this Crowne, they thinke to diſherite him who is the eldeſt ſon
and heire, whoſe place he holdeth and repreſenteth: vpon a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
onely that he beléeueth not as much or more in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as in the word of God, and
by this text, they win the good will of the people, and of other
ignorant people. But when they contemne thoſe of this houſe,
making warre againſt them, who haue béen moſt zealous and
affectionate to their Conſtitutions, who haue alſo for defence
thereof, expoſed their liues and goods to all daungers, as haue
done the Dukes of <hi>Mont Penſier,</hi> both father &amp; ſonne: do they
not ſhew, that they are thorowly reſolued to deſtroy this race,
and to tranſlate this Crowne vnto ſome other progeny? Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Kinge, who is at this preſent: they ſhould neuer
be able to attaint or ſtaine him with note of any crueltie, tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
nor any other inſufficiencie to rule, for to blame him for
ſticking to that religion wherein he hath béen brought vp, it is
not likely they will, for the ſame reproch would fall vpon their
pates, if they ſhould not perſeuere in theſe. But he offreth them
faire, and more then they will accord to, that is to be heard in

&amp; to ſtand to that which ſhalbe awarded for both ſides. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

Yet ſée, this parte was handled with ſuch cuning and craft,
that the Italian became therby Souerayne Lord of twiſe ſo

            <p>TO ſhewe this by a familiar example, regarde but a man
that is of baſe condition, who hath onely but fiftie or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
crownes of yéerly rent for a péece of land that he holdeth by

he will make more account of that péece, then of thrée or
foure times ſo much lying among Peſants, or that he gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
among country Farmers, bragging of it euerie where.
Now ſée we ſome Biſhop, or poore Monke comming to bée
Pope, to haue rentes and tributes out of the kingdomes of
<hi>Spaine, Portugall, Naples, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Polonia,</hi> and as hée
was woont alſo out of the kingdome of England, where as all
Chriſtian Kings and Princes take no tribute: but for the moſt

take then to giue, and this muſt they do by Taxes, Subſidies,
Fiftéenes, and ſuch like paiments. Herein we may ſée the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous

attributed to the gold that they ſhare from other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

the ſubſtance of <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> is of ſo celeſtiall a nature, that
if it be not verie cloſely kept, and encloſed within ſome veſſell
for that purpoſe, it léeſeth ſtraight the vertue, and flieth away
by vapours into the ayre: ſo this gold which they fetch ſo farre

hath, and hath both value &amp; vertue, none like it, that we haue:
not onely for that it is leuied with ſuch wonderfull celeritie,
and vnuſuall ſpéed. (For when they purchaſe any collection of
mony, or any other Bull of an Abby or a Biſhoppricke, they
ſpare no Horſe fleſh to gather vp the ſummes taxed, &amp; hauing
gotten them vp once, they muſt go in poſt, and chaunge Horſe
ſo often, that it ſéemeth the Flie with a Swallowes wings: no

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Thinke I haue ſaid inough of the Domination and filching

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelus in their eſtate, &amp; to make it good againſt al other.
And albeit, in inuention and deuiſing, the yare ſo cunning, and
can paſſe and make ſéeme good to euerie one, that which they
haue inuented and deuiſed: yet are they farre more expert in
kéeping their eſtate, and can remoue and preuent all lets that

of Gods workes, to the ſtudie of Philoſophie, and
to the reading and peruſing of the holie ſcriptures in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
wherein they were written, might view all the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are vſed vnder the ſcope of the heauens, and ſéeke out
the firſt cauſes, principles, and inuentors thereof, and hauing
curiouſly examined all, might make theſe concluſions: <hi>viz.</hi>
that all religion is either diuine or humane: that the diuine is
procéeded from God, the other from men: that by the diuine,
there is nothing required at our hands but to offer our ſelues,
ſoules, and bodies to God, to do that which is his will, which
is to follow vertue, and to flie vice, to call vpon him and adore
his holie name, and for our ſinnes, I haue recourſe vnto the
mercie that he offereth vs in Ieſus Chriſt, the which he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vs fréely without our mony or riches, onely enioyning vs
charitably to helpe and loue one another. On the other ſide, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
their eyes vpon humane religion, they ſhall ſée that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
that men haue, whether they be Paſtors of the church,
or who ſoeuer they be: for their authours, tend onely but to get
rule, &amp; to draw away the ſubſtance of thoſe that embrace them,
and are fitter to tye men by the féete to this earth, then to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
them vp to heauen, where the ſeate of God is. Concluding
likewiſe this: that, that religion is beſt, by the which God is
beſt ſerued: then it muſt néedes follow, that following his will
declared by his word, he is better ſerued, then by the traditions
of men: wherefore we muſt not go beyond that, as being the
onely obiect of faith, and as being the onely thing which agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with his Doctours and Preachers in all the partes of the
world, to wit, the Firmament, with his admirable greatnes
and beautie almoſt incomprehenſible: the Planets placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
it and vs: the ayre, and that which is engendred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
the earth, the water, and the creatures which liue and moue
in the ſame, altogither ſetting forth from the one ende of the
world to the other, the greatnes, maieſtie, wiſdom, prouidence,
power, and bountie of God the Creator and preſeruer of the
ſame. On the other ſide, ſeruing to conuince vs of weakenes of
ſpirit, of ignorance, of blindnes, and vncapablenes to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
his eſſence, his profound wiſedome, and the meane wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he hath created all theſe things, how he conſerueth them in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1938:23"/>
their being, and how he worketh euery daye in the diuerſitie
of ſo many things which we ſée before our eyes, to learue vs
thereby, that it is an intollerable auragancie, and preſumption
in men to thinke to be his councellers, to make lawes, like
lictle Kings, in his Church, which he calleth the Kingdome of
heanen, and his Spowſe: to there great ſhame which name
themſelues ſeruants in the ſame, by whome agreat ouerſight
and raſhnes (not to be borne with all,) goe about to eſtabliſh in
it certaine humaine Conſtitutons, as though they weere to
comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and not to obay. For ſéeing that it is his Spowſe: ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes
muſt not be ſo ſaucie as to make Lawes for her to bee
at their checke. Séeing then that hée is the ſoueraigne King,
and him before whome all things are preſent, no man may
enterpriſe ſuch things without encroching vpon his kingdom,
reputing himſelfe of greater wiſedome then hee, who is his
creatour, which are greuous offences deſeruing very great
puniſhments, and cleane contrary to our dutie towards God,
which is to ſhew our ſelues, humble, lowly and glad to bee
taught by him, and to tremble at his words, as this Dampiſh
earth an inſenſible and deafe creature taught vs, at the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the law, when it reeled, trembled and was readie to
ſhake in ſunder at the voyce of God. Moreouer what fayre
ſhew ſoeuer they can ſet on the Conſtitutions of Paſtors, the
ſhall alwayes be humaine, and whoſoeuer obayeth them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayeth
but men and there inuentions. But he that woulde
looke with a vigilant eye to the neere examination and déepe
ſownding therof: ſhal eaſily diſcouer, that their only purpoſe is
to amplifie there authoritie more and more ſtill, and to drawe
coyne from people ſecretly, ſelling that at an hard and deare
rate which God geueth vs fréely, and offereth vs moſt gratis.
And this is the reaſon why the Italyans fearing leſt the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of ſuch doctrine altogether heauenly and diuine, would
make there Domination ſhake from the top, quickly turne it

word (<hi>Catholike</hi>) which he might haue taken himſelfe if hée
would haue challenged it, no man to ſay nay. Theſe names
haue continued from father to ſonne, as if they came by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
by which the Italians haue plaied and wrought vpon,
as well the one as the other, as though the bare names had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vertue or operation in them, to tranſforme the perſons, and
to make them any other then they were, which ſhould bee a
moſt manifeſt abuſe. But when that a man hath any qualitie
of great vertue or vice, he may verie fitly haue ſome name of
honour or diſhonour attributed vnto him. As S. <hi>Lewes</hi> was
ſo called for his holines of life. <hi>Philip le Bel,</hi> for his excéeding
beautie: and <hi>Philip le Hardi,</hi> for his hardines &amp; valour. But
all this cannot be tranſlated to their heires and ſucceſſors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are but qualities of ſpeciall perſons, and are proper
to them onely, from whom they cannot paſſe. For as it had bin
a moſt abſurd thing to haue termed <hi>Commodus</hi> an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a moſt cruell tyrant, a Saint and a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
becauſe <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> his father, for his rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1938:25"/>
ſageſſe and eloquence was ſo named: ſo alſo is there none
apparent reaſon why the Councell of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
for flatterie, indifferently all the ſucceſſors of this crowne,
Kinges moſt Chriſtian. No more then with the <hi>Epitheton</hi>
that was giuen to <hi>Charles le grand,</hi> (1. the great.) And as for
the title of Catholike, it was falſly attributed to the King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> becauſe it ſignifieth as much as vninerſall King: that
is, King euer all. Whereas at that time he was King only but
of the Spaines; for as yet then raigned the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall:</hi>
and beſide he is not ſo much yet neither as King ouer all
Chriſtendome. Although that ſuch Epithets haue béene verie
vnfit, &amp; falfly attributed indifferently to all: yet we ſée by ſuch
toyes and deuiſes, they haue with a wet finger drawen more
Forces to their ſuccour out of theſe kingdomes, then at this
preſent twentie millions out of any other Princes purſe, would
do out of all <hi>Germany.</hi> By giuing them only theſe names and
titles, they make them march when they liſt, vſing them like
the great <hi>Canary</hi> Dogs, which are tied faſt with a long chaine
and a coller. As for the Emperour to kéep him vnder, they haue
beſtowed on him ſome kingdome or Princedome, to make him
their owne creature and vaſſall, yet vnder the name of their
Pope, to ſet him forward, or pull him backe as they liſt, and at
their deuotion. And all this to the end, that if any went about
to ſhake or endomage their Domination at the head, hée
ſhould ſtraight aſſaile and bee ſhaken off by the Catholicke
King, if he came againſt the breaſt, the moſt Chriſtian King
ſhould trownce him, if he made at the bellie, the Emperour
ſhould teare him: ſo that he ſhould be met withall what way
ſo euer he came. Turne ouer &amp; read the Hiſtories of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
actes and déeds of all nations in the world, and finde none
that euer hath ſo iuſteled Kings and Emperours by a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Domination, to make them march, without any pay at all,
as hath done the Councell of <hi>Rome.</hi> I ſpeake not only by theſe
but by an infinit number of others, ſo he haue bin glad to obey

their voluntarie ſlaues.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BVt the ſublimation of the Italian ſpirit is remarked to flie
farre aboue all other nations of the world, herein eſpecially,
that perceiuing a few yéeres ſince, there were found many men
of great ſpirit in the Councelles of theſe Monarkes, who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
their drifts, began to counterchecke them a litle, not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a whit at the firſt ſound of the Trumpet, comming from
<hi>Italy,</hi> as they were wont to do in times paſt, they haue made
a cunning <hi>prouiſo</hi> for this matter, drawing into their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie
and league, certaine younger brethren of the beſt houſes
of the Princes in Chriſtendome, who being not ſurcharged
with too much reuenues, nor too great gouernments, to imploy
themſelues, runne like ſwift footed Greyhounds at the firſt call,
that is made for them. To make them march with more then
humane expedition, they muſt be charmed with praiſes up to
the heauens, far higher then the praiſes of many of thoſe which
the Paynims held for Gods in this world. Comparing them
with the moſt worthy and valiant warriours which euer haue
béen, terming them the verie portraitures of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in
diligence and hautineſſe of courage: verie Images of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus
Caeſar,</hi> in ſubtilitie and wiſedome, and in zeale for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
and glorie of the Romane Church: true imitators of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, reſemblers of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> and as
great warriours as euer was the Romane <hi>Fertorius,</hi> to reſiſt
and ſtand out boldly againſt all humane powers. And to ſet a
better hue on theſe ſo high commendations, if there be to be
found any externall beautie or corporall force in theſe Princes,
that muſt not be forgotten in no wiſe, but extolled to the ninth
degrée: likewiſe, for the antiquitie of their houſes, the great
Alliances with other Princes, the noble and famous acts of all
their predeceſſours, all this muſt be curiouſly dilated, not one
little forgotten. And beſides, to paſſe them vp with the winde
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1938:26"/>
of ſuch vaine praiſes, and to eleuate their courage aboue al that
is vnder <hi>Luna,</hi> they forget not to abaſe and diſgrace as much
as they can, the ſpirit, courage, and valour of theſe thrée great
ones, of whome I ſpake but now, as though they had not the
wit to enterpriſe any great exploites of armes: as though they
had no magnanimitie, diligence, force nor wiſedome at all, to
execute ſuch matters: notwithſtanding the place and dignitie
they kéepe, and the great meanes they haue in their power: but
they if they had their roome, it were inough to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Monarkes of the whole world. The verie breath of theſe
ſo high commendations, doth ſo ſet on fire all the parts of their
ſoule and bodie, that it ſerueth them for winges to flie when
they go about any affaires for the Councell of <hi>Rome;</hi> who for
their part, to the ende to giue them féete to ſtaie and ſtand ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon, muſt not forget to aduertiſe them, that if they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
brethren or children, they may promote them to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Cardinals, ſo that they ſhalbe ſure to haue as much Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
reuenue as their backe will beare, ſo they may fill
their houſes full of coine, which had but in meane quantitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Now euerie one may thinke, that whileſt they go about
theſe things, Courſers of <hi>Naples, Damaſco</hi> ſwordes, plumes
of feathers, and precious ſtones, the rareſt and deareſt are alſo
preſented them, as thoſe only who are worthie to poſſeſſe them.
But aboue all, when they vnderſtand that all that ſhalbe their
owne that they can conqueſt, which is temporall, and that the
Italians paſſe not but for the ſpirituall, then they are ſet on fire
with an inextinguible zeale. Then appeares there ſuch a ſodein
chaunge, and ſtraunge metamorphoſis in theſe Princes, that a
man would thinke that ſome new ſoule had entered into their
bodie, and diſpoſſeſſed and chaſed out that which ruled there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
for then treading vnder foote the naturall affection, that
they bore to their countrie, their ſwéete mother, who hath
brought them vp tenderly, and nouriſhed them more delitiouſly
then all others: then farewell the homage and loyaltie belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to thoſe whom God hath ſet in place for their ſuperiours,
and the ſtraight bond of amitie towards all their kindreds and
auncient friends, without any regard of thoſe, who haue béen
their planke to preferre them to ſo high degrée and ranke of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1938:27"/>
which they poſſeſſe, ſuch younger brethren, neglecting the
oath giuen to their Prince, tranſported with a moſt vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
heate, and zeale, without all gouernment of reaſon, caſt
themſelues headlong to embraſe the affaires and practiſes of the
Roman Councel, with ſo violent affection, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all their thoughts,
diſcourſes, and imaginations, are occupied in nothing els, but
ſtill how to continue the ſame. So that the feruent zeale to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
the Roman Domination, doth conſume and gnaw them
night and day: falling into ſuch diſquietneſſe for the furthering
therof, that they haue not ſo much as the patience to abide any
good aduertiſements. But like as they were tranſformed into
more naturall Romanes; ſet their wits to deuiſe a thouſande
things for their good and conſeruation: refuſing not to ſuſtaine
all perils and daungers of bodie and goods, all watchings &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
for their ſake. Making no doubt of conſcience to ſet king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and prouinces any waies on fire: either by working
their ruine by their owne armes, or by forraine Forces, or to
do worſe, to ſtirre vp théeues and murtherers, who by treaſon
and at vnawares, do ſhed the blood of thoſe, who kéepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
faſt locked within townes, cauſing all lawes and bonds
(both diuine and humane) of amitie and conſanguinitie to bée
violated, perſuading themſelues that ſuch butchery &amp; murther,
may any way aduance the Italians: or els that ſuch cruelties
ſhould be to them onely ſacrificers of ſwéete ſauour, and ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

theſe fellowes, they will ſpeake their pleaſure, and that which

that their Prebends be taken from them, or that any other fine

            </argument>
            <p>BVt becauſe this great rabble had not taken vpon them the

being emploied, diſcouered many things to the great
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1938:28"/>
diminiſhing of the Romane authoritie, to make vp this breach,
the Italians brought in Ieſuites of farre profounder learning
then the begging Friars, and with the ſame haue peopled the
moſt famous Vniuerſities of Chriſtendome, who being ſo
much followed by ſtudentes, take no hire of them that heare
them, contenting themſelues only with the gaine of their pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners.
They hold opinion, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is aboue
the Conſuls, by this meane altogither ouerthrowing the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
thereof. As for their Diſciples, they tie them ſo faſt by

put them in ſuch feare that they tremble againe, if they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
the leaſt of them neuer ſo litle: and the more eaſily to
ſtrike this feare into their hearts, they robbe the tender youth
of all iudgement and vſe of reaſon. For to iudge truly of anie
queſtion in controuerſie, we muſt diligently heare and weigh
the reaſons on both ſides, all affection laide apart. Theſe on the
contrarie, hauing brought their Diſciples to belieue in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike

that they ſtop their hearing, and giue none eare to any one,

are infected: ſo they before all thinges muſt take héede, not to
heare any, nor receiue any bookes which may go about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
them from their opinion in one iote. Theſe are their
propper foundations and grounds, whereby they do not onely
depriue their Diſciples of all iudgement, but alſo of the vſe of all
their natural ſences, wherwith God hath indued man to make
choice of things, and to know how to put a difference betwéen
good and bad: by this meanes, they make them not onely dull
ſpirited; but altogither as brutiſh beaſts in heauenly and diuine
things, fighting directly againſt the inſtruction of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> who
teacheth vs to proue all things, praiſing in this place of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the diligence of thoſe that did examine the Prophecies, to

yéeld that there cauſe is ſcant good, for the are not ſo groſſe

at the foundation ſtone, vpon the which they haue built, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and eleuated there ſo great and loftie Dominatious,
that it hath no boundes here on the face of the earth, as haue
the kingdomes and empires of Emperours and Kings: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eleuated (if we will belieue them) as high as heauen gates,
ſhutteth &amp; openeth them euen as they do the doores of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie
at <hi>Rome.</hi> In ſome this foundation ſtone is, that Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> had his Apoſtles ſeate at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there was marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
whereof followeth, that the Romane Biſhop is his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour,
and hath vniuerſall charge ouer the whole world. For
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1938:33"/>
the firſt I deny, ſéeing that neither the Acts of the Apoſtles, nor
any other of the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> hath made mention ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
&amp; that he himſelfe witneſſeth that he was the Apoſtle of the
Iewes, called to thoſe that were of the circumciſion. For the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was martired there I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, for that thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi>
and their Emperours, to make a triumph of Ieſus Chriſt,
and of his doctrine, &amp; to quench their inſatiable crueltie againſt
Chriſtians, had cauſed S. <hi>Peter</hi> to be tranſported to <hi>Rome,</hi>
from another place where he was detained firſt priſoner, to put
him to death ignonimiouſly, and make him a publike ſpectacle
to the world. But for hauing by this crueltie and iniuſtice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
the world of ſo famous &amp; excellent ſeruant of God, that
they ſhould be reputed his ſucceſſours, there is no reaſon at all:
nay contrarie, I will ſtand to it, they ought therfore altogither
to be diſinherited: for was there euer any man ſo impudent,
that for hauing murthered another, would dare to challendge
his ſucceſſion? And if he had béen borne at <hi>Rome,</hi> and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Apoſtle to the ſame place, which he was not, neither they
haue made themſelues vnworthie of all ſucceſſorie, right and
title. For this were a prettie matter, that for vſing all crueltie,
and committing bloodie murthers againſt the ſeruants of God,
men ſhould get domination and principalitie, as well in earth
as in heauen, it were farre wide to ſay ſo, and the greateſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie
in the world, that men might imagine. Nay contrarie,
Chriſt menaceth great puniſhment for the like matter, when
he cried out, <hi>Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, thou which killeſt the
Prophets,</hi> thereby denouncing her ruine and ouerthrow by
the fire of Gods vengeance, foretelling her deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to come,
and the miſerable eſtate wherein ſhe is at this preſent houre.
If then this were ſufficient to depriue <hi>Rome</hi> of her ſucceſſion,
yet furthermore, were ſhe worthie to be depriued for her rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt the Goſpell, and the doctrine of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> wherein
ſhe hath perſeuered ſince the death &amp; paſſion of Chriſt, hauing
brought foorth the moſt deteſtable monſters for Emperours,
as <hi>Tyberius, Nero, Calligula, Commodus,</hi> and <hi>Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balus,</hi>
which haue euer béen remarked to liue vnder the vaute
of the heauens: who as cruell beaſts eſtranged and degenerat
from all Chriſtian blood, by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enormitie of their liues,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1938:33"/>
could not ſuffer any ſuch cleare light to ſhine there néere them,
being alſo ſet on by their ſacrificing Prieſts, Pagans, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
who only taught publikely at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſoone to extinguiſh
the ſame. But if there were any good Biſhops there, they laie
cloſe, and did not openly diſcouer themſelues, and were no part
of the bodie of this people, being indéed ſent thither, from diuers
other partes: perſonages of great learning and eloquence, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make reſidence there, then in any other part, for that

and Pagan Oratours: againſt whome it had not
béen for Paſtors meanely learned to haue diſputed without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow

that of the holie Kings of the old Teſtament, as doth the light

the Apoſtles and other faithfull Paſtors which went before
thée, it was alwaies diuined, and entermingled with the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

Prince of <hi>Condie</hi> and him, as perſons deſtitute of refuge, to
retire themſelues, with any Forces, but yet the Lord <hi>De la

Noue,</hi> by his great wiſedome and accuſtomed valour, ſtood in
ſome good ſteed here, hauing ſeiſed againe the towne of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
into his handes: they perceiuing the Army of this Prince
raunging almoſt in the hart of <hi>France</hi> againe, ſtraight iudged,
that they had halfe taken them napping alreadie by this hooke,
and that they might hereafter verie well ouertake them. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
caſt this hooke to them the ſecond time, they ſurpriſe them
once more: and ſo diſpoſſeſſe them quite by this bait of a ſecond
peace, of all their ſtrong Forts and holdes once againe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
many began greatly to miſtruſt them: but to take away
all ſuſpition, they practiſe quickly a confirmation of their
former peace, by concluſion of a marriage, by this vtterly to
ruine and cut the Admirals throat. He truſting to it, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the net that was laide for him. So that this may well
ſhew, that all our ſubtilitie is but a ſluggiſh ſlight, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the quicke carriage of the Italians, by reaſon that their
clymate is more Meridionall, and the region of <hi>France</hi> more
Septentrionall. True it is, that this great workeman of the
world, hathenriched thoſe that inhabite the more Northren
countries, with many other goodly gifts, as to be more ſtrong,
more faire and luſtie, witnes many great Philoſophers &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men, and this might ſerue vs for inſtruction, that ſéeing we
are endued with more ſtrength, and are the greater number,
we ſhould chace them out of <hi>France,</hi> and not ſuffer them to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe
any Domination ouer vs at all, nor to accompany any of
our Princes or great Lordes, that might trouble or alter our
ſtate. This is a verie good preſeruatiue to ſaue and deliuer our

it is a great ſhame for them who name themſelues Chriſtians,
and haue béen baptized to vſe ſo much treacherie in their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
whereas their aunceſtours who were but Pagans, and

            <argument>
               <p>How the Biſhop of Rome being created vniuerſall, other
nations ſhould not ſuffer the Italians to haue him only
to themſelues.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>LEt vs come now to the point I ſpake of, how that I did
not purpoſe to blame y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes perſons, nor diſpute againſt
their title of vniuerſall Biſhop, referring thoſe that would take
delight in ſuch diſputation to the Treatiſe of the Church, made
by the L. of <hi>Plesſis Mormay.</hi> But this is the pointe that I
proue, that ſéeing the Italians hold him for the vniuerſall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of Chriſtendome, it muſt néedes follow by the nature of
contraries, that he can be no more particularly tied to <hi>Rome,</hi>
but that he is alſo as well Biſhop of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and
<hi>Spaine,</hi> who cannot be conuerſant and particularly reſident
in all theſe places at once. Therefore his Sea ought no more
to be at <hi>Rome,</hi> then in other places; but he ſhould wander ouer
all Chriſtendom, as did the Apoſtles, ſéeing that they hold that
S. <hi>Peter</hi> Apoſtle of the Iewes, came to <hi>Rome,</hi> being ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
leagues diſtant and more, from the place from whence he
came. So that if the Pope be reſident any while in <hi>Italy,</hi> hée
ought to do the like alſo in other prouinces &amp; countries: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
he ſhould depriue them of the right which vnto them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteineth.
Wherefore they ſhould neuer abide that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
onely ſhould kéepe to themſelues the Biſhop common
to all: to preuent them, leaſt by that prerogatiue they ſhould
rule the world at their will, and diſpoſe and alter all things at
their pleaſure. This ſhall verie well ſhew, that whatſoeuer we
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue and perſuade our ſelues of the ſubtilitie and pollicie that
is in vs, they ſhall ſtil for euer farre go beyond vs. Witnes the
compoſitions made betwéene King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, &amp; thoſe
that inhabite but the néereſt borders of <hi>Italy,</hi> who retain ſome
ſparkes and beames of their ſubtilitie hidden in them. As the
Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> to whome this King with the aſſiſtance of
thoſe, whom he déemed the beſt aduiſed and moſt ſage parſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of <hi>France,</hi> yéelded vp a great country which he and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1938:36"/>
had conquered with infinite charges, combats, &amp; victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
And yet without any blow ſtroken by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> agréement of one

themſelues out of their ſo fluggiſh dulneſſe, &amp; not ſuffer
themſelues to be ouercome with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſugered words of this natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
although they be enterlaced with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwéetnes of religion, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

they deale with them in any caſe, for they will be ſure to haue

            </argument>
            <p>WHen we come then to remember, how they make the
people belieue that the Church cannot ſtand without an
vniuerſall Biſhop: who without euer looking to that which
might follow thereupon, allowed verie well of all that: They
incontinent hauing this aduantage, made him proper to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
&amp; by ſuch deuiſe haue vſurped a domination ouer all the

make conſcience to abridge, when they ſmell any profit for
themſelues: how did they practiſe in the great Pardons which
were ſent abroad in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, and <hi>Lewes</hi>

the power of their Biſhop: for being vniuerſal, as they
maintain, ſo alſo is his power extended ouer all, and not reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

for a fine deuiſe, to enrich their Citie, by the concourſe of diuers

            </argument>
            <p>NOw if there had béen in other nations any craft or ſutil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
any thing néere like to that of <hi>Italy,</hi> after they had
perceiued how by this prerogatiue they were brought vnder
the iuriſdiction of the Italians, and dreyned of their money by
this country, if they had ſtraight pretended that the vniuerſall
Biſhop ought as well to viſit, and be reſident among other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and principall parts of Chriſtendome, as at <hi>Rome:</hi> and
in caſe the Italians wold not conſent, to haue told them plaine,
that euerie nation ſhould haue procéeded to the election of an
other, in euerie ſeuerall countrie: as the Frenchmen for their
part, who held that the Goſpell was firſt brought vnto them
by S. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and that therefore he is their Apoſtle, to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
the Sea of their Biſhop at the Temple of S. <hi>Dennis</hi> for
<hi>France:</hi> and for <hi>Spaine</hi> at S. <hi>Iames</hi> Church in <hi>Gallitia:</hi> ſo
in like manner for other nations. And in caſe hereupon, they
ſhould enter into choller and ſtorme at this, they might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that S. <hi>Panl</hi> did admoniſh the Corinthes to follow
him, euen as he imitated Chriſt. And in good faith, it is honour
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1938:37"/>
inough for theſe Romiſh maiſters, in imitating them, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
the like order &amp; gouernment, as they allow beſt of among
themſelues: for truth it is, that the true manner of honouring
and worſhipping of Saintes, conſiſteth in doing our vttermoſt
to imitate and follow their footeſteps. According to this, euen
as they wold neuer conſent to be depriued of their Pope, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whom they cannot beare ſway in the world, and purloyne
money from other nations not ſo quick ſpirited as they: ſo in
like maner, if the French would looke well into their affaires,
it were neceſſarie for them alſo to make a Pope among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
to ſerue their own turne. And by the example of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
they ſhould endeuour their vttermoſt, to raunge vnder
their iuriſdiction, not onely a whole kingdome, but alſo other
nations more Septentrionall, who are leſſe ingenious then
they, and principally this might be effected by the Prouenſals
or Gaſcons, being a people more meridionall then the other
Frenchmen. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Engliſh, although by reaſon of the great
trafficke they haue into all partes by ſea, they are not a people
altogither ſo dull ſpirited and groſſe, yet they confeſſe, that the
French haue ſubtilly recouered that of them, by concluſions of
peace, which they by great victories had conquered from them
before. So that it is verie like by this meane, that if in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Italians, there were a Pope conſtituted but in <hi>France</hi>
onely, yet he ſhould haue vnder his iuriſdiction, <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Ireland, Norway, Friſeland,</hi> and all the <hi>Netherland.</hi>
By this ſhift, they might fetch in coyne from theſe parts, after

ſuch conter-pollicies, whereas the Italians contemne
them at this day, as groſſe and barberous: they would haue
made as much of them, otherwiſe as a nation and people as

is to ſhewe, how farre they excell vs in inuention and ſubtiltie

I agrée well to that, ſo they were the ſtronger: but when
we ſée that many of our Kings haue paſſed cleare through the
countrie of <hi>Italy,</hi> without any contradiction, and gone as farre
as <hi>Naples,</hi> and that thoſe that at any time went about to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them, were by and by ouerthrowne, wee muſt néedes
thinke, that it were great diſaduantage for them to deale that
way, but if on the other ſide, they would go to diſpute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
of wordes, to diſcide whether the ſucceſſion of <hi>S. Peter</hi>
and the lieftenancy of Chriſt be tyed to <hi>Rome,</hi> or no: we ſhall
néede but to ſende them to combat in this diſpute with the
Lutherians, who maintaine according to the ſaying of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
that the propertie and true deſcription of <hi>Rome</hi> is to containe
ſeuen mountaynes, thereby geuing vs to vnderſtand that it is
the Citye remarked in the Apocalips, to be the ſeate of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt:
Now in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne of Saint Dennis in France, there is no
ſuch matter, therefore ſuch qualitie cannot be attributed truely
to the <hi>Pope</hi> as the haue giuen him. But ſome may reply, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the
people would neuer beléeue ſo much in any other <hi>Pope</hi> as in

about to deſcrye his knauery (as ſome did) he might haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
preuailed for that poynt: for there was neuer any <hi>Pope</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who for his owne perſons ſake, nor for his miracles,
that euer was ſo followed with ſo great troupes, as was he of
whome I now ſpeake. But if they went about to terrifie the
French <hi>Pope,</hi> by excommunications and interdictions, ſo that
he would but practize y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like againſt theirs of <hi>Rome;</hi> it is moſt
certayne, that whoſoeuer would but looke on the one and the
other, ſhould ſée the Italians farre more black in the face and
more melancholike, and the French farre more cherefull and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1938:38"/>
Iocande then they. Sée her then in mine aduiſe are medy which
being put in practiſe of vs as it ought, will ruinate the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

without paying them any mony at all, no more then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantes
doe, which will haue nothing at all to doe with them.
And here I will aduertiſe the Readers of a fine deuiſe to feare
the Romans, and to make there <hi>Popes</hi> tryple crowne ſhake
on his head, if they had but the newes carried them, how that
the moſt Reuerend Cardinall of <hi>Vendome</hi> were elected
<hi>Pope</hi> in France: it would make them all quake for feare, and
put them in worſer caſe then if an Army of miniſters ſhould
goe thether to ſet vpon them: But if any Frenchman ſhould,

will neuer be done by meanes of any Paſtors.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ACcording to this, there is no more effectuall remedie to
preuent the Eccleſiaſticke, leaſt he gnaw the reſt of the
people: then to chuſe out in euerie towne ſome learned and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
man, which is not of the ſame qualitie, not too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to ceremonies and ſuperſtitions, who muſt haue an eye
to their counſels, conſtitutions, and preachings, and who muſt
alſo diſcouer their end: to the end they may ſée whether they go
about any thing to the preiudiſe of the Nobles, of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
or of the people: and if they do, to withſtand them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
hauing power and authoritie to aſſemble the people, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe
them by ſpéeches and Orations in their Temples, how
that they go about to deceiue them. If in the time of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
the Great, ſuch Protectors had béen choſen, they would
neuer haue permitted the Eccleſiaſticks vnder ſhadow of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie
and praiers for the dead, to haue depriued the lawfull
heires of ſo many Counties, Lordſhips, Barronies, Féefarms,
and other landes, whereof they haue robbed and ſpoiled them,
nor that the goods of Hoſpitals giuen to the poore, ſhould be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and ſwallowed downe by them: for although that they
would not contradict ſuch doctrine, yet perceiuing that vnder
the colour thereof, they pretended to make trafficke and ſale of
the kingdome of heauen, and to ſell for faire readie mony, life
euerlaſting: they would haue gainſaid them, and reproued ſuch
théeues, who vnder a falſe apparance of bringing men to heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
pretended to picke their purſes, &amp; to make them looſe that which
they had on earth: they wold haue taken order at the leaſt, that
the poore ſhould not die for hunger, languiſhing and crying, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Priors of Hoſpitals to deuour their good, ſinging and
making merry. Sée then this is a good remedie whereby wée
might kéep faſting the Italian and the Eccleſiaſtick, and make
them content themſelues with their owne, and to kéepe within
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1938:40"/>
their owne limits. For to hope that euer they will reforme
themſelues, they neuer did it yet, nor neuer will. For if you
looke ſince the death of <hi>Iouſa</hi> to Ieſus Chriſt, betwéene which
there is more then a thouſand yéeres, you ſhall finde that the
Eccleſiaſticks neuer ceaſed to corrupt the true ſeruice of God.
By reaſon whereof, he gaue them ouer into the hands of their
enemies. And how to reſtabliſh them, he raiſed vp Iudges and
Magiſtrates: how alſo after they had Kings, he inſpired many
to reforme and reduce his true ſeruice, hauing béen abaſtardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by the Miniſters and ordinarie Prieſts of his Church. And
why, I pray you, were Prophets ſent? But to accuſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict
the ordinarie Paſtors of their impietie, rebellion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie.
After the maner of which Prophets, S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi>
termeth them <hi>a generation of vipers:</hi> and Ieſus Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them, théeues and robbers. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his time, cried
out againſt their abuſes. And in the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> they
had diuided Chriſtendom into more then twentie ſeuerall ſects,
all which this holy parſonage cut off in his time, reducing
them all to one vniforme confeſſion at the Nicene Councell.
By whoſe example, Kings and Magiſtrates ought to ſet to
their handes: and out of the miſerable diſſipation wherein we
liue, to reſtabliſh one true way for the ſeruice of God, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
did command them: to wit, that they ſhould meditate in
his law day &amp; night, to kéepe it themſelues, and to cauſe others
to obſerue it alſo. And not to expect till the Paſtors reforme it:
whereof a great number ſéeke but to enrich themſelues, and
to ſway ouer others.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>That it is verie needfull to withſtand the enterpriſes of

protectors for the conſeruation of the people.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ANd to take away the doubt that ſome may propoſe, to
wit, if ſuch Tribunes are neceſſarie among thoſe who
haue caſt off the Popes yoke and haue Miniſters. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that the reaſon is all one: for to be perſuaded, that they are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1938:41"/>
of better borne, and of more gentle nature then the ſacrificing
prieſts, iſſued out of the race of <hi>Abraham,</hi> there is none appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
But to go no further then to the Apoſtles themſelues,
if we looke but to the marke that they leuelled at before the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion
of Ieſus Chriſt, and before he had ſent downe his holie
ſpirit vpon them, we ſhall ſée that they were enflamed with an
ardent deſire to be promoted, to rule &amp; beare ſway. So that, if
once they be tollerated to ſet downe articles &amp; conſtitutions in
the Chnrch, euery one thinking himſelfe wiſeſt of all, and farre
to go beyond his predeceſſours, will endeuour to inuent and
bring in ſome new article, ſo that they will procéed ſo farre at
the laſt, that the Church ſhall finde it ſelfe repleniſhed with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
traditions againe, in ſtéed of the Romiſh Eccleſiaſticall
conſtitutions before aboliſhed. And ſo it ſhall fall out as a thing
moſt naturall and common to all Paſtors, that they will cauſe
their owne inuentions to be obſerued more ſtrictly, then the
commandements of God, and the preceptes of his moſt ſacred
wore, as well by depriuing their ſhéepe of the Lords Supper at
their pleaſure, as alſo by their publike exclamations in their
Sermons. So that alſo the violence that ſome vſe in ſéeking
out curiouſlie, thoſe which had tranſgreſſed ſome articles of
their diſcipline, hath made men and women by thouſandes to
reuolt from their Churches: and moſt true it is, that he which
too curiouſly ſéeketh out the doings of other, often forgetteth to
examine his owne, which is quite contrarie to S. <hi>Paules</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
who treating of the Lords Supper, commaundeth
<hi>Euerie one to trie himſelfe.</hi> Whereupon the leagued Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons
of <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> one of the beſt peoples in the world, haue
abridged their Miniſters of this power, which they of <hi>France</hi>
labour to eſtabliſh amongſt them euerie where. But if there
were Protectors of the Magiſtrates, Nobles &amp; Commoners,
might not they verie well ſtop the courſe and progreſſe of theſe
matters? teaching them this leſſon, that ſéeing they attribute
to themſelues none other qualitie or condition, but to be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of the liuing God, that there is nothing more repugnant
to their profeſſion, then to preſume to make lawes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church,
which is the kingdom of God. And that there was neuer anie
ſeruant to King nor Prince, that durſt attempt to vſurpe anie

And who was euer ſo ſawcie a ſeruant, that being left to ſerue
and wait vpon the ſpouſe of his Lord, forgat himſelfe ſo much,
that he would rule ouer her by his own lawes and ordinances?
And what greater blindnes can there be, then to thinke to light
by our counſels the fountaine of all light and wiſedome, which
is eternally reſident in God? Who if he would be aſſiſted with
any other counſellers in the gouernment of his Church: hath
he not Angels and Archangels by legions? Hath he not <hi>Noe</hi>
that great Heralt of iuſtice, <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<hi>Moſes, Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Helias,</hi> the Prophets and Martyrs,
and more then fiue hundreth of the faithfull beſide, which roſe

ſéeing that this onely Chapter doth teach vs more then any

But he that would in good earneſt come to the reformation of

there is an euerlaſting ioy and felicitie, into the which, all the

               </gap>ll: and

them, we are cléerly conuicted and attainted of our owne imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie
and inſufficiencie to fulfill them. For my part, when I ſée
an aſſembly of paſtors congregated to make lawes, to bring
and conduct men more eaſily to life euerlaſting, then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and ſonne of God, and his Apoſtles did (although they

I ſée as an abſurd a thing as if the fiftéene ſcore blinde

thoſe that haue béen emploied about it heretofore. But if you
will obiect, that Miniſters haue made good lawes by their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
againſt danſing, maſking, and dicing. I yéeld, that at the

            <p>WHerefore if we do not take ſome order for the peace and

ſéeke for reconciliation betwéene God and man, &amp; afterwards,
betwéen themſelues, are nothing els but the verie inſtruments
of trouble &amp; ſedition, kindling the fires of diſcord euery where,
to ſet all in flame and concluſion. For to ſtay till of their owne
motions there fall out ſome accord betwéene the Councell of
<hi>Rome</hi> and the Lutherians, and betwéene them againe and the
Caluiniſts, touching our Lords Supper, that will neuer be no
more then betwéen <hi>Caiphas</hi> and the Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt,
wherefore if there be none other to ſtep in amongſt them, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
thereunto by pittying the ruine of other Eſtates, which I
haue named, who muſt craue aide of the greateſt Kings and
Chriſtian Magiſtrates, to make them hold their tongues, they
will trouble heauen &amp; earth about this diſputation of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
(a matter neuertheles verie eaſie to be accorded betwéene
them.) For we all agrée to this, that the faithfull taking the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1938:43"/>
bread &amp; the wine from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand of their Paſtors, receiue by this
meane the verie bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, to be vnited
with him, and made fleſh of his fleſh, &amp; bone of his bone. What
is it that is yet in controuerſie, but onely the maner and forme
how that commeth to paſſe? Now the Capernaits, deſiring to
comprehend the maner of this eating, Ieſus anſwereth them,
that, <hi>The words that I ſpeake vnto you are ſpirit and life.</hi>
As if he ſhould ſay vnto them: there is none but thoſe who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the operation of the diuine ſpirit, and how he giueth
life vnto all creatures, who can comprehend how that is done.
But our ſoule which is detained priſoner in this bodie, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſo much as conceiue how the ſpirite of God being infinite
and incomprehenſible, hath it operation in all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in the world:
nay, that which is farre leſſe, we cannot imagine how the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of heauen, and the ſpirituall Damons, employ their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to execute the iudgements of God, nor the temptations of
the wicked ſpirit againſt vs: nor how a legion of diuels may
be in one onely man, nor after what maner they lodge in him.
And yet thinges farre leſſe then all theſe, cannot we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
as the eſſence of our ſoule: and whether it be within vs
or about vs. For how it can ſo quickly ſtirre and remoue all
the members of the bodie: nor alſo by what force the Adamant
which is in the rocks of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> North, can draw vnto it yron, being
in a ſhip more then ten or twentie leagues of. And whereas he
calleth his words <hi>Life:</hi> it is to giue vs to vnderſtand, that as
our humane vnderſtanding cannot conceiue, how God inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
life to all creatures, and giueth it to ſome liuing creatures
in the belly of their dammes, giueth it to an infinit number of
litle Animals, Locuſts, and little Flies, and no man can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the forme and maner how he doth it, nor ſo mnch as
this, how many liuing creatures being pend in and depriued of
all externall light, for all that ſée moſt cléerely: ſo likewiſe muſt
we conclude, that God worketh in this Sacrament by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
operation, and altogither incomprehenſible, which man
cannot comprehend, nor ſhall not comprehend whileſt he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
in this Elementall and corruptible bodie. It ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
vs to know what S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs: that, there is in vs
an interior and an exterior man. So that in this Sacrament,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1938:43"/>
euen as the exterior, receiueth the ſignes of bread and wine, ſo
the interior receiueth the bodie and blood of Ieſus Chriſt, for
the nouriſhment of euerlaſting life, without making any dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

vpon, it ſhalbe méete for the peace and tranquilitie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome,
that the Tribunes ſhould humbly entreat Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Kings and Potentates to imploy the power and authoritie
that God hath beſtowed vpon them, to bury in perpetuall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuion,
all theſe meanes deuiſed by the Eccleſiaſtickes, be it of
<hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Conſubſtantiation, Infinitie</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes
bodie, and many other quiddities, the fountain of troubles

Italians, leaſt for things wherin they haue none intereſt, they
ruine alſo other Eſtates of this Continent. And if any debate
ſhould fall out betwéene the Tribunes and the Eccleſiaſtickes,

perſons by flattery, giftes and remuneratorie promiſes as
well Mageſtrates as other protectors of the people, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their vnto ſome Eccleſiaſtickes or others, we muſt néedes
ſéeke out and vſe ſome ſurer and perpetuall Remedy againſt
them, And becauſe as I haue proued that there Domination
and great ſomes of mony they dreine out of other countries
hath no foundation but the bare cloke of Religion, by reaſon
wherof to preuent leſt they ſurpriſe vs, we muſt be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and diligent to chooſe out the truth, for that the derill tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
himſelfe into an Angell of light, and is an Ape to the
workes of God, to rob and deceaue vs. But not to bee decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
we muſt at the firſt conſider and examine curiouſly al that
is proffered and preſented to vs for the way of ſaluation, of
what ſide ſoeuer it bee, to chooſe the beſt, otherwiſe our choiſe
ſhall alwayes be doubtfull, hauing no knowledge of neither of
the wayes which we might take. For in matter of Relligion
all haue one deſire and ſhoot at one and the ſame marke, which
is to come the ioyes of heauen and in this they all agrée, but
they diſagrée of the waies and the forme of ſeruices that they
ought to follow. And becauſe they Counſell of <hi>Rome,</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
one kinde of waie and maketh manie take that roowte
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1938:45"/>
with a goodly forwardnes, that they ſet them in thitherward,
and an externall forme of ſeruice, which with great delight, fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
humane ſences very much, practizing all kind of murthers
and cruelties, on thoſe that ſéeke to climbe to heauen any other
waies: There is alſo an other ſort of men, who by liuely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and great perſuaſions, go about to fetch backe from them
as many as they can, to lead them thither by other paths: but
the Romanes, to preuaile in this matter, ſay, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> way whih
they teach, is the broad and wide way, wherein the Fathers
haue paſſed, the which is alſo more common to a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of people. The others they ſay, that this great way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they eſtéeme ſo much, is that which leadeth to perdition, and
many there be that enter in. And that the way of ſaluation is
verie narrow and ſtraight, and few there be that go that way.
And if that they which follow the great and large way, finde it
to be the better, they will not hinder them for going that way:
but yet requiſite at their handes, that they will ſuffer them
peaceably to go by their ſtraight and narrow way, which they
take to be the ſurer paſſage.</p>

               <p>Of the Sunne, the very portraiture of his Creator, &amp; what
are his workes and operations.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>ANd firſt I ſay, that euen as men cannot comprehend the
quanty of his eſſence, being a thouſand times greater then
it appeareth to our eyes, as by demonſtrations all Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
proue, nor likewiſe the qualitie thereof, nor the manner
how it caſteth his heat and light ouer the whole world. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
can we conceiue neither by our vnderſtanding nor exteriour
ſecnes, the greatnes or qualitie of the diuine eſſence; nor how it
hath produced it operations in the creation of the world, in the
conſeruation of the ſame, nor the manner how it worketh to
create in the faithfull the new man, which fighteth againſt the
fleſh. Likewiſe as this great celeſtiall light is in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
operation and mouing, to runne his great race about the
whole world, alwaies doing good, and bringing infinit commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
to other creatures: ſo God is alwaies watching and in
action for the benefit and preſeruation of his creatures. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
as when a thicke cloude hath depriued our ſight of his
beames for a moneth togither or more, and that this let being
taken from vs, we begin to ſée his beames againe, which bring
a certaine ioy or gladneſſe vnto vs, and driue the cold far from
vs: ſo the faithfull neuer ſéeke to behold God in his works
and vertues, but that they receiue great pleaſure and delectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And beſides, as when this diuine image retireth back from
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1938:47"/>
vs into <hi>Capricorne,</hi> the Caldes comming from the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
and from the frozen ſea comming to afflict all liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
ſpoyling our mother the earth of all her trimme and good
ornaments, and making her naked and vgly to behold: ſo when
God angry at our ſinnes, taketh his holie ſpirit from vs, the
prince of this world, of the aire, the God of this age, the ruler
of darkenes, which is, the diuel commeth to aſſaile, and enuiron
vs, to tempt vs and bid vs battell, and to annoy vs many other
waies. But as this great celeſtiall light goeth not from vs to
forſake vs: but to diſtribute his light to the people which liue
vnder the North Pole, and that by his long abſence, wée know
better the benefites that wée receiue by his preſence: ſo God
ſometime holdeth his face from vs, to the end that deſiring him
we ſhould ſéeke for him, &amp; ſhewing vs his countenance againe,
we ſhould taſte better what a benefit it is to enioy alwaies his
preſence. For as this blazing torch comming towardes, being
leaped backward to approach vnto <hi>Cancer,</hi> beginneth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the face of the earth, and to beautifie her with gréenneſſe,
and with an infinit number of hearbes and floures of diuers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
giuing life to many hundreth thouſand millions of little
Annimals, to ſerue for foode to birdes and fiſhes, to féede their
young withall, who by an harmonious melodie, full of all ioy
and gladnes, celebrate the bountie of their ſoueraigne the Sun,
which they receiue by ſuch inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as it pleaſeth him to vſe
to heate againe that part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, from whence he had abſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelfe ſo farre, wherein he magnifieth the omnipotencie,
bountie and wiſedome of his maker, which hath attributed to
him ſo many vertues, to the end that we ſhould wonder at him
in his ſo beautifull and perfect workemanſhip: ſo alſo he pulleth
downe our preſumption, for that we cannot ſhew any ſuch like
péeces of workema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip, nay, we cannot ſo much as conceiue by
our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, how he giueth life to ſo many liuing things,
and how one onely floure is cloathed with ſuch diuerſitie of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
If it be ſo, then the greateſt and quickeſt vnderſtandings

him, ſéeking him here in earth, in buildings made by the handy

which was: that God did not inhabite in Temples made

vnto vs by an argument á <hi>Minore ad Maius.</hi> Thus, if it be ſo
that all the forces of men are not able to build an houſe big i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to encloſe and containe me: how is it then that they are
ſo fooliſh and preſumptuous to thinke to lodge him that is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
and hath his dwelling in the inacceſſible light, of the which
I am but a ſparke? how dare they thinke that he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
nor compriſed in houſes made by men, and that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
built by them, and that their tapers and candles are more
agréeable to him then we his great lightes, who without wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
old or conſuming, do diſtribute continually to the world, ſo
great and admirable a light? For as for their temples they are
but earth: and grant that they be vawted with ſtone, couered
with bricke, leade, or ſtate, yea were it with gold and ſiluer; all
that is taken out of the bowels of the earth. So that all your
buildings ſtand you in no more ſtéed then earthes and holes do
to the Foxes, that is to preſerue you from the iniuries of the

vehement heate, raine and cold: but you are not in any wiſe by
their meanes the néerer to God, nay rather when you are in
his temple of the world, they let you, that you cannot behold his
wondrous workes, putting as it were a barre betwéene hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and you. And as for the images that ye place within them
in contempt of vs, by your moſt deteſtable ingratitude, ſéeing
that God doth preſerue you by me and the reſt of the celeſtiall
lightes, and doth beſtow on you all kinde of bleſſings, is it not
then a great ouerſight in you, that in forſaking vs who are the

made by the deuiſe of men, albeit they approach in nothing,
neither in matter, greatnes, qualitie nor effects, to thoſe that
are the handie worke of God. For firſt they are made of an
earthly and dead ſubſtance, which commeth nothing néere our
greatnes: without any mouing or operation: and without
the heate and light which we haue. Moreouer, they are but ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Doctors, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> the Prophet ſaith: For they haue no
power, life, wiſedome, light, nor bountie, neither can they ſée
any thing: is it not then falſly done to go about to repreſent by
them Almightie, who is the welſpring of life &amp; light: and him,
who is all goodnes it ſelfe, &amp; afterward to tranſlate vnto them
the honour that appertaineth vnto him? Further, one is pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

was neuer ſo: another ſheweth a laughing countenance, and
neuer laugheth. Other are pictured with eyes, and they ſée not,
ſome with eares and they heare not, and others with a mouth
and yet they ſpeake not at all. Whereby appeareth, that there
is no veritie in their witneſſe, and that all that they can do, is
but to tranſport the mony aut of our purſes into the Italians
handes, or to ſome other of their ſuppoſes emploied in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices

and doctrines of men: that is to wit: whether they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
with they teſtimonies that God giueth of himſelfe by his
creatures: which as they publiſh that all things are procéeded
from a ſupreme and former cauſe that doth maintaine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
them: ſo alſo muſt hee giue him the hommage of all his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1938:50"/>
benefits, and to haue recourſe to him as to a bottomeles foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
to lade out of him all bleſſings, as well ſpirituall as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perall,
confeſſing his greatnes, bountie, and excellencie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his great and admirable workes, to humble vs, and to
tame this pride growing in vs by nature, in exalting him as the
giuer of all that which wee haue, to depend wholy on his good
pleaſure, and moſt holy will: And to make proofe of this great
concordance: the royal Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh vnto the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
to this effect: Call vpon me when thou art in trouble and
I will helpe thee, and thou ſhalt worſhip me. Wherein we ſee
a ſtrict commaundement to call vpon God, and to gine him
thankes, as an act properly due to the diuinitie and incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable
to all the reſt of his creatures: as hee ſpeaketh in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, To thee O God, who art aboue in the heauens, we
lift our eies.</p>
            <p>For to ſhew vs the forme of calling vpon him, which is not
to haue our ſpirites fixed heere in earth in the workes of mens
hands: but to eleuate them towardes the heauens, as Chriſt
himſelfe vſed ſaying: <hi>Our Father which art in heauen,</hi>
and ſo foorth: And as for faith, that it onelye ought to looke
vp to God: this Prophet verie well prooueth. In God is my
ſoule well pleaſed, he onely is my ſafegard, and the rocke of my
defence, he is my ſauing health, and my ſtrong fortreſſe, ſo that
I ſhall not fall, for hee holdeth me vp. And if we regard well, a
great part of the Pſalmes, and amongeſt the reſt, the 104. and
118 to what do they tend but to magnifie the excellence, beuty,
and greatnes of the workes of God? And ſurely, there is no
thing ſo excellent for man to practiſe, as to exerciſe himſelfe in
the contemplation of them, to giue the praiſe and honour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
vnto his Creatour. And all the reſt of the Pſalmes tend but
to extoll the admirable vertues of the liuing God, as his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
power, mercie, iuſtice, liberalitie and clemencie. Moreouer,
there are certaine principall verſes amongſt the reſt, which by
the riches of an immitable eloquence, do praiſe, ſet forth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all things aduance his holy and diuine lawe: ſhewing that
the ſoueraigne felicitie of man conſiſteth in the mediation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
day and night: forcing himſelfe with all his heart, thorowly
to obſerue the ſame. But after that hee hath thus ſpoken of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1938:51"/>
God, of his workes, and of his law: what ſaith hee, I pray you
concerning men, and of his owne perſon? when he ſaith. What
is man? hée is a thing of naught, and all that he worſhippeth is
but vanitie: &amp; in another place, the ſame kingly Prophet ſaith:
All are gone out of the way: they are all corrupt, there is none
that doth good, no not one. And ſpeaking of his owne perſon,
although hee were the moſt holy king that euer raigned ouer
Gods people, he ſaith: Be mercifull to me O God a pore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
&amp;c. and that his mother hath conceiued him in ſinne, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God to waſh him, and to purge him from all his iniquities,
as him onely that could doe it.</p>
            <p>Now hauing thus much ſpoken of man and of his doings, to
abate and pul down his pride and preſumption, and not to leaue
him there, but to prepare him to ſéeke all that which he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in the perſon of his redéemer: imbracing him by a true and
liuelie faith, as being him that to ſatiſfie the diuine iuſtice, ſhuld
carrie all our tranſgreſſions and ſinnes vpon his owne backe,
as <hi>Dauid</hi> deſcribeth in the 22. Pſalme, and the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>
in the 53. Chapter of his prophecie, which they did ſet downe
before the comming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and after his death his Apoſtles,
wel I haue prooued by a moſt admirable conſent and vnity. He
that wil then no more ſubmit himſelfe vnder the <hi>Italian</hi> yoke,
to be raunged vnder their <hi>Domination:</hi> let him read quicklie
the aforeſaid bookes, and conſider and ponder them well in his
mind, weighing diligently euerie word, and euerie ſentence one
after another: and conferring aduiſedly the beginning with
the middle, and the end. Let him examine this doctrine with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inſtructions that God doth giue vs particularlie both in
heauen and in earth: not to approoue and make them ſerue to
our fantaſies and opinions, but laying all them wholie aſide, to
take their inſtructions, and ſimplie to follow their leſſens. In
this doing, he ſhall learne that we are all Burgeſſes and felow-Citizens
of the great Temple and ſumptuous pallace of our
God, and that by the conſideration of our vicious and poore na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he ſhall be taught to mount aboue the heauens, to inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
vpon God, and to obtaine by this meane, all things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he ſhall ſtand in need. And from thence, comming vnto his
moſt holy and ſacred word, magnifiyng it as the onely inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1938:51"/>
of our ſaluation, and a perfect declaration of the counſell
and will of God towards men: and hauing the knowledge of
theſe thinges, no man ſhall be able to withdrawe vs from this
way of warſhipping GOD on high, to ſéeke him in Temples,
buildings, and other places of this earth, but if we goe to thoſe
places that ſhall be onely to make profeſſion of our faith, to bée
aſſiſtant at publicke praiers, to heare the word of God, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
whether the Doctrine that is taught vs be conformable
to theſe Doctors, of whome I haue now ſpoken: which when
we ſhall finde, we ſhall imbrace as diuine and of God, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vs againe in mynd, and confirming thoſe things which the
preached, we ſhall receiue it as moſt heauenly doctrine: but if
it tend to exalt men and their works only to pleaſe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
we ſhall receiue it as procéeding from the preſumption and
ouer-ſight of men, who take themſelues to be wiſer then God,
and for ſuch ſtuffe as may entangle the people in the nets of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie,
and fill onely the purſes of worldlie Paſtors: wherefore,
without any regard from whence it procéedeth, whether from
<hi>Coucels</hi> or <hi>Synods,</hi> or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other ſort of Ecclefiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
whatſoener, wee will reiect it, thinke our ſelues no more
hounden vnto the obſeruation thereof, then to the dreames and
tales of olde women. On the other ſide knowing that life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
is giuen vs by the grace of God in our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, and is offered gratis to all men: what ginnes ſoeuer the
Italians and ſuch like can lay to drawe our money finely from
vs, we ſhall goe by them well enough, making as though wée
ſawe them not, and as though wee neuer heard talke of them,
Theſe are then the moſt ſure &amp; certaine remedies, by the which
all true Chriſtians may eaſilie winde themſelues out from the
Italian Domination, and make a prouiſo, that their money be
no more tranſported to <hi>Rome,</hi> but tary at home iu their owne
purſes.</p>
