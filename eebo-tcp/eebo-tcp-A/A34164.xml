            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Begun in the Year</hi> 1640. <hi>by the Special Command of King</hi> CHARLES I. <hi>of Bleſſed Memory, and continued to the happy</hi> Reſtauration <hi>of the</hi> Government, <hi>and the</hi> Coronation <hi>of King</hi> CHARLES II.</head>
            <p>THere hath been very much Mony disburſed, and great Pains taken, and many Hazards run in making an exact Collection of all the Pamphlets that were publiſh'd from the Beginning of that Long and Rebel-Parliament, which began <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1640. till His late Majeſties Happy Reſtauration and Coronation, conſiſting of near Thirty Thouſand ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sorts, and by all Parties.</p>
            <p>They may be of very great Uſe to any Gentleman concerned in Publick Affairs, both for this Preſent, and After-Ages, there being not the like in the World neither is it poſſible to make ſuch a Collection.</p>
            <p>The Collection contains above Two Thouſand bound Volumes all of them uniformly bound, as if they were done at one Time, and all exactly Marked and Numbred.</p>
            <p>The Method that has been obſerved, is Time, and ſuch punctual Care was taken, that the very Day is written upon moſt of them, when they came out.</p>
            <p>The Catalogue of them fairly written is in Twelve Volumes in <hi>Folio;</hi> and though the Number of them be ſo great, (when the Books are ſet in their Order according to the Mark ſet upon each of them) the ſmalleſt Piece, though but one Sheet of Paper, being ſhewn in the Catalogue, may be found in a moment; which Method is of ſingular uſe to the Reader.</p>
            <p>In the whole are contain'd near one Hundred ſeveral MS. Pieces that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver printed, all, or moſt of them on the King's behalf, which no man durſt then venture to publiſh without endangering his Ruine. But the Peruſer now may by them be let into the Knowledge of many Occurences in thoſe Times, which have paſſ'd hitherto unobſerv'd.</p>
            <p>This Collection was ſo privately carried on, that it was never known, that there was ſuch a Deſign in hand; the Collector deſigning them only for His Majeſties Uſe that then was: His Majeſty having occaſion for a Pamphlet, could no where compaſs the Sight of it but from him, which His Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving peruſed, was very well pleas'd with the Deſign, and commanded a Perſon of Honour to reſtore it with his own Hands, and withal expreſs'd His deſire of having the Collection continued: This was the great Encouragement to the Undertaker, who had otherwiſe deſiſted proſecuting ſo difficult and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable a Work, which lay a heavy Burden upon himſelf and his Servants for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Twenty Years.</p>
            <p>To prevent the Diſcovery of them, when the Army was Northwards, he pack'd them up in ſeveral Trunks, and by one or two in a Week ſent them to a truſty Friend in <hi>Surry,</hi> who ſafely preſerv'd them; and when the Army was Weſtward, and fearing their Return that way; they were ſent to <hi>London</hi> again; but the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector durſt not keep them, but ſent them into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſo according as they lay near Danger, ſtill, by timely removing them, at a great Charge, ſecur'd them, but continu'd perfecting the Work.</p>
            <p>And for a farther Security to them, there was a Bargain pretended to be made with the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and a Receipt of a Thouſand Pounds given and acknowledg'd to be in part for them, that if the Uſurper had found them out, the Univerſity ſhould claim them, who had greater Power to ſtruggle for them than a private Man.</p>
            <p>All theſe Shifts have been made, and Difficulties encounter'd to keep the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection from being embezel'd and deſtroy'd; which with the great Charges of collecting and binding them, coſt the Undertaker ſo much, that he refuſed Four Thouſand Pounds for them in his Life time, ſuppoſing that Sum not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to re-imburſe him.</p>
