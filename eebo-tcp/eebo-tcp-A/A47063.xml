            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>Opium,</hi> that was in <hi>Use</hi> in <hi>Ancient Times,</hi> was made thus:</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Poppy</hi> (which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the <hi>White,</hi> and sow'd then only in Gardens, and small Inclosures) was come to its full growth, and most turgid of <hi>Milky Iuice,</hi> which was in the hot Countries in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>Iune;</hi> they did, as soon as the <hi>Dew</hi> was up in the mornings, make several Incisions transversly or <hi>athwart</hi> the Heads of the <hi>Poppies,</hi> yet not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly <hi>horizontal,</hi> but somewhat <hi>obliquely,</hi> taking
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52480:5"/>
care not to make them quite through into the <hi>cavity</hi> thereof; holding the <hi>Knife,</hi> or <hi>Instrument,</hi> with which the <hi>Incisions</hi> were made, with its Edge sloaping upward, while it wounded the Heads, and conveniently placing certain <hi>Shells</hi> to receive the <hi>Milky Drops,</hi> that issued out of the <hi>Incisions;</hi> and went backward among the <hi>Poppies,</hi> as they proceeded in this <hi>Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>They chose the Time when the Poppy Heads were most turgid of Milk,</hi> to take it in the best <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for their Purpose; for if they gathered it sooner, it was not so Mature, and if afterward, some of its <hi>Vertue</hi> expired; and the <hi>quantity</hi> of the Juice was less, because dry'd up in some measure, if not taken timely.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>They made several Incisions in every Poppy's Head,</hi> to have the greater Plenty of Juice.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>They made them immediately after the Dew was up,</hi> to prevent its being tainted with any of the <hi>Dew;</hi> and because the great <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Day,</hi> in those <hi>Countreys,</hi> would much diminish the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the <hi>Milky Iuice,</hi> and so thicken it, that it would not run out as freely as in the <hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>They made the Incisions transversly,</hi> thereby to cut and lay open more of the Milky Vessels.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>They made them somewhat obliquely,</hi> that the Drops might the better follow, and overtake one the other, and thereby coalesce, and grow more considerable in <hi>Bulk,</hi> and that the oblique <hi>Wound</hi> might the better conduct them into the same part of the <hi>Shells;</hi> that they might find all together in a <hi>mass,</hi> when it was sufficiently dried or inspis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sated by the <hi>Heat</hi> of the Sun.</item>
               <item>6. <hi>They did not make the Incisions quite through,</hi> (if they could avoid it) lest any of the <hi>Iuice</hi> should run into the <hi>Cavity</hi> of the <hi>Head,</hi> and so be lost among the <hi>Seeds</hi> contain'd therein.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52480:5"/>7. <hi>They sloaped the Edge of the Knife, or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upwards, as they made the Incisions,</hi> that the <hi>Iuice</hi> might the easier slide outwardly; especially in case they happened to make the <hi>Incisions</hi> quite through, which they could not always avoid, notwithstanding all the <hi>Care</hi> they used.</item>
               <item>8. <hi>They went backward as they did it,</hi> to avoid going by the <hi>Shells,</hi> and incised <hi>Heads;</hi> lest they should disorder, or discompose, or throw them down, or wipe off any of the <hi>Iuice</hi> with their Cloaths.</item>

            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>sound</hi> of <hi>b</hi> is more like that of <hi>v,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the sound of both are <hi>vocalized,</hi> which that of <hi>p</hi> (as has been said) is not; so that <hi>b</hi> and <hi>v</hi> agree exactly as <hi>p</hi> and <hi>f;</hi> This makes the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians</hi> say <hi>Theves</hi> for <hi>Thebes,</hi> as the <hi>Arabians</hi> say <hi>Ofium</hi> for <hi>Opium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who knows, but this may be the cause why <hi>P</hi> is a kind of shut <hi>F,</hi> and <hi>F</hi> a kind of an open <hi>P;</hi> for suppose <hi>P</hi> opened at the round part, to signifie that the Lips are not closed in sounding <hi>F,</hi> and that the lower stroak or part be left shorter, to signifie that the lower Lip is drawn inward in sounding <hi>F,</hi> the <hi>P</hi> becomes a perfect <hi>F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Reasons</hi> why the <hi>Opium,</hi> that came from <hi>Thebes,</hi> (now called <hi>Theves</hi>) was, and is the best, are, 1. That <hi>Thebes</hi> (or <hi>Theves</hi>) being in <hi>Egypt,</hi> lies in a hotter Country, that is, nearer the <hi>Line</hi> (or <hi>Equator</hi>) than any of the Countries on the North-side of the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> for it is observed, that the <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Climates</hi> contributes very much to the <hi>Strength</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> which is weaker if you make it in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> than in <hi>France;</hi> in the Northern Parts of <hi>France,</hi> than in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> which borders upon the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> and weaker there than in <hi>Smirna, Natolia, Aleppo,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52480:8"/>
and <hi>Apulia,</hi> which are more Southern; and weaker in those Places than in <hi>Thebais</hi> in <hi>Egypt:</hi> For which cause we may Judge, that the <hi>Opium</hi> which comes to <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> that is yet hotter than <hi>Egypt,</hi> being much worse than that of <hi>Thebes,</hi> (or <hi>Theves</hi>) must in all probability be adulterated, or made of the <hi>Leaves</hi> and <hi>Stems</hi> of the <hi>Poppy,</hi> (as some say) otherwise it would be rather better, as coming from the hotter Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. 2. That of <hi>Thebes</hi> may be better, because the Heat of <hi>Egypt</hi> is more constant, and uniform, than in <hi>Natolia, Aleppo, Smirna, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Quantity of <hi>Opium</hi> which was gathered by the <hi>Milky Iuice</hi> of the <hi>Poppy's Heads,</hi> dropping into <hi>Shells</hi> out of the <hi>Incisions</hi> aforesaid, being but small; and the <hi>Use</hi> of this most noble, pleasing, and generous of <hi>Cordials,</hi> and <hi>Medicaments,</hi> daily increasing, by the <hi>constant</hi> and insallible <hi>Benefit</hi> they found thereby; Men, partly to avoid the <hi>tediousness</hi> of gathering it by <hi>Drops,</hi> and partly out of <hi>necessity,</hi> but mainly ('tis to be doubted) out of <hi>covetousness,</hi> began to bruise and pound the <hi>Poppy's Heads,</hi> and to squeeze out the <hi>Iuice,</hi> for <hi>Expedition</hi> and <hi>Quantitic's</hi> sake; which bruising, and squeesing, caused it to look blackish.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Election (or <hi>Choice)</hi> of Opium.</head>
            <p>ALL <hi>Opium</hi> being made in ancient Times by the <hi>Milky Drops</hi> that fell out of the <hi>Incisions</hi> mention'd in the last Chapter, which being a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and simple way, made no difference in the <hi>Opium,</hi> but what Nature it self did; all their Knowledge of the best <hi>Opium</hi> consisted in distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing the <hi>Theban</hi> from other <hi>Opium,</hi> which was not naturally so good.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Theban Opium</hi> was of a lighter <hi>Reddish Yellow</hi> than other sorts, therefore some call'd it <hi>White Opium,</hi> not that it was abjolutely white, but only relatively such in comparison with other <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Opium;</hi> as we say <hi>White Rosin,</hi> in respect of other <hi>Rosin,</hi> thô it is not <hi>white,</hi> but only lighter colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than other <hi>Rosins.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Theban Opium</hi> was most hot, bitter, and biting in taste, from whence you may infer, that the <hi>Opium</hi> which has those qualities in the highest <hi>degree</hi> is the best.</item>
               <item>3. It smelled rankly, and vehemently of the <hi>Poppy,</hi> which gives you another good sign to judge of <hi>Opium.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. It burnt with a clearer Flame than any other.</item>
               <item>5. Some say, that it was weightier than other sorts. Notwithstanding all which Differences, they did in <hi>time</hi> find ways to adulterate it, which were these:
<list>
                     <item>1. They adulterated it with Juice of <hi>Glauciam,</hi> (or <hi>Apple</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi>)
<p>
                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52480:10"/>This was discernable by the <hi>Yellow Tincture,</hi> that it gave to <hi>Water,</hi> and other <hi>Menstruums;</hi> whereas the <hi>Theban,</hi> and all true <hi>Opium</hi> gives a <hi>Red Tincture.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. It was counterfeited with <hi>resinous Things.</hi>
                        <p>This Cheat was discoverable by its not being uniform, nor so dissolvable in <hi>Water</hi> as good <hi>Opium.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <p>3. It was mix'd with Juice of <hi>Lactuca Sylvestris,</hi> or <hi>Wild Endive leav'd Lettuce.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This made it of a duller <hi>colour,</hi> and not to smell so perfectly and rankly of the <hi>Poppy.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. It was sometimes mix'd with the <hi>Milky Iuice</hi> of <hi>Spurge,</hi> which being <hi>hot, bitter,</hi> and <hi>biting,</hi> was hardly discernable, but by its purging and disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality, and somewhat less and different.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>You may be sure, that <hi>this,</hi> and all the other <hi>Mixtures</hi> lessen'd its <hi>Vertue</hi> as an <hi>Opiate,</hi> if consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the same quantity, because they must take up room in the <hi>Mass;</hi> but <hi>Lactuca Sylvestris</hi> being of the nature of <hi>Opium,</hi> made the loss of its <hi>Vertue</hi> less discernable.</p>
            <p>It is true, that we have none of the <hi>Opium</hi> that was gathered by the <hi>milky Drops</hi> out of the <hi>Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi> and therefore what is said, doth not much concern us as to that sort; however these <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> will enlighten us as to the <hi>Opium</hi> that we now have.</p>
            <p>Of which I cannot find, that there is much <hi>Adulteration</hi> used, because (I suppose) that it is now grown considerably cheaper, by reason of the vast <hi>quantities</hi> that is made, with so much ease, that it is not worth while to counterfeit it, there being now great Fields of <hi>Poppy</hi> in <hi>Turky;</hi> so that our business will be rather to distinguish the <hi>Sort,</hi> than the <hi>Adulteration;</hi> thô this shall not pass unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, as far as it may concern us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52480:11"/>There are two sorts brought over to us; <hi>one</hi> from <hi>Persia</hi> and the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> the <hi>other</hi> from <hi>Turky,</hi> as from <hi>Lesser Asia,</hi> (or <hi>Natolia</hi>) <hi>Smyrna, Aleppo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. That which is brought from <hi>East-India, Persia, Surat,</hi> &amp;c. is (as I am inform'd) made of the Leaves and Stems of the <hi>Poppy,</hi> and is,
<list>
                     <item>1. More full of <hi>Filth</hi> within it, (for the outside is not so much to be regarded, because of <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi>)</item>
                     <item>2. It is not so <hi>uniform, smooth,</hi> and <hi>supple,</hi> but harsh and rugged.</item>
                     <item>3. It is not so readily dissolvable in Water.</item>
                     <item>4. The <hi>Indian</hi> is brought over in <hi>larger Pieces.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <p>5. It is not brought so wrapt in Leaves as the <hi>Turky Opium</hi> is.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bontius</hi> says, that they make it of the <hi>Stems</hi> and <hi>Leaves;</hi> if so, it must be much worse than the <hi>Turky Opium,</hi> that is made of the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Leaves.</hi>
                        </p>

                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>II. Among those sorts that are brought out of <hi>Turky,</hi> (and indeed any sorts of <hi>Opium</hi>)
<list>
                     <item>1. That is best that is most <hi>bitter, hot,</hi> and <hi>biting.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The <hi>lighter, whiter,</hi> and clearer its <hi>Flame</hi> is, when it burns, the better it is.</item>
                     <item>3. The more <hi>uniform, even, smooth, tough, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>complying</hi> it is to be wrought, or brought to any <hi>form,</hi> the better it is.</item>
                     <item>4. <hi>The more it gives, upon, or against moist Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or in a moist <hi>Air</hi> of any <hi>kind,</hi> and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, speedier, freer, and more perfectly it dissolves in <hi>Water,</hi> the better it is.</item>
                     <item>
                        <p>5. <hi>The redder the Tincture is that it gives in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Spirit of Wine, or any <hi>Menstruum,</hi> the better it is; and 'tis never good if it gives only a <hi>yellow Tincture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52480:11"/>But <hi>Note,</hi> That even the best <hi>Opium,</hi> if you take but a very slight <hi>Tincture</hi> thereof, will appear yellowish, especially in a <hi>white Vessel.</hi> Therefore my meaning is, that the redder Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture <hi>Opium</hi> causes in <hi>Water,</hi> quantity for quantity, the better it is.</p>
                     </item>
                     <item>6. <hi>It should have no taste or smell of an Empyreum,</hi> or Burning; for that gives it a nauseous taste, and in some measure signifies a loss of its Vertue by burning, thô this may be inconsiderable.</item>
                     <item>7. <hi>The less Filth it has on the inside, the better it is.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>8. <hi>The more it sparkles when cut, and afterward breath'd</hi> upon three or four times, the truer is the <hi>Opium;</hi> for those <hi>sparkling Particles</hi> are its noble <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> (or <hi>Sal. Volatile-oleosum</hi>) and not its <hi>resinous Parts,</hi> as <hi>Wedelcus,</hi> and others affirm. 1. Because when the <hi>Rosin</hi> and <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> are separated, that sparkling follows the <hi>Volatile Parts</hi> and not the <hi>Rosin,</hi> wherein they do not appear in the least. 2. Because I find that they are the <hi>Parts</hi> that are most apt to dissolve in <hi>Water,</hi> which the <hi>Rosin</hi> is not. 3. Because they are much altered by a warm and moist <hi>Breath,</hi> which the resinous Part is not. 4. How could that <hi>Opium</hi> be the best (as 'tis found to be) that has most of them, if it were the <hi>Rosin,</hi> which is the worst Part of <hi>Opium?</hi> But 'tis highly consonant to <hi>Experience,</hi> that they should be the <hi>Volatile,</hi> or <hi>best Parts</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> which is so much the better, the more it abounds with them.</item>
                     <item>9. <hi>If it yields any other Tincture than Red, it is not right;</hi> and the duller or paler the Red is, the worse or weaker it is.</item>
                     <item>10. <hi>The best is heavier in proportion to its Bulk,</hi> which you may soon experiment thus:</item>

               <item>
                  <p>1. <hi>It causes a most agreeable, pleasant, and charming Sensation about the Region of the Stomach,</hi> which if one lies, or sits still, diffuses it self in a kind of <hi>indefinite manner,</hi> seizing one not unlike the gentle, sweet <hi>Deliquium</hi> that we find upon our entrance into a most agreeable <hi>Slumber,</hi> which, upon yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, generally ends in <hi>Sleep:</hi> But if the Person keeps himself in <hi>Action, Discourse,</hi> or <hi>Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> it seems (especially when given in a <hi>Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> after a moderate Rest at Night) like a most delicious and extraordinary <hi>Refreshment</hi> of the Spirits upon very <hi>good News,</hi> or any other great cause of <hi>Ioy,</hi> as the sight of a dearly beloved Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thought to have been lost at <hi>Sea,</hi> or the like, causing such a pleasant <hi>Ovation</hi> of the <hi>Spirits, Serenity, &amp;c.</hi> as we find after a competent Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>generous Wine ad Hilaritatem,</hi> (as Men use to say.)</p>
                  <p>It is indeed so unexpressibly fine and sweet a <hi>Pleasure,</hi> that it is very difficult for me to describe, or any to conceive it, but such as actually feel it; for 'tis as if a <hi>Good Genius</hi> possessed, or informed a Man; therefore People do commonly call it a <hi>heavenly Condition,</hi> as if no <hi>worldly Pleasure</hi> was to be compar'd with it: <hi>Helmontianus</hi> would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less express it by the <hi>Archeus</hi> in his very best <hi>Humour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has been compar'd (not without good cause) to a permanent gentle <hi>Degree</hi> of that Pleasure, which Modesty forbids the naming of; and 'tis well worth a Remark, that both are <hi>Pleasures</hi> of the same Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Feeling;</hi> for it cannot be a Pleasure of any other <hi>Sense,</hi> since it is <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
                  </p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52480:14"/>2. <hi>It causes a brisk, gay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and good Humour:</hi> Nor do I doubt but it has this <hi>Effect</hi> upon sleeping Persons, as far as their Condition is capable of observing it; for you shall have them often tell of <hi>pleasant Dreams</hi> after it, when they remember them, and speak of any. See <hi>Bauchin,</hi> and the <hi>Authors</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned below under the 4th <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Opium.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p>3. <hi>It causes Promptitude, Serenity, Alacrity, and Expediteness in Dispatching and Managing of Business:</hi> To which <hi>end,</hi> and that of a good and gay Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour (which are near of <hi>kind</hi>) it is commonly taken in the Morning in the <hi>Eastern Countries,</hi> with most certain <hi>Effect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth of which <hi>Wedelius</hi> is forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, though quite contrary to his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Opium's fixing and coagulating the Spirits;</hi> giving an instance of <q>a certain serene Person, who when she had any Affair of great moment to dispatch, did (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand) take <hi>Opium</hi> with great advantage; for she thereby found her self every way better disposed for Business, and more enabled to bear the Fatigue thereof.</q> Which is the <hi>Substance</hi> of what he writes in <hi>Latin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many other <hi>Authors</hi> confirm the <hi>Truth</hi> of these <hi>Effects;</hi> but (above all) the constant Experience of the <hi>Eastern Nations,</hi> puts it out of all doubt.</p>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>It causes Assurance, Ovation of the Spirits, Courage, Contempt of Danger, and Magnanimity,</hi> much after the manner that <hi>generous Wine</hi> does; instead of which, the <hi>Turks, &amp;c.</hi> use <hi>Opium</hi> before <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,</hi> desperate <hi>Attacks, &amp;c.</hi> (as is most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious) to make them Courageous, which it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly does: For your satisfaction as to this, and other <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> not so commonly observed with us, for <hi>Reasons</hi> given in <hi>Chap.</hi> VIII.

               <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> contrives a Compendious Way of Examining all Opinions concerning the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Opium.</hi>

            <p>HAving, without any <hi>sly</hi> or <hi>sordid Evasion,</hi> or considerable <hi>Omission,</hi> (which has been the persidious Course of <hi>Authors</hi> in this Case) fully and truly enumerated the <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>certain Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Opium</hi> in Humane Bodies, and thereby <hi>empannel'd</hi> a <hi>Iust Iury</hi> for the <hi>Trial</hi> of <hi>Hypothesises,</hi> which must be Judged by the <hi>Effects</hi> or <hi>Pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena's</hi> of <hi>Opium;</hi> I will now proceed to their <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi> But because it would be endless to take every one <hi>particularly</hi> into <hi>Consideration,</hi> I will use their <hi>Stratagem,</hi> who <hi>blow up Foundations,</hi> to save the tedious Pecking at all the Parts of the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structures,</hi> which in this Case would require an <hi>Age,</hi> and take up all my Time in <hi>demolishing</hi> them, which may be better employ'd in <hi>erecting</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may be useful.</p>
            <p>I have <hi>considered,</hi> and find, That the <hi>Foundation,</hi> in which all <hi>Authors,</hi> both <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Modern,</hi> agree, and whereupon they have hitherto endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to build, (looking upon it as <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable</hi> in all <hi>Ages</hi>) is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> Opium <hi>operates by diminishing or disabling the Spirits</hi> (meaning the <hi>animal Spirits.</hi>)</p>
            <p>The Ancients <hi>affirming, That it did so by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme cold Quality, &amp;c.</hi> And</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52480:22"/>The Moderns (who observed it to act, while it is at <hi>Stomach,</hi> by affecting the <hi>Brain, Nerves, Animal Spirits, &amp;c.</hi> and concluded no Action was perform'd without Contact) <hi>infer'd</hi> and agreed, (because no visible Passage could be found from the <hi>Stomach</hi> to the <hi>Head) that it must of absolute necessity act by Fumes, Vapours, Auras, or Effluviums sent up out of the Stomach to the Brain, Nerves, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that all the remaining <hi>Question</hi> among the <hi>Moderns</hi> is, Which <hi>Way</hi> those <hi>Fumes</hi> or <hi>Vapours</hi> do the <hi>Feat?</hi> all allowing the <hi>Fumes</hi> do it.</p>

               <hi>clouding the Animal Spirits,</hi> cause a fine <hi>Ovation</hi> thereof, a <hi>Gay, Brave, Couragious, and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Disposition, Euphory, Promptitude to Venery, Serenity, Expediteness in Management, &amp;c.</hi> Which are (as has been said) the <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>proper Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor, indeed, was any of those <hi>Authors</hi> so fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardy as to attempt it; Why then did they write, and trouble the <hi>World</hi> to peruse their <hi>Books,</hi> when they were so far from explaining the <hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> that they scarce ever durst mention them, nor set their <hi>Hypothesises,</hi> and them, as much as in View of one another?

               <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> shews Iust Causes of his Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that all Authors have gone upon a wrong Foundation in their Disquisitions of the Cause of the Operation of <hi>Opium.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Have shewn you, That the <hi>general Foundation</hi> of both <hi>Ancient,</hi> and <hi>Modern</hi> Authors, is,</p>
            <q>That <hi>Opium</hi> doth diminish, or disable the Spirits.</q>
            <p>And now I will plainly shew <hi>Iust Causes of my Suspicion</hi> of its <hi>Insufficiency,</hi> which are these:</p>
            <p n="1">1. I <hi>observe,</hi> That all Learned Men are, to this <hi>day,</hi> highly dissatisfied as to the Cause, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Operation</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> notwithstanding all that has been written concerning it; and that it is the <hi>common Cry</hi> on all Hands, that none has illustrated the <hi>Operations</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> to any <hi>Purpose,</hi> or given any Satisfaction therein; and therefore <hi>Learned Physicians</hi> are still as much upon the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi> as ever they were.</p>
            <p>It is much more <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Reasonable,</hi> to <hi>suspect</hi> the <hi>Foundation,</hi> that all former <hi>Authors</hi> have built upon, than a <hi>general Failure</hi> in all the most Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Master Builders,</hi> that ever endeavour'd to build thereon; for if all the best <hi>Architects</hi> of the <hi>whole World</hi> fail to erect a firm <hi>Superstructure</hi> upon any one <hi>Foundation,</hi> what can we think, but that the <hi>Foundation</hi> is infirm? especially when (as in our Case) no <hi>Way</hi> (that <hi>Care, Iudgment, Perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacity,</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi> could invent, or think of) has
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52480:24"/>
been left untried to build thereon; so that (tho' I modestly call it a Cause of <hi>Suspicion</hi>) it amounts almost (if not altogether) to a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> that the <hi>Foundation</hi> that all <hi>Authors</hi> have gone upon is naught. Would not any considering Man, when he sees all the <hi>Iudicious Architects</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> fail to erect a firm <hi>Building</hi> upon a <hi>certain Foandation,</hi> seek for another? Therefore who can blame me, if I do? and not blame them, that did not? The meanest: <hi>Bricklayer,</hi> or <hi>Carpenter,</hi> that should be guilty of such <hi>Stupidity,</hi> as to attempt to build upon such a Foundation as always deceiv'd the <hi>Builders,</hi> would be thought too great a <hi>Blockhead</hi> to be employ'd in Building.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I <hi>observed,</hi> That most Men do (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that <hi>Foundation</hi> is agreed upon) think it impossible to explain the int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icate, various, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory <hi>Phenomena's,</hi> and mysterious <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium;</hi> sitting contented, and perswaded, that it operates by an <hi>occult Quality,</hi> wholly unexplicable, and particularly reserved from the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Mankind:</hi> But Nature works <hi>Mechanically</hi> in <hi>Weight, Measure, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore it is more than probable, that it is only their being upon a wrong Bottom makes it seem absolutely <hi>occult;</hi> for it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to find a thing, where it is not; or to build firmly upon an <hi>insufficient Foundation;</hi> whereas had it been right, and true, it is not to be imagined, but some or other would have thereupon done something, that would have stood against all <hi>Winds,</hi> and <hi>Storms;</hi> which none have done.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I <hi>observed,</hi> That none durst venture to lay the <hi>whole,</hi> no; nor one <hi>half</hi> of the Burthen of the <hi>Phinomena's,</hi> or <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> upon that <hi>Foundation;</hi> foreseeing (doubtless) that it could not bear them, and that if they laid any more <hi>Weight</hi> thereon, the whole would totter, and fall to the <hi>Ground.</hi> The <hi>Project</hi> in every <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52480:25"/>
Men of the <hi>Truth</hi> thereof; and the only <hi>way</hi> to do it, is to solve all <hi>Phenomena's</hi> thereby; for if it fails but in one, it is an infallible sign of its <hi>Insufficiency:</hi> There was no Reason to omit any of the <hi>Phenomena's,</hi> if they could have discern'd, that the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> would have born them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as has been intimated) it implies a Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of its <hi>Incompetency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I <hi>observed,</hi> That <hi>ancient Authors</hi> writ of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,</hi> before it came to be of common and general Use in the <hi>Day-time</hi> with Healthy Persons, (as it since is in many <hi>Nations</hi>) to cause a <hi>gay, pleasant,</hi> and <hi>good Humour, take off Sadness, Melancholy,</hi> and <hi>Anxiety;</hi> To <hi>cause Assurance, Boldness, Courage, Bravery, Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Euphory,</hi> or <hi>easie undergoing</hi> of <hi>Labour, Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; Promptitude in Business, Expediteness,</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity;</hi> To <hi>excite to Venery, &amp;c.</hi> Which Effects cannot be explained by that <hi>Supposition of disabling the Spirits,</hi> and that they used <hi>Opium</hi> only Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinally for the sake of such other <hi>Effects</hi> as might be tollerably well explicated by that <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> so that they had not any <hi>Occasion,</hi> nor <hi>Inducement</hi> to look any farther.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Effects</hi> they gave it for was only; 1. <hi>To cause Sleep.</hi> 2. <hi>To take off Pain.</hi> 3. <hi>To stop Fluxes.</hi> 4. <hi>To Compose the Spirits.</hi> 5. <hi>To cause Perspiration, and Sweat.</hi> All which are not inconsistent with the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>diminishing or disabling the Spirits,</hi> as the <hi>other</hi> are, and therefore might well deceive them; For,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Sleep</hi> is caused by <hi>diminishing the Spirits by Labour, Watching, &amp;c.</hi> as is most notorious over the <hi>whole World;</hi> so other Things that diminish the Spirits, as <hi>Bleeding, Vomiting, Purging,</hi> and many other Causes of <hi>diminishing</hi> thereof, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to <hi>Sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:52480:25"/>Secondly, <hi>Indolence,</hi> or <hi>Exemption from Pain,</hi> is caused by nothing more than <hi>want of Spirits,</hi> as in <hi>Paralytical Cases, Stupor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Obstructions,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> of the <hi>Nerves, Syncopes, Leipothymies, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquiums, Faintings</hi> after <hi>Bleeding,</hi> and <hi>Sleep;</hi> which (as was said) is so much caused by <hi>loss</hi> of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Fluxes are stopt, or moderated,</hi> by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than <hi>Sleep,</hi> which generally (as was said) proceeds from <hi>loss of Spirits;</hi> What also <hi>stops,</hi> or <hi>moderates Fluxes,</hi> more than want of the Sense of the Irritation of <hi>Humours?</hi> And what takes away Sense more than want of Spirits? Thus want of Sense by the absence of the Spirits, in <hi>Paralytical Intestines,</hi> stops <hi>Fluxes;</hi> Thus fails a <hi>Paralytical Bladder</hi> to express the <hi>Urine.</hi> So a <hi>Palsie</hi> of the <hi>Membranes,</hi> that include the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, must (as in <hi>Sleep,</hi> which relaxes them) stop, or moderate all <hi>Defluxions, Catarrhs, &amp;c.</hi> because they are not sensible o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Irritation</hi> of the <hi>Humour</hi> by Quantity, or Quality; which <hi>Irritation</hi> causes the <hi>Defluxions</hi> or <hi>Catarrhs,</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the <hi>Membranes,</hi> to contract, and thereby to squeeze out the <hi>Humours</hi> contain'd in the <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Composure of the Spirits</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured mainly by <hi>Sleep,</hi> which all loss of Spirits (as was shewn) inclines us to; so <hi>Bleeding,</hi> which <hi>diminishes the Spirits,</hi> compose their Fury in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Deliriums, Madness, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Perspiration</hi> is caused by nothing more than <hi>Sleep;</hi> for we perspire twice as much in <hi>Sleep,</hi> as when we watch, as is most manifestly demonstrable by the <hi>Statick Experiments</hi> of Weighing People; nor is <hi>Perspiration</hi> ever so great as in <hi>Deliquiums, Syncopes, Leipothymies,</hi> and such like deadish Cases, which are caused by <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing, or disabling of the Spirits,</hi> nay, 'tis so in

               <hi>Animals,</hi> quite dead for a little time while they are hot, as is evident by like <hi>Statick Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> The true Cause of which is <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Pores, Skin, &amp;c.</hi> for want of Spirits to <hi>contract,</hi> and <hi>constringe</hi> them; as shall be fully proved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after (by <hi>God's Help.</hi>)</p>
            <p>These Things were (doubtless) the occasion of that <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> of <hi>diminishing or disabling the Spirits by Opium;</hi> but how likely are they to err by establishing it without any consideration of its <hi>enlivening, encouraging,</hi> and <hi>brisk Effects,</hi> as <hi>Ova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirits, Gaity, Bravery, Magnanimity, Euphory, Promptitude to Venery, &amp;c.</hi> which can never be solved by <hi>Diminution, or Disability of the Spirits,</hi> till <hi>Depression</hi> and <hi>Elevation</hi> thereof are <hi>reconcilable,</hi> and <hi>consistent</hi> at the <hi>same time</hi> in the <hi>same subject;</hi> which can never be till <hi>Disabling</hi> and <hi>Not Disabling</hi> are the same thing? Have not we then <hi>good Reason</hi> to suspect that <hi>general Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>diminishing or disabling the Spirits by Opium,</hi> which was laid by such as never considered any thing of its <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>sprightly Effects,</hi> which (as has been shewn) are its <hi>constant,</hi> and therefore most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>genuine Effects?</hi> Who can doubt then but they must err, in laying a <hi>Foundation</hi> quite contrary to the very <hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>Opium?</hi>

            <p n="5">5.

            </p>
            <p n="6">6. I <hi>observed,</hi> That those <hi>brisk Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> were not taken notice of by our <hi>Physicians,</hi> nor indeed, (all things considered) do I well see how they should, without getting out of the common <hi>Road</hi> of observing, which is sometimes (as I have found) very useful upon such Occasions. For,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Opium</hi> is seldom (if ever) given in these <hi>Western Nations,</hi> but to Sick People, (as the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> did) who are utterly incapable of those
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52480:27"/>
               <hi>brisk Effects,</hi> or (at least) to any remarkable <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> that might call for a particular or special <hi>Advertency,</hi> or <hi>Atten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion;</hi> without which, they passed off as they came, without any <hi>Reflection</hi> thereupon; and so signified nothing, as if they had never happen'd.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We (as the <hi>Ancients</hi> did) generally give <hi>Opium</hi> when People are going to <hi>Bed,</hi> by which means all Opportunity of <hi>Observation</hi> is lost; because <hi>darkness,</hi> and being alone, hide, or hinder the shewing of any such <hi>Effects;</hi> and the <hi>Physician</hi> (whose only Business it is to be more curious in such Matters) is gone to his own <hi>Rest,</hi> tho', if he were present, not likely to take any <hi>Observations</hi> of such Matters, whereof he has least <hi>Thoughts,</hi> or <hi>Belief,</hi> as being, in his <hi>Opinion,</hi> contrary to all <hi>Reason, Sense, Experience,</hi> and the <hi>Opinion</hi> of all <hi>Authors,</hi> of the Stupefactive Quality of <hi>Opium,</hi> in which they all agree.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Opium</hi> is (as was said) given in these Countreys to cause <hi>Sleep,</hi> or such <hi>Effects</hi> to which <hi>Sleep</hi> conduces, as <hi>composing the Spirits, causing Indolence, stopping Fluxes,</hi> and <hi>promoting Perspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and therefore always given with all careful <hi>Directions,</hi> and <hi>Injunctions,</hi> that may conduce to that <hi>End,</hi> as <hi>going to Bed, lying still, putting out Lights, keeping Silence, &amp;c.</hi> which concurring with the <hi>Opium,</hi> cause <hi>Sleep,</hi> which is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with shewing any of those lively <hi>Effects,</hi> that belong only to a <hi>waking Person</hi> to do; so that all Opportunity of Observation is utterly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>Now, (all the Premises considered) it cannot be conceiv'd, that such as set their mind upon <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Effects,</hi> and expect no other, much less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ones, (against which also they are highly prejudiced by their <hi>Reason, Experience,</hi> and <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52480:27"/>
should observe such <hi>brisk Effects,</hi> if they did happen; and how can a <hi>brisk Humour, Courage, easie undergoing</hi> of <hi>Labour, Promptitude to Venus, &amp;c.</hi> be observed in Sick, and Infirm <hi>People,</hi> lying in Bed, alone, and in the <hi>dark,</hi> or (which renders it utterly impossible) while they are asleep, and the Thing it self disbelieved, and esteem'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Common Sense,</hi> and the <hi>Universal Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the Learned, and all others. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p n="7">7. If (after all) any such <hi>brisk Effect</hi> did ever happen, it must be either not regarded, or if observed, (which is no <hi>way</hi> likely, as was shewn) you may be sure (for the many plain <hi>Reasons,</hi> and Causes aforesaid) that it was not imputed to <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifying Opium,</hi> (as all esteem it) but to any other <hi>Cause,</hi> or Accident, rather than to a Thing well known to have quite <hi>contrary Effects.</hi> For <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Sick Person happen'd to be <hi>good humour'd,</hi> (of which he is seldom capable, and utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of all or most of the other brisk <hi>Effects,</hi> as <hi>Euphory, Promptitude to Venus, Exertion of Courage, &amp;c.</hi>) it was either passed by as an ordinary Thing of Course, and so not heeded, or else imputed to <hi>Refreshment</hi> by <hi>Sleep, Ease</hi> from Pain, or some <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment</hi> as to the Disease; or, indeed, to any Thing, rather than <hi>Dispiriting</hi> and <hi>Stupifying Opium,</hi> that is so far (in all Opinion) from exciting the Spirits, that all affirm, conclude, and agree, that it <hi>diminishes or disables them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like is to be said of any of the <hi>lively Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi> in case they happen, and are observ'd; Tho' I do not see how they can, so (at least) as any <hi>Stander by</hi> will refer it to <hi>Opium;</hi> besides, that as to some of the <hi>brisk Effects,</hi> (especially that of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52480:28"/>
               <hi>Venery</hi>) greater <hi>Doses</hi> are requisite, to render it any thing remarkable, than are used in these <hi>Western Parts,</hi> and that <hi>Modesty</hi> would much hinder the <hi>discovery</hi> of this <hi>Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not <hi>therefore</hi> very manifest, that I had great cause to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>suspect, that both <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Physicians</hi> consider'd things by <hi>halves,</hi> since they did not take the most <hi>genuine Properties</hi> into their Consideration, and that they laid their <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> upon the most <hi>contrary Effects</hi> to them? It follows then, That the <hi>general Supposition</hi> of all the Learned can no more solve the true <hi>Properties of Opium</hi> in any Probability, than giving the Reason why Fire <hi>hardens Clay</hi> can explain why it <hi>softens Wax;</hi> The <hi>Reason,</hi> did I say! I should have said, than giving the <hi>wrong Reason</hi> why it <hi>hardens Clay,</hi> shews how it <hi>softens Wax;</hi> for it will appear in the following <hi>Chapters,</hi> that they gave no <hi>right Reason</hi> for any <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> even those they ever allow'd to be its <hi>Effects;</hi> nor laid any <hi>true Foundation</hi> to explain the least, meanest and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Effect</hi> thereof; forasmuch as all their <hi>Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> are so false, that there never were any such <hi>Things</hi> as they lay down to explain the Effects of <hi>Opium,</hi> viz.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> It is proved, That <hi>Opium</hi> has no Cold Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to diminish or disable the Spirits thereby.</head>
            <p>HAving shewn just Causes of my <hi>Suspicion</hi> of that Universal <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Opium's Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing or Disabling the Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I will now proceed to a more strict <hi>Examination</hi> thereof, beginning with the <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> who affirm'd,</p>
            <q>That <hi>Opium</hi> diminished or disabled the Spirits by an extream Cold Quality.</q>
            <p>I confess that much may be done towards the <hi>diminishing, or disabling the Spirits by Opium,</hi> if it had such a <hi>cold Quality</hi> as the <hi>Ancients</hi> attributed to it; for then it must be such a <hi>Coldness,</hi> as the coldest Things either <hi>actual,</hi> or <hi>potential,</hi> bore no <hi>Proportion</hi> to; for <hi>Ice, Snow, &amp;c.</hi> bear no Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, in causing the same Effects by a <hi>cold Quality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the manner of the <hi>Ancients</hi> implicitly to believe, and subscribe to what their great <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi> in <hi>Physick,</hi> or <hi>Philosophy,</hi> taught them; whom they adored as infallible <hi>Gods,</hi> as soon as their <hi>Mortality</hi> proved the contrary; which was as absurd, as asserting, Tha <hi>Opium,</hi> which is one of the hotest Things that Vegetables afford, is <hi>extream cold;</hi> (blessed be <hi>God</hi> for our <hi>Light</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> in <hi>Philosophy!</hi>) There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some such admir'd <hi>Authors,</hi> or <hi>great Masters</hi> in <hi>Physick,</hi> having asserted, that <hi>Opium</hi> acted by an
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52480:29"/>
               <hi>extream cold Quality,</hi> all did implicitly subscribe to it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Devil,</hi> whom they worship'd, could not (tho' <hi>a Deceiver from the Beginning</hi>) impose more upon their <hi>Faith,</hi> than in causing them (for I cannot think but it was some such <hi>Evil Power</hi>) to believe, that <hi>Opium</hi> was <hi>cold,</hi> against all the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Experience;</hi> he might have as well told them, that <hi>Hell Fire</hi> had all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of common <hi>culinary Fire,</hi> and yet nothing more refreshing by its <hi>cold Quality;</hi> for as many of our <hi>Senses,</hi> as can take notice of <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> do plainly inform us, that it is very hot in it self, and <hi>Effects.</hi> For,</p>

            <p>Besides, this <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Coldness of Opium</hi> is very much exploded, and, indeed, it is so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>absurd,</hi> that I should not have thought it worth while to argue against it, but that it lay so in my <hi>way,</hi> that regularly I could not well avoid it, without <hi>Breach</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might have added, that it <hi>resolves, attenuates, &amp;c.</hi> but it is needless to say any more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52480:31"/>It is very <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>erroneous,</hi> that it <hi>stops Fluxes</hi> by <hi>incrassating,</hi> and <hi>binding,</hi> which are accounted <hi>cold Qualities;</hi> if so, how should it stop them when Pounds of <hi>Incrassatives</hi> and <hi>Binders</hi> have failed, tho' the <hi>Opium</hi> was given only in the <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of a <hi>Grain</hi> or <hi>Two?</hi> How should it stop, or moderate <hi>Fluxes,</hi> even while it is yet at Stomach, as it most certainly does? It bears (as <hi>Etmuller</hi> well observes) no Proportion to the <hi>Bloud,</hi> and Humours, to have any <hi>Effect</hi> that may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable upon them, for a Grain is but as 1 to 115200 to the Blood of him that has 20 Pound of Blood, which an ordinary Man has: Besides, How can <hi>Altenuatives, Resolvers,</hi> and <hi>Discussers,</hi> incrassate or bind? But, more especially, How can so great a <hi>Relaxer</hi> of Parts, be a Constringer thereof? That is <hi>perfect Contradiction:</hi> And how can a meer <hi>Sal Volatile Oleosum,</hi> in which all its <hi>Vertue</hi> lies, (as will plainly appear) thicken and bind?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Truth</hi> is, that it <hi>stops Fluxes</hi> (as Sleep doth) by taking away the sense of the <hi>Irritation</hi> of <hi>Humours,</hi> which solicite the Parts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and so to extrude and squeese them out; it <hi>promotes Perspiration</hi> by relaxing the <hi>Pores</hi> (as <hi>Sleep</hi> doth;) it also seems to thicken <hi>Rheum,</hi> (as <hi>Sleep</hi> doth) because it causing <hi>Sleep,</hi> or (at least) taking away a sense of the Irritation of the <hi>Rheum,</hi> is thereby suffered to stay till it thickens by the <hi>Heat</hi> of the Body; the <hi>Irritation</hi> also at <hi>Windpipe</hi> being less, because the <hi>Flux</hi> of the <hi>Rheum</hi> is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated for the <hi>Reason</hi> aforesaid.

            <p>THO' the <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Cold</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> is much exploded, that of <hi>Fumes, Vapours,</hi> or <hi>Aura's,</hi> arising from the <hi>Opium</hi> at Stomach, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up to the Brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is as much received and embraced; I know none, but such as think it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary, considering that it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and allow'd by all observing Men, That <hi>Opium</hi> produces all, or most of its <hi>Effects,</hi> while it is at <hi>Stomach;</hi> That the <hi>Genus Nerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52480:32"/>
were) of ever explicating the various <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> by that means, as will manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>I confess, that if <hi>Opium</hi> operated by such <hi>Fumes</hi> passing from the <hi>Stomach</hi> to the <hi>Brain, &amp;c.</hi> it would be easie to conceive how it should <hi>diminish,</hi> or <hi>disable,</hi> nay, utterly ruine the <hi>animal Spirits;</hi> and indeed impossible rationally to conceive how they could do otherwise: But then the <hi>enlivening, invigorating,</hi> and <hi>encouraging Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> which are its <hi>constant</hi> and most <hi>genuine Off spring,</hi> would lie upon our <hi>hands,</hi> without any possibility of giving an account thereof; for certainly dull, heavy, unnatural, undigested, and cloudy <hi>Fumes,</hi> or <hi>Vapours,</hi> could not advantage the <hi>animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> cause a <hi>Triumph,</hi> or <hi>Ovation,</hi> thereof, at their <hi>access, Courage, Serenity, Promptitude, Magnanimity, Euphory, Inclination to Venery, &amp;c.</hi> which we are most obliged to regard, as being its most <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>proper Effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Moderns</hi> does presume, or suppose, (for they prove nothing)</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That Fumes, or Vapours, do readily and freely pass from the Stomach to the Brain,</hi> because the gross <hi>Fumes</hi> (as they call them) of a <hi>Grain</hi> or two of <hi>Opium,</hi> always operate before it is out of the <hi>Stomach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they never saw such <hi>Fumes</hi> pass, nor their <hi>Passage,</hi> only <hi>suppose</hi> both; and that meerly upon an <hi>Imagination</hi> that it must be so, because they (<hi>forsooth</hi>) cannot conceive any other <hi>way</hi> by which <hi>Opium</hi> can affect the <hi>Head, Nerves, &amp;c.</hi> while it is at <hi>Stomach;</hi> whereas I can, and shall (<hi>God willing</hi>) shew them another means, or <hi>way,</hi> to do it, that is <hi>sensible,</hi> and not wholly <hi>precarious,</hi> as theirs is, and that in the meanest manner; because all their <hi>Grounds</hi> to suppose it, is their <hi>Inability</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:52480:32"/>
or <hi>apprehend,</hi> what is (as I shall shew) very <hi>sensible,</hi> nay <hi>obvious</hi> also.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>They suppose, That such Fumes will serve to solve all the Phoenomena's and Operations of Opium;</hi> whereas it is utterly impossible they should solve the <hi>enlivening</hi> and <hi>invigorating Effects</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, (as has been shewn, and shall be further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if God permits.)</p>
            <p>It were easie to evidence, but that it would be tedious and needless, (for their Incompetency to solve the most proper <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> is more than enough) that such <hi>Fumes,</hi> or <hi>Vapours,</hi> can truly solve no <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> unless it be that of <hi>Death,</hi> or some <hi>deadly Symptoms;</hi> nay, they will not solve the most likely to be caused by <hi>Vapours, viz. Sleep,</hi> which all Men (as <hi>Wedelius</hi> says) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to be the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Fumes,</hi> or <hi>Vapours,</hi> (in his <hi>Opiologia, c.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 35.) <q>Somnum naturalem <hi>(says he)</hi> omnes concedunt producere suaviores, &amp; blandas <gap reason="foreign">

               </q> Which is most certainly false; tho' I very much doubt, that this groundless <hi>Presumption,</hi> which (as he intimates) all embrace, has been a great cause of this <hi>airy Imagination</hi> of <hi>Fumes</hi> in the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Opium;</hi> because Men looked upon <hi>Sleep</hi> (agreed upon to be caused by <hi>Fumes</hi>) to be the <hi>prime, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and <hi>most proper Effect</hi> of <hi>Opium;</hi> which is also <hi>false,</hi> it being but a <hi>meer Accident,</hi> (as has been shown) and when it happens, generally requires <hi>lying,</hi> or <hi>sitting still,</hi> to assist it; whereas the <hi>Watching,</hi> that is the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> requires no <hi>help,</hi> and cannot be put off (as Sleep can, by <hi>Motion, Action, &amp;c.</hi>) notwithstanding all <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> to the contrary. Now I would know of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52480:33"/>
any Man, which is the most proper and natural <hi>Effect</hi> of any <hi>Cause,</hi> That which nothing can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or that which every <hi>Action</hi> can? But I run too far upon this matter, which belongs more aptly to that part of this <hi>Book,</hi> that explains all the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium;</hi> and so must return to that of <hi>Fumes,</hi> which do not cause <hi>natural Sleep,</hi> as manifestly appears,</p>
            <p>1. Because that which causes <hi>natural Sleep,</hi> must, in all Reason, (as it is always in the wise Work of <hi>Nature</hi>) bear a <hi>Proportion</hi> thereto; but <hi>Fumes</hi> (supposing their <hi>Being</hi>) bear no <hi>Proportion</hi> to our <hi>Sleep.</hi> Certainly a working <hi>Labourer,</hi> that toils all the <hi>Day,</hi> must spend the <hi>Fumes</hi> of his Body in the highest <hi>degree;</hi> and feeding upon dry <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Cheese,</hi> must breed fewest <hi>Fumes;</hi> yet none sleeps better or sweeter than he. The like is to be said of a <hi>travelling</hi> Man, a tired Person, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who often fall asleep before they eat or drink to renew their <hi>Fumes,</hi> which they had spent in an extraordinary manner. Why <hi>Sleep,</hi> that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for <hi>Refreshment</hi> and <hi>Recruit,</hi> should depend upon <hi>Fumes,</hi> no Man can tell; for then our <hi>Refreshment</hi> would wholly depend thereon, and no Man have any <hi>Recruit</hi> by <hi>Sleep,</hi> but in <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> thereunto. Who dares accuse our <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Good Maker</hi> of such Contrivances, who in <hi>Nature</hi> always proportions Things to the <hi>Exigencies</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? and therefore <hi>Sleep</hi> not to <hi>Fumes,</hi> but to that which was impair'd in us for <hi>want</hi> thereof; which is always contriv'd by <hi>Wise Nature</hi> (if you'll ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it) to be the prompting <hi>Cause</hi> to the <hi>Recruit;</hi> and then <hi>Proportion</hi> is duly observ'd, because we are prompted exactly according to the <hi>Exigence</hi> or <hi>Necessity of Nature,</hi> as becomes the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of our <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>Preserver.</hi> This <hi>Rule</hi> (if duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to) will easily, speedily, and certainly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52480:33"/>
lead you to the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the true <hi>natural Causes</hi> of <hi>Hunger, Thirst, Inclination to Sleep,</hi> and all such <hi>Calls</hi> for <hi>Restauration.</hi> All which I could soon satisfie you in, but that it is not my <hi>Business</hi> at present, and that it will too much anticipate my designed <hi>Tract</hi> of <hi>Animal Mechanism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor doth <hi>Labour</hi> it self bear any <hi>exact Proportion</hi> thereunto, because many healthy People, that are idle all <hi>day,</hi> sleep long, soundly, and sweetly, every night, as well as <hi>Labourers:</hi> So that (in short) it must be somewhat that belongs to <hi>Watching</hi> as such; for <hi>Sleep</hi> generally bears the best <hi>Proportion</hi> to <hi>Watching.</hi> If we <hi>watch</hi> much, or little, our Sleep bears some <hi>Proportion</hi> thereto; tho' there may be in this, as well as in <hi>Hunger, Thirst, &amp;c. Accidents,</hi> that cause the <hi>Promptitude</hi> to be <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> and so vary the true <hi>natural Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> all which have the Nature of <hi>Diseases,</hi> as <hi>canine Appetites, Coma's, Caros, preternatural Thrists, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What it is that <hi>Watching</hi> causes to prompt us to <hi>Sleep,</hi> must be some Impair made thereby as such, and not the foolish Conceit of <hi>Fumes:</hi> And it were easie for me to illustrate what it is, but that it will require some Sheets of <hi>Paper,</hi> and (as I said before) anticipate my <hi>Discourse</hi> of <hi>Animal Mechanism,</hi> which I hoped to have published be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this <hi>Book,</hi> and would have been most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, because the <hi>Principles</hi> therein stated may serve to explain the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium;</hi> but that the <hi>want</hi> of a few <hi>Experiments</hi> has (to my Grief) hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto delay'd it; and therefore I must be put to much Trouble in this Work for want thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am resolved not to spare my self, in order to satisfie the <hi>Reader</hi> in this great and unexplicated <hi>Mystery.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:52480:34"/>2. If <hi>Vapours</hi> were the cause of <hi>natural Sleep,</hi> it is impossible that the <hi>prick</hi> of a <hi>Pin,</hi> or a <hi>sharp Sound,</hi> &amp;c. should awake one ten or twenty times in an <hi>Hour;</hi> for <hi>either</hi> the <hi>Prick</hi> must in an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> discuss all the <hi>Fumes</hi> in being, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be imagined, and they as often return to cause <hi>Sleep</hi> again; <hi>or</hi> intercept their Motion from the <hi>Stomach</hi> to the <hi>Head,</hi> which no Man can have any Conception of the Efficacy of the <hi>Pin,</hi> or <hi>Sound,</hi> so to do: <hi>Or</hi> they must both <hi>discuss</hi> and <hi>intercept</hi> the <hi>Fumes,</hi> (which indeed if the case were such, would be necessary to make a clear <hi>Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi>) which is yet far more unconceivable. What <hi>paltry Trifles</hi> does the <hi>World</hi> embrace, instead of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reason!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Several Persons (whereof I am one) do awake in a minute or two after they first fall asleep in Bed at <hi>night;</hi> which would be absolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, if <hi>Fumes</hi> caused <hi>Sleep;</hi> for the <hi>Fumes</hi> would increase <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more,</hi> and make one <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more remote</hi> from waking.</p>
            <p>4. Why should <hi>warm Baths, Fomentations, Feet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>washes, Head-washes, warm moist Weather,</hi> the <hi>Act of Venery,</hi> the <hi>Pleasure of sweet Melody, gentle rubbing of the Head</hi> in a pleasant manner, <hi>scratching the Back</hi> where it itches, and all gentle <hi>Pleasures</hi> that are consistent with <hi>lying,</hi> or <hi>sitting</hi> still, which do all cause a very free Perspiration of <hi>Fumes</hi> at the <hi>Pores,</hi> (that are then most certainly opened by all those Causes, as may be proved by statick Demonstration, Magnifying Glasses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) cause Sleep, seeing they all cause a spending of the <hi>Fumes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Some half-witted, unthinking <hi>Caviller</hi> may say, That such Things stir up the <hi>Vapours, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52480:34"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What such mean by <hi>Vapours</hi> stirr'd, is not easily determinable; but this I know, that all stir of <hi>Humours,</hi> or any other thing, hinders <hi>Sleep;</hi> and that the longer such Causes of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Pores,</hi> and consequently of perspiring <hi>Fumes</hi> do last, the more we are inclin'd by them to <hi>Sleep;</hi> so that the more our <hi>Fumes</hi> have been spent, the more we are inclined to <hi>sleep;</hi> which is a strange <hi>Contradiction,</hi> if <hi>Fumes</hi> be the cause of <hi>Sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can but smile to think how most Physicians come to call several things <hi>Vapours:</hi> First, they say, that <hi>Sleep</hi> is from <hi>Vapours;</hi> then call every thing <hi>Vapours</hi> (<hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi>) that inclines us to sleep, by reason of that false <hi>Supposition:</hi> How then comes <hi>Camphire</hi> not to be a great Causer of Sleep, that is so apt to evaporate?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Fear, Sorrow, Grief, Melancholy, Depression of Spirits, Cold,</hi> &amp;c. do most certainly close the <hi>Pores,</hi> (as appears by <hi>statick Experiments</hi>) by which means <hi>Vapours</hi> are much crowded in the <hi>Body;</hi> yet all such <hi>Grievances</hi> do hinder <hi>Sleep,</hi> as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so do the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not proceed from <hi>Fumes,</hi> as the <hi>World</hi> imagines; for then these things that crowd in the <hi>Fumes</hi> and <hi>Vapours,</hi> would promote, not hinder <hi>Sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. If <hi>Fumes</hi> are the <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>Sleep,</hi> then are the cause of <hi>Sleep</hi> and <hi>Vertigo's</hi> (as the <hi>Vaporanians allow</hi>) the same, it follows then that we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>sleep</hi> without a <hi>Vertigo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Many (as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> says) eat their <hi>Meat,</hi> take their <hi>Drink,</hi> &amp;c. as other People, yet do not <hi>sleep</hi> at all for many <hi>Weeks</hi> together; which were impossible, if the <hi>Fumes</hi> of <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> caused <hi>Sleep;</hi> for they, by <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:52480:35"/>
must have those <hi>Fumes,</hi> and consequently <hi>Sleep,</hi> as other People, if that were true.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>They suppose and take it for granted,</hi> (which I do not, for I know the contrary) <hi>That</hi> Opium, <hi>while it is at Stomach, can affect the Brain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>no other way but by Fumes;</hi> which is a most groundless Supposition: For,</p>

Chapters</hi> will shew you at large: Therefore I shall say no more of this at <hi>present,</hi> for it is fit for us <hi>first</hi> to overthrow that <hi>Supposition of Fumes and Vapours,</hi> before we establish our own. For farther <hi>Satisfaction</hi> then, as to that <hi>general Supposition</hi> of <hi>Fumes,</hi> let us duly and fully consider Things; for it is not a slight matter to proceed against a <hi>General Opinion,</hi> that has continued through all <hi>Ages,</hi> or to wipe off the <hi>Prejudices</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired thereby. <hi>Observe,</hi>

                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52480:36"/>And if you'll duly consider the <hi>Organs</hi> of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that are near the <hi>Brain,</hi> you'll find that they are contrived as <hi>Shutters,</hi> to exclude all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous Particles from the <hi>Brain;</hi> for <hi>Impulses</hi> might have been contrived without their <hi>Interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> because they do not alter or improve the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses</hi> received from Objects; for if they did, we should not have true notice of Things: And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they do not alter, or improve the <hi>Impulses,</hi> of what <hi>Use</hi> should they be but to exclude extraneous <hi>Particles, Eumes, Effluvia's,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>instance:</hi> The <hi>tremulous Motion</hi> of the <hi>Air;</hi> in the case of <hi>Sound,</hi> would have as truly hit the <hi>Auditory Nerve,</hi> or <hi>Membrane,</hi> without the <hi>Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan;</hi> and very often much truer without it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the several <hi>Faults</hi> and <hi>Disorders</hi> that it is liable to: Yet so necessary was it thought by the best of <hi>Iudges,</hi> who cannot err, that it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be placed there, with all its Inconveniences that might follow, than any way expose the <hi>Brain,</hi> though to the most gentle of Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Air,</hi> by which (in all probability) the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> themselves are nourished, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained.</p>
                     <p>Were it not that extraneous Particles, or <hi>Air,</hi> would offend the <hi>Brain,</hi> What need is there of the <hi>Tympan,</hi> when we know as well by Experience, as by the aforesaid <hi>Reasons,</hi> that a <hi>Dog,</hi> &amp;c. can hear as well without it, upon the first taking it off, but that the Hearing will afterward decay, because the <hi>Brain,</hi> &amp;c. being exposed, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured?</p>
                     <p>What is evident in the case of the <hi>Ear,</hi> may be made so as to the <hi>Nose</hi> and <hi>Eyes;</hi> for though some of my <hi>Readers</hi> may not easily conceive it, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of Things might have been conveyed by <hi>Reflections</hi> and <hi>Refractions</hi> of Light, without

excluding the <hi>Air,</hi> but that it was more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and safe for the <hi>Brain,</hi> and <hi>Optick Nerve,</hi> (which is much the same matter with the <hi>Brain,</hi> and a Production thereof) that the <hi>Air</hi> should be excluded.</p>

This may be most manifestly illustrated by some <hi>hot Brandy,</hi> or indeed any hot Liquid put into a porous Dish set upon one's <hi>Hand,</hi> which presently warms it; but if the Liquid be tinged with any thing, that <hi>Tincture</hi> will not reach the Hand, till the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which is its <hi>Vehicle,</hi> soaks through, which may be in an <hi>Hour (more</hi> or <hi>less</hi>) according to the Porosity of the <hi>Wood,</hi> which Tincture is to be compared to the <hi>Purgative</hi> at <hi>Stomach.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XI. Opium</hi> does not diminish or disable the Spirits by any means whatsoever.</head>
            <p>HAving sufficiently demonstrated, that <hi>Opium</hi> cannot <hi>diminish</hi> or <hi>disable the Spirits</hi> by the <hi>cold Quality</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> or <hi>Fumes</hi> of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns,</hi> and that neither of them have as much as any <hi>Being;</hi> I shall now add, that <hi>Opium</hi> does not <hi>diminish, or disable the Spirits by any other means whatsoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not be mistaken, when I say, That <hi>Opium</hi> does not <hi>diminish,</hi> or <hi>disable the Spirits</hi> by any means, (for there is nothing so good in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> but will do it, if used unduely, or immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, as <hi>Wine, Bread, Milk, Honey, Sugar, Beer, &amp;c.</hi> in excess) for I intend, that it does not do it when <hi>duely</hi> and <hi>moderately</hi> used.</p>
            <p>1. That which refreshes the Wearied, and highly prevents <hi>Weariness,</hi> must add to, or excite the Spirits, which is directly contrary to <hi>diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or <hi>disabling</hi> them; but <hi>Opium</hi> does in a most eminent manner refresh the Wearied, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Weariness,</hi> therefore it does not diminish, or disable the <hi>Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some have been so silly, and inadvertent, as to object, that it refresh'd the Weary only by <hi>Sleep;</hi> It is <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> that it refreshes them whether they <hi>Sleep,</hi> or no, and that without fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as often as it is used in that Case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:52480:45"/>Others (that were no Wiser) have said, that it only took off the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Weariness</hi> by stupify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which happened by the <hi>diminishing,</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits.</hi> Bare Insensibleness cannot enable the Spirits to <hi>Labour</hi> with eminent <hi>Briskness</hi> and <hi>Alacrity,</hi> as Men most certainly do after <hi>Opium</hi> is taken, being finely <hi>enlivened,</hi> and <hi>invigorated,</hi> as with <hi>generous Wine;</hi> if they do not know this to be true, let them for shame hold their <hi>Tongues,</hi> till they know <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> which if they will not, they proclaim themselves to be <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>impertinent Babblers;</hi> but if they will patiently and wisely abstain arguing, till they are satisfied as to <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> then will they be past <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Hypothesis</hi> in that Case; for they will have sensible and certain <hi>Knowledge of the contrary,</hi> and the Truth of what I say; which will end all <hi>Controversy,</hi> and <hi>precarious Squabbles</hi> upon false <hi>Suppositions,</hi> (as the manner is) that cannot lead them to what is Right, but by meer chance, and never to a true <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that they are in the Right, which makes it none in effect; for they can do nothing with <hi>Assurance,</hi> but only suppose, and hope they are in the <hi>Right,</hi> when they are as much out (to their Patient's sorrow) as <hi>Physicians</hi> have been in the <hi>cold Quality,</hi> and <hi>Fumes of</hi> Opium.</p>
            <p>It is true, that a <hi>Grain</hi> (or Two) of <hi>Opium,</hi> will, if a Man composes himself, <hi>sitting,</hi> or <hi>lying still,</hi> cause a <hi>Sleepiness,</hi> equal to that caused by spending the <hi>Spirits</hi> by a <hi>Day's Labour;</hi> but spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Spirits</hi> is not the only, no, nor best <hi>proportioned,</hi> or more <hi>adequate</hi> cause thereof, (as I have shewn:) If loss of Spirit were the adequate cause of <hi>Sleep,</hi> how should good and generous Wine cause <hi>Sleepiness</hi> after that eminent Rate as it does in most People? How should the most

pleasing Musick incline such as <hi>lie,</hi> or sit <hi>still,</hi> to sleep? but if one Dances thereto, it makes him more lively and brisk than ordinary. The like exactly do <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Opium,</hi> if Men <hi>lie,</hi> or <hi>sit still;</hi> but otherwise, they make them much more brisk and lively, and able to undergo <hi>Labour, Action, &amp;c.</hi> Which <hi>Note,</hi> that you may not any more wonder, that <hi>Enliveners</hi> and <hi>Exciters</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> do cause <hi>Sleep,</hi> as well as <hi>Diminishers</hi> thereof; and observe, that they are all pleasing things, as <hi>Musick, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Opium,</hi> which cause <hi>Pleasant Dreams, Pleasant Watchings, Pleasant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours &amp;c.</hi> Expect more of this Matter in the <hi>following Chapters,</hi> and all by <hi>degrees,</hi> according as I Judge the prejudiced <hi>World</hi> will bear Things: For a great <hi>Paradox</hi> (how true soever) must not be abruptly obtruded, but <hi>gently,</hi> and <hi>gradually</hi> ushered in by insinuating <hi>Reasonings,</hi> otherwise it will be entertained like a rude <hi>Stranger,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts a <hi>Multitude</hi> in <hi>Fashions</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> that they have always used, and judged to be the very best (however blameable.)</p>
            <p>Consider, that if <hi>Opium diminished</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled the Spirits,</hi> proportionable to the <hi>Sleepiness</hi> that it causes, as a hard <hi>Day's</hi> Labour does, then if <hi>Opium</hi> were given a Man after a hard <hi>Day's</hi> Labour, it would be, as it were, adding another hard <hi>Day's Labour</hi> to cure it, the <hi>Day's Labour</hi> and <hi>Opium</hi> impairing the <hi>Spirits</hi> alike; Think what a miserable Condition the poor Man would be in, especially if Sleep did not make him some amends, it would be such as were utterly intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; but so far is <hi>Opium</hi> from any such <hi>Effect,</hi> that it refreshes him tho' he Sleep; not at all after the hard <hi>Day's Labour,</hi> and not only so, but will enable him to Work all the following Night with great <hi>Alacrity,</hi> if need requires it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:52480:46"/>What a <hi>Condition</hi> would those be in, who take a <hi>Drachm</hi> of it twice a day for 10, 20, or 30 years? Nay, how could any possibly do it for half 10 days, if a <hi>Grain</hi> or Two destroyed the <hi>Spirits</hi> so much, as to cause <hi>Sleepiness</hi> thereby, as <hi>hard Labour</hi> does? Which they must allow, that assert it causes Sleep by <hi>diminishing, or disabling the Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some may say, (tho' very inconsiderately) that it only <hi>disables</hi> them for the <hi>time</hi> of its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; That is strange, indeed, considering that even during that time they are mostly enabled to <hi>Work,</hi> or <hi>Labour,</hi> tho' tired before; and that it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>2. Causes <hi>Comfort, Refreshment, Ovation of the Spirits,</hi> all the <hi>time</hi> of its Operation, as <hi>Wine</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately taken does, especially if People keep themselves in <hi>Action, Labour, &amp;c.</hi> otherwise, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they may fall asleep upon the comfortable <hi>satisfaction, contentation</hi> of Mind, and <hi>acquiescence</hi> of Spirit, that it occasions, as <hi>Wine</hi> does.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>first Effect</hi> that we find of <hi>Opium</hi> (which may therefore probably be a very <hi>leading, funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi> and <hi>significant Effect</hi>) is, that it causes a most <hi>agreeable, pleasant, and charming sensation about the Region of the Stomach;</hi> which if one <hi>lies,</hi> or <hi>sits still,</hi> inclines him to <hi>Sleep,</hi> if not, it makes him <hi>gay, good humour'd, brave, &amp;c.</hi> It is a <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> so sweet, and <hi>delicious,</hi> that tho' I endeavour'd to express it by the <hi>Ovation of the Spirits</hi> upon Joy, a <hi>good Genius</hi> informing a Man, or the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52480:46"/>
of <hi>Waters, &amp;c.</hi> do incline us to <hi>Sleep</hi> by the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> thereof, which lulls and sooths us to it, (as is most certain, if we <hi>sit,</hi> or <hi>lie still</hi>) much more must the high <hi>Charms</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> cause it.</p>
            <p>That it is a <hi>Pleasure</hi> that affects by one of our <hi>Senses,</hi> namely by <hi>Feeling,</hi> is indisputable; for it is not a <hi>Pleasure</hi> of the <hi>Eye, Nose, Tongue,</hi> or <hi>Ear,</hi> and it must be <hi>sensitive,</hi> because caused by <hi>Matter;</hi> and that <hi>Opium</hi> has (doubtless) the like <hi>Effect</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Brutes,</hi> who have no other <hi>Pleasure,</hi> but what is <hi>sensitive;</hi> That it is at <hi>Stomach</hi> is also <hi>evident,</hi> where we can be pleased only by the <hi>Sense of Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> That it is involuntary, and pleases us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will or no, and that the same Particles excite <hi>Venery, Itching, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all the <hi>Senses</hi> (especially <hi>Feeling,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that at <hi>Stomach</hi>) are given us for <hi>Watches,</hi> and <hi>Sentinels,</hi> to discover and give <hi>notice</hi> of what is, or is not <hi>good</hi> and agreeable to our <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Nature;</hi> That upon notice of what is good, and agreeable, <hi>Pleasure, Comfort, Satisfaction, &amp;c.</hi> are conceived; otherwise <hi>Displeasure, Discomfort,</hi> and <hi>Dissatisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>diminishes</hi> or <hi>disables</hi> our Spirits, does us the greatest <hi>Evil</hi> that can be, and consequently <hi>Sensation</hi> would, according to its <hi>Office,</hi> give us such notice thereof as would cause <hi>Displeasure, &amp;c.</hi> otherwise these <hi>Sentinels,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> have appointed for <hi>faithful Notice,</hi> would (instead of trusty service, which is the <hi>End</hi> they are made for) deceive us, and consequently do us mischief, rather than good; which is very Prophane (if not <hi>Blasphemous</hi>) to assert, as being highly abusive of <hi>God's Goodness</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> to make Things in <hi>Nature,</hi> that would not only not answer, but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52480:47"/>
act quite contrary to their <hi>Ends;</hi> it follows then, that what causes such a mighty agreeable, and pleasant <hi>Sensation</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> which is the greatest, and most accurate Judge of what is, or is not agreeable to the <hi>Animal,</hi> cannot be destructive, or disabling of its <hi>Spirits,</hi> which are the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and useful Things, that belong thereto; Therefore <hi>Opium,</hi> which so mightily recommends it self to, pleases, and comforts the greatest <hi>Iudge</hi> that <hi>God</hi> has given to a sensible Creature to discern what is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> for it, cannot <hi>diminish or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able our Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One may say, (what I dare not) that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation at <hi>Stomach</hi> may deceive us.</p>
            <p>We may deceive our selves, and say so, when that which pleases the <hi>Stomach,</hi> does not please our perverted <hi>Imagination,</hi> which makes no <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;</hi> let us therefore consider Things where there is no such vain <hi>Imagination</hi> to contradict the good <hi>Ends</hi> of Nature; if the Stomach and Senses in a <hi>Brute</hi> or meer Animal, which has no other means to Judge of what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> for it, should not Judge aright, all the Animals in the whole World would soon perish. It is the vain Opinion of Men that perswades them that Things are <hi>cold,</hi> when <hi>hot, &amp;c.</hi> as in the Case of <hi>Opium,</hi> when the Senses truely inform that it is <hi>hot;</hi> If you'll stand to your <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and <hi>Suppositions,</hi> (for such all must be without the <hi>Information</hi> of Sense) against the <hi>Dictates</hi> of <hi>Sensation,</hi> you must inevitably err.</p>
            <p>But one may say, Is the Sense at <hi>Stomach</hi> such an infallible <hi>Guide</hi> always?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:52480:47"/>I believe it will be very hard to give many <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> to the contrary, and prove it well; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if we do, or may allow something of this <hi>Kind</hi> to a perverted <hi>Stomach</hi> at certain <hi>times,</hi> (to avoid a <hi>squabble</hi> about it) it is never to be allow'd, That all the <hi>Stomachs</hi> in the <hi>whole World</hi> should be pleased with one and the same Thing at all times, and yet that this Thing should be so highly perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the <hi>Animal</hi> as to <hi>diminish</hi> or <hi>disable its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> Then, indeed, it would follow, that the most exquisite Sense at <hi>Stomach,</hi> to discern what is or is not agreeable to the <hi>Animal,</hi> were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in <hi>vain,</hi> which no Man of <hi>Reason,</hi> that has any Apprehension of the Wisdom of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> can assert.</p>

               <hi>Loss of Memory</hi> by <hi>Opium</hi> (as some argue) is not so much a <hi>Loss</hi> of <hi>Spirits,</hi> as <hi>Lanity</hi> of the <hi>Brain;</hi> for People in Drink do not want Spirits, but there is a great <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> and its <hi>Membranes,</hi> and of the whole <hi>Ienus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:52480:50"/>1. Opium <hi>does not Operate as an Alterative of the Bloud,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because it Operates while it is at <hi>Stomach,</hi> or (<hi>at least</hi>) before it arrives at the <hi>Bloud;</hi> which manifestly appears several <hi>Ways;</hi> as,<list>
                  <item>1. Because it often Operates in a <hi>Liquid Form</hi> in few <hi>Minutes,</hi> and very commonly in a <hi>Quarter</hi> of an <hi>Hour,</hi> in which time it must be at <hi>Stomach,</hi> or, at least, far from arriving at the <hi>Bloud.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Because it has been very often Vomited up after it has Operated, and produced its <hi>usual Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and sometimes more <hi>Hours;</hi> as evidently appear'd by the <hi>Smell, Colour, Taste, &amp;c.</hi> of what was Vomited; and by its <hi>Operation</hi> ceasing after such <hi>Vomiting;</hi> of which <hi>common Experience,</hi> and <hi>Authors,</hi> do inform us: See <hi>Helmont Ius Duumvir.</hi> 62. where he tells of <hi>Opium</hi> Operating at Night, and Vomited up next Morning.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p>3. Its bare causing Vomiting after it has Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for a good while, is of it self (tho' its <hi>Taste, Smell, &amp;c.</hi> did not discover it) an infallible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its Operating, while it is at <hi>Stomach;</hi> for 'tis against all Reason to imagine, that Things should irritate it to Vomit after they are gone into the <hi>Bloud,</hi> and not do it while they are in the <hi>Stomach</hi> it self, as all <hi>Vomitories</hi> do.</p>
                     <p>The Reasons why it stays so long at Stomach, are, 1. Its <hi>Indigestibleness,</hi> which plainly appears by <hi>Stools, Urine,</hi> and <hi>Sweat,</hi> smelling of it, when taken in any considerable Quantity; all the <hi>Cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Digestions, Circulations, &amp;c.</hi> that it passes in the Body, signifying very little to it, which its causing <hi>Itchings</hi> in the Skin, and affecting the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal</hi>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:52480:51"/>
                        <hi>Membranes</hi> after its passing the Bloud, do also argue. 2. The clamminess of its resinous Parts sticking to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> cause (as I shall plainly prove hereafter) its long stay in it; for if the <hi>Rosin</hi> be separate from it, 'twill not then make such a long stay at Stomach, as I have often Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. We actually feel it causing a sense of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> at Stomach during its Operation, therefore it is then in it.</item>
                  <item>5. It has been carried off by Stool after it has produced its usual Effects; Therefore it Operated before it arrived at the Bloud.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p>6. All Observers do allow, that <hi>Opium</hi> Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates while it is at <hi>Stomach;</hi> which gave the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion (as you may remember) to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of its Operating by <hi>Fumes</hi> rising out of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;</hi> because they could not think of any other Means by which it might affect the <hi>Head, Brain, Animal Spirits, Nerves, &amp;c.</hi> while it was at <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> but by the Way of <hi>Fumes</hi> or <hi>Vapours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is therefore past all doubt, <hi>That</hi> Opium <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces its common Effects while it is at Stomach, and before it arrives at the Blood, and therefore does not Operate as an Alterative thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because a <hi>Grain</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> which Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates very remarkably, bears (as <hi>Etmuller</hi> well observes) so small a Proportion to the Bloud, that it cannot produce such great, and notable Effects, as an <hi>Alterative</hi> thereof; for a Grain of <hi>Opium</hi> to 20 Pound of Blood, (which an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Man has in his Body) is but as 1 to 115200, or (if 16 Oucnes be allow'd to the Pound) as 1 to 153600. But it is no Wonder if a <hi>Grain</hi> should affect the <hi>Membrane</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> since the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52480:51"/>
1000 part of a <hi>Grain</hi> of the <hi>Vomitory Particles</hi> of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> or <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> does affect it so eminently, as many other Things will in a very small Quantity; whereas the altering of the Blood to any observable <hi>degree,</hi> requires the Use of <hi>Alteratives</hi> in great Quantity for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Weeks:</hi> Which confirms the former Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>That</hi> Opium <hi>does not Operate as an Alterative,</hi> as to its common and usual Effects.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Opium <hi>does not Operate by grievous Sensation,</hi> (or Irritation) as <hi>Vomits, Purgers, Errhines, Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators,</hi> (or Apophlegmatizers) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because it manifestly causes a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, pleasant, and even charming <hi>Sensation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because it takes away <hi>grievous Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Pain,</hi> thereby stopping <hi>Vomiting, Purging,</hi> and all other-Effects of <hi>grievous Sensation,</hi> by <hi>Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Vomiting</hi> that <hi>Opium</hi> sometimes causes, it is only (<hi>as shall be shewn</hi>) by its Resinous Parts sticking to the Coat of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> which being separated from it, <hi>Opium</hi> has no such <hi>Effect,</hi> tho' all its <hi>good Effects</hi> remain. So its <hi>Purging</hi> (which happens most rarely, and only when a great <hi>Quantity</hi> is given to Men of strong Digestion) it is only from its Rosin digested, and resolved in strong <hi>Stomachs;</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Dogs,</hi> and such as have <hi>canine Appetites,</hi> do generally Purge after a great Quantity of <hi>Crude</hi> or <hi>Rosinous Opium;</hi> whereas such as is not <hi>Rosinous</hi> causes no such <hi>Effect.</hi> But of these Matters more to your Satisfaction hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because it causes all Effects that are quite contrary to those of <hi>grievous Sensation; It</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:52480:52"/>
causing an <hi>Ovation</hi> of the Sensitive Soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; <hi>Pain</hi> (or grievous Sensation) a <hi>Depression of Spirits; It</hi> causing <hi>Euphory</hi> and <hi>Pain, Weariness;</hi> For what tires more than <hi>Pain,</hi> or labouring in <hi>Pain? It</hi> causing <hi>good Humour, Pain Peevishness, Fretfulness,</hi> and <hi>ill Humour; Opium</hi> causing Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Parts, <hi>Pain</hi> Contraction; <hi>That</hi> causing free <hi>Perspiration, this</hi> checking it; <hi>That</hi> causing Sleep, <hi>this</hi> hindering it; <hi>That</hi> causing Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation Acquiescence, <hi>this</hi> Discontent and Uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; <hi>That</hi> composing, <hi>this</hi> discomposing the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Bloud,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That</hi> causing <hi>Fluxes</hi> by <hi>Irritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>this</hi> moderating, or stopping them; <hi>That</hi> opening the Pores, <hi>Pain</hi> constringing them; <hi>Opium</hi> preventing the Shaking Fits in <hi>Agues, Pain</hi> bringing them on; <hi>That</hi> causing a large and slow Pulse, <hi>this</hi> a quick, hard, and narrow Pulse; <hi>That</hi> causing an <hi>Efflorescence</hi> of the Skin, <hi>this Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; That</hi> pleasant, <hi>this</hi> unpleasant Dreams; <hi>That</hi> stills Hiccoughs, <hi>this</hi> causes them; <hi>That</hi> takes off <hi>Contractions, Convulsions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>this</hi> causes them. To be short, <hi>Opium</hi> causes all the Effects of <hi>pleasant Sensation,</hi> and takes off all the Effects of <hi>grievous Sensation.</hi> What can be a more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Proof of its acting by causing a <hi>pleasant Sensation?</hi> It were endless to mention all the <hi>Proofs</hi> that may be made to the same Purpose, from <hi>Pleasers</hi> and <hi>Displeasers</hi> of <hi>Sensation.</hi>

               <hi>That</hi> Opium <hi>does not Operate by causing a grievoui Sensation,</hi> and there being no other Way left by which it may Operate,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It must Operate by causing a pleasant Sensation;</hi> which is the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>plain Reason</hi> why (as has been shewn) it takes off <hi>Pain,</hi> and causes all Effects quite contrary to that of <hi>grievous Sensation;</hi>

               <hi>CHAP XIII.</hi> Of the Oeconomy of Sensation, as far (at least) as it concerns our present Purpose.</head>
            <p>WHEN I had written this <hi>Tract</hi> thus far, I judged it best, first, to publish that of <hi>Animal Mechanism,</hi> because it contained those <hi>Principles</hi> that would explain the Matter of <hi>Opium;</hi> therefore laying this aside, I applied my self to that: But a <hi>New Art,</hi> rightly to <hi>Spell, Write,</hi> and <hi>Sweeten</hi> all <hi>Languages,</hi> (that I since call'd <hi>Phono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy</hi>) coming into my Mind, and thinking it might be very useful, and likely to lie for ever in Darkness, (as it had always been) unless I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the <hi>Drudgery,</hi> I set my self to it; which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up more <hi>Time</hi> than I imagined, has to this <hi>day</hi> hindred the finishing of that <hi>Tract</hi> of <hi>Animal Mechanism,</hi> which I now much want, (as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated:) Therefore because I resolv'd to publish this, (that was so long since promised) I am now forced, for want of that <hi>Book,</hi> to premise here some Things, concerning the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of <hi>Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the <hi>Nature of sensitive Pleasure,</hi> in order to explicate the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> which might have been spared, if that of <hi>Animal Mechanism</hi> had been published.</p>
            <p>Considering that <hi>Opium</hi> must (as was shewn) operate by pleasing the <hi>Sense</hi> of <hi>Feeling,</hi> it will be requisite to consider,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Five Things</hi> mainly concern the <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of <hi>Sensation:</hi> 1. The <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The <hi>external Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi> 3. The <hi>Organs</hi> of <hi>Sensation.</hi> 4. The <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits,</hi> (or <hi>internal Medium.</hi>) 5. The <hi>sensitive Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>Object is the Thing perceiv'd by any of the Senses;</hi> as, <hi>Light</hi> by the <hi>Eye; Sound</hi> (or <hi>tremulous Motion</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi>) by the <hi>Ear; Odour</hi> by the <hi>Nose; Tastes</hi> by the <hi>Tongue; Opium</hi> by the Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or (as <hi>Helmont</hi> calls it) the <hi>Gustus</hi> (or <hi>Taste</hi>) at <hi>Stomach.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The <hi>External Medium of Sensation is that which receives Impressions from the Object, and conveys them to the Organs of Sensation.</hi> Thus the <hi>Air</hi> conveys <hi>Sound</hi> (or <hi>tremulous Motion</hi>) to the <hi>Ear, Light</hi> to the <hi>Eye,</hi> and <hi>Odour</hi> to the <hi>Nose.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. The <hi>Organs are the Parts of the Body that God has fram'd to receive those Impressions, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to the Animal Spirits,</hi> (or <hi>Internal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</hi>) Thus the <hi>Eye</hi> is the <hi>Organ</hi> to receive the Impression of <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Ear</hi> that of <hi>Sound, &amp;c.</hi> And the <hi>Membranes</hi> in all Parts of the Body are the <hi>Organs</hi> that receive <hi>Impressions</hi> from <hi>Objects</hi> in the case of <hi>Feeling,</hi> which is our main <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. The <hi>Internal Medium is the Animal Spirits that receive the Impressions from the Organs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them to the Sensitive Soul.</hi>

               <item>5. The <hi>Sensitive Soul, which perceives those Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions convey'd to him by the Animal Spirits;</hi> which <hi>Perception</hi> is <hi>Sensation.</hi>

For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sensitive Perception is not infinite,</hi> because there are Degrees of <hi>Light, Sound, &amp;c.</hi> that cannot be perceiv'd, tho' they must be very small, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable: Thus the Light of a Candle at so great a <hi>distance</hi> that it can hardly be perceived, is some <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and makes its Reflection proportionably from a <hi>Wall, Tree, &amp;c.</hi> yet cannot that reflected <hi>Light</hi> from the <hi>Wall,</hi> or <hi>Tree,</hi> be perceived; so the smallest Things cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

               </hi> So that it is no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a <hi>Grain</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> operates in so short a <hi>time,</hi> that is, as soon as a <hi>Tincture</hi> thereof insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates it self through the <hi>Crusta Carnosa</hi> to the <hi>sensile Coat</hi> of the <hi>Stomach;</hi> whereas it must take a very long time, if it operated as an <hi>Alterative</hi> of the <hi>Bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That there is no <hi>way</hi> for any thing to operate upon the <hi>sensitive Soul,</hi> in so small a Quanty, as <hi>Opium</hi> operates, or in so short a Time, as by affecting the most exquisitely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Membrane</hi> at <hi>Stomach.</hi> 2.

            <p>Thus if you make a <hi>Dent,</hi> or <hi>Impression,</hi> of the bigness of half a small <hi>Pea,</hi> at one end of a <hi>Gut</hi> so filled with <hi>Air,</hi> that is of the bigness of one's Thigh, and two Yards long, it will bear a very small <hi>Proportion</hi> to the whole, and consequently very insensibly affect it; for 'tis like a <hi>Drop</hi> (as the Saying is) added to an <hi>Ocean;</hi> but if an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> (or <hi>Dent</hi>) of that <hi>bigness</hi> be made upon a <hi>Gut</hi> no bigger than a <hi>Pea</hi> in <hi>diameter,</hi> the <hi>Thrust,</hi> or <hi>Impression,</hi> will be very considerable at the other <hi>end,</hi> for the Reasons aforesaid. So that you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see, 1. That the more <hi>Air</hi> is compressed, the better it conveys <hi>Impressions:</hi> Hence it is that we hear <hi>Sounds</hi> better, and farther, when the <hi>Air</hi> is most compressed, and the <hi>Quicksilver</hi> high in the <hi>Barometer,</hi> (or <hi>Weather-glass</hi>) and upon low Grounds, tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> flat, and without any <hi>hollowness,</hi> than on the <hi>tops</hi> of high Hills that are flat also; because the <hi>Pressure</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> is less on high Hills.

               <hi>Hence it is, That</hi> if one speaks at one end of a <hi>Pipe,</hi> that is but an Inch in <hi>diameter,</hi> you'll hear it much better at the other <hi>end</hi> than in a <hi>close Gallery</hi> of the same length, tho' this will advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it much more than the open <hi>Air: That</hi> if one speaks ever so slowly at one <hi>end</hi> of a long Piece of Timber, it is manifestly and distinctly heard at the other <hi>end,</hi> through the narrow <hi>Vessels,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fibres of the <hi>Wood: That</hi> all <hi>Sounds</hi> are <hi>sharper</hi> in <hi>narrow Pipes, &amp;c.</hi> How easie is it then to contrive invisible <hi>Whispering-Places,</hi> which the World so much admire, and some <hi>Religions</hi> make such great <hi>Use</hi> of to deceive the People by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Divine and Oracular <hi>Responses,</hi> of which the <hi>Reader</hi> may hereafter be aware.</p>
            <p>It is for like Reasons that <hi>Guns, Bells, &amp;c.</hi> are better and farther heard along hollow <hi>Valleys,</hi> than upon <hi>Plains;</hi> that <hi>Sounds</hi> are heard so well the ways that <hi>Rivers</hi> run; for it is a <hi>vulgar Error</hi> that the <hi>Water</hi> does advantage the <hi>Sound</hi> upon <hi>Rivers;</hi> if it did, you'd hear farther at <hi>Sea</hi> than upon <hi>Land;</hi> which is so false, that the quite contrary is true, <hi>Sounds</hi> being much farther heard by <hi>Land</hi> than at <hi>Sea.</hi> It is a common Observation in <hi>Sea-Fights,</hi> that the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>There is indeed another <hi>Advantage</hi> in <hi>Valleys,</hi> (and therefore upon <hi>Rivers</hi>) <hi>viz.</hi> the several <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberations,</hi> or <hi>Eccho's,</hi> from the <hi>Hills</hi> and high <hi>Banks, Rocks, &amp;c.</hi> on the <hi>sides</hi> thereof; but this not much concerning our Purpose, I must (for the present) pass them and several <hi>Observations</hi> upon <hi>Sounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the aforesaid, and other <hi>ends,</hi> it is notorious that the <hi>Air</hi> is <hi>springy,</hi> and always under the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> of the <hi>Atmosphere,</hi> or else it would be of little <hi>use</hi> as a <hi>Medium.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:52480:57"/>I know but one thing more to our Purpose that is worth the mentioning, in reference to the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> between the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums of Sensation, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is requisite, or convenient at least, that the Air have an homogeneous Continuity,</hi> which much more advances it in conveying <hi>Impulses,</hi> (or <hi>Impressions</hi>) than when it is discontinued, divided, or sever'd, by other <hi>heterogeneous Particles,</hi> especially if these be in motion between the Parts of the <hi>Air;</hi> for then they very much disappoint and disgregate the <hi>Impressions</hi> made thereon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore</hi> it is, that we hear so much better after <hi>Sun-set,</hi> or in the <hi>Nights,</hi> especially the <hi>Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> than in the <hi>Day,</hi> when the <hi>Particles</hi> of <hi>Heat,</hi> and others thereby raised, do too much divide, discontinue, and disgregate the <hi>Impressions,</hi> and the Parts of the <hi>Air<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Where you may observe how Good and Wise <hi>Providence</hi> orders Hearing to be more useful in the Night, when Seeing fails. It is a vulgar <hi>Errour,</hi> (tho' little thought so to be) That the Cause of the Difference of hearing Sounds <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after Sun-set,</hi> is the <hi>Noise</hi> that is made in the <hi>Day-time,</hi> and the Silence of the <hi>Evenings</hi> and <hi>Nights;</hi> which one single Instance (tho' thousands may be given) will fully demonstrate, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Famous and Well-governed <hi>University</hi> and <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> there is scarce any <hi>Noise</hi> made at the Times of <hi>Divine Service</hi> on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> all People being either silent at Church, or shut up quietly and silently in their respective <hi>Houses</hi> or <hi>Colleges,</hi> (the <hi>Heat</hi> of the Days in Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, but mostly the good Order of the Place, causing it:) But after <hi>Sun-set,</hi> most People are out, walking and discoursing, or talking at their <hi>Doors, Arbours,</hi> or <hi>Gardens;</hi> and all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

            <p>It is not only consonant to Reason that the <hi>Air</hi> should be so discontinued by the Particles of <hi>Heat, &amp;c.</hi> but obvious to the Sight that it is so; for in a great <hi>Heat,</hi> the Summer-time, and clearest <hi>Day,</hi> you may see the very <hi>Air</hi> in a wavering tremulous Motion, which could not be seen of it self, without the mixture of other <hi>Parts;</hi> for disgregation of Parts, (as you see even in pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucid homogeneous Things powder'd) causes Opacity.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The Business, or Office, of the Organs of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, in the Oeconomy thereof, being to receive and communicate the Impressions to the Animal Spirits with all the smartness they can,</hi> it is manifest, that in the <hi>Membranes,</hi> (or <hi>Organs</hi>) <hi>Tension is their main Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.</hi> Hence it is that when the <hi>Tympan</hi> of the <hi>Ear</hi> is tense, the <hi>Cornea,</hi> and other Tunicles of the Eye sufficiently so, we hear and see acutely and accurately; to that end <hi>God</hi> has given us a <hi>Power</hi> to render the Tympan more tense when we listen; to contract the Pupilla of the Eye when we look very intently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we see, that when the

               <hi>Cornea</hi> is relaxed, (as it is always when the Eye looks deadish, as in <hi>Sleep, Drunkenness, fainting Fits, &amp;c.</hi>) yet then we either not seet at all, or much worse: So it is when the <hi>Tympan</hi> is relaxed. We also always put the <hi>Tongue</hi> in a <hi>tense</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we would taste a Thing exactly. So when any Part is relax'd by Warmth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we do not feel so well and nicely, as when the Part is cold, or more tense, or rigid; nor in <hi>Sleep,</hi> as when <hi>awake,</hi> because all Parts are relaxed in <hi>Sleep,</hi> and contracted when we are awake, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly appears,<list>
                  <item>1. Because we perspire less when we are awake, than when asleep, which happens because the Pores are closed by the <hi>Contraction,</hi> or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </item>
                  <item>2.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I purposely started this <hi>Objection</hi> to clear the <hi>Case.</hi> Therefore, 1. Observe, That <hi>Violin-Strings</hi> will grow so tense (as will any thing else of like <hi>Nature</hi>) by <hi>Contraction</hi> in moist Weather,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52480:59"/>
that tears them to pieces sometimes upon that account, and always puts them upon a greater stress; for when a thing is fixed at both <hi>ends,</hi> it is the same thing to shorten, or contract, the String, to render it <hi>tense,</hi> as to take something from its length between those two fix'd Points; both the <hi>Contraction</hi> and the <hi>Winding</hi> do only take something of the Length away, that is between those two Points, where the Ends are fastned; which causes a great stress of the shortned String, to reach those two Points that it is fastned to: As, suppose you have a String of 11 Inches long, fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at both ends at the distance of 10 Inches, it will be very loose; then shorten it one Inch, by winding up so much, or by some means contract the String to 10 Inches, or any way shorten it an <hi>Inch;</hi> then it will just reach the Points, and be tense, if fastned at them. So there is <hi>Contraction</hi> necessarily causing <hi>Tension,</hi> which was to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be the same in effect, if a String put round any thing is shortned by Moisture, or otherwise, it must grow more tense; and so must 500 Strings, if so shortned, or an entire Membrane that covers or includes the whole. Thus Membranes (as a Gut contracted upon included Air) must, when they contract, grow more tense upon the inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> in the <hi>Nerves,</hi> or otherwise; for it is the same as forcing much Air into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or contracted Gut, or Bladder, which must make them <hi>tense,</hi> while the elastick Body must thrust out the harder, the more it is compressed. And that the Membranes, and all sensile Parts, are more contracted when we are awake, doth farther most plainly appear: Because,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:52480:59"/>3. The <hi>Cornea</hi> of the <hi>Eyes</hi> (which is a visible and certain sign of the <hi>Relaxation</hi> of all the <hi>sensile Parts</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi>) is relax'd in Sleep, as any one may see; for that is the cause of the deadness of the Eye in <hi>Sleep,</hi> which upon awaking is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gone, by the <hi>Cornea</hi> contracting into a tense condition upon its <hi>Contents,</hi> by which means it becomes <hi>tense, rotund, hard, smooth, shining,</hi> and reflects a brisk <hi>Speck</hi> of Light, (as round Things do) which makes it look lively; whereas when 'tis lax, as in <hi>Sleep, Syncopes, Faintings, &amp;c.</hi> it is uneven, soft, and reflects an uneven, dull, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Light, all which causes the deadness of <hi>Looks.</hi> Therefore (as was intimated) there is no better sign of <hi>Relaxation</hi> than deadish Looks.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Pupilla</hi> (which is another sign of <hi>Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) is relaxed, or dilated, in <hi>Sleep,</hi> and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted when we are awake.</p>
            <p>5. All Motions of the <hi>Body</hi> are better perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when we are awake; which argues the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>contraction</hi> of Parts; for <hi>Relaxation</hi> (as in <hi>Sleep, Deliquiums, Drunkenness, &amp;c.</hi>) weakens all <hi>Motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. That <hi>Efflorescence</hi> of the Skin which People have when asleep, (which is caused by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation</hi> of the <hi>Skin</hi> admitting the Bloud more into it; as <hi>Paleness</hi> is by the <hi>Contraction</hi> of the <hi>Skin</hi> in <hi>Cold, Fear, &amp;c.</hi> repelling the Boud) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appears upon awaking, by <hi>reason</hi> that the <hi>vigila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Contraction</hi> (so I call it) does send the Bloud out of the Skin by squeezing it back, or repelling it.</p>
            <p>7. Measure the Body ingeniously and accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and you'll find it contracted and narower, after <hi>awaking,</hi> than in <hi>Sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Hence it is that you find, when the <hi>Body</hi> is pretty full of <hi>Moisture,</hi> and the Weather hot, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udden <hi>Sweat</hi> upon awaking; because the whole
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52480:60"/>
               <hi>Body</hi> contracting, does, like the contortion of wet Linnen, cause an exudation of its <hi>Moisture,</hi> by a <hi>mechanical expression,</hi> or <hi>squeezing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Hence also it is that we are subject to take <hi>Cold,</hi> even in a warm <hi>Room,</hi> if we watch long; because the <hi>Pores</hi> being closed by that <hi>vigitative Contraction,</hi> hinder <hi>Perspiration</hi> too long, and too much: Therefore it is that all <hi>Colds</hi> are worse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Evenings,</hi> because that <hi>Contraction</hi> closes the <hi>Pores</hi> all <hi>day;</hi> and not only <hi>Colds,</hi> but many other <hi>Distempers,</hi> especially such as <hi>Perspiration</hi> is good for; as indeed it is for most <hi>Diseases,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>considerable Evacuation: Most natural,</hi> because it requires no voluntary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Irritation of the sensile Parts, as that of <hi>Siege, Urine, &amp;c.</hi> which either require the <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Irritation</hi> by <hi>Quantity</hi> or <hi>Quality,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> or <hi>all three;</hi> but <hi>Perspiration</hi> (like <hi>Fumes</hi> in a Chimney) requires only that its little <hi>Funnels</hi> (the <hi>Pores</hi>) should be open, because our <hi>Fumes</hi> pass (as the other do) by their own natural Levity: And it is <hi>most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,</hi> because universal, and that much more is evacuated that <hi>way,</hi> than by all <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence</hi> it is that all Membranes gaining a <hi>Tension,</hi> by the <hi>vigilative Contraction</hi> in manner aforesaid, are more rightly disposed to receive and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate <hi>smart Impressions</hi> to the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> while we are awake, which was the Thing aim'd at, and will be much more illustrated by the <hi>Consideration</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> and the <hi>Sensitive Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That the <hi>Membranes, Vessels,</hi> and <hi>Roads</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> being much narrowed and compressed by this <hi>vigilative Contraction, Two</hi> other main <hi>Requisites</hi> for exact <hi>Sensation</hi> do of

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That an <hi>Impression</hi> made upon the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits</hi> in <hi>Pipes</hi> so narrowed, is better, more exactly and smartly convey'd to the <hi>sensitive Soul,</hi> as has been shewn, by the <hi>Analogy</hi> of the <hi>External Medium</hi> in <hi>slender Pipes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is by such narrowing of the <hi>Nerves, Pipes, Roads, &amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> that <hi>cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> which contracts the Parts, makes our <hi>Feeling</hi> more <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>smart</hi> than <hi>warm Weather,</hi> which relaxes the <hi>Vessels,</hi> and gives the <hi>springy Animal Spirits</hi> (for such they are, as shall, by His Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that made them, appear) leave to expand, by which means, and the <hi>Vessels</hi> widening, the <hi>Feeling</hi> grows duller, for want of compression of the Spirits.</p>
            <p>By what has been said, you may see why Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of a fine and <hi>delicate Texture</hi> (that is, of <hi>smaller</hi> and <hi>slenderer Vessels</hi>) have a more exquisite <hi>Feeling;</hi> that little <hi>Animals,</hi> as <hi>Spiders, Flea's,</hi> and many such, have most <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>accurate Feeling,</hi> because their <hi>Nerves, Vessels, Pipes, &amp;c.</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably small, and the smaller they are, the more accute is their <hi>Feeling,</hi> for the <hi>Reasons</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said; which was absolutely necessary, because they deal with small Things proportionably, as their <hi>Food, Treading, &amp;c.</hi> and that small Things may harm them, unless they take distinct notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to defend themselves; whereas <hi>Elephants, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, Horses, &amp;c.</hi> can, because of their large <hi>Vessels,</hi> scarce feel such Impressions, as would crush those little <hi>Animals</hi> to pieces. <hi>Lord, how manifold are Thy Works!

                  <item>3.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52480:62"/>
                     <hi>Experiments</hi> of the <hi>Air-Pump</hi> do confirm the same.</item>
                  <item>10. There can be no doubt but the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> are nourish'd, or sustain'd by the <hi>Air,</hi> if they be not <hi>Air;</hi> therefore they are <hi>elastick.</hi> What needs any more <hi>Arguments,</hi> when several of the former are Demonstrative? And, that,</item>
                  <item>11. All <hi>Physicians</hi> and <hi>Phylosophers</hi> (that I know of) do allow, that the Animal Spirits are <hi>ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="4">Secondly, <hi>It is requisite,</hi> (as was said of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Medium</hi>) <hi>that they should be compressed,</hi> to render them fit to convey <hi>Impressions;</hi> and that they are compressed is evident (as was before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated.)</p>
            <p>1. By the <hi>Atmosphere.</hi> 2. By the <hi>Vigilative Contraction;</hi> which makes them much more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to <hi>convey Impressions</hi> than the <hi>External Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium;</hi> besides, that very often Two other <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> (that are shewn in the remaining <hi>Part</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi>) are added thereto; and, that the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> are wholly contained in <hi>Pipes,</hi> (to prevent their Expansion) and that of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest sizes that can well be imagined; but the <hi>Air,</hi> or <hi>External Medium,</hi> is at large in the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere;</hi> so that all the <hi>Impressions</hi> made upon the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> are very tightly, closely, and smart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convey'd, nor have they but a little Way to pass, that is, the <hi>length</hi> of the <hi>Animal</hi> at most, which also may be some Advantage to small <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> But in <hi>Sleep</hi> the <hi>Vigilative Contraction</hi> being lost, and the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> thereupon expanded, all Impulses must needs be carried very faintly, both because the <hi>Organs</hi> (or Membranes) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed by <hi>Relaxation,</hi> and the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> by <hi>Expansion</hi> upon that <hi>Relaxation,</hi> for want of due <hi>Compression</hi> to fit them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:52480:63"/>
               <hi>Thus have you (after many vain Enquiries) the true Mechanical Cause of the Difference of Sensation, Sleeping, and Waking, and the plain Reason, why our Motions are so feeble in Sleep,</hi> viz. <hi>Because the Animal Spirits have lost much of their Force, Sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for want of due Compression, by Reason of the Relaxation of all the Vessels that include the Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is</hi> (in some Measure) <hi>requisite, that the Animal Spirits should have an Homogeneous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity,</hi> as was shewn by the <hi>Analogy</hi> of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Medium,</hi> which does not convey <hi>Impressions</hi> as well in the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Day,</hi> as in the <hi>Night,</hi> or after <hi>Sunset;</hi> because its Parts are more discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and disgregated by the Particles of <hi>Heat, Fumes, &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Day Time;</hi> nay, if Things be discontinued, they never carry <hi>Impressions</hi> so well, tho' placed contiguously afterward; Thus a long <hi>Tree</hi> that conveys sounds so exactly from one end to the other, while all is continued, and in one Piece, will not convey the <hi>sound</hi> so well if it be cut into many <hi>Pieces,</hi> tho' they are afterward put close one to the other.</p>
            <p>As to this Matter of <hi>Continuity</hi> in the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> seeing it does not much concern us, and that <hi>People</hi> in a State of <hi>Health</hi> are supposed to have it, and that it is not our <hi>Business</hi> here to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the Consideration of Nervous Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, I need not use any more Words about it; but that if it any Way happens to be discontinued, as either by the <hi>Penury</hi> thereof, that they do not quite fill all Parts of their <hi>Vessels,</hi> or any Matter intercepting their Parts, or that the <hi>Vessels</hi> should be so relaxed, or widen'd, that the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> cannot so well fill them up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> such Causes must
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52480:63"/>
destroy or lessen Sensation, tho' the bare mixing of <hi>Fumes</hi> with them would not (considering the shortness of the <hi>Way</hi> that Impressions are carried in <hi>Animals</hi>) much alter the Case, as you find <hi>Fumes</hi> in the <hi>Air</hi> do not much hinder <hi>sound</hi> at the distance of a <hi>Yard</hi> or <hi>Two,</hi> wherein it is insensible (to common Observers at least;) so that if some <hi>Fumes</hi> from a Grain or Two of <hi>Opium,</hi> did mingle with the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> it would not cause a sensible <hi>difference</hi> of <hi>Feeling</hi> in the short space of the length of an <hi>Animal:</hi> But I have proved, That no such <hi>Fume</hi> from the <hi>Opium</hi> mixes with them, therefore need say no more of this <hi>Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>The Office or Business of the sensitive Soul in the Oeconomy of Sensation, being to perceive the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions conveyed to him by the Animal Spirits,</hi> that he may, if he finds them disagreeable, bestir himself in Defence of the <hi>Animal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">First, <hi>It is requisite he should attend to all Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions offer'd him by the Animal Spirits,</hi> otherwise <hi>Impressions</hi> of great Concernment may escape his notice, and consequently want his <hi>Assistance</hi> by Way of Defence. For</p>
            <p>It is manifest, That when his <hi>Attention</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by any <hi>Object,</hi> more especially by such as mightily pleases him, as in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Venery,</hi> and other <hi>Pleasures,</hi> especially if <hi>intense,</hi> that he does not perceive other <hi>Objects</hi> at the <hi>Time</hi> that he is so diverted; and if the <hi>pleasant Diversion</hi> be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense,</hi> and <hi>permanent,</hi> as in the Case of <hi>Opium</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> drank in a considerable Quantity, he is so taken up, diverted, or charm'd therewith, that he does not attend to the Business of <hi>Sensation.</hi> This is one <hi>Reason</hi> why such as are far gone in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52480:64"/>
               <hi>Drink,</hi> have none of their <hi>Senses</hi> aright; but as to the <hi>Illustration</hi> of this <hi>Matter</hi> you may expect more hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> is the only Thing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, <hi>It is requisite, that it should use all Means that is in its Power, that the Impressions should be brought to it very entirely, exactly, smartly,</hi> &amp;c. so as to have due notice of all <hi>Objects,</hi> and the smallest <hi>Impressions</hi> that may be.</p>
            <p>For which good <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Purposes God</hi> has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> (as will be fully proved) with a Power of contracting all the sensile, small, and slender <hi>Pipes, Vessels,</hi> or <hi>Passages</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> for the more express, distinct, and accurate Conveyance of all <hi>Impressions</hi> by the Help of <hi>Compression;</hi> Therefore the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> taking the <hi>Advantage</hi> thereof, for better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, in order to <hi>Self-Preservation,</hi> does (by the Appointment of the Preserver of all Things) execute his <hi>Power</hi> by the aforementioned <hi>Vigila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Contraction</hi> of those <hi>Parts,</hi> to cause their <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> and <hi>greater Compression</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> to improve the <hi>Impressions</hi> that are to be convey'd to him, and render them more observable; This <hi>God,</hi> who has made nothing to be idle, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ordered the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> in <hi>Adam</hi> for Labour, especeally in <hi>Reference</hi> to their own Safety and Preservation, has made to be the ordinary <hi>Employ</hi> or <hi>Day-Work</hi> of the <hi>sensitive Soul,</hi> that by the said <hi>Vigilative Contraction,</hi> the <hi>Organs, Membranes, Vessels, &amp;c.</hi> may be render'd more <hi>tense</hi> and <hi>firm,</hi> and the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> more <hi>compressed,</hi>

            <p>But the keeping of the said Parts, Membranes, &amp;c. in <hi>continual Contraction,</hi> even against the <hi>Renitency</hi> of the <hi>elastick Spirits,</hi> (which resist, and thrust the harder against their <hi>Vessels,</hi> by how much the more they Compress them by the <hi>Vigilative Contraction</hi>) being a continual tedious <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Fatigue,</hi> of which the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> being <hi>sensible,</hi> (as the only Perceiver of <hi>Lassitude,</hi> or indeed of any Thing besides, in an <hi>Animal</hi>) and in his <hi>Nature</hi> but <hi>material, changeable, fatigable, frail, subject</hi> to be worn out, and <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>Decay,</hi> (which makes the Certainty of <hi>Death</hi> in <hi>all Animals,</hi> and in us since the <hi>Fall</hi> into an <hi>Animal Nature</hi>) does, upon that Account, and lest the continual <hi>Contraction</hi> and tensive Stress of Parts, by that Means, should spoil their <hi>Tone,</hi> and to recruit the wasted <hi>Sprits</hi> by Rest, (after tuggingall Day at the <hi>Vigilative Contraction</hi>) grow willing to give over the <hi>Drudgery,</hi> however convenient for the <hi>Uses</hi> aforesaid; Therefore being allow'd convenient <hi>Rest</hi> by his Maker, he, for the great Benefit of <hi>Refection,</hi> without which he cannot continue his Being, and for the sweetness of <hi>Ease,</hi> loosens the Reins of <hi>Vigilative Contraction;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Sensation</hi> and <hi>Promptitude</hi> to <hi>Motion</hi> (which were maintain'd by that <hi>Contraction,</hi> causing the <hi>Tension</hi> of <hi>Organs,</hi> and <hi>Compression</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> as has been <hi>Mechanically</hi> demonstrated) fail by the <hi>Relaxation</hi> of those <hi>Organs, Membranes,</hi> and <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and the consequent <hi>Expansion</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits;</hi> so that now only the Compression of the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> remains, which (as you see in a <hi>Gut</hi> half full of Air un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Pressure) is not sufficient to <hi>convey the</hi>

               <item>11. <hi>Why</hi> People are more sleepy in warm moist <hi>Weather, viz.</hi> because the Parts are more relaxed, and the Pressure of the <hi>Atmosphere</hi> less to assist the <hi>Vigilative Contraction,</hi> to keep us in a waking State by the <hi>Compressure</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits:</hi> How much better therefore is a <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>dry Air,</hi> that raises the <hi>Mercury</hi> high in the <hi>Barometer,</hi> (or <hi>Weather Glass</hi>) both for <hi>Heath</hi> and <hi>Action?</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it renders the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

               <item>19. It is plain also from what has been Stated concerning <hi>Sleep,</hi> why <hi>Ague Fits</hi> seldom (if

ever) take <hi>People</hi> in the time of their first sound <hi>Sleep,</hi> because the <hi>Shivering</hi> is caused by a <hi>grievous Sensation</hi> of the <hi>sensile Parts,</hi> which cannot well happen in that <hi>sound Sleep,</hi> wherein there is so little Feeling by Reason of the said <hi>Relaxation;</hi> and because <hi>Relaxation</hi> opposes <hi>Contraction,</hi> by which that <hi>Shivering</hi> is promoted.

               <item>21. Why <hi>Watching, Labour,</hi> or what impairs the Spirits, and tires the <hi>sensitive Soul,</hi> inclines us to Sleep, that is, disposes the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> (the only Feeler of Lassitude) to give over Contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sensile Parts, which (as will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by and by) spends the Spirits, as Sleep by relaxing them causes a <hi>Recruit</hi> thereof.</item>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52480:68"/>
all the <hi>Arguments</hi> I can make for it, such Splendour does <hi>Truth</hi> shew upon the first <hi>Glimps</hi> thereof, as I take the Account I gave of <hi>Sleep</hi> and <hi>Watching</hi> to be; for the Opinions I have met concerning them were quite <hi>contrary</hi> to, or very <hi>remote</hi> from what I have stated.</p>
            <p>1. They went quite <hi>contrary</hi> to it that said, That the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> were expanded, and the <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Brain, &amp;c.</hi> more open (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more lax) in <hi>Watching,</hi> as <hi>Willis, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others;</hi> who therefore say that <hi>Coffee, Volatile Salts, &amp;c.</hi> are <hi>Antihypnoticks,</hi> (or good against too much <hi>Sleepiness</hi>) because they cause an <hi>Expansion</hi> of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and open the <hi>Pores</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> supposing (forsooth) that they marched up and down, and so kept the greater stir upon the false Imagination of their <hi>Roads</hi> being more open, which (as was proved) are really more close. <hi>Coffee</hi> keeps us from <hi>Sleep</hi> by drying, binding, and both Ways constringing the <hi>Vessels,</hi> as also by a wide grating Quality, which therefore does irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them to contract, besides that the Saline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles causing an <hi>Agitation,</hi> may contribute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, so that by <hi>constringing</hi> and <hi>agitating,</hi> it directly opposes Sleep, which proceeds from Relaxation and Quietness.</p>
            <p>2. They were very <hi>remote</hi> from the Mark, that said (as <hi>Wedeli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I will not argue against such senseless and precarious <hi>Absurdities;</hi> it is not worth the while, especially since the <hi>Truth</hi> is manifestly discovered: It would not have been so silly to have affirm'd the quite contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> are forced into the soft and yielding Brain, in Watching, by the <hi>Vigilative Contraction</hi> of all the <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file Parts</hi> repelling them, as when Cold repels them by a strong <hi>Contraction</hi> of the Parts, and causes a <hi>Stupor</hi> or <hi>Sleep</hi> thereof (as they call it.) But what have we to do with such insufferable <hi>Trash?</hi> Therefore bidding it adieu, let us pursue our <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is the <hi>Sensitive Soul,</hi> and nothing but it, has that <hi>Contracting Power,</hi> is evident;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because it is the Original of all <hi>Motion</hi> in the <hi>Animal</hi> as such; and that nothing besides it has any <hi>Life, Perception, Motion,</hi> or <hi>Power,</hi> and therefore must rest till they are moved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because, That when the <hi>Sensitive Soul</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by <hi>intense Pleasure,</hi> from attending his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, immediately <hi>Relaxation</hi> follows; as in the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of the <hi>Act of Venery,</hi> by <hi>Wine, Ioy, &amp;c.</hi> in which you have all the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Relaxation,</hi> as <hi>Deadness</hi> of the <hi>Eyes, Dilatation</hi> of the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> plentiful <hi>Perspiration, Floridity</hi> of the <hi>Skin,</hi> a large <hi>Pulse,</hi> and sometimes a considerable <hi>Failure</hi> of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> as in the most pleasant time of the <hi>Venereal Act, Deliquiums, Drunkenness, Syncopes,</hi> or <hi>Ecstasies</hi> upon <hi>intense Pleasure,</hi> (which are very properly called <hi>Ecstasies</hi>) <hi>Leipothymies, Leipopsychies, &amp;c.</hi> which signifie the <hi>Soul's leaving us</hi> without his Help by <hi>Contractions,</hi> which he then does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, as being charm'd, and wholly taken up with <hi>Pleasure.</hi> This is the true Cause of all <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiums, &amp;c.</hi> upon <hi>Pleasure, Ioy, &amp;c.</hi> all which cause great Relaxations, and thereby Loss of <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> as being its necessary Consequences.</p>

            </p>
            <p>4. Because the <hi>Sensitive Soul</hi> can, when we are Sleepy, oppose it, by continuing the <hi>Vigilative Contraction;</hi> which proves <hi>Vigilative Contraction</hi> to be in his <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That there is also other sorts of <hi>Leipothy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Deliquiums, &amp;c.</hi> upon the <hi>Sensitive Soul</hi>'s being over-tired, (whereof <hi>Natural Sleep</hi> is but a common and ordinary <hi>Degree,</hi> that happens of Course for our Relief) or over-born with some <hi>Fatigue,</hi> &amp;c. as when somewhat grieves at <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> and that it has laid about it all manner of <hi>Ways,</hi> by <hi>Vomiting, Convulsive Motions, &amp;c.</hi> to be rid of it, till it can work no longer; whereupon it lays down the <hi>Cudgels,</hi> desists from all further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by <hi>Contractions,</hi> yielding it self to <hi>Ease,</hi> seeing all Striving is to no Effect: So, that tho' this <hi>Deliquium,</hi> and the former, differ in their first Causes, yet do they agree in the last and immediate, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sensitive Soul</hi>'s not attending his Business of <hi>Contraction,</hi> whereupon follows a <hi>mighty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation,</hi> as appears by the <hi>Deadness</hi> (or <hi>Relaxation</hi>) of the <hi>Cornea, Dilatation</hi> of the <hi>Pupil,</hi> a <hi>great Laxity</hi> of all Parts, a large <hi>Pulse,</hi> or none, very plentiful <hi>Perspiration,</hi> Stops of <hi>Hemorrhages,</hi> and all Fluxes that require <hi>Contraction,</hi> &amp;c. which happen both upon the Account of the great <hi>Relaxation</hi> it self, (as has been shewn) and the almost absolute Rest of all Things by the <hi>Sensitive Soul</hi>'s withdrawing himself from <hi>Business,</hi> more than in Sleep it self.

such as are much tired <hi>sleep</hi> more profoundly, that our <hi>first Sleeps</hi> are the soundest, and that Sleep gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually <hi>declines</hi> in degrees (as we are recruited) till we awake; the nearer which we are, the more we <hi>dream,</hi> the state of <hi>Dreaming</hi> being a kind of Twilight between sound <hi>Sleep</hi> and Awaking, or between a full <hi>somniferous Relaxation</hi> and <hi>vigilative Contraction.</hi> And as the <hi>Sensitive Soul</hi> uses all <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Contraction</hi> below that of the <hi>Vigilative,</hi> till it comes to bare <hi>Compression</hi> of the <hi>Air;</hi> so it can exercise <hi>super-vigilative Contraction,</hi> (if I may so call it) that is, much higher <hi>degrees</hi> thereof than what was requisite ordinarily for a state of <hi>Vigilancy,</hi> as in Cases of Danger to the <hi>Animal, Frights, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, grievous Passions</hi> and <hi>Sensations;</hi> by which means the <hi>animal Spirits</hi> being more compressed than under the ordinary <hi>vigilative Contraction,</hi> Sensation grows more <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>smart,</hi> and Motion more <hi>prompt</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> (they always going together) for the <hi>Defence</hi> of the <hi>Animal,</hi> by extraordinary <hi>Flight, Repulsion,</hi> or otherwise. Hence it is, upon <hi>Fear, Terrour, grievous Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> or <hi>Sensation,</hi> (which manifestly proves the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such an extraordinary <hi>Contraction</hi> upon such Occasions) That,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Perspiration</hi> sails in a yet higher degree than under bare or ordinary <hi>vigilative Contraction,</hi> as appears by infallible <hi>statick Experiments</hi> and <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is by reason of the said <hi>defensive Contraction,</hi> (for so I call it, because it is excited in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner for the <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>Animal</hi> in time of need, or great <hi>Exigence</hi>) That in <hi>Frights, Terrours, &amp;c.</hi> our <hi>Hair, Dogs,</hi> &amp;c. does stand on end, or more upright; 1. Because the <hi>Pores</hi> do, by that violent <hi>Contraction,</hi> strictly close about the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Hair,</hi> that it cannot swag, incline,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52480:70"/>
or yield any way, by reason of its <hi>Weight,</hi> &amp;c. as when the Skin is more <hi>lax</hi> and <hi>soft,</hi> and the Pores, wherein the <hi>Hair</hi> is fixed, more open. 2. Because (which is the <hi>main Reason</hi>) the said <hi>Contraction</hi> renders the oblique <hi>Pores</hi> more upright; as suppose the <hi>Pores</hi> and <hi>Hair</hi> do naturally stand obliquely, (as they do to carry off Wet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <figure>
                  <head>Fig:I</head>
               </figure>
               <figure>
                  <head>Fig:II</head>
               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>And that (<hi>a</hi>) in <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. is, by the said <hi>Contraction,</hi> brought nearer to (<hi>i</hi>), as much as is from (<hi>a</hi>) to (<hi>o</hi>), then will the <hi>Pores</hi> and <hi>Hair</hi> stand upright, as in <hi>Fig.</hi> 2. and the Skin <hi>a, o, e, i, s,</hi> contracted and brought within the prick'd <hi>Perpendiculars,</hi> whereas in <hi>Fig.</hi> 1. it excur'd beyond the <hi>Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular n, m,</hi> as much as is from <hi>a</hi> to <hi>o.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. For the same Reason it is, That the Face, in <hi>grievous Passions</hi> and <hi>Sensations,</hi> as acute Pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is contorted and wrung awry, as you see in Persons that cry because of <hi>Grievances,</hi> (after the same manner as when they strive to lift up a great <hi>Weight</hi>) and that at the same time Tears, and Moisture at <hi>Nose</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> are squeezed out by the same <hi>Contraction;</hi> which makes People use the Saying of <hi>Casting Snot about</hi> when Men cry. It is for the same <hi>Reason</hi> that <hi>People</hi>'s Mouths <hi>water</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:52480:71"/>
extreamly when they are trimm'd with a bad <hi>Razor</hi> that puts them to <hi>Pain,</hi> which contracts the Parts, and squeezes out the Spittle.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Pulse</hi> grows sensibly narrower and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the same <hi>Contraction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It is by the <hi>Contraction</hi> upon <hi>grievous Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that our Mouths water very much upon a <hi>Nausea</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> because of the continuity of the Membranes of the <hi>Mouth</hi> and <hi>Stomach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The same <hi>Contraction</hi> is the true <hi>Reason</hi> why People, upon <hi>Hunger</hi> (which is a <hi>grievous Sensation at Stomach</hi>) have so much Moisture (or Spittle) in their Mouths, and so much the more when they see good <hi>Victuals,</hi> and cannot have it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Grievance</hi> which causes the <hi>Contraction</hi> that squeezes it out, is by so much the greater. This is the cause why the Mouth waters when hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry <hi>People</hi> see or smell good Victuals. By the same Contraction Moisture is squeezed out into the <hi>Oesophagus,</hi> (or <hi>Gullet</hi>) and the <hi>Menstruum</hi> into the Stomach at the same <hi>time;</hi> where (observe <hi>God's</hi> Good and Wise <hi>Providence</hi>) that <hi>Hunger</hi> which calls for <hi>Meat,</hi> at the same time provides Spittle to lubricate it for swollowing, and to help <hi>Digestion,</hi> render the <hi>Gullet</hi> slippery and disten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and causes the <hi>Menstruum</hi> to flow more abundantly into the <hi>Stomach;</hi> and all this when most needed, and that exactly in <hi>proportion</hi> to the <hi>Hunger</hi> (or <hi>grievous Sensation</hi>) that causes the <hi>Contraction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well worth your <hi>nothing,</hi> That God's <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> does always cause the <hi>Want</hi> of what is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in <hi>sensile Creatures,</hi> to be the solliciting and urging Cause for supply, that a due <hi>Proportion</hi> may be observed between the Supply and the <hi>Want;</hi> which may upon the telling of it appear so plain a Case, that it is scarce worth the mentioning; but (believe me) it is so little observ'd, (as plain
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52480:71"/>
as it may seem to be) that <hi>People</hi> have, and do err extravagantly for <hi>want</hi> of noting it; which if they had noted, they could never have said that <hi>Vapours,</hi> or the <hi>retiring</hi> of Spirits into the <hi>Brain, &amp;c.</hi> was the <hi>Cause,</hi> or <hi>Call</hi> of <hi>natural Sleep;</hi> nor <hi>feigned Menstruums</hi> to be the cause of <hi>Hunger;</hi> but would have duly considered what is mainly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by <hi>Eating,</hi> or recruited by <hi>Sleeping,</hi> &amp;c. and then had nothing to do but to conclude the <hi>Defect</hi> of that to have been the Cause that solicited for the Supply in <hi>proportion</hi> to the <hi>Defect:</hi> Which, if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, will most naturally and easily lead you to the true <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Causes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all <hi>Appetites</hi> in an <hi>Animal,</hi> upon a few Minutes Consideration; for want of which most plain and (one would think) very obvious <hi>Method,</hi> the deviating <hi>World</hi> has sadly puzzled it self about the Cause of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Thirst, Sleep,</hi> and the like, to this <hi>day,</hi> and still is in Disputes about them, of which (tho' my advertent <hi>Reader</hi> may well prevent me, by using that <hi>natural Method</hi>) I shall (<hi>God willing</hi>) give an account in my Tract of <hi>Animal Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism:</hi> Only <hi>note</hi> here, That I do not mean bare privative Defect, as such, to be the positive Cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that the Defect of what keeps or guards the Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the Grievance, causes other Matter to grieve it, cause Hunger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without which means, no Proportion can be observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Hunger and what takes it away, or our <hi>Food.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. The same <hi>defensive Contraction</hi> does, upon <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sensation,</hi> as <hi>Pain, Cold, Terrour, &amp;c.</hi> cause a <hi>Corrugation</hi> of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> contract the Skin into little <hi>Tubercles</hi> like that of a <hi>Goose-Skin, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. By it, upon <hi>grievous Sensation,</hi> as by squeez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Nose</hi> very hard, pulling the <hi>Hair, Sand,</hi> or any such thing, in the <hi>Eye,</hi> or a <hi>Grievance</hi> by the <hi>Volatile Particles</hi> of <hi>Onions, Mustard, Horse-Radish-Roots,</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:52480:72"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Parts and <hi>Membranes</hi> about the <hi>Eyes</hi> contracting, squeeze out <hi>Tears,</hi> that what grieves the <hi>Eyes</hi> may thereby be washed away, or qualified, as much as the <hi>Tears</hi> can do it.</p>
            <p>9. By this <hi>Contraction</hi> repelling the <hi>Bloud,</hi> the <hi>Skin</hi> grows <hi>Pale</hi> by <hi>Cold, Fear, Pain, &amp;c.</hi> which also closing the <hi>Pores,</hi> stop <hi>Sweat,</hi> as in a moment. You'll have an account hereafter how <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> may cause Sweat by <hi>squeezing</hi> in some Cases, and stop it by <hi>shutting the Pores</hi> in other Cases.</p>
            <p>10. It is by it that <hi>Contraction,</hi> that <hi>Fear, Cold, &amp;c.</hi> closing the <hi>Pores,</hi> and repelling the Bloud, stanch Bleeding: So happens also a greater <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi> of the <hi>Pupil</hi> of the <hi>Eye</hi> by the same Cause.</p>
            <p>11. It is the <hi>Violence</hi> of this <hi>Contraction</hi> upon <hi>Fear, Terrour, Pain, Cold, &amp;c.</hi> closing the small <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> and thereby repelling them, causes the <hi>Shivering</hi> in those <hi>Cases,</hi> by the <hi>Renitency</hi> of the <hi>elastick Animal Spirits</hi> springing back again, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> having gain'd more <hi>ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Force</hi> by the very <hi>Compression</hi> it self, which that <hi>Contraction</hi> causes; so that by reason of the dubious <hi>velitation</hi> (or <hi>skirmishing</hi>) between the repelling <hi>Contraction</hi> and the <hi>springing Spirits,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens a <hi>tremulous Motion,</hi> (as of <hi>quavering Springs;</hi>) which <hi>Shivering in Ague-Fits</hi> did formerly lead me to the <hi>Situation</hi> of the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Agues</hi> (when I writ my Book <hi>De Febribus intermittentibus</hi>) in the <hi>Angustiae</hi> at the end of the <hi>Vessels,</hi> which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the <hi>Membranes;</hi> the <hi>grievous Sensation</hi> of which, causes all the Shivering that happens in any Case to <hi>Animals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. By the same <hi>Contraction,</hi> when very violent, and of the whole Body, <hi>cold Sweats</hi> happen in <hi>Pain, Fear, Terrour,</hi> &amp;c. while it violently squeezes out the outmost, and therefore coldest Moisture
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52480:72"/>
of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> as <hi>Laundresses</hi> do Water out of wet Linnen by <hi>Contortion.</hi> Thus if you dip one <hi>half</hi> of a wet cold Sheet in hot Water, wrapping the hot side within the cold, or let a <hi>warm Sheet</hi> that is contorted cool on the out-side of it, and then wring it as <hi>Women</hi> do Linnen, the Water that first exudates will be cold; for in this <hi>Case</hi> the closing of the <hi>Pores</hi> avails nothing to hinder it, as long as the expressing <hi>Force</hi> masters it; more <hi>especially</hi> in <hi>Animal Bodies,</hi> wherein the Parts are so contrived, that <hi>Humours</hi> design'd for <hi>Exoretion</hi> cannot well return, and therefore must, upon <hi>Contraction,</hi> run out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that <hi>Alum,</hi> or <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which are very astringent, and therefore close the <hi>Pores,</hi> will notwithstanding cause the <hi>Mouth,</hi> or <hi>Nose,</hi> to run very plentifully with Moisture, by <hi>contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> all the <hi>Membranes</hi> about the <hi>Mouth,</hi> or <hi>Nose,</hi> and thereby squeezing out the <hi>Moisture</hi> design'd to be excern'd, which cannot return, because the <hi>Parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> are contriv'd against the return or <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance</hi> thereof; whereas <hi>Alum,</hi> or <hi>Vitriol,</hi> will stanch or stop <hi>Bloud</hi> by the same <hi>Contraction,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may return (as not being design'd to be excern'd) either into the <hi>Arteries,</hi> and so pass by other <hi>Branches</hi> thereof, or (which is more ready and natural) keep its course into the <hi>Veins.</hi> So the two <hi>Riddles</hi> (that I have known some <hi>Proud Physicians</hi> amaz'd at, tho' but <hi>Trifles</hi>) of <hi>Alum</hi> and <hi>Vitriol</hi> causing the Spittle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to come out, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of stopping it by their <hi>Astringency,</hi> and their stopping <hi>Bloud</hi> at Nose at the same time they cause the <hi>Snot,</hi> or other <hi>Humours,</hi> to run out, are unfolded.</p>
            <p>13. It is by this mighty <hi>Contraction</hi> growing to an enormous <hi>degree,</hi> that the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> being violently compressed, grow exceeding irrequiete, as upon <hi>Convulsions</hi> in great <hi>Pain,</hi> or very grievous
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52480:73"/>
Sensation at <hi>Stomach, &amp;c.</hi> while the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> compressing them with mighty <hi>Force,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what disorderly and unevenly, because of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion</hi> and <hi>Hurry</hi> he is in to relieve the <hi>Animal,</hi> they by their springiness fling up and down with great <hi>Vigour.</hi> This makes <hi>convulsive Motions</hi> have great Strength.</p>
            <p>14. The Body under this Contraction is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly shrunk by measure, especially when the Sensation is very grievous, but most of all if they cause a <hi>general Convulsion;</hi> which I manifestly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in a little Bitch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that was convulsive all over for three Hours, and was just expiring, when I gave her the <hi>Sal Volat. Oleos.</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> which perfectly restored her by relaxing the Vessels.</p>
            <p>Some may think it strange, That <hi>Nature</hi> should contrive a more nice and smart Sensation (which the <hi>Contraction</hi> of the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the Animal Spirits must cause by <hi>compressing</hi> them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in <hi>Pain,</hi> and by it; which becomes so much the more acute; whereas one would judge, That <hi>Nature</hi> would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrive its <hi>Ease</hi> than improve its <hi>Smart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You are to know, That the <hi>Pain</hi> is in order to <hi>relieve</hi> the <hi>Animal,</hi> by exciting all its <hi>Powers</hi> to defend, expel, or reject the <hi>Cause;</hi> and that, without a <hi>grievous Sensation,</hi> the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> is neither minded nor excited to do it; and the more the <hi>Pain</hi> is, the more it is stirr'd up to <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preservation,</hi> and (as was shewn) the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous do its <hi>Motions</hi> grow by the <hi>Compression</hi> of the <hi>elastick Spirits</hi> to perform that Work; so <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> not regarding the <hi>Pain</hi> (which is rather for good) as much as taking away the Cause, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that, for this <hi>Purpose;</hi> like a wise <hi>Physician,</hi> who finding a <hi>Grievance</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> not sufficient to excite effectual <hi>Vomiting,</hi> to throw away the grieving Cause, adds to the <hi>Grievance</hi> by giving a <hi>Vomit;</hi> which because (as was said) <hi>Nature</hi> is

proportionably excited <hi>to,</hi> and invigorated <hi>for Self-preservation,</hi> sufficiently sollicites and enables it, by a stronger <hi>Contraction,</hi> to reject the <hi>grieving Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the greater the Relaxation is, the more is the Rest of all Parts; and the weaker the <hi>Anim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All those three Contractions, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Vigilative, Defensive,</hi> and <hi>Intentive</hi> do, because they promote Motion, and cause it more or less, (as you find the <hi>Vigilative</hi> causes much more of it than <hi>Sleep,</hi> and the <hi>Defensive</hi> more than that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) spend the <hi>Spirits,</hi> cause <hi>Weariness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vigilative Contraction</hi> does of it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any considerable <hi>Grievance</hi> or <hi>Labour,</hi> that is, without the <hi>Denfensive</hi> or <hi>Intentive Contraction,</hi> tire the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> in about 16 <hi>Hours:</hi> Hence it is that the idlest Person, that is most free from <hi>Care, Trouble,</hi> or <hi>Pain,</hi> cannot well hold out without the Recruit of <hi>Sleep</hi> any longer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Defensive Contraction,</hi> or that of <hi>Grievances,</hi> being added to the <hi>Vigilative Contraction,</hi> the Spirits are faster spent, and the Person tired pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably sooner, according as the <hi>Grievance</hi> is <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less;</hi> and consequently the Endeavours of the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> to be rid thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:52480:75"/>To both which <hi>Contractions,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Vigilative</hi> and <hi>Defensive</hi>) if you add the <hi>Intentive,</hi> (or <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi>) then are you sooner and more tired than by only those two <hi>former Contractions;</hi> for this last Case is labouring in <hi>Pain,</hi> (or under a <hi>Grievance</hi>) which notoriously tires Man or Beast sooner than ordinary: The direct contrary to which, is sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing soundly and sweetly, without Trouble, Pain, or Dreams; for a <hi>dreaming Condition</hi> has too much of the <hi>vigilative Contraction</hi> in it, to be pure <hi>Relaxation</hi> and <hi>Recruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now according as these <hi>Contractions</hi> are, or are not added one to another, we are sooner or later before we are tired, (speaking generally, and not considering <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Habit,</hi> which concerns us not.)</p>
            <p>You see that all the three <hi>Contractions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourring, do soon and sadly tire us, that no <hi>two</hi> of them tire us as much as the <hi>three</hi> together; that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observe,</hi> That we recruit in eight Hours (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally speaking) as much by relaxation in <hi>Sleep,</hi> as we spend by <hi>vigilative Contraction</hi> in sixteen: I take the Reason of that to be, That <hi>Relaxation</hi> widening all the Passages of the <hi>Body,</hi> the Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is admitted into them more fully and freely,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52480:75"/>
as the <hi>Bloud</hi> is into the Skin in <hi>Sleep,</hi> and all <hi>Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which cause an <hi>Efflorescence</hi> thereof in those Cases. Hence it is that we are so much recruited and nourished in Sleep; that Children grow more than others proportionably; that Relaxers cause the <hi>Breasts, &amp;c.</hi> to grow.</p>

               <item>2.

               <item>3. The <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>Animal Comfort</hi> does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in having many <hi>Spirits;</hi> for one in most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Misery,</hi> by which he is much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted, cast down, depressed in Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may have great plenty of <hi>Spirits;</hi> and one that has not half as many, highly comforted, by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Objects</hi> of <hi>Sense, good News,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>4. If we staid for <hi>Comfort</hi> by a <hi>Meal</hi> of <hi>Meat, &amp;c.</hi> till it added to our <hi>Spirits,</hi> we might stay long enough; nay, if we staid for <hi>Comfort</hi> till
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52480:76"/>
we found it by that <hi>Addition,</hi> we should never find it; for we cannot in that case find what we do not feel: We possibly, after two or three days eating and drinking, may find our selves stronger; but (after all) suppose us in very great misery at the same time, Where's the Comfort of it, when the Spirits are otherwise depressed by <hi>Pain, ill News?</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>5. Hunger is a <hi>grievous Sensation</hi> at Stomach; which is cured, and we comforted, by causing a <hi>pleasant Sensation</hi> by <hi>Meat, Wine,</hi> &amp;c. instead thereof; and not by adding <hi>Spirits,</hi> which is a great Mistake. It is true indeed, that we are comforted, but it is most manifestly by pleasing the <hi>exquisite Sensation</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> has placed there for that <hi>End:</hi> Hence it is that all <hi>Cordials</hi> must be pleasing to the Stomach, or else they are no <hi>Cordials;</hi> and that <hi>Wine,</hi> and all such Things as please the <hi>Stomach,</hi> are apt to take away much of the <hi>Sharpness</hi> of <hi>Hunger,</hi> for a time at least.</item>
               <item>6. How should <hi>Wine,</hi> which has a great Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity in it, and so very good for <hi>Digestion,</hi> cure a <hi>canine Appetite,</hi> which is a <hi>grievous Sensation,</hi> but by causing a pleasant one in its room, by which means the <hi>grievous Sensation</hi> is taken off? For <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> and <hi>Grievance,</hi> (or Displeasure) which are <hi>Contraries,</hi> cannot be in the same <hi>Subject</hi> at one <hi>time.</hi> Thus it is that <hi>Opium</hi> takes off <hi>Hunger, canine Appetite,</hi> &amp;c. But of this hereafter.</item>
               <item>7. How should a Quart of Wine; drank in a minute or two, have all the <hi>comfortable Effects</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> in a <hi>quarter</hi> of an <hi>hour</hi> while it is at <hi>Stomach,</hi> if it were to stay for this Comfort till it added Spirits to ours, since the matter of <hi>Effluvia,</hi> or <hi>Fumes</hi> passing into the <hi>Rloud,</hi> is disproved?</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:52480:77"/>8. Why should our <hi>Comfort</hi> be so great while it is at <hi>Stomach,</hi> and none by that time it is got into the <hi>Bloud,</hi> but that the <hi>Stomach</hi> being very sensile, the Spirits of the <hi>Wine</hi> do highly please by their <hi>Agreeableness</hi> thereunto? It matters not whether it had Spirits or no, so it caused a <hi>pleasing Sensation;</hi> for a <hi>Draught</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> in a high <hi>Fever,</hi> and when we are very faint with <hi>Thirst,</hi> very much comforts us without any <hi>Spirits,</hi> as does a Venison-Pasty a hungry Person, by <hi>agreeable Sensation</hi> taking off the <hi>grievous Sensation</hi> (called <hi>Hunger</hi>) and all its consequent Faintness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before it can add any <hi>Spirits</hi> by Nutrition.</item>
               <item>9. What need we seek any farther? Do not we find a <hi>pleasing Sensation</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> when we are comforted with any thing, and the <hi>Comfort</hi> to bear a <hi>Proportion</hi> to the <hi>Pleasure?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>10. Are not we <hi>prompt, blithe, gay,</hi> and <hi>brave,</hi> while the <hi>Wine</hi> is at <hi>Stomach?</hi> And very often fit for nothing, <hi>dull, heavy, mopish,</hi> &amp;c. by that <hi>time</hi> it is got into the <hi>Bloud?</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Therefore we may safely conclude, That the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <hi>Wine</hi> do comfort us, by causing a <hi>pleasing Sensation,</hi> and not by adding its Spirits to ours, according to the settled Sentiment of the World, that is not yet arrived to the <hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Knowledge</hi> why the most common Cordial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts them. What Spirits has a Grain of <hi>Opium,</hi> while at Stomach, to add to ours; or can it add, if it had them? Yet no <hi>Wine</hi> comforts us as much as <hi>Opium,</hi> because it pleases us so much, (as was and will be yet much more fully shewn.)</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Nature of Sensitive Pleasure, and its Effects upon the Animal, as far as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns our present Purpose.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>SEnsitive Pleasure is a Complacency of the sensitive Soul, resulting from the Agreeableness of the Object to the Organ of Sensation:</hi> Thus are we pleased with what is agreeable to the <hi>Eye, Ear, Tongue, Stomach,</hi> &amp;c. And what is agreeable to those <hi>Organs,</hi> is agreeable to the <hi>Animal</hi> in general: 1. Because <hi>God</hi> has made and appointed them (especially the <hi>sensile Membrane</hi> at Stomach) to be as it were the Touchstone of what is agreeable to the <hi>Animal.</hi> 2. Because the <hi>Membranes</hi> (or <hi>Organs</hi>) are of the same <hi>active Principles</hi> with the <hi>Animal's Body</hi> in general; otherwise they would not be fit <hi>Tasters, Triers,</hi> or <hi>Touchstones</hi> of what is good or bad for the <hi>Body</hi> in general.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>active Principles</hi> of the <hi>Membranes,</hi> (or Organs) are <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> and <hi>oily Parts,</hi> or a <hi>Sal Volatile Oleosum,</hi> which is predominant in them, and all the Parts of the <hi>Body;</hi> therefore such Things as have a <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> join'd with some <hi>oily Parts,</hi> must be in a special manner agreeable and pleasing to the <hi>Membranes;</hi> for <hi>simile fimili gaudeat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is, That what abound in Volatile Salt, as <hi>Snails, Earthworms,</hi> and Things of that <hi>kind,</hi> are such fine <hi>Anodynes,</hi> and so pleasing to the <hi>Membranes,</hi> &amp;c. That the Seed of <hi>Animals,</hi> which is a <hi>Sal Volatile Oleosum,</hi> and Things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Onions, Garlick, Rocket, Sives, Bears Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:52480:78"/>
               <hi>Oysters, Cockles, Shallot,</hi> &amp;c. do so please and tickle the <hi>Venereal Membranes,</hi> and thereby <hi>excite Venery;</hi> and that such Things are generally so very agreeable to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> (with which we are mainly concerned, as the Chief Judge of what is agreeable to the <hi>Animal</hi>) and so main Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of <hi>Relishes, Sauces,</hi> &amp;c. to render them pleasing to it.</p>
            <p>Here it is obvious to <hi>note,</hi> (what is also very commonly observed) That the most pleasing Things to the <hi>Stomach, Venereal Membranes,</hi> &amp;c. have those <hi>Principles</hi> more active, warm, and tickling, than the <hi>Membranes</hi> themselves, because the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> is highly pleased with what fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actuates, tickles, and causes an Ovation of the <hi>Spiritus insiti</hi> of the <hi>Membranes.</hi> Hence bare Warmth is so very pleasing, as are also gentle <hi>Frictions</hi> of the <hi>Head, Back,</hi> &amp;c. for the same <hi>Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <p>1. The oily Parts (as all know) do please the Feeling (with which we have to do) by their smooth, gentle, and soft touch. Thus Milk, Emulsions, and other <hi>Anodynes,</hi> as the Root and Flower of <hi>Water Lily, White Lily,</hi> &amp;c. become agreeable to the <hi>Membranes,</hi> and theresore relax and ease <hi>Pain.</hi> Hence it is that all <hi>Aliments</hi> have an agreeable Sweetness, the Pleasure whereof takes off the grievous Sensation called Hunger.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of oily Parts, because they do not so actuate, stir, and titillate the <hi>Spiritus insiti,</hi> is but flat, slow, and dull, without they are joined with some other Particles that are pleasing to the <hi>Membranes,</hi> that actuate and finely titillate the Membranes, and <hi>Spiritus insiti;</hi> therefore to make them highly and charmingly pleasing, they should have join'd therewith,</p>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:52480:79"/>2. <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> being a more <hi>active agreeable Principle,</hi> which may finely and pleasingly excite, actuate, titillate, and cause an Ovation in the <hi>Spiritus insiti,</hi> as <hi>Onions, &amp;c.</hi> at <hi>Stomach, Sem. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</hi> upon the <hi>Venereal Membranes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>But, as was said of the <hi>Oily Parts,</hi> That they cannot cause so exalted a <hi>Pleasure</hi> without the <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> so the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> alone, or too little qualified, and smooth'd over with Oily Parts, is too rude, pungent, or acrimonious, as in <hi>Cantharides, Bees, Pismire, Asarabacca, Spear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Crowsfoot,</hi> and other <hi>Vomitory Volatiles,</hi> which becomes so by over-stinging the <hi>Membranes,</hi> and stirring the <hi>Spiritus insiti</hi> overmuch into a sort of <hi>Fury,</hi> instead of an <hi>agreeable Ovation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It follows therefore, That it is neither <hi>Oily Parts</hi> alone, which if too much, often nauseates the <hi>Stomach,</hi> nor <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> alone, no nor every <hi>Mixture</hi> thereof, but a certain due <hi>Proportion</hi> of both, so as to have the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> somewhat more predominant than in our Membranes, that it may comfortably <hi>actuate, titillate,</hi> and <hi>excite</hi> our <hi>Spirits,</hi> as <hi>Warmth, Frications, &amp;c.</hi> do, must cause the most <hi>charming</hi> and <hi>exalted Pleasure;</hi> For Things exactly of the same <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Oil</hi> and <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> with our <hi>Membranes,</hi> can cause but a slow <hi>Sensation,</hi> because they make little or no <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> therein, which is one of the great <hi>Requisites</hi> of <hi>Sensation;</hi> for that which makes no <hi>Alteration,</hi> as the <hi>Saliva</hi> in the <hi>Mouth,</hi> the same <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> that is in the <hi>Eye,</hi> of <hi>Sound</hi> as in the <hi>Ear</hi> already, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot be perceiv'd, because where no <hi>Difference</hi> is made, nothing can be perceiv'd, for the <hi>Organ</hi> is affected but as it was before the <hi>Object</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, and consequently we cannot perceive that any new thing was objected, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be at all sensible thereof; so if it makes but

a small <hi>Difference,</hi> the <hi>Sensation</hi> can be but slow, and slight Proportionably, as of a little degree of <hi>Light</hi> more than is in the <hi>Eye, &amp;c.</hi> for it is only that little that is perceived; for (as is notorious to all who understand any Thing of these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Sensation</hi>) it is only the <hi>Excess</hi> of <hi>Impression</hi> to what was upon the <hi>Organ</hi> before, that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for that is all that is <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w</hi> above what was thereon before, and therefore all that is to be, or can be perceived more than was before (as was said.) Hence it is, that <hi>Flesh</hi> or other <hi>Things,</hi> that have the <hi>Sal-Volatile Oleosum,</hi> or the same <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> that the <hi>Membranes</hi> of the <hi>Stomach, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Parts, &amp;c.</hi> have, in much the same <hi>degree,</hi> affect them but with a gentle <hi>Pleasure.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must have such a mixture wherein the <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> as in <hi>Semine Animali, Onions, &amp;c.</hi> is sensibly more active than in our <hi>Membranes,</hi> to actuate the <hi>Spiritus insui</hi> of the <hi>Membranes,</hi> and cause an Ovation therein, which is (as was said of Comfortable <hi>Warmth, Frications,</hi> &amp;c.) very agreeable, and pleasant to the <hi>Sensitive Soul,</hi> who looks upon such as friendly and active Auxiliaries to our <hi>Spirits,</hi> whereas the other are as <hi>lazy Friends,</hi> wherein he takes not the like <hi>Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency;</hi> You may perceive much of the Difference in this Case in <hi>Mustums,</hi> (or new <hi>unfermented Wines</hi>) which indeed do lazily please by their <hi>acceptable sweetness,</hi> but do not so <hi>actuate</hi> the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus insiti</hi> as the same <hi>Oily Parts</hi> when rendered <hi>active, spirituous,</hi> and nearer the Nature of <hi>actual Heat</hi> after <hi>Fermentation;</hi> which then being very readily actuated by the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> do briskly and chearfully return the <hi>Kindness</hi> by <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating</hi> our <hi>Spirits,</hi> and putting them into a pleasing <hi>Ovation,</hi> of which I could give you a very pat and pregnant Instance in a Thing actuated into a very high degree of pleasing by <hi>Frication</hi> and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52480:80"/>
               <hi>Agitation,</hi> which was otherwise almost insensible; but Modesty forbids me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> How the sluggish Oily Parts in <hi>Mustums</hi> do, by being <hi>spiritualized</hi> by <hi>Fermentation,</hi> as it were, supply the place of <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> in <hi>actuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and in some measure <hi>titillating,</hi> tho' not to that high degree as the more <hi>poinant Volatile salt</hi> in <hi>Semine Virili,</hi> and the <hi>like,</hi> because the <hi>Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Oily</hi> Particles, however separated, disgre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and set at at liberty by <hi>Fermentation,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain much of their smoothness, and never can arrive at the <hi>titillating</hi> Power of <hi>Volatile Salts,</hi> as is evident in <hi>Amphrodistacks</hi> upon the Account of <hi>Volatile Salts,</hi> as <hi>Cantharides, Bees, Pismire, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Wine</hi> in 100 times the quantity cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in <hi>Titillation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it enough to have the <hi>Sal Volatile Oleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi> duely qualified, as to the <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> of both the <hi>Oily</hi> and <hi>Saline Parts,</hi> and these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, and of a fine brisk and gently tickling Activity;</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Oleous</hi> and <hi>Salino Volatile</hi> Parts should (to make a compleat and permanent <hi>Pleaser</hi> of the <hi>Membranes</hi>) be very intimately combined, so as not easily to separate one from the other, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they will not duely conspire and co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to cause the <hi>Pleasure,</hi> but the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> will act separately as such, that is <hi>irritating,</hi> and not finely and pleasantly Tickling, as <hi>Semen Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, &amp;c.</hi> wherein the Oil and <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> are firmly join'd together.</p>
            <p>I therefore conclude, That the most excellent Thing to please the <hi>Membranes,</hi> must be such as <hi>Semen Humanum,</hi> that is, not too <hi>Oily,</hi> (for then
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52480:80"/>
it would not sufficiently please by a fine <hi>Titilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and actuating of our Spirits) nor too full of <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> as <hi>Mustard, Asarabacca, &amp;c.</hi> nor have too <hi>accrimonious</hi> a <hi>Volatile salt</hi> with too little <hi>Oleous Parts</hi> to correct it, for in both these last Cases the <hi>Irritation</hi> would be <hi>grievous;</hi> nor have the <hi>Oleous</hi> and <hi>Volatile</hi> loosely combined. But,</p>
            <p>That it should be a <hi>Sal Volatile Oleosum, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the</hi> Volatile Parts <hi>are brisker, and somewhat more active than ours, yet so corrected by</hi> Oleous Parts <hi>intimately combined therewith, as to render it of a most agreeable and pleasant Titillation, such as would please all Membranes, but especially those that have most accute Sensation, as the</hi> Stomach, <hi>and</hi> Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Membranes, (both which <hi>Opium</hi> most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly pleases) which are ordered so to be for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the <hi>Individuum,</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> the one to invite us to <hi>Eat,</hi> and the other to <hi>Procreate;</hi> But to satisfie you yet farther, as to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> which concerns us mostly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 1. That the more <hi>exalted</hi> and <hi>intense</hi> the <hi>Pleasure</hi> is, the higher are its <hi>Effects</hi> upon the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Soul</hi> in pleasing, comforting, and elevating it; and upon the <hi>Body,</hi> in relaxing all the <hi>Sensile Parts</hi> thereof, as that of <hi>Wine</hi> is higher than that of <hi>Mustum, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 2. That the better the <hi>Organ</hi> is disposed for <hi>Sensation,</hi> the higher the <hi>Pleasure</hi> or <hi>Displeasure</hi> is; for he that has his <hi>Nose, Tongue, Ear, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, &amp;c.</hi> ill disposed for <hi>Smelling, Tasting, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Feeling, &amp;c.</hi> has not so much <hi>Pleasure</hi> in sweet <hi>Odours,</hi> good <hi>Tastes, Musick, Pleasers</hi> of the <hi>Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi> nor so much <hi>Displeasure</hi> in bad <hi>Scents, &amp;c.</hi> It follows,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:52480:81"/>
               <hi>Note</hi> 3. That <hi>cujus est Dolor ejusdem est Voluptas,</hi> that is, the <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Membrane</hi> that is capable of <hi>intense Pleasure,</hi> is so of <hi>intense Pain</hi> or <hi>Displeasure.</hi> For <hi>Instance,</hi> If the <hi>Stomach</hi> be capable of great <hi>Grievances,</hi> it is so of great <hi>Pleasure,</hi> God having distributed them also equally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 4. That, since the great <hi>Use, End,</hi> and <hi>Business</hi> of <hi>Sensation,</hi> is to give <hi>notice,</hi> and inform the <hi>Animal</hi> of what is, or is not good and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to it, it follows, that the <hi>Wisdom</hi> that made us would place the most exquisitely and critically disposed <hi>Organ</hi> (or <hi>Membrane</hi>) of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> where such <hi>notice</hi> is most requisite and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and consequently there must be more <hi>Pleasure</hi> or <hi>Displeasure</hi> conceiv'd at Things agreeable or disagreeable, that the descending and relieving <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> may be proportionable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note</hi> 5. That such exquisite, exact, and nice Notice is most requisite at <hi>Stomach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because all our Nutriment, good and bad, is to pass that Way to be Judged of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because it is the last <hi>Part</hi> that it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at before it receives a considerable change; for when it is changed, no such true and sincere <hi>Iudgment</hi> can be given thereof, as could be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because the Faults, Defects, or Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences of the <hi>Taste,</hi> and the <hi>External Senses,</hi> are to be remedied and corrected there, or no where, therefore the <hi>Stomach</hi> is as the last Judge of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> and should be most exact and infallible in <hi>Iudging;</hi> or as the last inner, or <hi>Main Guard</hi> in a <hi>Fort, Town,</hi> or <hi>Castle,</hi> which if the <hi>Enemy</hi> pass, the whole is endanger'd, if not lost.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because the Concern being so great, Sensation should be the more exquisite there, to excite the <hi>Animal Powers</hi> to make Defence, by
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52480:81"/>
repelling, rejecting, or detruding the <hi>Enemy,</hi> which <hi>Powers</hi> (as has been intimated) are excited according to the <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Sensation,</hi> especially seeing there is no voluntary <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Contraction</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> but only the <hi>Natural,</hi> which is always excited by <hi>Sensation</hi> in such Cases, or not at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Sensation</hi> should be <hi>critical</hi> and accurate at <hi>Stomach,</hi> to inform us precisely when we should Eat or Drink.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To inform us exactly when we have Eaten or Drank enough; for all this is done by <hi>Sensation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>God</hi> has placed a most Sensile <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane</hi> at the <hi>Stomach,</hi> as most manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By its taking, and giving notice of such Minute <hi>Things,</hi> that no <hi>Sense, Part, Organ,</hi> or <hi>Membrane</hi> can; for it takes <hi>notice</hi> of, and informs the <hi>Sensitive Soul</hi> (as has been said) of the Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Particles of the <hi>Crocus</hi> and <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> which are so indefinitely small, that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Membrane</hi> or <hi>Organ</hi> of Sensation, but that at <hi>Stomach,</hi> can take notice thereof, because the <hi>Crocus</hi> and <hi>Regulus,</hi> after they have afforded 1000 <hi>Vomits</hi> from their Bodies, are not sensibly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished either in <hi>Weight</hi> or <hi>Bulk;</hi> nor doth the <hi>Stomach</hi> take and give a slight, but very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>notice</hi> thereof, that is sufficiently powerful to excite not only all the <hi>Natural Powers</hi> of the Part, and of all the <hi>Auxiliary Muscles</hi> that usually assist to <hi>Vomit,</hi> but to cause a <hi>Contraction</hi> (and that very often strongly Convulsive) of all, or most of the <hi>Muscles,</hi> and <hi>Membranes</hi> of the whole Body, so great is the <hi>Sway,</hi> or <hi>Regimen</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> by <hi>vertue</hi> of its <hi>exquisite sensility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:52480:82"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By its giving <hi>notice</hi> of <hi>inimicous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> and very tenuious <hi>Effluvias,</hi> that fly in the <hi>Air,</hi> which no Organ of <hi>Sensation,</hi> or <hi>Membrane,</hi> but that at <hi>Stomach,</hi> can observe. For <hi>Instance,</hi> Some that hate <hi>Cats</hi> very much, will know, that there is a <hi>Cat</hi> in the same <hi>Room</hi> with them, tho' silent, and shut up in a <hi>Trunk</hi> or <hi>Cupboard,</hi> where neither the <hi>Eye, Ear, Nose, Taste,</hi> or immediate <hi>Feeling,</hi> can be at all concerned or affected. That it is the <hi>Stomach</hi> that is affected, is apparent, (tho' a Thing not thought of;) 1. Because the <hi>first notice</hi> they have is plainly at <hi>Stomach</hi> by a kind of faint <hi>Distress,</hi> not unlike a beginning <hi>Nausea;</hi> If the Curious will enquire, they will find it to be as I say. 2. Because all <hi>Perception</hi> of Material Things is by <hi>Sensation,</hi> and that it is evident no other <hi>Organ</hi> of <hi>Sensation,</hi> or <hi>Membrane,</hi> is concerned. 3. Because, if the <hi>Cat</hi> continues in the Room, and is not removed, they fall a Vomiting, or into <hi>Anxieties</hi> or <hi>great Distresses</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> or <hi>Faintings</hi> and <hi>Syncopes,</hi> which are the common and known <hi>Effects</hi> of a grieved or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed <hi>Stomach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Just so does it (tho' these Things are not, or not duely observed) take, and give notice of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilential Effluvias,</hi> which cause the like <hi>Faintings,</hi> or a kind of <hi>Nausea</hi> at <hi>Stomach;</hi> Thus People discern that they are (as they call it) <hi>Plague struck,</hi> and often fall (as in the Case of the <hi>Effluvias</hi> of the <hi>Cat</hi>) into dangerous <hi>Deliquiums</hi> and <hi>Syncopes,</hi> of which many in <hi>Plague</hi> Times suddenly dye, as Cat Haters would (for ought I know) if they continue long in the same Room with a Cat, as they do with <hi>Pestilential Effluvias;</hi> Therefore it were good presently to remove them from the <hi>Place</hi> wherein they were struck, because the <hi>Air</hi> (as the <hi>Room</hi> wherein the <hi>Cat</hi> is) is fill'd with the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52480:82"/>
pernicious Particles; for you see in the Case of the <hi>Cat,</hi> that removing the Man or the <hi>Cat</hi> gives Relief, and it were better removing the <hi>Man,</hi> but that he is more Cumbersom, because the <hi>Room</hi> is already tainted with the <hi>Effluvias,</hi> and in the <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>Plague</hi> it is only the Person that can be well removed. This proves how useful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movals may be, and how convenient in <hi>Plague Time</hi> it would be to remove to the <hi>Wind-side</hi> of a <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>City</hi> that is tainted, according as the <hi>Wind</hi> changes, and how convenient <hi>Winds</hi> are to convey away the <hi>Effluviams,</hi> and good Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machick Cordials, that are warm, and pleasant, to fortifie the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and open the <hi>Pores,</hi> which all Things that cause a sense of <hi>Pleasure</hi> do, as <hi>Wine, Spirits, &amp;c.</hi> to which if some good <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> were added, it would be most convenient. How many <hi>Stories</hi> have we of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons well fill'd with <hi>Wine,</hi> who wonderfully escaped <hi>Infection;</hi> I pray <hi>God</hi> this <hi>Hint</hi> may be improv'd to the <hi>Preservation</hi> of <hi>Mankind;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I add, that much may be in a good <hi>Quantity</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> in this Case; 1. Because, <hi>Quod intus est prohibet alienum,</hi> that is, <hi>What is within hinders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of another Thing.</hi> 2. Because the <hi>Perspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> will be the greater, both upon the Account of the greater opening of the <hi>Pores</hi> by the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of the <hi>Wine,</hi> and the greater <hi>Quantity</hi> of Matter to be perspired carry off the <hi>venemous Particles.</hi> 3. Because the <hi>Sensitive Soul</hi> is thereby much comforted, refreshed, and invigorated; but I would have the <hi>Wine</hi> so used, as to keep a continual <hi>Warmth, Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> at <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> which is the main Cause of all the good; I think a <hi>Glass</hi> every Hour, after taking 2 or 3 at first, may hit the Mark best, the Reason of which will appear hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:52480:83"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Stomach's exquisite Disposition</hi> to <hi>Sensation,</hi> above all other <hi>Organs</hi> and <hi>Membranes,</hi> appears by this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Offences of the other <hi>Organs</hi> of <hi>Sensation</hi> (even by their proper <hi>Objects</hi>) do often affect the <hi>Stomach</hi> more than those very <hi>Senses</hi> or <hi>Organs</hi> themselves. For <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> If we smell a great Stench, the <hi>Stomach</hi> is often more offended thereat than the <hi>Nose,</hi> as is manifest from the <hi>Vomitings, Faintings,</hi> and <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiums</hi> that are caused by the <hi>Stomach</hi> upon that <hi>Account;</hi> so the bare <hi>Seeing, Feeling,</hi> and <hi>Tasting</hi> of a nasty Thing, do cause <hi>Nauseas, &amp;c.</hi> at <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> yea, the very naming of such Things has much offended it, and caused such <hi>Effects,</hi> which may be thought very strange, considering that there pass no <hi>Effluvias</hi> from the <hi>sound</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> but the <hi>Reason</hi> will appear in the following <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All <hi>Passions, Commotions,</hi> and <hi>Pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations,</hi> that happen in the Body, do often affect the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and sometimes so grievously, as to cause <hi>Nauseas, Vomitings,</hi> great <hi>Anxieties</hi> at <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Faintings,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Fear, Terrour, Surprizes, Anger, Grief, Pain</hi> in other Parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> causing some Motion in the <hi>Animal</hi> more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, (of which the <hi>Stomach</hi> being sensible) do cause the aforesaid Disturbances; Therefore it is no <hi>Wonder,</hi> if the <hi>Hearing</hi> one mention a Nasty Thing, which causes an <hi>Abhorrence,</hi> and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions consequent thereunto, should (as was said in the precedent <hi>Paragraph</hi>) cause the nice <hi>Stomach</hi> to be offended.</p>
            <p>It is most manifest from the Premises, that no <hi>Organ</hi> or <hi>Membrane,</hi> can compare with the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> as to its <hi>exquisite Disposition</hi> for <hi>Sensation;</hi> it follows then,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:52480:83"/>
               <hi>That Grievances or Pleasure at Stomach must have the greater Effects;</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Because the Intenseness of either will be proportionable to the <hi>Sensation.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Because the <hi>Powers</hi> of the <hi>Animal</hi> that are to defend it (which are <hi>Contractions</hi>) are affected according to the <hi>Sensation,</hi> and that it is there most requisite sensibly to affect them.</item>
               <item>3. Because what affects the <hi>Stomach</hi> influences the whole <hi>Animal,</hi> more than the <hi>Sensation</hi> of any other Part.</item>
               <item>4. Because of the considerable Stay that Things make at <hi>Stomach</hi> to cause <hi>Grievance</hi> or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> whereas that of <hi>Pleasure</hi> is generally very momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in other Cases.</item>
               <item>5. Because, being within the <hi>Body,</hi> we carry our <hi>Pleasure</hi> or <hi>Grievance</hi> with us, (as a <hi>Vade Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>) wherever we go, and therefore,</item>
               <item>6. It is a <hi>Pleasure, &amp;c.</hi> that cannot so well be taken away from us, as that of the <hi>Tongue, Ear, Nose, Eye, &amp;c.</hi> may, by removing the <hi>Objects;</hi> and therefore it remains with us in our very <hi>Sleep,</hi> as far as we are capable of <hi>Sensation</hi> at that Time, causing pleasant <hi>Dreams, &amp;c.</hi> and so agreeably entertaining us <hi>Sleeping</hi> or <hi>Waking,</hi> when the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all the other <hi>Senses</hi> fails us.

            <p>It is for the <hi>several Reasons</hi> contain'd in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> that the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Grievance,</hi> as <hi>Hunger, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> are more <hi>considerable</hi> and <hi>remarkable</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> and that Things agreeable thereto have, by way of <hi>Eminence,</hi> gain'd the Name of Cordials; That <hi>Wine, Spirits, Opium, &amp;c.</hi> do cause a more permanent and notable <hi>Gaity, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness, Good Humour, Serenity, Promptitude, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Spirits,</hi> (or <hi>Sensitive Soul) Bravery, Courage, Magnanimity, Euphory,</hi> or easie under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going of <hi>Business, Relaxation,</hi> with all its Effects, as <hi>Deadness of the Eye, Dilatation of the Papilla, Perspiration,</hi> &amp;c. which are hardly noted in other <hi>short Pleasures,</hi> unless it be in that eminent (tho' short) one of <hi>Venus,</hi> which is a <hi>Pleasure</hi> of the same <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Feeling,</hi> as that of <hi>Opium</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> are.</p>
            <p>Therefore pleasing the <hi>Stomach</hi> is one of the greatest Things to be regarded in the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> to Comfort, Satisfie, or Compose the <hi>Spirits;</hi> by which Means I have often performed such Cures, that neither I, nor (I suppose) any other, could otherwise perform, namely, <hi>Dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Appetite, Untowardness at Stomach,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>The <hi>Stomach</hi> is grieved (for it will concern us to know how, because <hi>Opium</hi> causes <hi>Vomiting, &amp;c.</hi>) generally speaking;</p>

away the <hi>Pain,</hi> if it once sensibly decreases; and consequently all <hi>Physicians</hi> should then not give any more <hi>Opium,</hi> tho' the <hi>Pain</hi> is not yet quite off: For if the <hi>Relaxation,</hi> caused by <hi>Pleasant Sensation,</hi> was of force enough to overcome the greater <hi>Contraction</hi> by the greater <hi>Pain,</hi> which opposed it more strongly, it will suffice to overcome the less.

               <item>1. Because <hi>Perspiration</hi> is the only <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>infallible Effect</hi> thereof, by reason that the <hi>Levity</hi> of the <hi>Fumes</hi> causes them as certainly to pass at the <hi>Pores</hi> when open, as <hi>Smoak</hi> passes up at an open <hi>Chimney.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Because <hi>Sweat</hi> is an <hi>uncertain Effect</hi> thereof, for it requires that the <hi>Body</hi> be well fill'd with moisture, tho' there is a <hi>Relaxation</hi> or <hi>Opening</hi> of the <hi>Pores;</hi> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> very rightly intimates in that <hi>Aphorism</hi> of his that I cited in the last <hi>Chapter.</hi> 1. Because <hi>Sweat</hi> has not that <hi>Levity</hi> that the <hi>Fumes</hi> have, to cause it readily to move as soon as the <hi>Pores</hi> are open. 2. Because <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation</hi> is more apt to <hi>receive, detain,</hi> and <hi>suspend Humours.</hi> 3. Because the protrusive Motion of the <hi>Heart</hi> is weaker in all <hi>Relaxations;</hi> and all see how much its <hi>Vigorous Protrusion</hi> contributes to <hi>Sweat</hi> upon <hi>Action.</hi> 4. Because a <hi>Heartfull</hi> of Bloud does not make such a <hi>Push</hi> forward when the <hi>Arteries</hi> are widen'd by <hi>Relaxation.</hi> 5. Sweat having more of Continuity, Consistence, and Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity, cannot flow out so readily at the Pores, as

a meer Vapour. However, if the <hi>Body</hi> be full of <hi>Moisture,</hi> and the <hi>Pores</hi> open, there being a Natural Course that <hi>Way,</hi> and the <hi>Heart</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually protruding it farther and farther, a <hi>Sweat</hi> follows, and that whether they Sleep or not.</item>
               <item>3. Because <hi>Sweat</hi> (as was in some sort intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) is sometimes caused by the <hi>strong Protrusion</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> as in <hi>Motion, &amp;c.</hi> and upon that <hi>Account</hi> comes more under the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Fluxes</hi> caused by <hi>Contraction,</hi> than <hi>Relaxation,</hi> of which <hi>Perspiration</hi> is a constant Effect.</item>
               <item>4. Because <hi>Sweat</hi> is sometimes caused by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of <hi>Contraction, viz.</hi> the <hi>Compression</hi> of the whole <hi>Body</hi> by a violent <hi>Defensive Contraction,</hi> as in <hi>great Terrour, Agonies,</hi> and the like; causing thereby (as was shewn) by the Comparison of a wet Sheet wrung, (whose out <hi>side</hi> is cold) a <hi>cold Sweat,</hi> which that of <hi>Alum</hi> or <hi>Vitriol,</hi> caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Exudation</hi> of the <hi>Spittle</hi> into the <hi>Mouth</hi> by constringing the Parts, does illustrate very plainly.</item>

            <p>Therefore you see I had just Cause not to mention <hi>Sweat</hi> as a certain and proper <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Relaxation,</hi> without good <hi>Distinctions</hi> first made; tho' unwary <hi>Authors</hi> that talk any Thing one after another, not knowing what they say, make it their common saying, That <hi>Sleep</hi> and <hi>Opium</hi> stops all <hi>Fluxes</hi> but <hi>Sweat,</hi> whereas they should have rather said, but <hi>Perspiration;</hi> for <hi>Opium</hi> and <hi>Sleep</hi> also will sometimes hinder <hi>Sweat, viz.</hi> that from <hi>Pain, Terrour, &amp;c.</hi> and that as happens just upon awaking by the stronger <hi>Systole</hi> of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Contraction</hi> of the whole Body, and that also upon motion, unless the Body be (as was said) full of <hi>Humours,</hi> or Moisture. Therefore it is a <hi>Vulgar Errour</hi> to say <hi>Sweat</hi> instead of <hi>Perspiration</hi> in the Case aforesaid.</p>

                  <item>5.

                        <hi>Therefore</hi> it is also past doubt, That the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> is more <hi>active, acrimonious,</hi> and <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillating,</hi> than those in our <hi>Membranes,</hi> or in <hi>Sem.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is very obvious and evident, That <hi>Opium</hi> is <hi>Sulphureous.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Because the Juice of the <hi>Poppy,</hi> whereof it is made, is of it self, when it drops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>out of the <hi>Incisions, Milk-white,</hi> which colour in Liquids (especially the Juice of Plants) proceeds from <hi>Sulphureous Particles</hi> mixt with <hi>Water</hi> (or <hi>Phlegm</hi>) as <hi>Milk, Emulsions, Chyle, Cinnamon Water,</hi> and the <hi>Tinctures</hi> of all <hi>Sulphureous</hi> Things dropt into <hi>Water,</hi> do evince.</item>
                  <item>2. Because it is <hi>inflammable;</hi> for nothing is so but what is <hi>Sulphureous.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Because <hi>Opium</hi> will soften with a <hi>dry Warmth,</hi> which all, and only, <hi>Sulphureous Things</hi> will do; as all <hi>Rosins, Tallows, Pitches, Turpentines, Oils,</hi> and such <hi>Sulphureous Things.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Because it is very <hi>bitter,</hi> and that Oleose Particles are always (as Dr. <hi>Grew</hi> and <hi>Sylvius</hi> truely say) one Ingredient of a <hi>bitter Taste.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. Its <hi>tawny colour</hi> does also (as was said accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Dr. <hi>Grew</hi>) argue much <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                  </item>

                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:52480:95"/>6. Its hot Taste proves the same; for a proper <hi>hot Taste</hi> is from <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as the <hi>biting</hi> or <hi>pungent</hi> is from <hi>Volatile Salt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. Because of its pungent and strong Smell, which denotes <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>8. Its being so dissolvable as it is in Spirit of Wine, Brandy, and other <hi>Sulphureous Menstruums,</hi> proves the same.</item>
                  <item>9. Its <hi>dissolving Quality</hi> argues, that it has the same <hi>Principles</hi> with our <hi>Skin</hi> and <hi>Flesh,</hi> which are <hi>Oleose</hi> as well as <hi>Salino-volatile,</hi> and that nothing is a compleat <hi>Dissolver,</hi> but such as have both; because <hi>Agreeableness</hi> in Principles being the <hi>Basis</hi> of Dissolution, (as you see in <hi>Menstruums,</hi> and the Things therein dissolv'd) there is no good, kind, or compleat Dissolvent of our Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but what participates of both; because otherwise there would be a <hi>Disagreement</hi> in one Respect.</item>
                  <item>10. It appears by <hi>Autopsie</hi> upon the <hi>Chymical Analysis</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> &amp;c. that it has a very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Quantity of <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>11. So if you only dissolve it in Water, you'll find much Sulphureous Substance undissolved at the bottom.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p>12. All (or most) of the <hi>Modern Authors</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute its Operation to <hi>Sulphur,</hi> agreeing, that it is well impregnated therewith.</p>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <hi>Therefore Opium</hi> consists very much, as to its <hi>active Principles,</hi> of a <hi>Sal-Volatile-Sulphureum;</hi> but still this does not compleat a most agreeable <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum;</hi> 1. Because it may be a <hi>Sal-Volatile-Resinosum,</hi> and yet be a <hi>Sal-Volatile-Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureum.</hi> 2. If it be a <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum,</hi> the Oil and the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> may be so disjoin'd, as not to conspire and co-operate to please the <hi>Membranes,</hi> but act separately, as <hi>Oil</hi> and <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> given out of divers <hi>Spoons,</hi> and cause no more
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52480:95"/>
               <hi>Effect</hi> than <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Olives</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sal Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enoniack</hi> taken inwardly, one acting too softly, lazily, and greasily, to cause any brisk and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Ovation</hi> of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and the other too rudely stinging the Membranes; therefore we must proceed in our <hi>Enquiry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Opium</hi> has a sort of Resinous <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> that is loose, and not united with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Volatile Salt;</hi> which plainly appears;
<list>
                  <item>1. Because, if you dissolve <hi>Opium</hi> in <hi>Water,</hi> cold or hot, or any Watery <hi>Menstruum,</hi> you'll find a good quantity of <hi>Rosin</hi> undissolved at <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,</hi> while the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> is all or most dissolved in the Water, (especially if the Water be often repeated) and quite separated from the <hi>Resinous Part</hi> which subsides, without any more trouble; which shews, that the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> and it are not combined, but in a very loose and distinct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</item>
                  <item>
                     <p>2. Because, if you first dissolve <hi>Opium</hi> in <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> which imbibes the <hi>Rosin,</hi> it is easily again precipitated by plain <hi>Water,</hi> leaving behind it all or most of the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> in the Form of a <hi>red Tincture</hi> in the <hi>Menstruum,</hi> as it does also in the former Case.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Note,</hi> That the <hi>Resinous Part</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> has no Effect as an <hi>Opiate,</hi> for if it be well washed with Water (as was said) it has no Operation of that kind, or so little, that it is not worth the minding, but all the <hi>Vertue, Specifick Taste, Smell, &amp;c.</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in that <hi>red Tincture,</hi> which has all the good <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> as Experience assures us.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:52480:96"/>3. Because, if <hi>Opium</hi> be very much torrefied, most of the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> is evaporated, and with it most, if not all, the <hi>Vertue</hi> of <hi>Opium;</hi> but the <hi>Rosin</hi> remains as a deadish Stuff in Respect of the <hi>good Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> tho' it is (as shall be proved) the Producer of the ill <hi>Effects</hi> thereof. Therefore this Rosin must be wholly rejected.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Red <hi>Tincture</hi> aforesaid has all, or most of the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> in it.
<list>
                  <item>1. Because <hi>Water</hi> is the Proper Menstruum for Saline Things, and that the <hi>Tincture</hi> reduced to an <hi>Extract</hi> gives very much in <hi>moist Weather;</hi> which Quality it must have from the <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> because it has very little Fixed Salt.</item>
                  <item>2. Because the Specifick <hi>Bitterness</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from <hi>Volatile salt,</hi> and <hi>Oily Parts,</hi> is wholly in that <hi>Red Tincture.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Because that <hi>Tincture</hi> has also the Specifick <hi>Rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of <hi>Smell</hi> that the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> (as was shewn) gives the <hi>Opium,</hi> by the Help of some <hi>Oily Parts.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Because that <hi>Tincture,</hi> reduced to an Extract, has the <hi>biting</hi> Taste of <hi>Opium,</hi> which (as was shewn) proceeds from its <hi>Volatile Salt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <p>5. Because that <hi>Extract incides, discusses, resolves,</hi> is <hi>Psilothrick, titillates to Venery,</hi> causes <hi>Itchings</hi> in the Skin, <hi>acrimonious Sweats, &amp;c.</hi> all which are (as was shewn) the Effects of <hi>Volatile Salt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what need I insist so much upon its <hi>Effects</hi> to prove it? When,</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>6.

               <hi>Obj.</hi> It may be said, That the <hi>Rosin</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> is but as other <hi>Rosins,</hi> therefore why should it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend so much in the Case of <hi>Opium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> For Three very manifest Reasons; 1. That it is a <hi>Rosin</hi> of a peculiar <hi>Clamminess</hi> and <hi>Viscidity.</hi> 2. That it has Acrimony in't, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by its Purging Quality if it be given in any Quantity, and that the <hi>Stomach</hi> dissolves it (as was shewn.) 3. That it is join'd with the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Particles of the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> of the <hi>Opium,</hi> which, when it sticks to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> it holds to it, tearing it too long and continually with those <hi>Points</hi> upon the same <hi>Part,</hi> which must cause <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress</hi> and <hi>Vomitings</hi> in Weak <hi>Stomachs</hi> that cannot digest it, and that sometimes to no <hi>Purpose,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon follows <hi>Convulsions, Hiccoughs, &amp;c.</hi> and all <hi>Endeavours falling,</hi> an <hi>Yielding</hi> or <hi>Succumbency,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by <hi>Faintings, Syncopes, Leipothymies,</hi> &amp;c. and sometimes <hi>Death</hi> it self, for it must be a most grievous Thing to be so continually stung in the same Part of the most <hi>sensile Membrane</hi> of the <hi>Stomach</hi> without Remedy or Redress. If some have died of a little <hi>Gum Ammoniacum,</hi> or <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penum,</hi> sticking to the <hi>Intestinum Rectum</hi> or <hi>Colon,</hi> which are the Sink of the <hi>Body,</hi> and fitted for and used to bear all <hi>Faeces</hi> and <hi>Trash,</hi> much more must the <hi>nice</hi> and exquisitely disposed <hi>Membrane</hi> at <hi>Stomach</hi> be grieved by such <hi>pointed Rosin,</hi> as that of <hi>Opium,</hi> sticking to some Part thereof; besides, that the <hi>Stomach</hi> does peculiarly hate and loath, that any Thing, how gentle soever, should stay too long in it, which creates frequent and sad <hi>Disturbances</hi> in such whose <hi>Stomachs</hi> are relaxed, (as 'tis also in the Case of <hi>Opium</hi>) and cannot in due <hi>time</hi> discharge themselves of the grieving Matter: <hi>Therefore</hi> such as are mostly troubled with those <hi>dismal Symptoms</hi> after <hi>Resinous</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> The Explication of the Effects of <hi>Opium</hi> used internally in a moderate Dose.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>NOte,</hi> That because <hi>Opium</hi> has been generally hitherto used either <hi>Crude,</hi> or with its <hi>Rosin</hi> in it, the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> are accordingly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as <hi>common Experience</hi> thereupon has given <hi>Opportunity</hi> of <hi>Observing</hi> them; but as I proceed I shall shew you where the Resinous Part of <hi>Opium</hi> is concern'd in the <hi>Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is manifest why <hi>Opium</hi> may well ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in a very <hi>small Quantity,</hi> as it usually does, because the least Matter imaginable <hi>affects</hi> the <hi>Senses,</hi> (as has been shewn;) for the Thousandth Part of a grain of <hi>Ambergrise, Musk, &amp;c.</hi> affects the <hi>Smelling,</hi> the Hundredth Part of a <hi>Grain</hi> of very acrimonious Things the <hi>Taste,</hi> which causes very sensible <hi>Pleasure,</hi> or <hi>Displeasure,</hi> according as it is agreeable, or not; much easier may the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely disposed <hi>Membrane at Stomach,</hi> which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Things so indefinitely small, that no other <hi>Sense,</hi> or <hi>Membrane,</hi> can take notice of, as the Particles of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> in <hi>Vomits, Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvias</hi> from a <hi>Cats Body, pestiferous Effluvias,</hi> and the like; of all which the <hi>Stomach</hi> is so sensible, that they thereby cause most violent Symptoms, which are (as was shewn) proportioned to the Sensation. Therefore it can be no <hi>wonder,</hi> that a <hi>Grain,</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> should affect the sensile Coat of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and thereby cause a Sense of <hi>Pleasure;</hi> for that which is nice to discern grieving <hi>Particles,</hi> is so to discern pleasing ones,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52480:109"/>
(as has been said.) <hi>Cujus est Dolor ejusdem est Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptus,</hi> that is, <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Displeasure,</hi> belong to the same Part, and (as was shewn) in <hi>equal Degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This proves, That it must Operate by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singly affecting the <hi>Stomach,</hi> for it were otherwise impossible, that so little a <hi>Quantity</hi> should cause such <hi>remarkable Effects,</hi> and that before the <hi>Opium</hi> is out of the <hi>Stomach;</hi> but it is ordinary for the <hi>Stomach</hi> to cause <hi>mighty Effects</hi> by its Sensation of very small Things, otherwise insensible and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable as to the Production of any observable <hi>Effects;</hi> and therefore it would be a Miracle, if it did any other <hi>Way</hi> cause such great and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Effects. Helmont</hi> observed, That <hi>Pro Remedio restaurativo Archaei (sive Animae sensitivae) non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiritur Unciarum &amp; Drachmarum Quantitas, sed pauca Grana;</hi> That is, <hi>Very little serves to comfort the Archaeus (or Sensitive Soul;</hi>) because it is done by <hi>Sensation,</hi> (as I have proved.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is as evident how a hot, brisk, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino-volatile</hi> Thing, as <hi>Opium</hi> is, must affect the <hi>sensile Coat</hi> of the <hi>Stomach</hi> in a <hi>short Time,</hi> as <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, Purgers, &amp;c.</hi> do; which it does much in the same Time with those Things, that is, as soon as they insinuate themselves through the <hi>Crusta Carnosa</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and reach its <hi>sensile Coat,</hi> which is the Reason that <hi>Opium, Vomits, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, &amp;c.</hi> make some, and like <hi>Delay,</hi> before they <hi>Operate;</hi> which is also a Proof, that all of them Operate by affecting the <hi>sensile Coat</hi> of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> all the Difference being, that one affects pleasantly, as <hi>Wine, Meat,</hi> and <hi>Cordials,</hi> and the other by a <hi>grievous Sensation.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The first and leading Effect of</hi> Opium is, causing <hi>a most agreeable, pleasant, and charming Sensation about the Region of the Stomach.</hi> This is a <hi>Property</hi> that belongs to it <hi>omni &amp; semper,</hi> and indeed <hi>soli</hi> to <hi>Opiates,</hi> if the Degree, Duration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Fineness of the <hi>Pleasure</hi> be <hi>considered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How manifest is it, from what has been said of the most Compleat and Consummate <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> which exactly agrees in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with <hi>Semen Animale,</hi> that so highly pleases and titillates the <hi>Membranes,</hi> with which it not only agrees in <hi>Principles,</hi> (as was shewn) but has them more <hi>active, actuating,</hi> and <hi>titillating,</hi> than any <hi>Membrane,</hi> that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it must of necessity highly please all <hi>Membranes,</hi> more especially such as are most exquisitely disposed for Sensation, as the most <hi>sensile Membrane</hi> at <hi>Stomach</hi> is, not only by its <hi>Agreeableness,</hi> but by a most Charming and Captivating <hi>Titillation,</hi> that actuates and causes a fine Ovation, and serene glowing of the <hi>Spiritus insiti</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> which makes it pleasing in the highest manner, having all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites</hi> to cause a Sense of <hi>Pleasure!</hi> and that is not all, <hi>but it being taken into the Body, it causes a long, continued, and permanent sense of Pleasure, which we must necessarily carry along with us as a</hi> Vade Mecum, <hi>even Sleeping or Waking, Resting or Moving, or whatever we do, or wherever we are;</hi> by which <hi>Means,</hi> it far excells all other <hi>Pleasures,</hi> and consequently produces such mighty <hi>Effects;</hi> all other <hi>Pleasures</hi> being <hi>momentary, transitory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultory,</hi> or <hi>interrupted,</hi> except that of <hi>Wine,</hi> and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52480:110"/>
                  <hi>Cordials</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> which therefore have the <hi>likest Effects</hi> to that of <hi>Opium,</hi> tho' they do not equal it in the <hi>Intenseness</hi> or <hi>Duration</hi> of the <hi>Pleasure,</hi> unless they are repeated, (as indeed they may be) which made me to intimate, That drinking a good <hi>Glass</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> every <hi>Hour,</hi> and by that Means keeping the fresh <hi>Pleasure</hi> thereof conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually at the <hi>Stomach,</hi> (like that of <hi>Opium</hi>) is the best Way to cause a long <hi>Euphory</hi> of <hi>Labour, Iourneys, &amp;c.</hi> which may come near the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our <hi>Divine Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> tho' never equal it for Reasons already sufficiently hinted, <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>Wine</hi> wants its most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Composition, and fine <hi>Titillation</hi> of the <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt</hi> that <hi>Opium</hi> and <hi>Animal Seed</hi> have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> may, to some inadvertent <hi>Persons,</hi> seem very indefinite, tho' it is at <hi>Stomach,</hi> (as it must be) because the <hi>Pleasure</hi> immediately relaxing all Parts, and gratifying the Sensitive <hi>Soul,</hi> which informs the whole, seems to be <hi>general,</hi> tho' Originally only at <hi>Stomach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Consummate Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> must cause a <hi>blith, gay, and good Humour;</hi> for being pleased with any Thing (as is the <hi>Vulgar Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>) causes a <hi>good Humour,</hi> how much more must such an <hi>intense, agreeable,</hi> and <hi>continual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> that we always, and every where carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us, so do! How common a Saying is it, <hi>He was pleased with somewhat, for I found him in a good Humour!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The like is to be said of <hi>its causing Prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Serenity, Alacrity, and Expediteness in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching and Managing of Business;</hi> for these are but natural and necessary Consequences of a <hi>blith, gay, and good Humour,</hi> and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways go together; for the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> being put
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52480:110"/>
in a <hi>fine Ovation,</hi> by the <hi>continual Pleasure,</hi> is more active; and having thereupon (as was shewn) wholly excused himself from the <hi>Care,</hi> and soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude of the <hi>Defensive Contraction,</hi> and, in great Measure, of the <hi>Vigilative Contraction</hi> also, is more at <hi>leisure</hi> to attend the Managery of other Affairs without <hi>Distraction;</hi> besides, that he is <hi>actuated</hi> and <hi>enliven'd</hi> by the aforesaid <hi>Ovation</hi> of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and pleasing <hi>Titillation</hi> into an <hi>Alacrity</hi> and <hi>Promptitude</hi> for any Business; with which also he is less tired, because he has (as was said) rid himself of the <hi>Fatigue</hi> of the <hi>Contractions,</hi> that (as was manifestly proved) do cause <hi>Lassitude,</hi> which otherwise can hardly touch or affect him at all in the State of <hi>Relaxation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It must cause Assurance, Ovation of the Spirits, Courage, Magnanimity,</hi> (as <hi>Wine</hi> does) by elevating the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> by <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and a high <hi>Titillation</hi> of the <hi>Spiritus insiti,</hi> by its <hi>Volatile Parts</hi> actuating them, as the <hi>Animal Semen</hi> does all <hi>Creatures</hi> in <hi>Times</hi> of <hi>Copulation,</hi> tho' it immediately affects only the <hi>Venereal Membranes,</hi> but ours does actuate them not only in those <hi>Membranes,</hi> but also in the more exquisitely disposed <hi>Membranes</hi> for Sensation at <hi>Stomach,</hi> and soon after, all over the <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>It prevents and takes away Grief, Fear, Anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Peevishness, Fretfulness, &amp;c.</hi> for the aforesaid <hi>Reasons,</hi> which cause a <hi>blith, gay,</hi> and <hi>good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, Promptitude, Courage, &amp;c.</hi> for it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be <hi>gay,</hi> and <hi>good Humour'd, Serene, Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Courageous,</hi> and <hi>Magnanimous,</hi> and at the same Time <hi>Sorrowful, Fearful, Peevish, Fretful, &amp;c.</hi> If the bare Sense of an ordinary <hi>Meal</hi> of <hi>Meat</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> which causes but a slow <hi>Pleasure</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with <hi>Opium,</hi> takes off the <hi>Peevishness, Fretfulness, &amp;c.</hi> that the <hi>grievous Sensation</hi> of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> causes, how much more must the intense and <hi>charming Pleasure</hi> caused by <hi>Opium,</hi> that is so agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52480:111"/>
even far beyond <hi>Wine</hi> it self, (as has been set forth) take away all ill <hi>Humours, Fretfulness, Peevishness, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be said, That <hi>Sleepiness,</hi> which depends also upon <hi>Relaxation,</hi> as the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Pleasure</hi> do, causes a <hi>Peevish, Fretful Humour,</hi> as is commonly, observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is so far otherwise in the Case of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,</hi> that it is quite contrary; for, 1. The Sleepy are not Peevish, unless you put them by some Means out of the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of enjoying <hi>Sleep</hi> or <hi>Relaxation,</hi> for if you let them alone they will not trouble you with Peevishness, nor any ill <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;</hi> but it is the calling them from their <hi>relaxed Condition,</hi> to the grievous Task of <hi>Contractions,</hi> that vexes them; so that it is the <hi>Want</hi> of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing under the <hi>Relaxation</hi> that frets them, and the more, because the <hi>Fatigue</hi> and <hi>Tedium</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi> did put them upon the <hi>Relief</hi> of <hi>Sleep,</hi> of which if disappointed, they are much vexed.</p>
               <p>But in the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> you cannot so easily rob them of their <hi>Pleasure,</hi> which they carry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually within them in an uninterrupted manner, unless some very <hi>grievous Thing</hi> happens, which causes more <hi>defensive Contraction</hi> than the <hi>Opium</hi> causes <hi>Relaxation;</hi> tho' even this also is generally soon overcome by the <hi>Pleasure</hi> continually inviting the <hi>Relaxation,</hi> and promoting it, whereas the <hi>Interruptions</hi> thereof are <hi>transitory;</hi> but at the worst it is but taking more <hi>Opium,</hi> and the <hi>Work</hi> is done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, I observe, that the <hi>Dose</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> must be sufficient to introduce such a Sense of <hi>Pleasure</hi> as causes a <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Contraction</hi> caused by the <hi>Grievance:</hi> Hence it is certain, that a greater <hi>Pain</hi> requires a larger <hi>Dose</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> (as has been intimated.)</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:52480:111"/>6. All know, that <hi>Pleasant Diversions,</hi> as <hi>Musick, Pleasant Iests</hi> and <hi>Stories, fine Sights, &amp;c.</hi> do cause <hi>Euphory,</hi> and <hi>an easie undergoing of Iourneys, Labour, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, if such interrupted, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient, and slight <hi>Pleasures,</hi> do it so much, it will be easily granted me, that a continual, and more <hi>intense Pleasure,</hi> that is always present without any <hi>Interruption</hi> or <hi>Intermission,</hi> (as that of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Opium</hi>) must cause a more eminent and permanent <hi>Euphory,</hi> proportioned to the <hi>Pleasure,</hi> which causing <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation,</hi> prevents the <hi>Fatigue</hi> (or <hi>Lassitude</hi>) that is caused only by <hi>Contractions,</hi> either <hi>Vigilative, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that I do not conceive, how the <hi>Noctambuli</hi> (or such as Walk in their Sleep) can ever be tired, if they Travelled ever so far, (if they could Eat and Drink) because the <hi>Relaxation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of the <hi>Sleep</hi> recruits them as much as they spend of <hi>Spirits, &amp;c.</hi> so Persons that cause such <hi>Relaxation</hi> by <hi>Opium,</hi> and so repeat it as to maintain the <hi>Relaxation,</hi> can hardly be weary; which is the true, plain, and <hi>Mechanical Reason,</hi> why the <hi>Turks,</hi> and other <hi>Eastern People,</hi> do, by the Help of <hi>Opium,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form prodigious <hi>Iourneys</hi> without being tired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which may therefore (in <hi>Allusion</hi> to the <hi>Noctam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli</hi>) be call'd <hi>Opiambuli,</hi> (or <hi>Opambuli</hi>) as being a kind of Artificial <hi>Noctambuli,</hi> because they are much relax'd by the <hi>Pleasure</hi> that <hi>Opium</hi> causes, as the other are by <hi>Sleep.

3.

               <p n="12">12. <hi>I have just now shewn how it promotes insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Perspiration, viz.</hi> by the <hi>Relaxation</hi> opening the <hi>Pores,</hi> and letting out the <hi>Fumes;</hi> which I need not have mentioned again but for Order sake, that all may thereby see, that I evade the <hi>Explication</hi> of no Effect, nor, indeed, need I, for they are now obvious enough, even without my <hi>Explication,</hi> to any <hi>Sagacious Person;</hi> so that the <hi>Plainness</hi> may give greater cause to pass over some untouched, than the <hi>Difficulty;</hi> but it is not sit that either should cause any Omission in such a <hi>mighty Concern,</hi> that was never Explicated, and scarce ever thought possible.</p>

               <p n="15">15. <hi>It causes a larger and slower Pulse,</hi> because of the <hi>Relaxation</hi> that the <hi>intense</hi> and <hi>continual Pleasure</hi> causes, by which the <hi>Arteries</hi> are widened, and the Motion made slower; 1. Because the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> are weakened by the <hi>Relaxation</hi> of their Vessels, and their <hi>Expansion</hi> thereupon. 2. Because the sense of <hi>Irritation,</hi> by which the <hi>Heart</hi> is solicited to move faster, is lost.</p>

Because the <hi>Dilatation</hi> of the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, by the <hi>Relaxation,</hi> detains and suspends the <hi>Humours;</hi> and 2. Because the Sensation being lessen'd, the Membranes that include the <hi>Salival Glandules</hi> are not irritated to <hi>Contraction</hi> to squeeze out the <hi>Saliva</hi> (or Spittle.) 3.

               <p n="18">18. <hi>It has more Effect upon fine and lax Textures,</hi> for the same Reason, and because their <hi>Sensation</hi> is more nice, and affected more with Pleasing or Grieving Things: Therefore it affects <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> especially the Nice, and Delicate, more than Men; which may be the Reason why <hi>Women</hi> do not use <hi>Opium,</hi> in the <hi>Eastern Countreys,</hi> as much as <hi>Men.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> The Explication of the frequent (tho' not constant) Effects of <hi>Opium,</hi> in a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Dose.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>IT causes Sleep,</hi> because it highly disposes thereto by the <hi>Relaxation</hi> that its <hi>Pleasure</hi> causes. Thus <hi>Musick, agreeable Frications,</hi> and many other <hi>Pleasures,</hi> nay, all that are consistent with <hi>lying,</hi> or <hi>sitting still,</hi> and silent, incline us to <hi>Sleep;</hi> but none can compare with the <hi>sweet, continual,</hi> and <hi>transcendent Pleasure</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> that we carry along with us for many <hi>Hours;</hi> whereas other <hi>Pleasures</hi> are either remiss, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, or transient in their <hi>Nature;</hi> for <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance</hi> in gentle <hi>Pleasure,</hi> as the fall of <hi>Waters, Whistling of Winds,</hi> effects much towards Sleep, so <hi>Intenseness</hi> does also, tho' <hi>momentary,</hi> as that of <hi>Venus;</hi> how much then must a <hi>continual</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense Pleasure</hi> cause it, especially when <hi>Rest, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp;c.</hi> is added thereto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That <hi>Sleep</hi> is so far from being a <hi>Property</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> that it does not belong to it <hi>omni, soli,</hi> or <hi>semper;</hi> yet <hi>People</hi> have generally look'd upon <hi>Sleep</hi> as such, which caused many <hi>Errours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It causes pleasant Dreams,</hi> because the very <hi>Sleep</hi> is caused and continued by <hi>Pleasure,</hi> when it is by <hi>Opium;</hi> which <hi>Pleasure</hi> being all the <hi>time</hi> we Sleep within us, must needs suggest <hi>pleasant Dreams,</hi> or none, for how can sad and <hi>melancholy Dreams</hi> seise one that is in a <hi>gay</hi> and <hi>pleasant Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as far as one in <hi>Sleep</hi> is capable thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:52480:115"/>3. <hi>It stops Vomiting;</hi> 1. As it doth other <hi>Fluxes,</hi> by taking away the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Irritation.</hi> 2. By highly pleasing, and thereby <hi>quieting</hi> and <hi>composing</hi> the <hi>Commotion</hi> of the <hi>Stomach.</hi> 3. By relaxing it, which oppose the <hi>Contraction,</hi> by which Vomiting is perform'd.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It stills Hiccoughs</hi> for the same Reasons.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It causes Convulsions and Contractions to cease.</hi> 1. Because it induces a <hi>Relaxation,</hi> which takes them off. 2. By taking off the sense which the <hi>Irritating</hi> causes. 3. By <hi>composing</hi> the Spirits.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It causes the Meat to stay long at Stomach,</hi> (as Sleep does;) 1. <hi>By relaxing the Stomach,</hi> so that it is not subject to <hi>contract</hi> to send it out. 2. <hi>By stilling all Motions,</hi> whereby the <hi>Stomach</hi> grows proportionably unactive. 3. Because the <hi>Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> opposes the <hi>Contraction,</hi> by which the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum</hi> is sent into the <hi>Stomach,</hi> or the <hi>Saliva</hi> into the Mouth; both which are therefore much want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Sleep</hi> for the like <hi>Reason (as has been shewn.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>It moderates and prevents Hunger;</hi> 1. Because (as was said) the <hi>Menstruum</hi> is not so plentifully sent or squeesed into the relaxed <hi>Stomach.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it takes away the sense of <hi>Hunger.</hi> 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it leaves the Meat to stay too long at <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> by <hi>Reason</hi> that it is relaxed, more insensible and proportionably languid in motion (as in <hi>Sleep.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>It causes Sweat,</hi> when the <hi>Body</hi> is full of <hi>moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi> (as <hi>Sleep</hi> doth) by relaxing, and thereby opening the <hi>Pores;</hi> and not (as People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly talk) by attenuating, and the like, for a <hi>Grain</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> bears no <hi>Proportion</hi> to the <hi>Bloud</hi> and <hi>Humours:</hi> That it causes it meerly as <hi>Sleep</hi> does, is manifest, not only because it bears not a due <hi>Proportion</hi> to the <hi>Work,</hi> as an <hi>Alterative,</hi> but because Men do not Sweat in that Case (as in <hi>Sleep</hi>) without much moisture in the <hi>Body,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:52480:115"/>
much would not be attenuated as soon as less: Therefore it is only an <hi>Exudation</hi> of the Humours upon a Plenty thereof, and opening of the Pores. <hi>Sanctorius, Sect.</hi> 1. <hi>Aph.</hi> 22. <q>Invisibilis Perspiratio fit visibilis, quando Nutrimentum est nimium;</q> That is, <hi>Invisible Perspiration becomes visible (Sweat) when nourishment</hi> (or <hi>moisture</hi>) <hi>is too much,</hi> which exactly agrees with that of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> cited in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>It causes the Menses to flow,</hi> when nothing is wanting but the opening or relaxing of the <hi>Viae</hi> or <hi>Pores</hi> they issue out at, as when they are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally too narrow and close; as upon the first Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to them in <hi>young Girls,</hi> or when stopt by <hi>Reason</hi> of any undue <hi>Contraction</hi> thereof, as by <hi>Pain, Cold, Sorrow,</hi> or other <hi>grievous Passions,</hi> all which do close the <hi>Pores.</hi> Besides, it does irritate those very sensile <hi>Venereal Parts</hi> to <hi>Erection;</hi> and I have reason to think, that it does by a <hi>general Relaxation,</hi> cause an <hi>Increase</hi> of <hi>Bloud,</hi> as it does of the <hi>Breasts, Milk, &amp;c.</hi> causing, as it were, an <hi>Artificial Puberty,</hi> or (at least) much promoting the <hi>Natural,</hi> and therefore is of excellent <hi>Use</hi> in this Case in Judicious Hands, tho' little thought of in <hi>Practice.</hi>

               <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be <hi>objected,</hi> That it particularly stanches Bloud, how then should it promote the <hi>Menses?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. Experience</hi> tells me it does, and <hi>Reason</hi> confirms it: It <hi>stanches Bloud,</hi> by composing the Fury of its Motion, but that does not hinder, but it may relax the <hi>Pores</hi> for <hi>Sweat, Menses, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, &amp;c.</hi> to pass; and, why not for the <hi>Menses</hi> and <hi>Lochia,</hi> as well as <hi>Sweat,</hi> by opening the <hi>Pores,</hi> I would fain know? considering also the <hi>Titilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that it causes upon those <hi>Venereal Parts,</hi> which may very much solicite their <hi>motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>It causes the</hi> Lochia <hi>to flow</hi> for the same Reasons that it does the <hi>Menses:</hi> This I have great <hi>Experience</hi> in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That the <hi>Menses, Lochia,</hi> and <hi>Perspiration,</hi> are Natural <hi>Evacuations</hi> that have <hi>Pores</hi> designed for them by <hi>Nature,</hi> the opening of which by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation</hi> must make <hi>way</hi> for them: Suppose, when the <hi>Bloud</hi> flows so much into the Skin as to cause an <hi>Efflorescence,</hi> by the <hi>Relaxation</hi> thereof, after <hi>Opium</hi> is taken, that there were <hi>Pores</hi> to carry out <hi>Bloud,</hi> as there is for <hi>Sweat,</hi> why should not one flow as well as the other? But there are such <hi>Pores</hi> for the <hi>Menses</hi> and <hi>Lochia,</hi> and large ones too, and therefore it must promote them; and why should not <hi>Relaxation</hi> do it, as well as <hi>Contraction,</hi> by <hi>Cold, Terrour, Grief, &amp;c.</hi> stop them? for <hi>the Effects of Contraries are contrary.</hi>

            <p n="11">11. <hi>It causes the Stone to pass;</hi> 1. Because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p n="12">12. <hi>It causes the Delivery of Women,</hi> by relaxing the Neck of the <hi>Womb,</hi> as it does that of the <hi>Bladder</hi> to <hi>deliver</hi> Persons of the <hi>Stone,</hi> but in the <hi>Delivery</hi> of <hi>Women</hi> it is not to be used but in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cases, and by a very Skilful Hand; 1.

            <p n="13">13. <hi>It causes Deadness of the Eyes,</hi> (as in <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keness, &amp;c.</hi>) because the <hi>Cornea</hi> is relaxed, so that the <hi>Humours</hi> do not fill it up to a <hi>tense Rotundity,</hi> as when 'tis more contracted.</p>

            <p n="21">21. <hi>It causes Swimmings in the Head</hi> by Consent, when the <hi>Stomach</hi> is grieved by that <hi>Rosin,</hi> as you find upon <hi>Nauseas before Vomiting,</hi> or when any Thing does much offend the <hi>Stomach,</hi> as much <hi>Drink</hi> or <hi>Wine,</hi> which when they have Vomited, those <hi>Swimmings</hi> cease.</p>

            <p>Besides, there are some sort of Persons, that upon <hi>Ioy, good News, Pleasure,</hi> or the like, are too much <hi>elevated,</hi> or have a <hi>restless Ovation</hi> of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> which will not suffer them to <hi>Sleep,</hi> tho' they are in a <hi>Pleasant Condition</hi> all the time; This may be the Case of some that cannot <hi>Sleep</hi> after <hi>Opium,</hi> tho' they are all the Time (as they call it) in a <hi>Heavenly Condition,</hi> for (as I have said) a

               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Faltring of the Tongue</hi> does (as in <hi>Relaxation</hi> by <hi>Drunkenness</hi>) proceed from the same Cause.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Looseness of the Lower Iaw,</hi> as you see in the Drowsy and Drunken People, is from the same <hi>Relaxation.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>It sometimes prevents Sweat,</hi> by causing a very <hi>Liberal Perspiration</hi> (as was shewn;) for (as <hi>Sanctorius</hi> says, who should know it) much insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>Perspiration</hi> and <hi>Sweat</hi> cannot consist, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a Temperate Person, who Eats and Drinks moderately; Therefore, if you keep a Person, that <hi>Sweats</hi> much at <hi>Night,</hi> in a free <hi>Perspiration</hi> all <hi>Day,</hi> by the Help of an <hi>Opiate,</hi> you'll much lessen or totally prevent the <hi>Sweat</hi> at <hi>Night,</hi> as in <hi>Consumptive Persons,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>It causes Abortion,</hi> by relaxing the Neck of the <hi>Womb,</hi> which also the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of Coition sometimes does for the like Reason, and would be much more apt to cause it if it continued long, as that of <hi>Opium</hi> does. <hi>Note</hi> the Inconvenience of <hi>Coition</hi> after <hi>Impregnation;</hi> This is the great Cause that <hi>Whores</hi> are not apt to bear Children, because Frequency of Pleasure does over-relax the <hi>Collum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <item>7 <hi>Intumescence of the Lips</hi> is from their <hi>Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> admitting the Bloud and Humours into them in a plentiful manner; besides, that their <hi>Laxity,</hi> and the <hi>Inadvertency</hi> occasioned by the Diverting <hi>Pleasure</hi> or <hi>Drowsiness</hi> that follows, letting the <hi>Lower Lip</hi> hang down carelesly (as is usual in such Cases) may by exposing much more of that <hi>Lip</hi> (which is most concern'd in this <hi>Effect</hi>) make it seem larger, as a hanging <hi>Lip</hi> does.</item>

               <item>9. <hi>It cures Stupors</hi> that proceed from <hi>Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as by <hi>Cold, &amp;c.</hi> by relaxing all Parts.</item>
               <item>10. <hi>It causes Anxieties and Distresses,</hi> by the <hi>Rosin</hi> sticking and teazing the <hi>Stomach.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>11. <hi>Vomitings and Hiccoughs</hi> proceed from the same <hi>Cause.</hi>

               <item>
                  <p>12. <hi>Convulsions</hi> are caused by the same <hi>Rosin,</hi> while it continually urges the <hi>Stomach</hi> to <hi>grievous Vomitings,</hi> which at last draw other Parts (as the <hi>Stomach</hi> usually does when under great <hi>Gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Note,</hi> That such a <hi>violent Compression</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> into a great springiness, is the cause of the Strength of <hi>Convulsive Motions,</hi> so that sometimes a strong Man can hardly hold a Child's Limb in such <hi>Cases.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That such <hi>Leipothymies</hi> are (as was hinted) of the same Nature as <hi>Sleep</hi> is, but that they are suddain, more profound, and not so usual, natural, and of course, as <hi>Sleep</hi> is, which makes them more <hi>amazing</hi> and <hi>surprizing; therefore</hi> it follows, that they are (as <hi>Sleep</hi> is) a Means of <hi>Recruit,</hi>

                  <p>Many true and useful <hi>Consequences</hi> do hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; as, That we are not always to disturb them, or put them out of these <hi>recruiting Leipothymies</hi> by grievous Means, as <hi>Prickings, Pinchings, &amp;c.</hi> but only by <hi>Cordials</hi> and <hi>Refreshing Things,</hi> as you would Treat a Person much tired; or by letting them take their <hi>Nap</hi> (if I may so call it) if there be not very eminent Danger. But 'tis endless, and besides my Purpose, to make a particular <hi>Discourse</hi> of this Matter, which will belong more properly to my Tract of <hi>Animal Mechanism.</hi>

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:52480:120"/>
other apparent Cause; for as the being <hi>tired,</hi> and <hi>want of Recruit,</hi> causes Sleep, so the <hi>having it</hi> causes <hi>Waking,</hi> or (which is the same in <hi>Effect</hi>) no farther need of <hi>Relaxation</hi> for Recruit's sake, so that the sensitive Soul fall to his useful Work of <hi>Vigilative Contraction</hi> for <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Motion's</hi> sake.</item>

                  <p>15. <hi>It sometimes causes Purging,</hi> which happens (as far as I have observed, or can learn) only when it is given in a good Quantity to Persons of a <hi>strong Digestion</hi> or <hi>canine Appetite.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Case is thus; When Persons, that are of a <hi>strong Digestion,</hi> take a <hi>Resinous Opiate</hi> in good Quantity, they do in great measure by their fixed Salts at Stomach, and <hi>strong Digestion,</hi> subdue the <hi>Volatility</hi> of the <hi>Opium,</hi> and dissolve its <hi>Rosin,</hi> which then (as <hi>acrimonious Rosins,</hi> or <hi>Vomits</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by <hi>fixt Salt,</hi> use to do) causes <hi>Purging;</hi> Hence it is, that it generally (if not always) Purges <hi>Dogs,</hi> and People of a high <hi>canine Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,</hi> and that sometimes meeting such fixed Salts, it Purges the <hi>Consumptive. Bartholine</hi> says, That <hi>Mandrake Iuice purges when it meets with acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious fixed Salt. Erastus</hi> and <hi>Quercelan</hi> do agree, That it has a <hi>Purgative Quality,</hi> but that it does not always exert it; 1. Because it takes away the Sense of <hi>Irritation.</hi> 2. Because it is given in too small a <hi>Quantity.</hi> The <hi>Reasons</hi> are Just and Right, and not only consistent with, but confirm what I say.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That this is not intended of the <hi>Purging</hi> that happens after the <hi>declination</hi> of its <hi>Operation,</hi> which is (as you'll find) from another Cause, therefore this does not smell of the <hi>Opium</hi> as the other does, because it is past and gone before that in the <hi>Declination</hi> happens; Of which more in its <hi>proper Place.</hi>

The <hi>other</hi> Case is, when <hi>violent Contraction,</hi> as from <hi>Pain, Cold, Vomitings,</hi> and <hi>Grievous Passions,</hi> as <hi>Terrour, &amp;c.</hi> are the Cause, that People are almost expiring, for it takes off the <hi>Contractions</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <item>18. <hi>It causes stoppage of Urine</hi> sometimes (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in old <hi>People</hi>) by over relaxing, and causing a kind of a <hi>temporary Palsie</hi> of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> (as was shewn) and taking away the sense of the <hi>Irritation</hi> of the <hi>Urine,</hi> which should contract the <hi>Bladder</hi> to squeese it out; by which Means it happens sometimes, that the <hi>Bladder</hi> comes to be so over extended beyond its due <hi>Tone,</hi> that they cannot contract it to make <hi>Water;</hi> in all which Cases strong <hi>Contracters,</hi> as <hi>Cold, Terrours, &amp;c.</hi> immediately cures them; the very putting the <hi>Scrotum</hi> to the Edge of a cold Chamberpot has effected it several times by my <hi>Advice;</hi> tho' (if need be) you must come to Dashing of <hi>cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> upon the <hi>Region</hi> of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> or Pumping on it, or Dipping in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so <hi>Terrour,</hi> and causing a very smart <hi>Pain,</hi> especially near those Parts, will do much, but Cold is the readiest and best <hi>Remedy.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> The Explication of the Effects of the Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Operation of <hi>Opium</hi> in a Moderate Dose.</head>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <p>1. A <hi>General Return of all Diseases and Disasters,</hi> when the <hi>Operation</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> is over, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it does not (as was shewn) operate as an <hi>Alterative,</hi> but a <hi>pleasing Diverter</hi> of the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> for some <hi>Time,</hi> during which it causes a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Relaxation</hi> of all the sensile Parts, whereby the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> being expanded, grow unsit to convey <hi>Impressions</hi> smartly, which is requisite to cause a sense of Pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as has been often said.)</p>
                  <p>But it cures several <hi>Distempers, viz.</hi> such as pleasing and comforting the <hi>sensitive Soul, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Spirits, Relaxation, Perspiration, Sweat, &amp;c.</hi> can quite take away; Of which more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly when we come to speak of the <hi>Use of Opium</hi> in <hi>Cure.</hi>
                  </p>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Sweat</hi> happens in the <hi>Declination</hi> of its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as Sir <hi>Theodore Mayern, my self,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> have observed, because that now all the <hi>Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> contracting, which by their <hi>Relaxation</hi> suspended all <hi>Humours</hi> during its <hi>Operation,</hi> do Mechanically squeese out the congested <hi>Humours,</hi> there being less <hi>Room</hi> in the <hi>Body,</hi> as was said of <hi>Sweat</hi> upon awaking, by the <hi>Return</hi> of the <hi>Vigilative Contraction</hi> after <hi>Relaxation</hi> during the Sleep, which is to be compared to the <hi>Relaxation</hi> during the Operation of <hi>Opium,</hi> and the <hi>Return</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:52480:122"/>
when 'tis ended; besides, that both upon the <hi>Going off of the Operation,</hi> and <hi>Awaking,</hi> the Motion of the Heart growing more vigorous, (as it does upon Motion by the <hi>Intentive Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) does more powerfully propell the <hi>Humours</hi> out at the <hi>Pores</hi> (as happens in <hi>Sweat upon Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>)</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Frequent making of Water</hi> happens, <hi>partly</hi> by the <hi>Titillation</hi> of the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> (as by <hi>Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides, &amp;c.</hi>) that is now separated from the Bloud; <hi>partly</hi> by the <hi>Contraction</hi> of the whole Body squees<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out at the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> as when People are <hi>Cold,</hi> they make more Water for that Reason.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>A Looseness</hi> may, and does happen some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the like <hi>Contraction</hi> squeesing out the <hi>Humours</hi> that were suspended during the <hi>Relaxation</hi> by the <hi>Opium,</hi> which is common for such <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions</hi> to cause, as by <hi>Cold, Terrour, &amp;c.</hi> and because <hi>Sensation</hi> grows more <hi>nice</hi> and irritable by the <hi>Humours,</hi> by <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Contraction,</hi> which is the more for the <hi>Grievance</hi> of failing of the Pleasure of <hi>Opium.</hi> Therefore,</item>
               <item>5. <hi>Diseases, Pains, &amp;c.</hi> seem worse upon the <hi>Return</hi> of the <hi>Grievances,</hi> because of the great <hi>Ease</hi> they had during the <hi>Operation</hi> of the <hi>Opium, Contraria inter se magis elucescunt;</hi> and it is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly observed of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> That it leaves Men worse then it found them. Thus a Man is worse, more sad, <hi>&amp;c. Post Coitum,</hi> more <hi>Melancholy</hi> after all sorts of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> insomuch that it is grown to a <hi>Proverb,</hi> viz. <hi>After Merry comes Sorry,</hi> (or, <hi>After Mirth comes Sorrow;</hi>) as also <hi>Minus gaudebis, minus dolebis.</hi> Therefore,</item>
               <item>6. <hi>Melaneholy</hi> does often (if not always) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in some <hi>degree,</hi> after its <hi>Operation</hi> is ended; 1. Because of the Return of the <hi>Contractions</hi> (or <hi>Toil</hi>) of the <hi>sensitive Soul.</hi> 2. Because (as was said) the Sense of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> newly lost, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52480:122"/>
the Sorrow, as has been shewn after <hi>Coiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. <hi>The Pulse is narrow,</hi> because the <hi>Contraction</hi> returns with <hi>Melancholy,</hi> and <hi>Return</hi> of <hi>Disasters</hi> improve when that so happens, as it generally does.</item>
               <item>8. <hi>Itching of the Skin</hi> happens about this time, because that now the <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> which causes <hi>Tuillation,</hi> is arrived as far as the <hi>Skin</hi> upon its march out of the <hi>Body.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XXI.</hi> The Explication of the Effects of <hi>Opium</hi> in an Excessive Dose.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Cause</hi> of most of these <hi>Effects</hi> will be evident from the Explication of the former, because the <hi>Difference</hi> is only in the <hi>Quantity</hi> of the <hi>Opium,</hi> therefore I am often necessitated to speak much the same as I have done before.</p>
            <p>You cannot expect any <hi>good Effects</hi> from its <hi>Excess,</hi> any more than you have from <hi>Wine,</hi> (tho the best of <hi>Cordials,</hi> next to the <hi>Sal. Volatile. Oleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi>) but rather less, because <hi>Opium</hi> is join'd to a <hi>pernicious Rosin,</hi> which you may be sure will be very grievous to the <hi>Stomach</hi> in great Quantities, if it was so in little.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Evil Effects</hi> in this Case, do mainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, <hi>either</hi> from <hi>too much Relaxation,</hi> as in <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or,</hi> from the <hi>Rosin at Stomach.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>A Heat at Stomach</hi> is caused by the intense <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Opium</hi> in a <hi>great Quantity,</hi> it being sensibly a very hot Thing.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>The Sense of Weight at Stomach</hi> is caused by the <hi>great Relaxation</hi> that it causes, which renders the <hi>Stomach</hi> proportionably weak, and unable to endeavour its own <hi>Relief,</hi> so that the <hi>Rosin, &amp;c.</hi> lie heavy upon't; Thus we find a <hi>great Heaviness</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> when any Thing grieves it, that it cannot reject or discharge.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:52480:123"/>3. <hi>Gaity of Humour is caused at first</hi> (as by the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of a great Quantity of <hi>Wine</hi>) by its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Agreeableness</hi> to the <hi>Membrane</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> till the <hi>Relaxation</hi> grows enormous, as by a <hi>great Dose of Wine suddenly drank,</hi> to which it is very like in all its <hi>Effects,</hi> except such as proceed from the <hi>Rosin</hi> sticking at <hi>Stomach,</hi> which <hi>Wine</hi> has not.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Sardonick Laughter</hi> is caused (as you see in <hi>Drunken People</hi>) when they are disabled by the great <hi>Relaxation,</hi> that they cannot well Express themselves by the failing Tongue, they endeavour it by a silly kind of <hi>fained</hi> or <hi>made Laughter,</hi> (as they call it) while the pleasing <hi>Titillation</hi> at <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> much inclines them to <hi>Mirth,</hi> if they knew how to manage and carry it on.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>Laxity, and consequently Debility of all Parts,</hi> is caused by the extraordinary <hi>Relaxation</hi> of them by a continual and permanent sense of <hi>Pleasure,</hi> which happens considerably in the Momentary <hi>Pleasure</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> much more in this <hi>continual</hi> and <hi>lasting Pleasure,</hi> when a great <hi>Dose</hi> makes it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense, as in <hi>Drunkenness.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. <hi>Alienation of the Mind</hi> is caused (as in <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness</hi>) by an over-<hi>Relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Brain</hi> and its <hi>Membranes.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. <hi>Loss of Memory</hi> happens by the same Means, (as in Drunkenness.) So,</item>
               <item>8. <hi>Darkness of Eyes</hi> is caused by a <hi>Relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Coats</hi> and <hi>Membranes</hi> of the <hi>Eyes,</hi> but mainly by the <hi>Expansion</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> by that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation,</hi> which (as in Sleep) renders them unfit to convey the <hi>Impressions</hi> of <hi>Light, &amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>9. <hi>Laxity of the Cornea</hi> is from the same <hi>Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>10. <hi>Appearance of various Colours</hi> happens by (as was said) the unevenness of the <hi>Cornea, &amp;c.</hi> when so relaxed, whereas when 'tis duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted it is round, even, polite, and truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents Things.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:52480:124"/>11. <hi>Deadness of the Eyes to the View,</hi> is (as has been shewn) from the <hi>Laxity</hi> of the <hi>Cornea,</hi> which makes it flag, lie loose, look dully, and not duely reflect a <hi>smart</hi> and <hi>brisk speck</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> as it does when <hi>tense, round,</hi> and <hi>polite,</hi> by its <hi>Contraction</hi> on the <hi>contain'd Humours,</hi> which then duely fill it.</item>
               <item>12. <hi>Faltring of the Tongue</hi> is from the same <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation,</hi> as in <hi>Drunken Persons.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>13. <hi>A Sopor</hi> is from the <hi>same Relaxation</hi> over all the <hi>sensile Parts of the Body,</hi> by which Means <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> are diminished or lost by the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> which (as has been said) being not duely compressed, become unfit for <hi>both</hi> at the same <hi>time.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>14. <hi>A slow and wide Pulse</hi> is from the same Cause, because the said <hi>Relaxation</hi> permits the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries to widen, and the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> to expand, and consequently renders the <hi>motion</hi> of the Heart <hi>slow,</hi> which is the cause of the <hi>Pulse.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>15. <hi>A high Colour</hi> or <hi>Efflorescence of the Skin,</hi> has been explain'd.</item>
               <item>16. <hi>Looseness of the Iaw and Lips</hi> is from the same <hi>Relaxation,</hi> (as was shewn;) and so is,</item>
               <item>17. <hi>Intumescence of the Lips,</hi> (as has been shewn)</item>
               <item>18. <hi>Difficulty of Breathing</hi> may be from <hi>Two</hi> different Causes; <hi>either</hi> by the <hi>Relaxation</hi> weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>requisite Motions</hi> for want of <hi>Compressure</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> and by the <hi>Flaccity</hi> of the Parts themselves; <hi>Or,</hi> by a great <hi>Grievance</hi> at <hi>Stomach</hi> upon the <hi>Account</hi> of the <hi>Rosin</hi> sticking to it, and causing a <hi>Convulsion</hi> of those Parts; both which may happen.</item>
               <item>19. <hi>Fury and Madness</hi> may also happen, <hi>either</hi> by the exalted <hi>Pleasure</hi> of its <hi>Titillation,</hi> as in <hi>Drunkards,</hi> who therefore scarce know what they do, the <hi>Mind</hi> being (as was said) <hi>alienated; Or</hi> it may happen (as I have often known a kind of <hi>Madness</hi> to be produc'd) by a great <hi>Grievance</hi> at
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:52480:124"/>
                  <hi>Stomach;</hi> which may well be from the <hi>Rosin</hi> grieving and teazing the <hi>nicely sensile Stomach;</hi> They may be easily distinguished, <hi>one</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> that from the Rosin at <hi>Stomach</hi>) being with great <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, Anxieties, Convulsions, &amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> without any.</item>
               <item>20. <hi>Venereal Fury</hi> proceeds from the high <hi>Titil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of the <hi>Venereal Membranes</hi> by the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> of so much <hi>Opium,</hi> as if <hi>Cantharides, Bees, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> were taken internally; but that these cannot so agreeably titillate those Parts as <hi>Opium</hi> does, whose <hi>Volatile Particles</hi> are render'd more pleasing by <hi>oily ones,</hi> and therefore much of the Nature of <hi>Semen Virile.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>21. <hi>Priapisms</hi> are caused by the same continual <hi>Titillation.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>22. <hi>Violent Itchings of the Skin</hi> are caused by the same tickling <hi>Volatile Particles</hi> in great Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, proportionable to the <hi>excessive Dose.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>23. <hi>Nauseas</hi> are caused by the <hi>Rosin</hi> sticking at, and soliciting the <hi>Stomach</hi> to <hi>Vomit.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <p>24. <hi>Swimmings in the Head</hi> are by <hi>conse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Stomach</hi> is grieved by that <hi>Rosin,</hi> as is observed in many Cases from a <hi>grieved Stomach</hi> upon a <hi>Tendency</hi> to <hi>Vomit,</hi> as when it is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaden with <hi>Wine,</hi> or <hi>indigestible Victuals,</hi> or when Persons are <hi>Sea,</hi> or <hi>Coach-sick, &amp;c.</hi> for it is not in these last <hi>Cases,</hi> because the <hi>Brain</hi> is offended (as People imagine) that they are <hi>Sick,</hi> or <hi>Vomit,</hi> but the <hi>Swimming in the Head,</hi> and <hi>Offence</hi> of the <hi>Brain</hi> happens, because the Stomach is offended by the Motion of the <hi>Coach</hi> or <hi>Ship,</hi> by Reason of its most <hi>exquisite Sensation,</hi> which the <hi>Effluvias of a Cat, pestiferous Particles,</hi> and <hi>Commotions</hi> caused by mear Passion, can, and do offend, (as was said) so as to cause <hi>Vomitings, Anxieties, &amp;c.</hi> much more then may the Motion of a <hi>Ship</hi> or <hi>Coach</hi> do it. I shall not here enter into Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:52480:125"/>
with those that assert, That it is the <hi>Head</hi> is first offended in a Coach or Ship; it is sufficient for my <hi>Purpose,</hi> that <hi>Grievances at Stomach</hi> do commonly cause <hi>Swimmings in the Head,</hi> for taking off those <hi>Grievances</hi> cures them, as <hi>Eating</hi> when it is from the <hi>Grievance</hi> of <hi>Hunger</hi> or <hi>Wind at Stomach,</hi> and discharging the <hi>Stomach</hi> of a great Load of Wine, Ale, or indigestible Matters, when such Things cause it, do cure such <hi>Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings in the Head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Way</hi> how <hi>Grievances</hi> at <hi>Stomach</hi> do cause those <hi>Swimmings,</hi> is by causing a <hi>Contraction</hi> (as all <hi>Grievances</hi> do, but especially those at <hi>Stomach</hi>) of the <hi>Membranes</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> as it does of all other, but mainly of these, because very sensile; by which means the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, grow more <hi>irrequiete</hi> and skipping up and down, and the <hi>Compression</hi> not being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually alike in general, or the <hi>Arteries</hi> affording an uneven and forcible supply of them (or <hi>Fumes</hi>) from the Bloud by the <hi>Compression,</hi> nor affecting all Parts of the <hi>Brain</hi> with equal <hi>Force,</hi> because the Pleasure endeavour to relax, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there must thence arise <hi>Eddies, Vortices,</hi> or <hi>Whirls</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which cause <hi>Swimmings, Vertigo's, &amp;c.</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they happen to be moved.</p>
                  <p>That they happen from such <hi>Contraction</hi> is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest;</p>
                  <p>1. Because the <hi>Grievance</hi> at <hi>Stomach</hi> can add nothing else to the <hi>Brain,</hi> or its <hi>Membranes.</hi> 2. Because they are taken off by pleasing the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and consequently by <hi>Relaxation,</hi> as by a <hi>Glass of Wine, Victuals,</hi> an <hi>Opiate</hi> that is not resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:52480:125"/>It is here well worth your <hi>notice,</hi> That all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Parts</hi> (a Thing much admir'd) is only by <hi>Contraction</hi> or <hi>Relaxation,</hi> which suddenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the whole Systeme of the <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</hi>

               <item>30. <hi>Convulsions</hi> happen (as was shewn) by the enormous <hi>Compression</hi> of the <hi>Animal Spirits,</hi> by Reason of the <hi>violent Contraction</hi> upon the great <hi>Grievance</hi> by the <hi>Rosin</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> which causes them to skip and fling up and down very forcibly under the squeese of the <hi>Compression,</hi> and possibly skirmishing under the Vicissitudes of it and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation.</hi>

               <item>31. <hi>Faintings and Leipothymies</hi> are caused (as has been explain'd) by the sensitive Soul's being over-tired by the Fatigue of <hi>Defensive Contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and yielding himself to Rest from all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi> as the last Relief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereupon <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> do fail for want of <hi>Compression</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Spirits springy, active, and fit for the <hi>Purpose.</hi>

Tho' hardly any of the <hi>Comparisons</hi> come up to that of <hi>Opium,</hi> because of the <hi>charming Pleasure, mighty Euphory</hi> and <hi>Promptitude</hi> that it causes; it is as if one were supported, and wholly depended upon <hi>Cordials,</hi> and suddenly denied them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>An Inhability of getting up in the morning till it is taken, and begins to operate,</hi> proceeds from the same Cause. A <hi>Mechanical Reason</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected here also as to these Matters, but it will hardly bear it, any more than how the <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Appetite</hi> causes the first <hi>Impulse</hi> toward <hi>voluntary Moti n;</hi> all that can be said is, that without the <hi>Opium</hi> the <hi>sensitive Soul</hi> is, when he does any Thing, to act under the <hi>Toil</hi> and <hi>Difficulties</hi> of a full <hi>vigilative Contraction,</hi> (as being awake) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Contraction,</hi> (as acting) and <hi>defensive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi> (as being grieved) when the <hi>Operation of Opium</hi> is over, (as after <hi>Veneral Pleasure, &amp;c.</hi>) so that now he labours under the great <hi>Disadvantages</hi> and <hi>Drudgery</hi> of all the <hi>Three Contractions,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the <hi>Pleasure, fine Titillation</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> and <hi>Relaxation</hi> consequential thereunto, he was eased of all the <hi>Defensive Contraction,</hi> which is the most grievous, and in great measure of the <hi>Vigilative,</hi> (as has been shewn) which makes <hi>Working, Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying, &amp;c.</hi> very easie to him; Therefore it is as if one that delights in <hi>Musick,</hi> Danced to Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Melody in beloved Company, with pleasing <hi>Refections</hi> of <hi>Wine, &amp;c.</hi> and in the <hi>other Case,</hi> as if one <hi>laboured</hi> in <hi>Grief</hi> or <hi>Pain.</hi> Now suppose that one, used never to Act or Work without such

               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>A dull, moapish, and heavy Disposition,</hi> must be the Effect, unless it be while they <hi>please, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> and <hi>enliven themselves</hi> by the <hi>Opium,</hi> because their <hi>Brain</hi> is habitually over relaxed; which is the very Case of old <hi>Drunkards,</hi> who have (as 'tis said) drank away their <hi>Parts</hi> by such an <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Brain,</hi> (which over-much <hi>Sleeping</hi> causes also upon the Account of the like <hi>Relaxation</hi>) therefore they must be moapish till the pleasing <hi>Titillation</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> enlivens them.</item>
               <item>5. <hi>Diminution of Appetite</hi> is caused by an <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> taking away its <hi>Sensation,</hi> and suspending the <hi>Menstruum</hi> from flowing to it as freely as it should, and would, if there were a due <hi>Contraction</hi> to squeese it out.</item>
               <item>6. <hi>Weakness of Digestion</hi> happens from the same Causes.</item>

               </item>
               <item>10. <hi>Stooping in the Back</hi> is caused by the <hi>habitual Relaxation</hi> of the Parts, which weakens and causes them to comply with our <hi>Tendency</hi> and <hi>Use</hi> of bending forward, and yield to the greater Weight, that is (generally speaking) on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the <hi>Back-bone</hi> (or <hi>Perpendicular;</hi>) so that Stooping must gradually follow those conspiring Causes, as it does in <hi>habitual Drunkards,</hi> whose Parts are relax'd.</item>

            <p>Thus have you all, even the most mysterious and <hi>seemingly Contradictory Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd and reconcil'd, and that so easily, that if there were no other <hi>Proof</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of my <hi>Foundation,</hi> it is sufficient to convince any Man of its <hi>Validity,</hi> considering the <hi>Vastness</hi> of the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and <hi>Perplexity</hi> of the <hi>Nature</hi> of those <hi>Effects,</hi> that are all with such <hi>Facility</hi> explain'd, is able even to disparage the <hi>Performance</hi> as <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>obvious,</hi> (like that of the <hi>Circulation of the Bloud,</hi> or <hi>America</hi> when found out) did not the <hi>newness</hi> of the Thing, the baffled <hi>Endeavours</hi> of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the seeming Impossibility of ever find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out, (which was almost agreed upon) speak in its <hi>behalf.</hi> Consider, that nothing can be <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> but what is <hi>true,</hi> and consequently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing valuable but what is so; what's true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but <hi>the Knowledge of Things as they really are?</hi> And when a Thing is known as really as it is, it must be plain, and never so till then; for to take a Thing to be what it is not, is all <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Errour, Puzzle, Confusion,</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> as all Discourses of <hi>Opium</hi> have hitherto been.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of <hi>Opium</hi> separated from its noxious Part, (or Rosin) and whether it is a <hi>Panacea,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THus far have I spoken of Crude <hi>Opium</hi> jointly with its <hi>Rosin</hi> or <hi>noxious Part,</hi> now I will consider it separated from it, and shew how to do it. <hi>Galen</hi> says, That it is very difficult to find an <hi>excellent Remedy</hi> without a <hi>noxious Quality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is as difficult to find any Thing so <hi>noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> as not to afford a <hi>good Medicament;</hi> which you see in <hi>Vipers, Scorpions, Mercury, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All, or most <hi>Physicians,</hi> unanimously agree, That <hi>Opium</hi> has such a <hi>noxious Quality,</hi> that causes <hi>Vomitings, Hiccoughs, Distresses, Anxieties, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> chiefly at or about the <hi>Region</hi> of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;</hi> and that if it were freed from it, it would be the <hi>noblest of Medicaments:</hi> Who can otherwise imagine? seeing it is so excellent and universal a <hi>Remedy,</hi> as it is now used in the <hi>World,</hi> without such an excellent <hi>Preparation</hi> thereof, wherein the <hi>noxious Principle</hi> is separated from it.</p>
            <p>Of which <hi>Paracelsus</hi> says, That whoever shall enjoy it, will be a Professor of no less Knowledge than <hi>Apollo, Machaon,</hi> or <hi>Podalyrius,</hi> tho' he was the greatest Master of <hi>Arcanas, Panaceas, &amp;c.</hi> yet does he <hi>confess,</hi> 
               <q>That a Preparation of <hi>Opium</hi> stood him in stead, and perform'd his Business, when all his great Medicaments fail'd him; and that it will dissolve Diseases, as Fire doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It were endless to tell you the <hi>Eulogies</hi> of the Learned concerning such a <hi>Preparation</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> which they generall conclude to be a most noble <hi>Panacea;</hi> therefore many, and very solicitous have been the <hi>Disquisitions</hi> of the Ingenious and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious, to find out this <hi>heroick, generous,</hi> and <hi>most glorious Medicament.</hi> I am fully satisfied, that the pure <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum of Opium,</hi> duely separated from its <hi>noxious Rosin, Dross, &amp;c.</hi> is the very Thing; some of the Reasons that convince me are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Because <hi>Opium</hi> has no other <hi>Principle</hi> in it, that signifies any Thing as to its laudable and noble <hi>Effects,</hi> but its <hi>Sal Volatile Oleosum</hi> (as has been shewn.)</item>
               <item>2. Because the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> produces all its <hi>good Effects.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. Because the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> duely sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from its <hi>Rosin,</hi> and other Principles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces no ill <hi>Effect</hi> in a moderate <hi>Dose.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:52480:132"/>This added to what has been Discoursed at large of the <hi>Principles of Opium,</hi> is (I think) suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to satisfie any Man, that the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum of Opium</hi> (so separated) is the great <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacea</hi> that is sought for.</p>
            <p>However, because we are upon the <hi>greatest Thing</hi> in <hi>Physick,</hi> (as may be well inferr'd from what has been already said) and that the <hi>World</hi> has been under great <hi>Fears, Iealousies,</hi> and <hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> concerning this <hi>Matter,</hi> and the <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Opium;</hi> it will be well worth our While to give all imaginable <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in this Case, therefore I will,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Lay down all the requisite <hi>Qualifications</hi> of a <hi>Compleat Panacea,</hi> as far as I can collect out of the most Eminent <hi>Authors,</hi> and my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I will particularly enquire as to each of the <hi>Qualifications,</hi> whether the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> duely separated from every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> is furnished therewith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will shew you how duely to separate its <hi>Dross, Rosin, &amp;c.</hi> so as to leave a pure, sincere <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> for <hi>Use.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <head>The requisite Qualifications of a <hi>Panacea</hi> are these, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </head>
               <item>1. <hi>That it should highly please our Sensation at Stomach;</hi> because the <hi>Stomach</hi> is contrived and appointed by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> as the <hi>Touchstone</hi> to try, a <hi>Sentinel</hi> truely to inform, and a <hi>Critical Iudge</hi> to determine, what is, or is not agreeable to our <hi>Nature</hi> in general, and therefore (as has been shewn) endued with a wonderful <hi>sagacity</hi> and <hi>nicety of Sensation</hi> for that <hi>End.</hi> It follows
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52480:133"/>
then, that a <hi>Panacea</hi> should be very pleasing and agreeable to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and therefore very <hi>cordial.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That it should be highly pleasing to the sensitive Soul,</hi> which is the <hi>Principle of all Motion, Action,</hi> and <hi>Alteration</hi> in an <hi>Animal;</hi> This <hi>Helmont</hi> couches under the Name of pleasing the <hi>Archaeus.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>That it should take away all Grievances of the sensitive Soul</hi> (or <hi>Archaeus</hi>) because its <hi>Grievance</hi> is the <hi>Essential Form</hi> of <hi>Diseases,</hi> for even Morbid <hi>Matter,</hi> unless it causes a <hi>Grievance,</hi> causes no more <hi>Disease</hi> than it does in a dead Carcass, as <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>common Reason</hi> assures us; therefore <hi>Disease</hi> and <hi>Grievance</hi> are only Two Words sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the same Thing, and nothing is capable of <hi>Grievance</hi> in an <hi>Animal,</hi> as such, but the <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soul.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>It should compose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comfort, enliven, encourage, and invigorate our sensitive Soul and Spirits,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Motion</hi> in our <hi>Animal Nature,</hi> in order to self Preservation; for <hi>Nature</hi> (or those <hi>active Principles</hi> within us) is the <hi>Curer</hi> of <hi>Diseases,</hi> and we <hi>Physicians</hi> only its Ministers to offer it good Means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. <hi>The Principles of a</hi> Panacea <hi>should be agreeable to the best, noblest, most active, and predominant Principles of our Bodies.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. <hi>Those Principles in the</hi> Panacea <hi>should be more vigorous than ours,</hi> to reduce them, when deficient, and exalt them, when depressed, clog'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. <hi>It should be a general Resolver of Humours,</hi> for which Cause the <hi>Liquor Alcahest</hi> is so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled for a <hi>Panacea.</hi> Hear what the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician <hi>Claudius de la Courvee</hi> says, <hi>Uni morbosae, &amp; semper preter Naturam humorum coagulationi, unique eorundem colliquationi, oui perpetuo intendit natura, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligenter studeas; hujus adjuvandae, illius corrigendae modum si assecutus fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </item>
               <item>8. <hi>It should, after such Resolution of Humours, compose, concentrate, combine, and unite the good Principles.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>9. <hi>It should discuss the bad and useless Parts.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>10. <hi>It should open the Pores to give them their Exit,</hi> by that most universal, natural, plentiful, kindly, and easie <hi>Evacuation.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>11. <hi>That</hi> (after all) <hi>it should (like the Liquor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cahest</hi>) remain very much unaltered in it self.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now whatsoever is endued with these Eleven most noble <hi>Qualifications,</hi> must be in the Estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any <hi>Rational Physician</hi> or <hi>Phylosopher, a glorious Panacea,</hi> that is fitted to take off the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of all <hi>Diseases,</hi> (or <hi>Grievances</hi>) as far as it is in the <hi>Power</hi> of a <hi>Natural Medicament</hi> (or <hi>Alterative</hi>) so to do; Therefore, let us see, how the pure <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> is furnished therewith?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is so highly agreeable and pleasing to our most nice Sensation at Stomach,</hi> which is given us for a <hi>Touchstone, Watch,</hi> and <hi>Iudge</hi> of what is agreeable and beneficial to our <hi>Bodies,</hi> that nothing in the whole World is so agreeable and pleasing to it, and therefore nothing is more agreeable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to our <hi>Animal Nature;</hi> it would imply a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> that the <hi>Stomach,</hi> which is given us (and accordingly qualfied) to make a true <hi>Report</hi> of what is, or is not agreeable and beneficial to us, should always (tho' it may by <hi>Accident</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly) give us a <hi>false Report</hi> of the <hi>Agreeableness</hi> of Things; It would be more than <hi>Prophaneness</hi> to attribute such deceitful, unkind, and unwise <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances</hi> to the infinitely <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Wise;</hi> therefore
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52480:134"/>
the <hi>Stomach</hi> does infallibly testify, and assure us, that it is most agreeable to our <hi>Nature,</hi> seeing it is always so to it; <hi>Agreeableness</hi> and <hi>Disagreeableness</hi> with which, is appointed and ordain'd by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> to be the <hi>Test</hi> and <hi>Touchstone</hi> of what is agreeable or otherwise to our <hi>Animal Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Why then, being so agreeable to the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> should it not create an <hi>Appetite,</hi> but rather lessen it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Tho' some may be so weak as to make such an <hi>Objection,</hi> because Things agreeable to the <hi>Stomach</hi> are commonly reputed to cause an <hi>Appetite,</hi> yet (the Matter duely considered) the Case is quite contrary; for <hi>Appetite</hi> (or <hi>Hunger</hi>) is a <hi>grievous Sensation</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> which cannot be expected from Things that gratifie and please the <hi>Stomach,</hi> which are the adequate Cure of a <hi>grievous Sensation</hi> (or <hi>Hunger;</hi>) Thus <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> (as has been shewn) cure an <hi>Appetite,</hi> grievous Sensation, or Hunger; Thus <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Opium</hi> do (by pleasing the <hi>Stomach</hi>) cure a <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Appetite, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore you may <hi>Note</hi> by the by, that all <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> that please the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and gratifie its <hi>Sense,</hi> are really <hi>Opiates</hi> in some <hi>degree,</hi> causing good Humour, Sleepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Appetite</hi> or <hi>Hunger,</hi> tho' it is a convenient <hi>Call</hi> or <hi>Intimation</hi> of <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>Supply</hi> and <hi>Recruit,</hi> is, as such, a consequent of <hi>defect,</hi> and so unnatural, tho' call'd <hi>Natural,</hi> because it is a Thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens of course, to direct us how to proportion Things to the <hi>Exigence</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> of which there would be no need, if we could otherwise proportion good and agreeable <hi>Refection</hi> to our <hi>Wants</hi> thereof: In short, it is a <hi>Disease</hi> which
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52480:134"/>
Things agreeable and pleasing to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> as our <hi>Panacea,</hi> must cure, or else it would not be a <hi>Panacea;</hi> and (as was shewn) nothing can be a more proper Cure of <hi>Grievance</hi> (or <hi>Displeasure</hi>) than <hi>Pleasure;</hi> Therefore what is agreeable to our <hi>Stomach,</hi> and consequently to our <hi>Body,</hi> must cure not cause <hi>Appetite,</hi> as <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> It does indeed argue a quick <hi>Digestion,</hi> and great Expence of the <hi>Recruits</hi> taken in, but still it is all bottom'd upon <hi>Deficiency;</hi> and <hi>Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> may be, and is very often too quick, as in the <hi>Boulimia,</hi> (or <hi>canine Appetite</hi>) Nature delights in a gentle, kind, and gradual <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Meat</hi> at <hi>Stomach;</hi> to which you'll find, by and by, that <hi>Opium</hi> very much conduces by its <hi>resolving Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nothing in Nature is more pleasing to the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Soul,</hi> as appears by the whole Series of our Discourse, and the explaining all the <hi>Phenomena</hi> or <hi>good Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> by that very <hi>Pleasure</hi> of the <hi>sensitive Soul.</hi> Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It</hi> (as was manifestly shewn) <hi>does thereby take off all Grievances,</hi> which are the <hi>essential Forms</hi> of <hi>Diseases;</hi> and the <hi>essential Forms</hi> of <hi>Diseases</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, (<hi>which give them being, and make them to be what they are,</hi> according to the <hi>Definition</hi> of an <hi>essential Form</hi>) the very being of <hi>Diseases</hi> must be taken away: Therefore our <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> is a <hi>compleat Panacea,</hi> that takes away the <hi>Essence</hi> or Being of <hi>Diseases,</hi> in taking away the <hi>Grievance</hi> thereof.</p>

            <p>But what need it end at all, if you please?

            <p n="7">
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:52480:135"/>7. <hi>That the</hi> Sal-Volatile-Oleosum <hi>of</hi> Opium <hi>being so agreeable and powerful, must be the greatest Resolver of Humours that can be imagined;</hi> for all <hi>Resolution</hi> is by an Agreement of Particles, which makes them easily miscible, insinuate into, and penetrate each other, especially if one be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more vigorous and penetrating than the other, as the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> has been plainly proved to be; Thus it is, that all <hi>Menstruums</hi> do so resolve things of their own Nature, and so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and cleanse them, by taking to themselves what is meerly and purely of the same <hi>Nature,</hi> and rejecting or letting go their Hold of what is otherwise: Where it is worth noting, how upon the Account of the intimate Combination and Union of the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> and <hi>Oily Parts</hi> in our <hi>Panacea,</hi> it is dissolvable in all <hi>Menstruums,</hi> and consequently an <hi>universal Resolvent</hi> of all the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> of our Bodies, which its <hi>external resolving</hi> of all <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Tumours</hi> does also prove. Now if it be such a <hi>Resolver,</hi> of which there is no Place to doubt, then as <hi>Claudius de la Courvee</hi> says, it must excell all Things in altering and reducing all the Humours of our Bodies to a good and agreeable Condition.

our <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum,</hi> tho' this alone (as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced even in common Preparations of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi>) suffices very often to cure Diseases by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Commotions, as in <hi>Diary Fevers</hi> from <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the bitter and firm textured <hi>Cortex</hi> (as I have shewn in my <hi>Book De Febribus intermittenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>) takes off <hi>Ague Fits,</hi> by re-combining the segregated <hi>Humours</hi> with the Bloud, which it sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly doing, leaves a Disposition in the Bloud, when ever it meets with a segregating Cause, (as <hi>Purging, violent Motion, Insolation, intemperate Drinking, &amp;c.</hi>) to a <hi>Relapse,</hi> by a second Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Morbid Matter from it, as you have it more at large in my said <hi>Book, p.</hi> 166, 167, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 242, 243, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where you may see how <hi>Opiates</hi> conduce very much to a speedy Cure by the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> by <hi>composing, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>Now you may perceive the true <hi>Qualifications</hi> of a <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum,</hi> so much sought for by the <hi>Learned</hi> as a <hi>Panacea;</hi> and how far the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ones, that are sold in the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Shops, are from being such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylvius</hi> (indeed) had an excellent one, with which he did many, and great <hi>Cures,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considered, (had he not confessed his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Cause of the Effects of <hi>Opium</hi>) and the Narrative he makes of its Vertue and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>first Book</hi> of his <hi>Praxis,</hi> and that he delighted so much in the <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> even when he was young, that he was call'd by the Name of <hi>Doctor Opiatus,</hi> and that he declares no Oil was added in its Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52480:137"/>
and that it is intimated that the <hi>Oil</hi> and <hi>Volatile Parts</hi> were strictly combined, would have made me suspect, that it was the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> that he used, which if it was not, I dare be confident, that (notwithstanding all its Excellency) it was not as good.</p>
            <p>I am very well satisfied, that a true and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> is not to be made barely by <hi>Art;</hi> Enquirers might have better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess if they sought it among the Natural Tribe of bitter Plants that are agreeable to the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> which have all in them a <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum,</hi> but how to pick and cull is (I think) best seen by the requisite <hi>Qualifications</hi> of a <hi>Pana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi> that I have stated. There have been many in whose Hands <hi>bitter Things</hi> have been as a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacea.</hi> One in <hi>Germany</hi> cured most Diseases with <hi>Wild Sage.</hi> Some have done great Things with <hi>Agrimony,</hi> others with <hi>Bean Trefoil,</hi> some with <hi>Centaury,</hi> others with <hi>Gentian, &amp;c.</hi> and the famous Dr. <hi>Lower</hi>'s Practice ran almost altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon bitter Things, which did him great Service in his <hi>Tincture</hi> of Steel, (as he call'd it) that he often made in Destill'd Waters, that could take little or nothing to Purpose of the <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Steel,</hi> (whether out of Ignorance or Design, I will not, tho' I may determine) which shews, that it was the bitter Things that did the good, and made it as a <hi>Panacea,</hi> and not the <hi>Steel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, certain it is, that promoting the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of Meat at <hi>Stomach,</hi> which the bitter <hi>Salia-Volatalia-Oleosa</hi> do, is a great Foundation for <hi>Cure;</hi> and (no doubt) our <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> does, by its <hi>inciding, dividing,</hi> and <hi>resolving Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> contribute very much to a due <hi>solution</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at <hi>Stomach</hi> by <hi>Connaturalness,</hi> as all <hi>Menstruums</hi>

do, (especially if it be <hi>Flesh,</hi> which we use mostly, and requires most help to be resolv'd) which may very well be, tho' it lessens <hi>Appetite</hi> by pleasing <hi>Sensation;</hi> for (as was shewn) it is quite another Thing to cause <hi>Appetite,</hi> (or a <hi>grievous Sensation</hi>) and <hi>Resolution</hi> (or <hi>Digestion</hi>) of the Meat at <hi>Stomach;</hi> for Wine helps <hi>Digestion,</hi> yet, by the <hi>pleasing Sensation</hi> that it causes at <hi>Stomach,</hi> it cures a <hi>canine Appetite,</hi> and at any time (if you'll observe it) takes off the <hi>Eagerness</hi> of <hi>Appetise</hi> for the present; you can better stay without Meat after a <hi>Whet</hi> before Dinner, than you could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; so that the Wine answers that of a <hi>Whet</hi> as to <hi>Digestion,</hi> tho' not to <hi>Appetite</hi> or <hi>Hunger,</hi> which is a <hi>grievous Sensation</hi> that Wine must rather Cure than Cause.</p>
            <p>It is true, that <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Opium</hi> may, by causing a sense of <hi>Pleasure</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> cause some stay of the Meat at <hi>Stomach,</hi> but it does not thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low but the <hi>Digestion</hi> may be the truer, because more gentle and gradual, as it may, and does happen in <hi>Sleep,</hi> when Things that are not very hard of <hi>Digestion</hi> are eaten, which are not good at any <hi>Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may remember how Blisters (to which <hi>Opium</hi> is near of Kind, as has been shewn) do quickly by their <hi>resolving Nature,</hi> turn the <hi>Cuticle</hi> (as if digested) into a sort of <hi>Gelly;</hi> what a mighty Help would such a Degree of <hi>Resolution</hi> be to the <hi>Digestion</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> when it is, by that Means, like the Skin of a well boil'd Cow-heel, half turn'd to a Gelly, and from a Thing that is very hard of <hi>Digestion,</hi> to be very easie, as is also a <hi>Boar's Skin</hi> in <hi>Brawn</hi> by reason of the <hi>prior Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> in the Boiling.</p>

            <p>SEeing that the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> must be such an effectual, generous, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Medicament,</hi> that is both <hi>cordial</hi> and <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> in so transcendent a manner, it well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves a careful and curious <hi>Preparation;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will be very particular therein. To that end,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>It must be separated from all the noxious Rosin, and all Filth and Dross of the Opium.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>It must be kept entire without weakening, or any way altering it, or adding a new Quality thereto.</hi> Therefore,</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Opium must not be torrefied,</hi> according to the <hi>Common Practice;</hi> 1. Because the finest and most volatile Part (which is the very best) is thereby lost. 2. Because the resinous and earthy Parts (which are not spent that <hi>way</hi>) grow more in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum;</hi> so that <hi>torre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> cannot be allow'd, unless preserving the <hi>Bad,</hi> and destroying the <hi>Good,</hi> be allowable. The vain and ostentatious Pretence of destroying (I know not what) <hi>narcotick Sulphur,</hi> (which is a Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name given by Ignorance to the best Parts of <hi>Opium</hi>) is most insufferable stuff. 3. Because all <hi>Empyreùm</hi> (which renders it very nauseous) can hardly be avoided in torresying it; but suppose it were, What need is there otherwise so to damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it? (as is aforesaid.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:52480:140"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> It is found to be more innocent, after such <hi>Torrefaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I grant that it happens so sometimes; but it must be meerly by <hi>Accident;</hi> either, 1. Because it meets with a strong <hi>Digestion</hi> at <hi>Stomach; Or,</hi> 2. By the Custom of poudering it, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways directed, and done after the <hi>Torrefaction;</hi> by which means the <hi>resinous Parts</hi> being divided and severed, become less liable to a <hi>Coalescence</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> and consequently less offensive and more subduable: Especially, 3. When it is mixed (as generally it is) with other things that keep the Parts of the <hi>Rosin</hi> from <hi>Coalescence,</hi> and leave them more conquerable by the <hi>Digestion,</hi> as the <hi>Ancients</hi> found by <hi>Experience;</hi> who therefore did general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not always, mix it in a small quantity, with many other things in great quantity, in the form of <hi>Electuaries,</hi> as in <hi>Venice-Treacle, Mithridate, &amp;c.</hi> though nothing in them corrected the <hi>Opium</hi> otherwise than by dividing and segregating its Parts. This indeed is like that of <hi>divide &amp; impera,</hi> or interlining suspected Soldiers with trusty, or friendly ones, to prevent a mischievous <hi>Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> But how much better is it to have no Enemy to contest with, by a due and compleat separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rosin from the <hi>Opium!</hi> Otherwise you must be obliged to good Accidents, if ever torrefied <hi>Opium</hi> becomes safe, because all the <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious Rosin</hi> is left in it.</p>
            <p>Therefore if after <hi>Torrefaction</hi> you will give it in a Mass, without poudering it, and mixing it with other things, you'll find its ill <hi>Effects</hi> to be as bad, if not worse, than ever; as you will also, if you afterward extract it out of <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> reducing it into the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Pills,</hi> by which means
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52480:140"/>
the severed Parts of the <hi>poudered Rosin</hi> do again co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alesce into a <hi>lumpish Condition,</hi> which renders it worse than <hi>crude Opium,</hi> as <hi>Wedelius,</hi> my self, and others do testifie; because the <hi>Opium</hi> being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what weakened, and all the <hi>Rosin</hi> remaining, the <hi>Dose</hi> of the <hi>Opium,</hi> and consequently of its <hi>Rosin,</hi> must be increased. As, suppose 8 Grains of <hi>crude Opium</hi> has 2 of <hi>Rosin,</hi> 2 of other <hi>Dross,</hi> 2 of <hi>Phlegm,</hi> and 2 of <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum;</hi> and that 2 <hi>Grains</hi> of the <hi>crude Opium</hi> containing <hi>half a Grain</hi> of the <hi>Sal-Volotile-Oleosum,</hi> was the <hi>Dose;</hi> then if in <hi>torrefying</hi> it, one Grain of the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> be lost, and another of the <hi>Phlegm,</hi> there will remain only 6 <hi>Grains</hi> of the <hi>Opium,</hi> with the Virtue of one Grain of the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> in it; therefore 3 <hi>Grains</hi> of it must be now used, to have half a Grain of the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum,</hi> which 3 <hi>Grains</hi> will contain half the <hi>Rosin</hi> of the whole Mass, that is, one <hi>Grain;</hi> whereas there was but <hi>half a Grain</hi> thereof in the 2 <hi>Grains</hi> of <hi>crude Opium:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore torrefied <hi>Opium</hi> is in it self much worse than crude <hi>Opium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is yet worse, if after <hi>Torrefication</hi> you make an <hi>Extract</hi> of it in <hi>Spirit of Wine;</hi> for then the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oss</hi> and <hi>Phlegm</hi> being separated from the 6 <hi>Grains,</hi> nothing will remain in the <hi>Extract</hi> but the <hi>resinous Part,</hi> with less of the Virtue of the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum,</hi> which is not taken up so greedily, as the <hi>Rosin</hi> is, by the <hi>Spirit of Wine;</hi> besides that, some of this <hi>Volatile Part</hi> may be lost, and that the <hi>Rosin</hi> is now more compacted, as not having as much as the drossie, earthy, or watry Parts to sever and keep its <hi>noxious Particles</hi> at a distance, to render them (as was shewn) more subduable and digestible at <hi>Stomach.</hi> See what Pains the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate World does take (and exceedingly hoast of) to render <hi>Opium</hi> by <hi>Torrefaction, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:52480:141"/>
in <hi>Spirit of Wine, &amp;c.</hi> at least twice as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zious as <hi>crude Opium,</hi> without accounting how far the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> that remains is impair'd by the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Spirit of Wine!</hi> It is therefore no <hi>Wonder</hi> that <hi>Wedelius</hi> declares, That he found more Mischief by such <hi>Extracts</hi> out of <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> than any other <hi>Preparation</hi> of <hi>Opium.</hi> It is plain then,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That we must not extract it out of Spirit of Wine,</hi> or any such <hi>sulphureous Menstruum;</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause more apt to extract the <hi>Rosin</hi> than the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum.</hi> 2. Because the <hi>Rosin</hi> will be more compacted. 3. Because the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> may in some measure alter it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>We must not extract Opium first out of Water, and afterward out of Spirit of Wine, and then mix them together, and evaporate them to an Extract:</hi> For this is (as was said) wisely taking care to add the <hi>Poison</hi> to the <hi>Panacea,</hi> or <hi>Rosin</hi> extracted by the <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> to the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the <hi>Water;</hi> besides the Impair and Loss made of the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and the <hi>Evaporation,</hi> how gentle soever it be.</p>
            <p>Here it will be seasonable to <hi>note,</hi> That there is a general great <hi>Fault</hi> committed by Preparers of <hi>Medicaments,</hi> especially such as pretend to most <hi>Curiosity</hi> therein, in endeavouring (<hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi>) to have all the Principles of the Plant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> join'd together in their <hi>Medicaments,</hi> however <hi>noxious</hi> or <hi>contrary</hi> to the Purpose, (as you see in the <hi>Instance</hi> just now mentioned) whereas they had much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do as the great <hi>Helmont</hi> says, <hi>Pharm. &amp; Dispens.

si quicquam laude dignum per simplicia egisse mediten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</q> 
               <hi>That is,</hi> 
               <q>Let Beginners learn to distinguish and separate the true Bloud of Plants from their Cruor (or dead Gore) and Parenchyma, if they think to do any thing Praise-worthy by Simples.</q> You'll find this to be very pat in the true <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum,</hi> whose <hi>Ruby-colour</hi> makes it look like <hi>Bloud,</hi> while the <hi>Rosin, Earth,</hi> and <hi>Dross,</hi> make the Appearance of a dull and dead Cruor, (or <hi>Gore.</hi>)</p>
            <p>If they took a <hi>Tincture</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> and used it so, it would not be so bad; for then the <hi>resinous Particles</hi> are disseminated, and not so liable to <hi>Coalescence</hi> at <hi>Stomach;</hi> but so great is the Stupidity, that they take care, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it into the <hi>Form</hi> of an <hi>Extract,</hi> to combine them and make them as noxious as is possible; and then they think them worthy to be boasted of as their <hi>Nostrums,</hi> proclaiming their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and glorying in their greatest <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Disgrace</hi> of Mankind, that Humane <hi>Species</hi> should have any such <hi>unthinking Brutes</hi> in it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>We must not use Acids in the Preparation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</hi> 1. Because being in their <hi>Nature</hi> opposite to <hi>Volatile Salts,</hi> it cannot be done without Injury to the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium.</hi> 2. Because they cannot so well agree with the <hi>oily Parts</hi> of it. Yet are they not so much to be blamed as <hi>Extracts</hi> made in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> or <hi>sulphureous Menstruums;</hi> because <hi>acid Menstruums</hi> leave the <hi>Rosin</hi> behind them untouched, or not extracted.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>A Salino-Volatile Menstruum,</hi> as <hi>Spirit of Sal Ammoniac,</hi> of <hi>Urine, &amp;c.</hi> is not so proper: 1. It may render the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> too acrimonious. 2. Because by its Volatility, Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52480:142"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may cause too great a stir in the <hi>Bloud, &amp;c.</hi> and so oppose or hinder <hi>Sleep,</hi> which is one of the most happy and useful <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> (or its <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum.</hi>) 3. Because it may have undue <hi>Effects</hi> by altering its <hi>general Disposition:</hi> Nay,</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>We are not to use a lixivial Menstruum,</hi> (tho' so much cried up) 1. Because it extracts the <hi>resinous Parts,</hi> which (<hi>experto crede Roberto</hi>) I have found to be pernicious upon that account, like <hi>Extracts</hi> in <hi>Spirit of Wine,</hi> unless great care be taken to separate those <hi>Parts</hi> (which is not easily done) by <hi>Filtrations, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Because being very apt to join with the oily Parts, and quite to destroy their Nature, by converting it into a kind of <hi>Sapo;</hi> it may deal so with some of the <hi>oily Parts</hi> of the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi> of <hi>Opium.</hi> 3. Because there is no need to run any of these Hazards, since the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> may be (as I shall shew) easily extracted in its <hi>Purity,</hi> without those <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Dangers.</hi> 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause any Tincture made thus is apt to let go the <hi>Rosin</hi> at <hi>Stomach,</hi> if it be diluted with aqueous Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture taken before, with it, or after it; which so being let go, coalesces, and does mischief.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>The use of Fire</hi> any way (besides that of its Torrefaction) is much to be suspected: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> may be in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thereby evaporated: Or, 2. An <hi>Empyreum</hi> contracted: And, 3. The <hi>Rosin</hi> (as was said of its <hi>Torrefaction</hi>) grows the more in Proportion, if any of the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum,</hi> or but the <hi>Phlegm</hi> be (by that means) evaporated, and the <hi>Remainder</hi> kept for <hi>use.</hi> And particularly,</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The Distillation thereof may cause migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Alterations in its <hi>Properties, Strength,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:52480:142"/>We must therefore avoid all these <hi>Ways</hi> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it, and yet must we,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Separate the Sal-Volatile-Oleosum of Opium from all its Rosin, Earth, Filth, and Dross.</hi>

               <item>1. It readily imbibes the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> without <hi>Fire, Heat, lixivial Salts,</hi> as <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar, &amp;c.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. It imbibes none of the <hi>Rosin</hi> of the <hi>Opium,</hi> but lets it all subside together with the earthy and drossie Parts, separating the lighter <hi>Filth</hi> (if there be any) to the <hi>surface.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. It no way weakens, alters, or adds any new <hi>Quality</hi> to the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. Whatever cold Water dissolves, which is the <hi>General Drink,</hi> or <hi>Menstruum,</hi> appointed by the <hi>All-wise Creater</hi> for the Dissolution of all Things taken into the <hi>Stomach</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> is easily dissolved at <hi>Stomach</hi> by its more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and agreeable <hi>Menstruum.</hi> And not only so, but,</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>I have observed, That (as Reason tells us) its <hi>Smell</hi> is best palliated by other <hi>rank Smells,</hi> as that of <hi>Onions, Garlick, Asa-foetida, &amp;c.</hi> and its <hi>bitter Taste</hi> with bitter things, as <hi>Gentian, Centaury, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore when Persons that know its <hi>Smell</hi> and <hi>Taste</hi> are avers to take it, (if the other more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Things will not suffice for that purpose) use some of these; You may, when you are in haste, infuse half a dozen slices of <hi>Gentian-root,</hi>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:52480:144"/>
and one slice of an <hi>Onion,</hi> or a bruised <hi>Clove</hi> of <hi>Garlick,</hi> or both, in a <hi>Glass</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> for one <hi>hour</hi> for a <hi>Vehicle</hi> in that case: 'Twere better to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse them longer, if you have time; but you'll find, that the <hi>liquid Panacea</hi> has not such a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rank Taste, or Smell, but that it is easily pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated by such means, if the <hi>Opium</hi> had no <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyreum.</hi> The <hi>solid Panacea</hi> may be also palliated by the same Things, conveniently mixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I know there are other <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> to separate the <hi>Rosin, &amp;c.</hi> as extracting a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Opium</hi> in Spirit of <hi>Wine,</hi> and afterward precipitating the Rosin with distilled Rain-water; but this is attended with more Trouble and many Inconveniences, that are avoided by the <hi>cold distilled Rain-water:</hi> For, 1. You know not how the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> may (as was said) alter it. 2. This is going round the <hi>Bush,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding two <hi>Menstruums</hi> together, whereas the simple <hi>Water</hi> used alone is much better. 3. You cannot thus separate the resinous Particles so perfectly, by <hi>reason</hi> that the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> must retain some of them; and if you add more and more <hi>Water</hi> in the <hi>Precipitation,</hi> the Tincture becomes too much diluted, and very weak: How much better is it to use a <hi>Menstruum</hi> that never takes up any <hi>Rosin,</hi> and consequently needs no such <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> of <hi>Precipitation!</hi> It is better not to admit an <hi>Enemy</hi> to one's Country, than afterward to endeavour his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion;</hi> for he will at best leave some Marks of his Hostility behind him, as the <hi>Rosin</hi> will in the <hi>Spirit of Wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:52480:144"/>The like <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> there will be in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating it by the way of <hi>Distillation;</hi> as, 1. The altering of it by the Tyranny of Fire. 2. The loss of it by <hi>Evaporation.</hi> 3. The addition of the Particles of Fire thereto. 4. The never se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating it so well that way. 5. The disuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Oil</hi> and <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But what Experience may hereafter teach Men, I will not determine, neither can I.</p>
            <p>But this I can, That as it was even <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> that People should never mind the Cause they daily <hi>felt,</hi> and solicitously <hi>sought</hi> for; so it is as strange that they could not hit upon the plain Use of Water (so very common in all Hands) for a <hi>Menstruum,</hi> either by <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Consideration,</hi> in all the <hi>Eastern</hi> Parts of the World, where it is so universally taken, or in the inquisitive <hi>Western</hi> Parts of the World, where it has been studied and considered by great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with the utmost <hi>Diligence:</hi> But they passing over <hi>Water</hi> as despicable, because common, (for Familiarity breeds Contempt) tho' its being made the <hi>Drink</hi> of all living Creatures by the <hi>Omniscient</hi> should commend it above all things, did like those, that regardlesly pass over a <hi>Iewel,</hi> or <hi>Treasure,</hi> and having once left it behind them, proceed farther and farther from it, the greater progress they make, concluding that it was not to be found the way they pass'd; not because it was not there, but because they could not see it.</p>
            <p>As for the keeping of the <hi>liquid Panacea</hi> uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, I do not find it apt to change; however, because made so easily by bare throwing it into Water, it need not be kept long, but may be made upon all occasions, or at least one under the

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Such Preparations, wherein the resinous Part of</hi> Opium <hi>is quite altered in its Form and Nature by Chimistry, or artificial Tortures of Fire;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hardly to be done without much impairing the <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum,</hi> will be neither commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor worth while, considering how easily, without that <hi>Trouble, Pains,</hi> and <hi>Labour,</hi> even the <hi>Rosin</hi> it self may be separated wholly from the <hi>Opium</hi> by <hi>aqueous Menstruums.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I am of Opinion, (upon my best <hi>Thoughts</hi> and some <hi>Experience</hi>) That intimately mixing and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing <hi>Opium</hi> with good white <hi>Soap,</hi> may (for the <hi>Reasons</hi> aforesaid) prove a good and ready <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> or Preventer, of the <hi>Adhesion</hi> of the <hi>resinous Parts</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> much conduce to its <hi>Dissolution,</hi> or <hi>Digestion</hi> therein, and nimble slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of it, and thereby prevent all the <hi>ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> which it causes by the <hi>Adhesion</hi> and <hi>Indigestibleness</hi> of its <hi>Rosin.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>This is mainly, (if not altogether) done by a fine and through <hi>Division</hi> of the resinous Parts of <hi>Opium,</hi> and keeping them afterwards from a <hi>Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescence</hi> in, and <hi>Adhesion</hi> to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> by which means they become digestible, or at least passable without Offence.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>By Torrefaction, till the</hi> Opium <hi>is very friable, and then finely poudering it,</hi> and mixing it with such things as are of good <hi>Consistence, &amp;c.</hi> to keep the Parts of <hi>Opium</hi> from a <hi>Coalescence,</hi> as in <hi>Venice Treacle, Mithridate, Diascordium,</hi> the <hi>Philoniums, &amp;c.</hi> This was the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients</hi> used; which caused <hi>Galen</hi> to say, <q>
                     <hi>That Opium alone</hi> (that is, undivided and unmix'd with other things to prevent its <hi>Coalescence, &amp;c.</hi>) <hi>was dangerous;</hi>

                  <hi>but mixt with other things was salutiferous,</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:52480:147"/>
(which they found by <hi>Experience,</hi> not knowing the Cause, but attributing the Safety thereof to something among the many Ingredients as a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of the <hi>Opium.</hi>) Hence it was that they put small Quantities thereof into Electuaries made of many and much other <hi>things,</hi> that kept the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles asunder; which they did so commonly, that (at last) all <hi>Electuaries</hi> were call'd <hi>Opiates.</hi> Thus we had those <hi>Compositions</hi> above named, which are safely used for the <hi>Reasons</hi> aforesaid; not that any thing therein corrects I know not what <hi>poisonous</hi> or <hi>narcotick Quality</hi> in <hi>Opium,</hi> but that the other Ingredients divide its <hi>Rosin,</hi> and afterward keep its <hi>Particles</hi> from <hi>Coalescence</hi> and <hi>Adhesion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Dissolution of Opium in Spirit of Wine,</hi> or such <hi>sulphureous Spirits</hi> which finely divide the <hi>Rosin,</hi> and using the bare <hi>Tincture</hi> before the resinous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are again compacted (as in <hi>Extracts, &amp;c.</hi>) may be of <hi>use,</hi> if duly administred.</p>
               <p>But here a <hi>Caution</hi> is to be used, That you take it not in, or drink any <hi>aqueous</hi> or <hi>phlegmatick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid</hi> with it, or before, or after it, in two or three hours; which if you do, the <hi>resinous Particles</hi> will be precipitated thereby, and so stick to the <hi>bottom tom</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> causing thereby the usual ill <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Vomiting, Anxieties, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore it should be given only in a <hi>spirituous Liquid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> also, That if you give a <hi>Solution</hi> thereof in any <hi>Lixivium,</hi> you take Care not to dilate it by any <hi>Means</hi> by <hi>aqueous Liquids</hi> in Two Hours before or after you take it; for then there being but little Lixivial Salt in proportion to the Liquid, the <hi>resinous Parts</hi> are let go, and precipitated to the Bottom of the <hi>Stomach;</hi> as in the Case of the <hi>Spirit of Wine</hi> so dilated: Of which I have seen a very convincing <hi>Instance;</hi> for one that had an Esteem of <hi>Lixivials</hi> in this Case, not only (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Helmont,</hi> and the <hi>Common Cry</hi>) to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Dissolution of</hi> Opium <hi>in the Yolk of a rear new laid Egg,</hi> by pounding the Dose that you intend to take, with a little Quantity of the <hi>Yolk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>new,</hi> ready, and agreeable <hi>Means,</hi> as good (if not better, all Things considered) than the former, and even equal to the <hi>Sapo tartareus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what is said, tho' short, you may (because it is the clear Truth of Things) Judge of the <hi>Goodness</hi> of all Preparations of <hi>Opium.</hi> And,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:52480:148"/>1. <hi>That resinous Things should not be added to Opium;</hi> because such (like its own <hi>Rosin</hi>) renders it more indigestible, and apt to stick at <hi>Stomach:</hi> Hence it is, that the <hi>Styrax Pill,</hi> having resinous Things in it, and crude <hi>Opium,</hi> does so often cause dismal <hi>Effects,</hi> tho, (forsooth) much esteem'd for the <hi>Lungs, Coughs, Defluxions, &amp;c.</hi> for having such <hi>Balsamick resinous Things,</hi> as <hi>Styrax,</hi> and <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum</hi> in it, whereas the Benefit is from the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium.</hi> Had Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> known the Cause of the <hi>Mischiefs</hi> of <hi>Opium,</hi> he would never have put <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> in his Pacifick Pill.</p>

Nor</hi> are you to <hi>stop the Vomiting,</hi> as not knowing what <hi>Nature</hi> may Advantage her self thereby, but indeed it is more than you can do, generally speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (if not always) while the <hi>Rosin</hi> teazes, urges, and stings the <hi>Stomach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It evidently follows, that the <hi>Cure</hi> must consist in the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Rosin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this Purpose you have Four Effectual <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvers</hi> of the Rosin, (as you may observe from the <hi>Chapter of the Preperations of Opium) that may be used with safety in a Moderate Dose;</hi> 1. <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Salts,</hi> whereof the best is <hi>Salt of Tartar.</hi> 2. <hi>Sulphureous Spirits,</hi> whereof the best is <hi>high rectified Spirit of Wine.</hi> 3. <hi>The Yolks of Eggs,</hi> whereof the best is the <hi>Yolk of a rear new laid Egg.</hi>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:52480:155"/>
4. <hi>White Soap,</hi> or rather the <hi>Sapo Tartareus.</hi> With these judiciously used, you may (by Gods Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing) Relieve and Cure the Person grieved with the <hi>Rosin</hi> (or noxious Part) of <hi>Opium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Give with all possible speed <hi>One scruple of Salt of Tartar,</hi> in a Spoonful or two of <hi>Brandy,</hi> or some other <hi>hot Cordial Spirit,</hi> (if Spirit of Wine be too hot) placing the Person in the very same Posture that he was in when he took the <hi>Opiate,</hi> that it may fall directly upon its <hi>Rosin,</hi> which most probably sticks where the <hi>Opiate</hi> first fell upon the <hi>Coat</hi> of the <hi>Stomach;</hi> then stay for a Minute or two, and give a Spoonful or two of the Brandy or Cordial, with (if need be) the Salt of Tartar in it.</p>
            <p>If you find Cause, either because the first <hi>Doses</hi> were Vomited, or that the Quantity of the <hi>Rosin</hi> was great, or that the <hi>Person</hi> grows worse, you may often repeat it, for we must not be sparing in safe Things in dangerous Cases, I think it may well be repeated after every Vomiting <hi>toties quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have a great <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Yolk of an Egg</hi> in these <hi>Cases,</hi> not only because it does (as the other Things) mix with the <hi>Rosin,</hi> but because being of a good Consistence, it sticks to it, and fastens upon't the better, and is not so clearly shaken from it by every <hi>Vomit,</hi> as Liquids are; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it very Useful to be given now and then immediately after <hi>Vomiting;</hi> however, let no other Food be given but it, and be sure to use it when you have not the aforesaid <hi>Things,</hi> I believe it will be found by <hi>Experience</hi> (which is yet much wanted, because it has not been used) to be the very best <hi>Help</hi> in these Cases, for the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:52480:155"/>
aforesaid <hi>Reasons,</hi> and because its fine Oiliness will correct the <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> of <hi>Opium.</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine but <hi>White Soap,</hi> or rather the <hi>Sapo tartareus,</hi> (if you have it by you) may be of very good use to dissolve and carry off the <hi>Rosin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When the <hi>Vomiting</hi> begins to cease, you must distinguish well whether it be because the Person is better, and the <hi>Stomach</hi> discharged of the <hi>Rosin,</hi> or because tired <hi>Nature</hi> yields it self to Rest, by a sort of <hi>Succumbency</hi> to the <hi>Fatigue</hi> or <hi>Leipothymy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may easily distinguish these Cases; for in the <hi>first Case</hi> every Thing seems better, and in the <hi>last</hi> worse, saving that the <hi>Vomiting</hi> ceases, which was an endeavour of more <hi>vigorous Nature,</hi> and therefore its failing is now an ill <hi>Sign.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That if you want <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> other <hi>Lixivial Salts</hi> may serve, as those of <hi>Wormwood, Broom, &amp;c.</hi> only you must give at least One <hi>Third</hi> more; and in Case of great Haste and Urgency, you may give the very Ashes of <hi>Wormwood, Broom,</hi> or any Vegetable, in 2 or 3 times the Quantity as the Salts are to be given, in 2 or 3 <hi>Spoonfulls</hi> of <hi>Brandy,</hi> or a <hi>Glass</hi> of <hi>Old Wine,</hi> or both mixed together, for the very roughness of the <hi>Ashes</hi> will, in some measure, contribute to wear off the <hi>Rosin,</hi> and thereby assist the <hi>Lixivial Salt</hi> that is in them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:52480:156"/>3. If the Quantity of the <hi>Resinous Opium</hi> was great, it will be convenient, when you perceive the <hi>Vomiting</hi> begin to abate, to give as much of <hi>Daffee's Elixir,</hi> or <hi>Tinctura Sacra</hi> made in some Spirituous Liquor, as does usually give Six Stools; it is best <hi>Purging</hi> with a Liquid, because speedier in <hi>Operation,</hi> and that it should be <hi>Spirituous,</hi> to help the <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Rosin.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When you are satisfied that <hi>Relaxation</hi> is the Cause, use all Means to procure a due <hi>Contraction</hi> of all Parts; which is to be done,

            </p>
            <p>After the <hi>Person</hi> has Vomited 3 or 4 <hi>Times,</hi> or so often as that you may judge the <hi>Stomach</hi> well cleared of the <hi>Opiate,</hi> give <hi>Half</hi> an <hi>Ounce</hi> of <hi>Cream</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> finely poudered in thin <hi>Broth, Whey, Water, Small Beer,</hi> or any convenient Liquid, which will correct the <hi>Opiate</hi> if any remains at <hi>Stomach,</hi> turn the <hi>Vomit</hi> to a <hi>Purger</hi> to clear the <hi>Intestines</hi> also, and contribute much to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Parts,</hi> which you must always have in your <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as the ruling <hi>Intention</hi> in this Case. Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You must use <hi>Contracters</hi> all the <hi>Time,</hi> the chief of which are <hi>Cold, grievous Sensation,</hi> (or <hi>Pain</hi>) <hi>Terrour, Fear, Voluntary Motion,</hi> and <hi>Acids,</hi> which last cannot be so well used during the <hi>Vomiting,</hi> lest they stop it.</p>
            <p>Therefore (especially if the Person be very Stupid) keep him very <hi>Cold,</hi> for he will hardly feel it, nor take <hi>Cold,</hi> because the <hi>Relaxation,</hi> and the Insensibleness of <hi>Grievance</hi> by <hi>Cold, &amp;c.</hi> keeps the <hi>Pores</hi> open; let him be (if possible) in some Motion, as <hi>Walking, Hewing, Sawing, Knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Tugging, &amp;c.</hi> the more <hi>violent</hi> it is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because it causes more <hi>Contraction</hi> and <hi>Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to prevent <hi>Sopors;</hi> To force him to Motion, (if need be) <hi>Pricking, Pinching,</hi> or <hi>Whipping</hi> him about the <hi>Legs, &amp;c.</hi> will be of good <hi>Use,</hi> because <hi>grievous Sensation</hi> adds <hi>defensive Contraction</hi> (which is the greatest sort) to that of the <hi>intentive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi> by <hi>voluntary Motion.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:52480:157"/>These Means failing, he should be exposed stark naked to the coldest <hi>Air,</hi> and in desperate Cases thrown suddenly at unawares into <hi>cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> by which Means you cause <hi>Terrour, Surprise,</hi> and <hi>Cold,</hi> (which are the highest and most forcible <hi>Contracters</hi>) to conspire to the <hi>Contraction</hi> of Parts; Hence it is that Drunken <hi>People,</hi> who are so from <hi>Relaxation,</hi> become Sober, as in a moment, by that <hi>Means.</hi>

               <hi>Note,</hi> That the Case may well happen, that the <hi>Rosin</hi> may stick at <hi>Stomach,</hi> and yet no Signs or Symptoms appear but those of <hi>Relaxation,</hi> by <hi>Reason</hi> that the Feeling at <hi>Stomach</hi> may thereby be disabled to take any notice of it.</p>
            <p>To be sure of this, you have no other <hi>Means,</hi> because the <hi>Symptoms</hi> and Effects of <hi>grievous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> cannot appear, where it is not (for the aforesaid <hi>Reason</hi>) but to examine whether the <hi>Opiate</hi> was a <hi>resinous one,</hi> as <hi>crude Opium, Extract</hi> out of <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> or the like, for then you may conclude, especially if they were given in a <hi>massy solid Form,</hi> as that of <hi>Pills, &amp;c.</hi> without se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Particles of the <hi>Rosin</hi> by other Things, as the <hi>Yolk</hi> of an <hi>Egg, &amp;c.</hi> that the <hi>Rosin</hi> may in all Probability<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>stick at <hi>Stomach,</hi> tho' its Symptoms do not appear for the aforesaid <hi>Reason.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XXXII.</hi> Of the Use of the <hi>Panacea, &amp;c.</hi> to compose the Sensitive Soul, Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Have shown <hi>how</hi> and <hi>why</hi> it <hi>composes</hi> and <hi>quiets</hi> the <hi>sensitive Soul, Spirits, Bloud, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> &amp;c. and by that means allays all the <hi>Fury, Commotions, Perturbations,</hi> and <hi>turbulent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances</hi> thereof, and that often without <hi>Sleep,</hi> but much better with it. It follows therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it prevents and takes off all Frets and turbulent Passions of the sensitive Soul;</hi> as, <hi>Anger, uneasie Agitations,</hi> and <hi>Tosses of the Mind, Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness, Fretfulness, Discontents, Disquietudes, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactions, Murmurs, turmoilings</hi> and <hi>vexatious Thoughts, Anxieties, Solicitudes, &amp;c.</hi> and all the <hi>evil Effects</hi> thereof; as, <hi>Watchings, Waste of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> or <hi>Strength, Lossitudes, Hypochondriacal Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, Cachexies, Scurvies, &amp;c.</hi> But these last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long most properly to its <hi>Alterative Faculty</hi> or <hi>Vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All involuntary furious Agitations of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Soul and Spirits;</hi> as, <hi>Madness,</hi> more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Melancholy Madnesses,</hi> or such as proceed from <hi>grievous Thoughts</hi> or <hi>Apprehensions, Losses, Crosses, Despair, Fears, Terrours,</hi> or <hi>the like;</hi> but they are not so good in <hi>Merry Madnesses,</hi> as those from <hi>Ioy, Venereal Fury,</hi> and such-like, which answers the great Disputes about <hi>Opiates</hi> in <hi>Madnesses, Deliriums, Epileptical Fits, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions general</hi> and <hi>particular,</hi> as those of the <hi>Head, Rising of the Lights, Vomitings, Hiccoughs, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings,</hi>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:52480:169"/>
               <hi>Keckings, Convulsive Asthma's, Palpitations,</hi> and <hi>Tremblings</hi> of the <hi>Heart, Shakings</hi> and <hi>Shiverings</hi> upon <hi>Fear, Terror, Cold, Pain, Ague-Fits, Convulsive Colicks, Hysterick Fits, Iliack Passions, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>All Fevers and Frets of Humours that happen from any of the aforesaid Causes; Or</hi> from any <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Motion,</hi> voluntary or involuntary, as <hi>Labour, Running, Hewing, Fighting,</hi> or any <hi>vehement Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, Ratlings, Tossings, Concussions</hi> in <hi>Coaches, Waggons, Boats</hi> in stormy Weather, <hi>violent Riding, &amp;c. Or</hi> from <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Fire, Sun, Baths, Hot-Houses, Bagnio's, Crowds, lying too many</hi> in one <hi>Bed,</hi> or with too <hi>much Clothes; Or</hi> from <hi>grievous Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Irritation,</hi> or <hi>Pain,</hi> as <hi>Fevers</hi> upon <hi>Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Abscesses, Buboes, Stone, Colick, Cardialgia, Wounds, Fractures, Dislocations, Confusions, Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,  Lithotomy, Paracentesis,</hi> or any painful Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Noble Art</hi> of <hi>Chirurgery; Agony,</hi> or <hi>Pain</hi> of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> as its <hi>second Fever,</hi> and the like: <hi>Or</hi> from <hi>Fluxes,</hi> as tedious and turbulent <hi>Vomitings, Diarrheas, Dysenteries, Cholera's, Iliack Passions, artificial Purging,</hi> and all <hi>symptomatick</hi> or <hi>immaterial Fevers</hi> whatsoever, which either never had any <hi>Matter,</hi> but proceed from such agitating Causes as I mentioned, or remain (as some do) after the <hi>grieving Matter</hi> is carry'd off by <hi>Vomiting, Purging, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I forbore mentioning <hi>Pleurisies</hi> and <hi>Peripneumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia's</hi> among the <hi>Fevers,</hi> that it prevents or takes off, because there are great <hi>Disputes</hi> whether <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates</hi> are convenient in those Cases, which I hope to determine.</p>
            <p>Unless it be when the said Distempers are come to that pass, that it is dangerous to cause <hi>Sleep,</hi> or take away any of the Sense of the <hi>Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of the Matter to be expectorated, lest it
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:52480:170"/>
should be too much amass'd in the <hi>Bronchias,</hi> or Wind-pipe, and so choak the Person, I see no cause to forbid them any more than <hi>Sleep,</hi> or <hi>Opiates,</hi> in other <hi>Inflammations,</hi> wherein they are highly beneficial, to give <hi>Ease,</hi> cause <hi>Sleep, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and take off, or at least moderate the <hi>Fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I see many good <hi>Reasons</hi> to use them: 1. Because, as a <hi>Sal-Volatile-Oleosum,</hi> they reserate and resolve <hi>clammy Humours,</hi> and are so agreeable in Principles (as <hi>Menstraums</hi> should be) to the thing to be resolved; I cannot doubt but <hi>Red Poppy</hi> is, upon <hi>Experience,</hi> stated a <hi>Specifick</hi> in those <hi>Cases</hi> for that <hi>reason.</hi> 2. Because these <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers</hi> (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> speaks) are from a <hi>segrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Humours</hi> by <hi>Agitation, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Opiates</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Composers</hi> thereof. 3. Because they are such great <hi>Discussers;</hi> and, 4. Open the <hi>Pores</hi> to let the discussed Matter quite out of the Body. 5. Because it may be that by its <hi>Relaxation</hi> upon such <hi>Resolution,</hi> the lodged Matter may be caused to flow off, and circulate again, and so be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, discussed, and carried off by the open <hi>Pores.</hi> 6. Because it envigorates Nature to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form those Things: And, 7. Gives <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> by <hi>Sleep.</hi> So that all Things considered, I think (as <hi>Experience</hi> assures us) that <hi>Red Poppy,</hi> or <hi>Opiates</hi> in due <hi>Quantity,</hi> are the very best <hi>Remedies</hi> that can be used. Hence it is that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedelius</hi> calls <hi>Opium</hi> an <hi>Antipleuritick Specifick,</hi> he having observed, (as I and others have done) That the whole <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Disease</hi> and <hi>Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> will succeed much better by their <hi>Use.</hi> He adds also, That he has very often cured them by its help, without <hi>letting of Bloud;</hi> which is
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:52480:170"/>
an infallible sign of their <hi>good Effect,</hi> since the <hi>Pleurisie</hi> can hardly be cured without <hi>Bleeding.</hi> I cannot see how an Effect that bears such Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to <hi>Sleep</hi> can do any more <hi>Harm</hi> than <hi>Sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Etmuller</hi> also advises the giving of <hi>Opiates</hi> not only in the Beginning, but also during the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease</hi> of the <hi>Pleurisie</hi> or <hi>Peripneumoniae:</hi> So that I conclude, That they are of <hi>excellent Use</hi> in those <hi>Diseases,</hi> unless it be when <hi>Sleep</hi> or them may cause too much Insensibleness of the <hi>Bronchias,</hi> and so retard <hi>Expectoration,</hi> when the Case is such that the Want thereof may endanger the Person's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choak'd.</p>
            <p>We have also many <hi>Histories</hi> of Persons cured in other <hi>Fevers</hi> by large <hi>Doses</hi> of <hi>Opiates.</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that <hi>resinous Opiates</hi> causing Vomiting and great Disturbances, by reason of ill <hi>Digestion</hi> in those Cases, might be one great Cause of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Ieolousies</hi> in giving <hi>Opiates,</hi> which is easily prevented by giving <hi>liquid Opiates</hi> void of any resinous Particles, as the <hi>liquid Panacea, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It does, by composing, quieting, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Motion and Perturbation of the Bloud, conduce much to the stop of its <hi>Efflux</hi> in <hi>Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhages</hi> (or <hi>Bleedings</hi>) that are <hi>unnatural;</hi> as at <hi>Nose,</hi> in <hi>spitting</hi> and <hi>vomiting of Bloud, bleeding</hi> at the <hi>Hemorrhoids,</hi> in <hi>Dysenteries, pissing of Bloud, &amp;c.</hi> and sometime in profuse <hi>Menses,</hi> when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from a <hi>Fever,</hi> or too much Motion of the <hi>Bloud</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> and not an <hi>over-Relaxation</hi> or <hi>Dilatation</hi> of the <hi>Pores,</hi> which must be well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished.</p>

               <item>3. <hi>Note,</hi> That the drier the Body is, the more unapt are <hi>Opiates</hi> to cause <hi>Sleep;</hi> therefore dry <hi>Bodies,</hi> as of <hi>old Men, Hectical Persons, &amp;c.</hi> should be well moistened by <hi>incrassative Moisteners,</hi> as <hi>Emulsions,</hi> and such Things as are above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ordered in the <hi>Chapter</hi> of the relaxing <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Opiates.</hi>

               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:52480:179"/>From what is said, I do conclude, that <hi>Opiates</hi> do cause <hi>Sleep</hi> very readily where the <hi>Oily Parts</hi> abound; and that Things, that have a fine <hi>Oleous Sulphur,</hi> are very good <hi>Correctors</hi> of it, where acrimonious <hi>Volatile Salts</hi> abound, in order to cause <hi>Sleep;</hi> and that hence it is, that some ancient People will often Sleep better by the Use of the aforementioned smooth <hi>fermented sulphureous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,</hi> than by the <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Opium;</hi> from all which it appears, that <hi>Sleep</hi> is not such a <hi>Property</hi> of <hi>Opium</hi> as People make it to be, because, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides relaxing, <hi>Sleep</hi> also requires a great <hi>Rest</hi> of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and the <hi>sensitive Soul.</hi>

            <p>It seems very probable from the Premises, that <hi>Anodyne Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> would be excellent to cause <hi>old Men</hi> to Sleep; for it doubtless causes Sleep only by obtunding and qualifying our <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salts,</hi> as <hi>White <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>IT <hi>palliates, moderates, and stops Fluxes;</hi> 1. By taking away the sense of the Irritation of Humours, which cause <hi>Contraction</hi> to squeese them out, and promote their motion. 2. Because it composes and stills the motion of Humours by the <hi>Relaxation</hi> and the <hi>Sleep</hi> that it causes, which quiets motions. 3. Because thereby, and by its combining <hi>Agreeableness</hi> and <hi>Texture,</hi> it <hi>congregates</hi> the <hi>disgregated Humours.</hi> 4. Because the <hi>Relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> suspends the <hi>Humours.</hi> 5. Because it <hi>discusses</hi> ill <hi>Humours.</hi> 6. Because the <hi>Pores</hi> being opened by the <hi>Relaxation,</hi> the Humours that caused the Fluxes are gradually perspired by that most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and universal sort of <hi>Evacuation;</hi> for 'tis plain <hi>Reason</hi> and common <hi>Observation,</hi> that a plentiful <hi>Evacuation</hi> at <hi>Pores</hi> stops <hi>Fluxes per Anum, &amp;c.</hi> and if it continues, perfectly <hi>cures</hi> them. ☞ Hence it is, that the <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Opiates</hi> continued, does happily not only palliate, but perfectly cure <hi>Diarrheas, Dysenteries, Defluxions, Catarrhs, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It therefore follows, that it is of great <hi>Use,</hi>

            </list>
            <p>But it is not advisable to use them in <hi>Fluxes,</hi> that are apparently, or very probably, for speedy and ready Benefit; otherwise (as was said of <hi>Pain</hi>) use them to respite <hi>Nature,</hi> which they do as <hi>Sleep</hi> does, nay, in many <hi>Cases,</hi> the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their <hi>Use</hi> may quite Cure them, for the several <hi>Reasons</hi> given in the beginning of this <hi>Chapter;</hi> What a pleasant <hi>Cure</hi> then do some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse that reject them? leaving their <hi>Patients</hi> to be worn out with dismal <hi>Pains, tedious</hi> and <hi>profuse Evacuations, want of Appetite and Digestion,</hi> the common Consequences of <hi>Diarrheas, Disente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>Loosenesses</hi> give Half the first <hi>Dose</hi> every Four <hi>Hours</hi> till the <hi>Flux</hi> begins to be moderated, then be more wary in giving it, for what is afterward given may have its full <hi>Effect;</hi> therefore be very cautious, by giving but small Quantities both in this Case and in <hi>Vomiting,</hi> when they are mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in some <hi>degree,</hi> because <hi>Opiates</hi> then have their full Effect without any <hi>Diminution</hi> or <hi>Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>In other <hi>Fluxes</hi> a <hi>moderate Dose</hi> may serve, as in <hi>Desluxions, Catarrhs, &amp;c.</hi> however let the <hi>Dose</hi> rather incline to the highest than the lowest, and suffice (if possible) to cause Sleep, which is a great Effect in these Cases.</p>
