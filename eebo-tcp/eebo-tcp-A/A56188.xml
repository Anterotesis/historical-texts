         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They have a designe, Beloved, to set up a man in stead of God, who may create new Articles of Faith at his pleasure, and impose them upon necessity of salvation. In vain,

it seems, came Christ from the bosome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reveal his will: in vain doth the Spirit lead us to all truth: in vain have we thought that our Priests lips should preserve knowledge, and that the people should seek it at their mouth: in vain have we gone to the Law and to the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, concluding that if men spoke not according to them, it was because there was no light in them. If we must lay aside all, and wait upon the Popes Oracles, how shall we be sure that he is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Not because he saith so: for if he bears witness of himself, his witness is not true.—Not because the Scripture saith so: for that (they say) is no further true then he confirms it. Not because he is St. <hi>Peters</hi> successour: for we are not sure St. <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Rome:</hi> if he was there, we are not sure that he was Bishop there, being an Apostle of the Circumcision, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Jews, and not of the Romans. <q>If he was there Bishop, we are not sure he was infallible, who denyed his Master thrice, and dissembled once:—If he was infallible, we are not sure he left any heirs of his grace and spirit,—or if any, we are not sure he left one in a perpetual and visible suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession at <hi>Rome:—</hi>That he so be queathed his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility to his Chair, as that whosoever sits in it, cannot but speak true; that all which sit where he sate, must by some instinct say as he taught:—That if <hi>Peter</hi> was infallible by vertue of Christs promise; yet that what Christ said to him, absolutely, ere ever <hi>Rome</hi> was thought of, must be referred, yea, tyed to it: that the Pope

            <p>You are taught to draw neer to God, to hear his Word in a Language you understand, and to make your requests known unto God, in a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some form of sound words you can assent to: and there come in some (it may be) when you are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in one place that believe not, or one unlearned; he is convinced of all, he is <hi>judged of all: and thus are the secrets of his heart made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest; and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.—</hi>When they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are together in one place, they all speak with tongues; and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, and they say that they are mad: so that the great God is blasphemed, Christian Religion is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, Atheism is promoted, and the world is ready to be shut up in unbelief.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We, our God, our Church hath taught you a Religion that teacheth <hi>to deny all ungodliness,</hi> and <hi>all worldly lusts; to hate every false way; to allow</hi> no

It's a sad thing to see the wiser sort of the World read those stories on winter-nights for sport, which the poor credulous multitude hear in their Churches, with a devout astonishment. Neither do they satisfie themselves with these false suggestions they have thrust upon the world; but in conscience of their untruth, they go about to deprave all Authors that may give evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; to outface ancient truths, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face all monuments of Primitive belief and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; leaving nothing unattempted against hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or earth that may promote their interest, and disable us their innocent adversaries; though thereby they blot out all Religion, and suppress all truth.</p>

senses: You must see Bread, yet not believe it; you must taste Wine, yet say it's blood.—And yet to what pass are we brought, if we cannot believe our senses? Yea, you must worship those whom the Scriptures declare wicked, for Saints; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore them, whom all the world know were lewd, for <hi>Martyrs.—</hi>You must honour Rebels, Villains, with Temples, Altars and Invocations: and yet you must believe them who lived according to scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-rule, to be villains, <hi>&amp;c.

How shall you, if you are Papists, know whether you hear effectually,—whether you pray savingly,—whether you receive the Sacrament successfully, seeing you depend wholly upon the Priests inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?—We must needs pity that religion that

is not sure of lawful Bishops, because they know not their intention that ordained them; no regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Priests, because they know not their thoughts that ordained them:—a religion this sure, that was contrived to perplex the world.</p>

They of <hi>Rome</hi> make it their business to torment and frighten you, to vex and perplex you: they will make you believe that so soon as you are born you must be cast remedilesly unto the eternal pains of hell for want of Baptism, which you could not live to desire: Thus they damn all your infants, and throw all those inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents to hell whom our Saviour thought fittest for the kingdome of heaven. And if you have lived beyond your baptism, they will fright you, poor souls, with expectation of feigned torments in Purgatory, not inferiour (for the time) to the flames of the damned. How wretchedly and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully must you, poor men, live? how sadly will you die in that way, wherein you are sure to go through a hell to heaven? yea, you are not sure you shall ever go to heaven; for they will perswade you that you neither can nor ought to be assured either of present grace, or of future salvation.—We indeed wish you to make your calling and your election sure,—but they say you cannot.—Oh an uncomfortable religion, wherein I must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to an eternity, but God knoweth whether of woe or weale; wherein I must say to an immortal

Neither must you onely live in fear of your estate in another world, while you are in that way, but in infinite cares and vexations in this,—while they rack your consciences with the needless tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a necessary shrift,—wherein the vertue of Absolution depends on the fulness of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that upon examination; and the sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of examination is so full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Beloved, if they could shew you a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way for Gods glory, the advancement of grace, and the settlement of your comfort; we would perswade you to follow them,—but now it appears that they desire onely the advancement of the Pope, whom if you submit to, you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what you will; for he writ to Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> that he would confirm all her and our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if she would but own him head of the Church. Now it appears that they destroy religion, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger poor souls, and disturb the world, onely for a

few mens interests, who seek their own.—Mark and avoid them, have nothing to do with them, lest if you perish, your blood be upon your own heads: keep close to God, stick fast to his truth, keep within his Church, live by his grace, keep up the power of religion in your hearts, be at peace among your selves; and your blood be upon our <hi>heads if you perish.</hi>

               <p>But if what is spoken upon examination, appear to have any repugnancie with <hi>godliness,</hi> in any one branch or duty thereunto belonging, we may be sure the words cannot be wholesome words.

I note it not without much gratulation and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to us of this Church. There are, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, afoot in the Christian world Controversies more then a good many; Decads, Centuries, Chiliads of Novel Tenents brought in this last Age, (which were never believed, many of them scarce ever heard of in the ancient Church) by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries of all sorts.

by private Opinions) I say, the publick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Church is such, as is not justly chargeable with any impiety, contrarious to any part of that duty we owe either to God or man. O that our conversation were as free from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception as our Religion is! Oh that we were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently careful to preserve the honour and lustre of the truth we profess, by the correspondencie of our lives and actions thereunto! And upon this point we dare boldly joyn issue with our clamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous adversaries on either hand, Papists, I mean, and Disciplinarians; who do both so loudly, but unjustly accuse us and our Religion: they, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and licentious; these, as Popish and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. As <hi>Eliah</hi> once said to the Baalites, That God that answereth by <hi>fire, let him him be God:</hi> so may we say to either of both; and when we have said it, not fear to put it to a fair tryal: That Church whose Doctrine, Confession and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is most according to <hi>godliness, Let that be the true Church.</hi>
