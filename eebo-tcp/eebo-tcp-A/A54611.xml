            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

before them, upon the last Meeting-day of <hi>their</hi> last year, and next before that of their <hi>Anniversary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection:</hi> Because, as Drapers cut Patterns of their whole Cloth out of an End, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the End is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the rest, but because it may be best spared; so (I suppose)
<pb facs="tcp:63700:3"/>
the <hi>Society</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that this Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise pass for a Sample, <hi>pro tanto,</hi> of what they are doing; for that the same may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to consist of three parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> being an Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to explain the Intricate Notions, or <hi>Philosophia Prima</hi> of Place, Time, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Elasticity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a way which the meanest Member of adult Mankind is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The <hi>second</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to excite the World to the study of a little Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, by shewing the use of <hi>Duplicate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions</hi> in some of the most weighty of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb facs="tcp:63700:4"/>
affairs, which Notion a Child of 12 years old may learn in an hour: And the <hi>last</hi> being, without Chymerical Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to consider such points and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, even in <hi>Atoms</hi> (such, whereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a Million do not make up one visible <hi>Corpusculum,</hi>) as may
<pb facs="tcp:63700:5"/>
give an intelligible Account of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xures, Mixtures, and Mobilities of all the parts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
            <p>In like manner, 'tis the Profession of the <hi>Society,</hi> to make My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious things plain; to explode and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use all insignificant and puzling words;
<pb facs="tcp:63700:5"/>
to improve and apply little small threds of Mathematicks to vast uses; and yet not to neglect, the finest Consideration, even of <hi>Atoms,</hi> where the same is necessary. The which purposes of theirs, I venture to say, do as much differ (both as to <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:63700:6"/>
from what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Wit</hi> (and which takes with far the greater part of Mankind,) as the skill of Drawing and Painting a Cloud or Periwig doth from that of Designing or Painting many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated Figures of Men and Beasts in some one Table,
<pb facs="tcp:63700:6"/>
wherein each is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to express some particular passion, and all standing together to contain the true and entire Spirit of the Story represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: For, in the <hi>latter,</hi> precise exactness is indispensible, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the <hi>former,</hi> not onely liberty always, but even extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb facs="tcp:63700:7"/>
sometimes is not onely tolerable, but laudable. And when I have said this; I withal say, that there is one Glory of the <hi>Sun,</hi> another of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and another of the <hi>Stars,</hi> which may all consist toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying or malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning each other.

all these several Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries shine steddily in your Graces Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Being, I say, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to publish this Exercise, I have presumed to dedicate it to your Grace. First, because the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi> have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to order it to be published; (I dare
<pb facs="tcp:63700:8"/>
not say, as approving it, but as committing it to Examination.) Secondly, because your Grace doth not onely love the search of Truth, but did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Me 30 years ago as to Enquiries of this kind. For about that time in <hi>Paris, <unclear>Mersennus</unclear>, Gassendy,</hi> Mr. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:63700:9"/>
Lectures and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: Much of which honours and helps I ow unto your Grace, and have a fresh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of them. Thirdly, because my Lord <hi>Ogle</hi> being now about to carve a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Figure upon my Lord his Son, by his careful Education of him, I thought it a
<pb facs="tcp:63700:9"/>
service to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, as well as an Expression of my Thanks for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer acceptance of my Endeavours, to call upon him, not onely to instruct my Lord his Son in some Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicsk, but also to store and stock him with variety of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Data</hi> and <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>

whereupon to exercise the same; since <hi>Lines</hi> &amp; <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> without <hi>those,</hi> are but like Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strings without a Lute or a Hand. For, my Lord, there is a <hi>Political Arithmetic,</hi> and a <hi>Geometrical Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> to be yet further cultivated in the World; the Errors
<pb facs="tcp:63700:10"/>
and Defects where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither Wit, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric, nor Interest can more than palliate, never cure. For, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, Disproportion, and Inconsistence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rectified by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sermocinations, though made all of figurate and measured periods, pronounced in Tune and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb facs="tcp:63700:11"/>
through the most advantageous organs; much less by Grandisonous or Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonical Nonsence, farded with formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; no more than vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Wines can be remedied with Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Honey, or ill Cookery with enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous proportions of Spice and Sugar:

how little progress I have made in thirty years time upon those Studies.

            <head>A DISCOURSE TO THE Royal Society.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as this <hi>Society</hi> has been censured (though without much cause) for spending too much time in matters not directly tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to profit and palpable Advantages (as the Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Air and the like)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63700:17"/>
I have therefore, to streigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this crooked stick, bent it and my present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course the quite contrary way, <hi>viz.</hi> to the <hi>Sails</hi> and <hi>Shapes</hi> of <hi>Ships;</hi> to <hi>Carpentry</hi> and <hi>Carriages;</hi> to <hi>Mills, Mill-dams, Bulwarks;</hi> to the <hi>Labour of Horses,</hi> and to several other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: The which are not only gross enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but are also as gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled in this Exercise, to prevent the further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of needless Nici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63700:17"/>
and to leave room for your own further thoughts upon the same.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as We have been also complained of for producing nothing New, I have together with my Instances and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, above and hereafter mentioned, presented you as an Appendix, to what is said of <hi>Springs</hi> and other <hi>Elastique bodies,</hi> with a new Theory (as I think) of <hi>Elasticity</hi> it self, and that mechanically explicated in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63700:18"/>
order to make a breach on this hard Rock in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and to chip off a little of that Block which has long lain thwart Us, in the way of Our Enquiries. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter I have followed the Example of <hi>Elderly Divines,</hi> who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Flocks not to mend their lives by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Discourses about Predestination, Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, &amp;c. betake themselves at last to preach <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good Wooks,</hi>

               <hi>Neighbourly Love</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> or <hi>Doing as we would be done unto,</hi> and the like. For I have in this Exercise declined all Speculations not tending to practice, and ventured at few new Hypotheses, but that of <hi>Elasticity;</hi> rather calling upon you to review your own former Observations, and to apply your <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks</hi> to <hi>Matter,</hi> so as both may be improved to the profitable purposes hereafter mentioned.</p>

            <p>Having thus enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my several Instances, wherein <hi>Duplicate,</hi> and <hi>Subduplicate proportion</hi> is of great importance; I might
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63700:22"/>
now fall down-right upon the Application of those proportions to each of the respective matters above mentioned. But because Custome hath made it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most necessary to make a <hi>Preface</hi> to every Discourse, my Preface to this one <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> shall be such, as may serve me for many more; that is, an Explication of what I my self (at least) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by <hi>Matter, Body, Figure, Place, Motion, Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, Quality, Habit, Time,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63700:22"/>
               <hi>Proportion, Weight, Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Force,</hi> and <hi>Elasticity;</hi> which I shall do without imposing or scarce recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the same to any other. For I would be glad, when any man speaks to me in matters of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by words which he uses often, that he would first give me a <hi>Dictionary</hi> of such words, to contein what he himself meaneth by each of them. Wherefore I shall, as a Preface, prefix this Dictionary, wherein I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63700:23"/>
dare not define <hi>Matter</hi> by <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Substance,</hi> because I think most men conceive <hi>Matter</hi> better than they do either of these two words, <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Substance.</hi> Nor do I define the words, <hi>Think, Consider,</hi> or <hi>Conceive,</hi> by the words, <hi>Soul, Spirit, Act,</hi> or the like, for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But presuming you all understand, <hi>conceive, imagine,</hi> or <hi>fancy</hi> the words <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Thought,</hi> as well as any other I can use, I venture to say as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63700:23"/>
followeth, and first, That</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Place</hi> is the Image or Fancy of Matter, or Matter considered.</item>

               <item>5. <hi>Situation,</hi> several Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces considered together.</item>
               <item>6. <hi>Figure</hi> is Quantity and Situation considered together.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63700:24"/>7. <hi>Body</hi> is Matter and Figure considered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</item>

Place or Space considered together.</item>
               <item>14. <hi>Force</hi> is Body and Swiftness considered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</item>
               <item>15. <hi>Right</hi> is the Image of Possession, and is to it as Place to Body.</item>
               <item>16. <hi>Elasticity</hi> I shall speak of hereafter.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In the next place, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all the <hi>First Matter</hi> of the World to be <hi>Atoms;</hi> that is, Matter Immutable in Magnitude and Figure. I suppose <hi>Corpuscles</hi> to be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63700:25"/>
as many Atoms joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as make up a <hi>visible</hi> or sensible <hi>Object,</hi> and that all <hi>Iuncture</hi> of <hi>Atomes</hi> is made by their <hi>Innate moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Moreover I suppose, That every Atom is like the Earths Globe or Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, wherein are <hi>three Points</hi> considerable, <hi>viz.</hi> two in the surface, called <hi>Poles,</hi> and one within the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, called <hi>Center,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Byas,</hi> because in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms we consider neither <hi>Magnitude</hi> nor <hi>Gravity.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:63700:25"/>
These Atoms also may have each of them such Motions as <hi>Copernicus</hi> attributes to the Earth, or more. Lastly, Motion <hi>to</hi> or <hi>from</hi> a Point makes a <hi>streight Line,</hi> and, <hi>about</hi> it, a <hi>Circle.</hi> But <hi>from</hi> the Center to several Points in the Circle, is <hi>Angle.</hi> We further say, that the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Corpuscles</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned motions of Atoms; and the motions of bigger and Tangible Bodies (<hi>viz.</hi> their qualities) are decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63700:26"/>
out of the <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Situation, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Magnitude</hi> of Corpuscles; and that out of, and by, the premisses all <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in nature must be sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And this is all the Preface I shall trouble you with, being (as was said) the <hi>Dictionary</hi> wherein to find what I mean by every material word I intend to use in this ensuing Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, which we thus begin, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="example">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:63700:26"/>
               <head>
                  <hi>The First Instance,</hi> Wherein Duplicate, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplicate Ratio or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is considerable, Is</head>
               <p>IN the <hi>Velocities</hi> of two equal and like <hi>Ships;</hi> which Velocities, I say, are the <hi>square Roots</hi> of the <hi>Powers</hi> which either drive or draw them; as, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Such two Ships having sails near double
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63700:27"/>
to each other, or as 49 to 25, the Velocity will be as 5, the square Root of 25 unto 7, the like Root of 49. Again, if the sails be near triple, or as 49 to 16, there the Velocity shall be as 7 (the Root of 49) to 4 (the Root of 16.) So as a <hi>quadruple Sail</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to <hi>double</hi> swiftness, and <hi>noncuple</hi> to <hi>treble;</hi> that is, The sails must be in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate proportion to the swiftness of the Ship; or this, in subduplicate to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63700:27"/>Again, let there be two Ships of Equal sails, but of unlike or unequal sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, suppose the head of one extremely obtuse or quite flat, and the head of the other to be an <hi>Isosceles Triangle</hi> added thereunto; I say, the swiftness of these Bodies shall be as the Roots of the Perpendicular of that Triangle to the Root of half the Base, or half breadth of the same. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Or if the same Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular head be cyphered
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63700:28"/>
away into an Angle from bottom to top; then, as the Root of the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular is to the Root of the Depth or Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, so are the Velocities. Thirdly, If the said head be cyphered both wayes together, then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Velocities shall be as half of one of the above mentioned Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions added to the other whole Proportion: <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> Suppose the Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the triangle-head
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63700:28"/>
be 36, the half breadth 9, and the whole depth be 4; then the one Proportion shall be as 6, the Root of 36, to 3, the Root of 9: The half of which Proportion is as 6 to 6; and the other Proportion is as 6, the Root of 36, to 2, the Root of 4. Now add the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of 6 to 6, to that of 6 to 2, the sum will be, as 36 to 12, or as 3 to 1.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Suppose two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralellepipedons of unequal heads or resistances, <hi>Ex. gr.</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63700:29"/>
as 8 to 5, or 64 to 40: And suppose the Sail on the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to that on the lesser, to be as 9 to 4, or 72 to 32; then the Velocity of the bigger shall be to the Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the lesser, as the Root of 45 is to the Root of 32. For if the Resistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be as 64 to 40; then, if the sail of the bigger to that of the less were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, the sail of the less should be 45, whereas we suppose it but 32. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63700:29"/>
the Velocity shall be as the Root of 45, which is almost 7, to the Root of 32, which is about 5¬Ω, that is, as about 14 to 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Memorandum,</hi> That wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Sails (by lessening the intersperst apertures between the threds of the Sail-cloth) doth make the Sail, as it were, bigger; which biggerness may be known and measured by the increase of the Ships velocity upon such wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For, if the Ship should
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63700:30"/>
move one tenth part quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er after wetting than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we may conclude the Sails are swollen to the equivalent of about ‚Öï part bigger; for 100 (whose Root is 10) exceeds 81, whose Root is 9, by about ‚Öï of 100.</p>
               <p>By these ways the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Velocities, arising from the different Trim of the same Ship, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so computed, the best Trim being that which makes least resistance, <hi>caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:63700:30"/>Now, having said thus much of the Effects of Sharpness and Sails, (the two principal causes of Velocity in shipping, and unto which all others may be referred;) I shall add, That the want of these two Advantages are the chief cause, why short, bluff, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermasted Vessels sail chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than others.</p>
               <p>For suppose two Ships<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> of equal burthens, but of unlike dimensions, the main Beam of the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63700:31"/>
scarse ‚Öì of the Keels length, and in the other, a full ‚Öï<hi rend="sup">th</hi>; I say first, that the Hull of the latter shall cost ‚Öì part more than that of the former, and the advantage as to sailing shall be scarce ‚Öô part. Again, suppose, the sharper could carry ¬Ω as much sail more as the bluf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, whereof the advantage in sailing would be ‚Öô part more, in all ‚Öì. Now, where the Sails are as 2 to 3, the Masts and Yards must be as 4 to 9 in substance;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63700:31"/>
and in value much more: And where the Masts and Yards are as 4 to 9 in weight and bulk, the Cord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and Rigging must be answerable: And where the Masts, Yards, Sails, and Rigging are great, the Wind-taught of the Ship will correspond, and will require proportionable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and the weight of the Anchor must follow the size of the Cable, and the number of hands must be proportionable to all the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63700:32"/>
premisses: So as the one Ship will cost at least double as much as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and will sail at double charge of Wages and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, Ware and Tare, &amp;c. Now if no trading Ship be (one time with another) above 1/10 of her whole reign under sail, or 6 days in 60, suppose the sharper and larger-sail'd Ship sail in 4 dayes what the other performs in 6; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence will be but 2 dayes in 60, or 1/30 part of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63700:32"/>
and Victuals, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charges; whereas the charges is supposed to be more than double. I say, this consideration is of great weight in Vessels of burden, especially such as carry gross and cheap bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky Commodities, neither liable to damage or perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Of which goods 7 parts of 10 of all Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage do consist. But on the other hand, where safety against Enemies, speedy dispatch upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63700:33"/>
occasions, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupation of a Market are in the case, there sharpness and great Sails may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions practicable.</p>
               <p>Having thus digressed, I mind you that we said, <hi>Velocities are the Roots of Resistances and Extent of Sails,</hi> &amp;c. It may be well askt, How we know the same, since that very few Seamen or Shipwrights, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their writing or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses seem to understand
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63700:33"/>
or own this important Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. To which I answer, that I have by many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, Calculations, and Comparisons, found the same to be <hi>praeter propter</hi> true, although there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny circumstances which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingle themselves in this Experiment, so as to disturb and confound it: As namely, The ill placing of Masts, The ill cutting and standing of Sails, The ill Trim of the Vessel, with the Cleanness or Foulness
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63700:34"/>
of the same; The Sails more or less worn or wet; as also taught or slack Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, &amp;c. Wherefore not onely to avoid these last mentioned Intricacies, but also to make these Positions Examinable by every one that desires it; I say, that the different Velocity of Bodies (of several sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and as drawn or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by different Powers of knocks or falling weights,) have been by my self and others much experimented
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63700:34"/>
in large <hi>Canales,</hi> or <hi>Troughs</hi> of water, fitted with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Apparatus for that purpose, and by no man more, nor more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously, than by the Right Honorable the Lord <hi>Brounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> President of this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. For I do not think it hard to conceive, that Weights and Sails are pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of like Effect, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to the same Principle; so as if a Body have moved in double velocity, when drawn by a quadruple
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63700:35"/>
weight; and in triple, when by a noncuple weight; I doubt not but the same will hold in Sails, or other impellent Powers of the same proportions.</p>
               <p>And for the further clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or easier trying hereof, I offer two small Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments heretofore made in this Society: The one, to measure the Velocity of the Wind, and the other its Power or Equivalency to Weight; whereby it did and will appear, when the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63700:35"/>
wind is of double velocity, it will stir a quadruple weight; and the like in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cases according to the proportions of Roots and Squares above mentioned. The same may also be seen even in any good Turnspit-Jack, where a quadruple weight makes double Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city (at the same distances of Time from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Motion) both in the time of the Weights descent, as also in the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the Fly, and each
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63700:36"/>
intermediate Wheel. Now perhaps the reason of these Phaenomena may be here expected; to which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that the many parallel Instances above and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after mentioned, do, like concurrent witnesses, prove the premisses, at least as to any practical use. And as for giving other reasons (which I take to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining this Subject from the very first Principles of <hi>Atomical Matter,</hi> and <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) I leave it to discourse,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63700:36"/>

                  <hi>The Second Instance</hi> Is in the Strength of Timber, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>LEt there be Square Rods or Pieces made of any Clean Timber, or other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, whose Ends let be supported with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Blocks or <hi>Fulcra:</hi> These Rods in Experience will bear weight hung in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63700:37"/>
the middle of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of their lengths or distance, between the <hi>Fulcra;</hi> that is to say, a Rod A. being of double length to the Rod B. will bear ¬Ω the weight which B can bear; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of triple length, it will bear one third; <hi>&amp; sic de caeteris.</hi> Again, let two of those equal and alike square Rods be placed one upon the other (so as to touch and sit,) then the two together shall bear 4 times
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63700:37"/>
as much as one alone, and three of them, placed as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-said, shall bear nine times as much, and so on in proportion of Roots to Squares. Again, lay the same two Rods side by side, to each other, then they shall bear but double, three shall bear triple, and so forward, in <hi>Arithmetical proportion.</hi> From whence it follows, that four of them placed square, shall bear eight times as much as one alone. But if the same four
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63700:38"/>
Rods taken as One, being of double length making an Octuple quantity to One, they shall bear but four times the weight of One alone. So as two like pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Timber, that are in cubical or triplicate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their Sides, are strong but according to duplicate proportion, or the Squares of their respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Sides; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to have like Vessels (differing in Content as the Cubes of their like
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63700:38"/>
Sides) equally strong, the Timber of which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist must be <hi>Quadrato-qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratic;</hi> that is to say, a Ship of 400 Tuns, equally strong with one of 50, must have not only 8 times as much Timber in it, but 16 times; which is seldom or never done. Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is the true Reason, why great Shipping is both Dearer and Weaker than small Shipping, (no Ship in the world being so strong as a Nutshel;) I say,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63700:39"/>
                  <hi>Weaker,</hi> for what is here said; and <hi>Dearer,</hi> for what shall be said hereafter in the sixteenth Instance of Masts, Diamonds, &amp;c. And on the other hand, if the Timbers were Quadrato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quadratic, then the Ship of 400 Tuns would be loaden with her own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials; if the Ship of 50 Tuns were not over-tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered.</p>
               <p>Now, for not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding these matters, many men designing En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63700:39"/>
of strength, do make Models of such Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by a Scale (suppose wherein an inch represents a foot,) by which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del is the 1/1728 part of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine intended: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they conceive, that if the Model be strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bear 1/1728 part of what the great Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is intended to bear, that then the said great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinament will be strong enough. Whereas indeed the Model must bear the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63700:40"/>
full 1/144 of what is intended for the great Machinament; otherwise great mischiefs will appear in the Work. Wherefore the Square of the Linear Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Model and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, is the measure and way of trying the strength and sufficiency sought for: The ignorance whereof hath made many a poor Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. Upon these Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, a Cask which will hold a Tun, ought to have 16 times as much Timber in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63700:40"/>
it, as the Cask which holds onely a Barrel, or ‚Öõ of a Tun; provided one be as strong as the other (which is not usually seen.) For the bigger Vessels, <hi>Carts,</hi> &amp;c. they are usually the weaker compar'd with the strength of the lesser; which appears also in <hi>Animals,</hi> whose strength is as the Square Roots of their weights and substance, <hi>viz.</hi> if 1728. Mice were equiponderate to one Horse, the said Horse is but 1/144 part as strong as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63700:41"/>
all the said Mice.</p>
               <p>From these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Scantlings of <hi>Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> in Buildings must be adjusted; as for example, Let the Walls of any Room be infinitely, that is, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently strong; let the length and the breadth of the Room be given: Next, suppose the Room is to be made so strong, as that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foot and a half square shall bear a Man, and so, that 31¬Ω square feet should bear a Tun weight, (rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63700:41"/>
14 men to the Tun:) Lastly, let the strength of the Timber be also given. Now the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions are, to find the Scantlings of the Girders, Gise, &amp;c. first in square pieces, and afterwards by altering the Squares into more advantageous ablong Sizes; as for example, Let the Room be supposed 26 foot long and 20 broad, <hi>viz.</hi> 520 foot in the <hi>Area,</hi> and able to receive about 250 men, and to bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63700:42"/>
16 Tuns. Suppose the Timber be such, as whereof a Rod of an inch square, and 20 foot long, will bear 1/20 part of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight; or, that 20 such Rods, or a Board of 20 inches broad, and 20 foot long within the walls, an whole hundred weight; and so the whole Floor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of about 16 such Boards, but 1600. Now if the same Board were planck of 4 inches thick, it would bear 16 times 1600 or 256
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63700:42"/>
hundred weight: If 5 inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, 400 hundred weight: But the whole weight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed being but 325 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, some size between 4 and 5 inches thick will suffice in this case, where we suppose the Floor to be of planck without Gise or Girder. Next, suppose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of this Planck there be used Gise of double thickness to the said Planck, and placed at qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple distance; I say, the Effect and Strength will be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63700:43"/>
the same with half the stuff. And I also say, that one Girder alone of 18 inches square, and 20 foot long, is near Equivalent to the 17 Gises of 9 inches deep, and 4¬Ω broad-abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; which Girder has but half the stuff which the Gise had; as the Gise did contein but half the stuff, which the 4¬Ω inch-Planck first mentioned did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein. Which saving of stuff is the reason of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Plank into Girders,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63700:43"/>
Gise, and Board. Where note, that these Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Scantlings are not offered as exact and best for practice, but onely to intimate the method of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into these matters so useful in the world.</p>

of water, the same 12000 feet, in 1800 seconds <hi>plus</hi> 360 seconds, or in all, 2160 seconds: And that 9 shall row the same Vessel, as the Root of 21 to the Root of 208, which is, as near 3 to 7; or in 3/7 of the time that one Rower alone could have done the same. Again, suppose each Oar lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from two to three, and that as many stroaks are made in the same time as before; then the Velocity shall increase proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:63700:45"/>But suppose, that the Oars remain of the same length, but that the <hi>Blade</hi> be doubled; then the Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city shall increase but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Roots of that doubling, or as 10 to 7, or 7 to 5, &amp;c. supposing still the same number of stroaks, within the same time, in every Case or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>

               <p>THe way of a Bullet, shot out of a good Gun, is as the square Roots of the quantity of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder fired; I say, of <hi>Powder fired,</hi> because what goes out unburnt, goes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Shot than Powder; and the Length of Guns sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies only the constraining
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63700:49"/>
of the Powder within the Lines of Direction, till it be all fired: The use of hard ramming and screw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Guns, being also the same; and the excellency of Powder being to fire quick, and before it goes out of the Gun. I say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Velocities caused by Gun-powder are as the Roots of the Powder fired, that is to say, 4 pound of Powder, all equally fired within the Piece, shall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Bullet twice as far as

I say, that forasmuch as the Weight of the 5 inch Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, to that of 7, is as 125 to 343; the Concave of the greater Gun must be in the same proportion to

               <p>IT is found by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that there are more persons living of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 16 and 26 years old, than of any other Age or Decade of years in the whole life of Man (which <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> say
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63700:57"/>
to be between 70 and 80 years:) The reasons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are not abstruse, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those of 16 have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the danger of Teeth, Convulsions, Worms, Ric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, Measles, and Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox for the most part: And for that those of 26. are scarce come to the Gout, Stone, Dropsie, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, Lethargies, Apople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xies, and other Infirmities of Old Age. Now whether these be sufficient reasons, is not the present Enquiry;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63700:58"/>
but taking the afore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Assertion to be true; I say, that the Roots of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry number of Mens Ages under 16 (whose Root is 4) compared with the said number 4, doth shew the proportion of the likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of such mens reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 70 years of Age. As for example; 'Tis 4 times more likely, that one of 16 years old should live to 70, then a new-born Babe. 'Tis three times more likely, that one of 9 years old
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63700:58"/>
should attain the said age of 70, than the said Infant. Moreover, 'tis twice as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that one of 16 should reach that Age, as that one of 4 years old should do it; and one third more likely, than for one of nine. On the other hand, 'tis 5 to 4, that one of 26 years old will die before one of 16; and 6 to 5, that one of 36 will die before one of 26; and 3 to 2, that the same person of 36 shall die before him of 16: And so forward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63700:59"/>
to the Roots of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other year of the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Age compared with a number between 4 and 5, which is the Root of 21, the most hopeful year for Longaevity, as the mean between 16 and 26; and is the year of perfection, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sense of <hi>Our Law,</hi> and the Age for whose life a <hi>Lease</hi> is most valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To prove all which, I can produce the accompts of every Man, Woman, and Child, within a certain Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish

of above 330 Souls; all which particular Ages being cast up, and added together, and the Sum divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the whole number of Souls, made the Quotient between 15 and 16; which I call (if it be Constant or Uniform) the Age of that Parish, or numerous <hi>Index</hi> or Longaevity there.

cannot speak positively hereof, but know from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Observations, that the Acceleration abovesaid shall not be made in Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical Proportion; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as I know, that in Fire-works great Fires are more profitable than small; as in Brewers Coppers, and Iron-works may be seen; wherein double Fires pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce more than double dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch or advantage.

of the <hi>Spirituosity of Liquors,</hi> or in what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions several Liquors contein more or less of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flameable or ardent parts. Now in this case I conceive, the Consideration of Roots and Squares is also mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial; for I understand by strength or multitude of Spirits, the Space, greater or lesser, into which such Liquors will be rarified, or will fill with Spirits: As for example, if a Pint of Water rarified into Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63700:63"/>
will fill a Globe but of 3 foot Diameter; and a Pint of rectified Spirit of Wine will fill a Globe of six foot diameter, or 8 times as large as that of Water; I shall say, that there is 8 times as much Spirit or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour in one as in the other. But if these Liquors were put into open Lamps or Vessels, there the space in which the Spirits rise, are the Roots, whose Squares do shew the Spirituosity of those Liquors: <hi>Ex. gr.</hi> Let

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63700:64"/>
for 'tis certain, that as the Spirit riseth double upwards, so also it emitteth or rarifieth it self double also sideways; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the quantity of the Spirit or Vapour must be quadruple; and so of other proportions.</p>

               <p>LEt it be observed in the Transparent Pipe of a Forcing Pump, at how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stroaks the Water is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Bottom to the Top; and let as many marks be made at the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places unto which the

Water mounted at every stroak (which stroaks we suppose to be all in Equal Times;) it will appear, that all the said Divisions will be according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions or the Logarithms above-mentioned.

falling upon a Wheel of a large Diameter, produceth wonderful Effects; the which may be well compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Principles we hold forth.</p>
               <p>Waters also have greater forces in the above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned proportions, as the hole or place whereat they issue is lower from their Surface; as may be seen in all Breast<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and Undershot-Mills; where it is pleasant to divide the Sinking of the water into Equal Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63700:66"/>
and to count the Clacks, Revolutions or Stroaks made within the Time of the waters sinking every such equal Space; for therein the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Logarithmes may also be observed.</p>
               <p>Unto this head may be referred the <hi>Leakage of Ships.</hi> For let there be a hole in a Ship somewhere under water; then let it be seen, what water comes in at the said hole, within any space of Time; then let
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63700:66"/>
the like hole be made at double the perpendicular distance from the top of the water, and there shall come in four times as much as at the upper hole; and let a third be at three distances, and that shall admit 9 times as much, &amp;c. Again, let there be two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual holes or Leaks in a Ship, the one at Head, and the other at Stern, and let the Ship be in motion; then the Leakage at the Head is composed of the pressure of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63700:67"/>
the water from the Surface, and of the Ships Motion together. Moreover, if the Ship make double way, the Leakage will be quadruple; if treble way, non cuple, &amp;c. Wherefore to stop Leaks <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> the Ship must stop its motion, lye by, or bear up to go with the Wind and Sea, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Lastly, I shall add, that the Swiftnesses of Waters or River-streams, are the Roots of the Power that causes them; which
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63700:67"/>
causes are Steepness or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent in a sharper Angle from the Perpendicular.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63700:75"/>
quadruple the same weight, it will draw down double the first distance, and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuple will draw it down treble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So as in a drawn Bow, let the Arrow be divided into <hi>quotcunque partes,</hi> each equal part of the Tension carrieth the Arrow to an Equal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, notwithstanding each equal part of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was made by Unequal power, and that each equal Space or Part also of the Arrows first flight requires

            <p>HAving done with the Consideration of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate and subduplicate Proportion in <hi>Elastic</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Materials, I hope it will not be amiss to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn a short Appendix of <hi>Elasticity it self,</hi> whereby to draw forth the better
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63700:77"/>
thoughts of other men for Countenance or Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore I say as followeth; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>First, Supposing <hi>every Body</hi> to have a <hi>Figure</hi> or Positure of its own, out of which it may be disturbed by <hi>External Force;</hi> I say, that <hi>Elasticity</hi> is the power of <hi>recovering</hi> that <hi>Figure,</hi> upon removal of such Force.</item>
               <item>2. I think it easiest to consider <hi>Elastic, Springing,</hi> or <hi>Resilient</hi> Bodies, as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae,</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:63700:77"/>
                  <hi>Laths,</hi> or <hi>Lines;</hi> so as a streight Lath, being by force bent <hi>circularly,</hi> doth upon the removal of that Force, return to be streight again by its <hi>Elasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;</hi> and a <hi>Circular Hoop</hi> being forced streight, leaps back into its own crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by its <hi>Elasticity.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>Elastic</hi> Bodies in their returns do overshoot their own Natural Positure, and vibrate <hi>cis citr√†</hi> the Point they seek, as doth a <hi>Pendulum,</hi> or <hi>Magnetic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Needle,</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:63700:78"/>
till at length they rest; the one in his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,</hi> and the other in his <hi>Meridian.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. An <hi>Elastic</hi> Body is a gross <hi>Tangible</hi> Body, which is made of <hi>Corpuscles,</hi> or the smallest Bodies that can possibly be <hi>seen;</hi> and these Corpuscles are made of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,</hi> or the smallest bodies in Nature (such as whereof a <hi>Million</hi> doth not perhaps make one of the <hi>Corpuscles</hi> last mentioned.)</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:63700:78"/>5. I know no reason, why we may not, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, suppose <hi>Atoms</hi> to be of <hi>several Figures</hi> and <hi>Magnitudes,</hi> provided we suppose them <hi>immutable,</hi> such as <hi>Corpuscles</hi> are not; gross tangible Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very mutable by the various Additions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritions that befal them.</item>
               <item>6. I suppose in every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome <hi>three such points</hi> as we all see and know to be in the <hi>Globe of the Earth,</hi> and in every <hi>Magnet, viz. two</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:63700:79"/>
                  <hi>Poles</hi> in its <hi>Superficies,</hi> and a <hi>Central</hi> point <hi>within its substance,</hi> which I call its <hi>Byas.</hi> The Heavens also visibly have their <hi>Poles,</hi> and must have a <hi>Center of Gravity</hi> or <hi>Magnitude,</hi> or some other <hi>Central</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant Point.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. I suppose every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome may move about his own <hi>Axis,</hi> and about other Atoms also, as the <hi>Moon</hi> does about the <hi>Earth; Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> about the <hi>Sun;</hi> and the <hi>Satellites</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:63700:79"/>
                  <hi>Iovis</hi> about <hi>Iupiter,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>8. I suppose, that the <hi>Byas</hi> of one Atome may have a tendency towards the <hi>Byas</hi> of another near it, and that the Byasses of many Atoms may tend to some common point with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; as we see in <hi>Electrical</hi> Bodies, and in the <hi>Globular drops</hi> of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Quicksilver, and all Mucilaginous Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</item>
               <item>9. I suppose, that all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms have, like a <hi>Magnet,</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:63700:80"/>
                  <hi>two Motions,</hi> one of <hi>Gravity,</hi> whereby it tendeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Center of the Earth, and the other of <hi>Verticity,</hi> by which it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth towards the Earths-Poles, and whereby Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets joyn to each other by their <hi>Opposite Poles.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>10. All Atoms by their Motion of <hi>Verticity</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,</hi> would draw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, like Magnets, into a streight Line, by setting all their Axes in <hi>directum</hi> to each other; did not the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63700:80"/>
Motion of their respective Byasses towards each other, and towards other Points, curb them into a <hi>Triangle,</hi> whereof the <hi>Two Axes</hi> of <hi>Two Atoms</hi> are two sides, and the distance between the Byass of each making the third side: Wherefore I call the <hi>Polar</hi> Motion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rectitude;</hi> and the Motion of the <hi>
                     <unclear>Biasses</unclear>,</hi> the Motion of <hi>Angularity</hi> or Curvity, or the Angular or Curve Motion.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:63700:81"/>11. I suppose, that all these Motions may be of different <hi>Velocities,</hi> and that by <hi>Contra-colluctations</hi> they ballance each other, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time into <hi>seeming</hi> rest: I say, <hi>seeming,</hi> because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there is <hi>no</hi> rest in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</item>
               <item>Lastly, I might suppose (even without a Metaphor) that Atoms are also <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> and the <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Susceptive</hi> Principles of all things; and that the above-named Byasses are
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63700:81"/>
the Points of Coition: For, that <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend further than to <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> is plain enough; the fall of <hi>Acorns</hi> into the ground, being the Coition of Oaks with the Earth. Nor is it absurd to think, that the words in <hi>Genesis, [Male and Female crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he them</hi>] may begin to take effect, even in the smallest parts of the <hi>first Matter.</hi> For although the words were spoken onely of <hi>Man;</hi> yet we see they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63700:82"/>
certainly refer to other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, and to <hi>Vegetables</hi> in manner aforesaid, and consequently not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to all other <hi>Principles of Generation.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
         </div>
         <div type="conclusion">
            <head>Conclusion.</head>
            <p>To Conclude, I hope I may say, that these my <hi>Principles,</hi> are <hi>Principles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;</hi> for there can be no <hi>fewer</hi> nor <hi>easier</hi> than <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi> My <hi>Matter</hi> is so simple, as I take notice
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63700:82"/>
of nothing in each Atome, but of <hi>three such Points</hi> as are in the Heavens, the Earth, in Magnets, and in many other Bodies. Nor do I suppose any <hi>Motions,</hi> but what we see in the greater parts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and in the parts of the Earth and Sea.</p>
            <p>Again, all the Motions I fancy in my Atoms, may be represented in gross <hi>Tangible</hi> Bodies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently may be made <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible</hi> and <hi>examinable.</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:63700:83"/>
Moreover, I hope none of my Suppositions are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with each other, nor do necessarily infer any absurdity or falsehood.</p>
            <p>And lastly, I hope they solve all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of <hi>Elasticity,</hi> and, as I think, of <hi>Hardness, Fixedness, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacity, Fluidity, Heat, Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, Fermentation,</hi> and the rest. All which is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly submitted to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this <hi>Society;</hi> whose <hi>Atoms</hi> or inseparable Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers I wish may happily
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63700:83"/>
Conglomerate, and Unite themselves into the most fixed and most noble Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies amongst the Sons of Men.</p>
