            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To shew this the better, I wil first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare howe greate a punishment of God this wounde of conscience is: Secondly I will teach how this trouble of minde may be preuented and auoyded: Lastly <hi>I</hi> will set downe how Gods children faling in some measure into this affliction of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pirite, may bee recouered out of it.</p>
            <p>For the first, the grieuousnesse of this mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie is seene, eyther by some due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the persons that haue felt it; or by some wise comparison made betweene this griefe of minde, and other outward griefes incident vnto a man.</p>
            <p>The persons in whome we may consider this wounde of spirit, are eyther meerely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men, or such as bee renued by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3573:6"/>
of God: The men meerely naturall are either the Heathen such as neuer knew God in Christ, or carnall professors, such as haue not professed Christianitie aright. If wee looke among the Hearhen, how many of them haue willingly gone vnder pouertie, and haue beene content to vnburden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of all worldly treasures? How haue some of them (whilest their mindes were vnappalled) suffered imprisonment, exile, and extreame tortures of bodie; rather than they would betray their Countries? Howe many of them haue deuoured many iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and borne outwarde troubles, with some ease and with no resistance, whilest their mindes were at libertie? And yet looke not into the meanest, but the best and most excellent men among them, euen their wise Philosophers, sweete Orators, and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Poets; who in bearing and forbearing thought the chiefest pointe of vertue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist; and yee shall see, when once some great distresse of minde did wounde them, some would make an ende of it by preparing a Cup of deadly poyson; some would violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and voluntarily runne on the enemies pikes: some woulde throwe downe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from hie Mountaines; some woulde not sticke to stabbe most monstrously their owne bodies with Daggers, or such
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3573:7"/>
like instruments of death: all which men would seeme to haue great courage in sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning many harmes, so long as their mindes were not ouermastred. But when their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and supreame Essence (which they accknowledged to be God) did by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er crosse &amp; ouerturne their witty deuises and headstrong attempts, so as without hope of remedie they were hampered in pensiuenes and sorrow of minde: then not being able to turne themselues vnder so heauie a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, they shrunke downe, and by violent death would ridde themselues of that disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes &amp; impatience of their troubled minds.</p>
            <p>But let vs come neerer; and whether wee behold the Papists, or the familie of loue, or the common sort of Christians, wee shall see they will passe quietly through many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, whether for that they haue a spirite of slumbering and numbnes cast vppon them; or whether because they haue braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themselues through some sencelesse blockishnes as men hewen out of hard Oaks, or grauen out of marble stones I know not: But yet when the lord shal let loose the corde of their consciences, and shall set before their faces their sinnes committed; see what fearefull endes they haue, whilest some of them by hanging themselues, some by casting themselues into the water, some
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3573:7"/>
by cutting their own throats haue rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues out of these intollerable griefes. Now wherein is the difference that some die so sencelesly, and some dispatch themselues so violently? Surely the one feeling no sinne, depart like brutish swine; the other surchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with sinne, die like barking Dogs.</p>
            <p>But let vs come to the children of God, who haue in some degree felt this wounde of minde; and it will appeare both in the members and in the heade, of all burthens to bee a thing most intollerable to sustaine a wounded conscience. And to beginne with, let vs set in the first ranke <hi>Iob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob.</note> that man of God commended vnto vs by the holy Ghost for a myrrour of patience; who although for his riches hee was the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest man in the land of <hi>Huz</hi>; for his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, might haue made afraid a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and for his substance was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of all the men in the East: Yet when the <hi>Shabeans</hi> came violently and tooke away his cattell; when the fier of God falling from heauen, burnt vp his sheepe and his seruants; when the Caldeans had taken away his Camels; when a greate winde smote downe his house vppon his children; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeede hee rent his garmentes, which was not so much for impatience, as to shewe that he was not senceles in these
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3573:8"/>
euils: Yet it is saide that hee worshipping blessed the name of the Lorde, saying: <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked shall I returne thither: The Lorde gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and the Lorde taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lorde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beholde when at the strange confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his comfortlesse friendes, his minde beganne to be agast, which was not so in all his former tryall, when his conscience began to be troubled, when he sawe the Lord fasten in him sharpe arrowes, and to set him vp as a Butte to shoote at; when hee thought God caused him to possesse the sinnes of his youth, this glorious patterne of patience coulde not beare his griefe: he was heauye, and nowe may commende, the Image of a wounded spirite, to all that come after. <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dauid.</note> a man chosen according to the Lordes owne heart: <hi>Ezekiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezekiah.</note> a pure worshipper of God, and carefull restorer of true Religion; <hi>Ieremiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ieremiah.</note> the Prophet of the Lorde, sanctified and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to that Office before hee was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his mothers wombe, were rare and singular in the graces and fauour of God: yet when they felt this wounde pearcing them with griefe of heart, they were as Sparrowes mourning, as Cranes chattering, as as pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans casting out fearefull cries, they thought themselues as in the graue, they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3573:8"/>
wished to haue dwelt solitary; they were as bottels parched in the smoke, they were as Doues mourning, not able without sighes and grones to vtter their wordes, their hearts cloue to the dust, and their tongues to the roofe of their mouthes.</p>
            <p>But aboue all; (if these were not not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to perswade vs in this doctrine) there remaineth one example, whome we affirme to be the perfect anatomie of an afflicted minde. This is the Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ the Image of the father,<note place="margin">Christ Iesus.</note> the heade of the bodie, the myrrour of all graces, the wisedome, righteousnes, holines, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all the Saints, who sustained the Crosse euen from his youth vpward: and besides pouertie, basenes, hunger, did wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly goe vnder the greate trouble of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and reproch, and that among them where he should haue had a right deserued honour, in respect of the doctrine he taught them, and in regard of the manifolde myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles be wrought among them; as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the sicke, the giuing sight to the blind, the restoring of life to the dead: This vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes neuertheles, did not so much strike into him. But at what time hee was set as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for al, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was to beare our infirmities &amp; carry our sorrowes, at what time hee was plagued &amp; smitten of God, humbled &amp; woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3573:9"/>
for our transgressions, when hee should be broken for our iniquities, and the chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was vpon him; then he cried out; <hi>My soule is heauie euen vnto the death:</hi> Then he prayeth, <hi>Lord if it he possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let this Cup passe from mee:</hi> But howe praieth hee? euen with sweating; how swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth hee? euen droppes of blood; how long praieth hee? Three times; when endes his agonie? not vntill he was dead; What said hee beeing readie to depart? <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was this for his humane death, as some haue imagined? No no, wicked men haue died withthout complaint, whose patience then might seeme to exceede his; it was his suffering in his humane Spirite, which incountred with the wrath of God, his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head suppressing it selfe for a while: he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red indeede many tormentes in bodie, but much more heuily did the wrath of God lie vpon his soule.</p>
            <p>If this consideration of an afflicted spirit in these examples doe not sufficiently shew what a grieuous thing it is to sustaine a wounded conscience: Let vs proceede to the comparing of this with other euils, which fal into the nature of man. There is no sicknes but Phisicke prouideth for it a remedy, there is no fore but Chirurgery wil afford it a salue;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3573:9"/>
Friendship helpeth pouertie; There is noe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, but there is hope of libertie; Suite and fauour recouer a man from banishment; Authoritie and time weare away reproch: But what Phisicke cureth? what Chirurgerie salueth? what riches ransometh? what counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance beareth out? what authoritie asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth? what fauour relieueth a troubled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science? All these banded together in league, (though they would conspire a confederacy) cannot help this one distresse of a troubled minde; And yet this one comfort of a quiet minde doth wonderfully cure, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly asswage al other griefes whatsoeuer. For if our assistance were as an host of armed sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; If our frinds where the Princes and the Gouernours of the earth; If our possessions were as large as betweene the East and the west; If our meate were as Manna from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; If our apparrell were as costly as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod of Aaron; If euery day were as glorious as the day of Christs resurrection; yet if our mindes bee appalled with the iudgements of God, these thinges would little comfort vs. Let experience speake; If a troubled minde impareth not health, drieth not vp the blood, wasteth not the marrowe, pineth not away the flesh, consumeth not the bones, if it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not all pleasures painfull, and shortneth not the life; surely no wisdome can councell
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3573:10"/>
it, no counsell can aduise it, no aduise can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wage it, no asswagement can cure it, no elo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quence can perswade it, no power can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, no Scepter wil affray it, nor inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can charme it. And yet on the contrary, if a man languish in sicknes, so his hart be whole, and is perswaded of the health of his soule, his sicknes doth not grieue him: If a man bee reproched, so he be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecious in the sight of God and his Angels, what losse hath hee? If a man be banished, and yet doubteth not that heauen is his Country, and that hee is a Citizen among the Saints, it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall him: If a man be in trouble, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth peace of conscience, hee will quietly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest his trouble. But if the minde be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, who dareth meete with the wrath of the Lorde of Hoasts? who can put to silence the voice of desperation? who will step out and make agreement with the hells to spare vs; who dare make a couenant with the Diuell, that hee woulde not lay claime vnto vs? If then a good Conscience hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth all euills, and all other benefits in this life, in themselues cannot help a troubled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; we se it true in proofe; which here is in prouerbe; <hi>The spirit of a man will susteine his infirmitie: But a wounded Spirit, Who can beare it</hi>?</p>
            <p>Againe, in all other afflictions we may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3573:10"/>
haue some comfort against sinne; this is euer accompanied with the accusation of sinne. A man may be sicke, reproched, impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, imprisoned, and banished; and yet in all these haue a cleare conscience; his owne heart telling him that there is noe speciall cause of these crosses in him, but that he may suffer them for the triall of his faith, or for righteousnes sake and well doing. But when the spirit is wounded, there is stil a guiltines of sin, and when a mans spirit is troubled, he suspecteth all his waies, he feareth al his sins, he knowes not what sinne to begin with; it breeds such hurly burlyes in him, that when it is day he wisheth for night; when itis night he would haue it day, his meat doth not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish him; his dreames are fearefull to him, his sleepe oftimes forsaketh him; If he speaketh, he is little eased; if he keepeth silence, hee boileth in disquietnes of heart; the light doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort him, the darkenes doth terify him.</p>
            <p>To prosecute our comparisons; where al other euils are the more tolerable, because they be temporal, &amp; pursue vs but to death: this not being cured endeth not in death, but becommeth eternall. For euen the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then men thought that death was the end of all misery: the perswasion whereof made them (beeing in some misery) to make an ende of themselues, and hasten their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3573:11"/>
owne death; as Sathan doth make many now a daies to doe, who are ignorant of the hell, which is a place of farre greater paines than any they can suffer in this worlde whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Howebeit a tormented conscience, if before it was begun, is now continued; or if it was not before, now beginneth and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer endeth world without ende. For though true it is, that sicknes, pouerty, imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t haue ended their term in death; yet a wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded hart which was te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral in this life, is nowe eternall after this life: that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death was in hope recouerable, is after death made vncurable &amp; vnrecouerable. It is good therefore to consider, if euen in this life the torment of conscience be so fearefull; how much more grieuous it is to susteine it in hell, where that is infinite, which here is finit; where that is vnmesurable, which here is mesurable: where is the sea of sorow, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this is but a drop, where is the flame of that fire, wherof this is lesse then a sparke.</p>
            <p>But to shut vp this argument: Some there haue beene who through out all their life time, haue been free from all other troubles, so as either they felt them not at all, or else in very small measure, and by that meanes neuer knewe what outward trouble meant. As for example, some men there haue beene, who for sicknesse neuer knewe there heade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3573:11"/>
for pouertie, neuer knewe what want meant; who for discredite, were neuer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill spoken of; who euer put farre from them the euill daye of the Lorde; who made a league with death as it were, &amp; a couenant with hell; who thought they could crucifie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery crosse, rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come vnderany crosse: yet they could neuer escape a wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, either in this life, or in the life to come. True it is, that Gods Children by faith &amp; repentance do often escape it, but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and such as are borne vnto it, as to their sure inheritance; the more they flie from it, the more it pursueth them. If we haue trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed the Ciuil Lawes, the Iudge by bribes may be corrupted; if a man haue committed some capitall offence, by flying his Country he may escape the Magistrates handes: but our consciences telling vs that we haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against God; what bribe shall we offer? or whether shall wee flie? whether shall wee goe from his spirit? or whether shall we goe from his presence? If we ascend into heauen, is not he there? If wee lie downe in hell is hee not there? If we flie to the vtmost parts of the sea, is he not there also? There needeth no apparitor to summon vs, there needes no Bayly arraunt to fetch vs; there needes noe accuser to giue in against vs: sinne will arrest vs, and lieth at the Doore, our owne Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3573:12"/>
will impannell a Quest against vs; our owne heartes will giue in sufficient Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and our owne iniquitie will plead vs to be guiltie to our owne faces.</p>
            <p>Thus we se both by the experience of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue suffered the wound of the spirit, and by the comparinge of it with other euils, what a waight most grieuous and burden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable it is to haue a tormented consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Now let vs shew how we may preuent; &amp; by what meanes Gods children falling into some degrees of it,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de part of the first diuision.</note> (for if it rage in extremity it is an euill vnrecouerable) may safely and quietly be deliuered from it. And here a iust complaint is to be taken vp, &amp; it is a wonder to be marked (if we may wonder at Gods works) that we se many so carefull &amp; watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to auoide o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her troubles, and so few or none take any paines to escape the trouble of minde which is so grieuous. We se men lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing health and loathing sicknes, in diet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat, in sleepe moderate, in Phisicke expert, skilful to purge, &amp; to auoide such corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, which in time may breed (though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently they do not bring forth) some da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous sicknes: yet to auoid the diseases of the soule, no man abateth his sleep, no man abridgeth his diet, no man prepareth Phisicke for it; no man knoweth when to be ful, and when to

Some ambitiously hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honor, &amp; not easily digesting reproaches, behaue themselues neither sluggishly nor sleepely; but are actiue in euery attempt, by loue &amp; by counsell, by prudence &amp; prowesse, by wit &amp; by practise, by labor &amp; learning by cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning, &amp; diligence to become famous, &amp; to shun a ciuill reproach: yet to bee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the sight of God and his Angelles, to fall before the heauens, and in the presence of the Almightie to bee couered with shame and confusion of Conscience, we make none account, as they, who neyther vse any means to obtaine the one, nor auoide those occasions which may bring the other.</p>
            <p>Others vnwilling to come within the reach and daunger of the Lawe, that they may escape imprisonment of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, or confiscation of goodes; will

be painefull in penall statutes, skilfull in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry branch of the ciuill law, and especially wil labour to keepe themselues from treasons, murthers, fellonies, and such like offences deseruing the punishment of death: yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord God threatneth the seazure both of soule and body, the attaching of our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the confiscating of our consciences, the banishing of vs from heauen, the hanging of vs in hell, the suspending of our saluation, the adiudging of vs to condemnation for the breach of his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements no man sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his eternall Lawe; noe man careth for the Gospell: neither the sentence of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting diuorsement from the Lord, neither the couenant of reconciliation is esteemed of vs.</p>
            <p>And to reach our Complaint one degree father. Behold, the more we seek outward pleasures and to auoide the inward trouble of minde, the more we hast and runne into it; &amp; suddainely plunge our selues in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded spirite ere we be aware. VVho posteth more to become rich who hopeth lesse to be come poore than the marchant man? who aduentureth great treasures, who hazardeth his goods, who putteth in ieoperdie his life; and yet sodenly he either rusheth vpon the rocke of hardnesse of heart, or else is swallowed vp of the gulph of a desparing

            <p>There be some of another sort, who neuer dreaming of a troubled minde, haue had their harts set on nothing but howe they might get some greate fame and renowme; and therefore haue slipt into such vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attempts, and foule flatteries, as they haue not only lost the peace of their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but also fallen most deepely into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull shame, which they sought to shunne.</p>
            <p>Now as the peace of conscience and ioye of minde is such a treasure, as the eye hath not seene, the eare hath not heard, nor the tongue expressed; but passeth all vnderstanding. So the wounded spirit is such as the eye hath not seene it, the eare hath not heard it, nor the tongue vttered, but passeth all vnderstanding. And as they onely knowe

            <p>The remedies preseruatiue; are first the searching of our sinnes, &amp; then the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our faith.</p>
            <p>The serching of our sinnes, is either the due acknowledging of our sinnes, or the true sense and feeling of our sinnes. The acknowledging of our sinnes, is eyther of those that bee past, whether wee haue vnfeinedly repented vs of them: or of those which bee present, whether wee be truelye greeued for them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly of those secret corruptions, which in the course of our life are likely to come, whether wee are reuerently afraide of them and resolue to suppresse them with all our indeuour.</p>
            <p>Concerning sinnes past, we must call to minde the sinnes done of old, in our youth, in our middle age, in our olde age; that we iudging our selues may not be iudged of the Lorde; that accusing of our selues, Sathan haue noe occasion to accuse vs; and throwing downe our selues before the Lord, he may lift vs vp. For many going quietly awaie, and sleeping in carnall securitie (not withstand-the sinnes of their youth) and neglecting to make conscience of their sinnes done long agoe; sodainely haue falne into such horrour o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> minde, that (the violent remembrance of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3573:15"/>
all their sinnes surcharging them) they haue beene ouerwhelmed.</p>
            <p>This Examination dooth then rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, when it is reacheth to the errors of this life, &amp; to the sinnes of our youth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many men (euen from their childhood, by a ciuill righteous life) hauing escaped grose sinnes, wherewith the world could neuer charge them, haue notwithstanding ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the burthen of their secret, sinnes done in their youth. <hi>Dauid (Psal.</hi> 25.7.) prayeth the Lord, not to remember the sinnes of his youth; Iob (23.6. the man of God) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that the Lord writinge bitter things against him made him to possesse the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of his youth. What, shall we thinke that <hi>Dauid</hi> or <hi>Iob</hi> were giuen to notorious wickednes in their youth? No, they knew they were subiect to youthfull wantonnes and vnstaiednes of their affections; which though it did not burst out, yet it made them lesse carefull to glorifie GOD; which loosenes the way to leaudnes; which weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the waie to strange vanities; which wantonnesse, the way to open wickednes, is euen in the best of Gods Children in the daies of their youth: which being afterwards in the time of their regeneration, brought (as it were) to iudgement, and laide before their consciences, doth cause them to repent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:3573:15"/>But here is a thing to be blushed at, which maketh mens eares to tingle when they heare it; that many men (farre noe doubt from this true repentance) can largely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed discourse of the things done in their youth; but in such a brauerie, with such boastings, and pleasing of themselues in the remembrance of them; as besides that they prouoke others to sinne in the like, and set themselues a flatte Backe-byas against Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and this Christian examination; they seeme to renewe the decayed colours of their olde sinnes, with the fresh suite of their second pleasures therein. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las what pleasure haue they in those things, whereof they haue noe profit? what profit haue they those thinges whereof they shoulde bee ashamed? Nether in this streine can wee forget the madnes of them, who may seeme to steppe one degree farther to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes this examination of sinne than did the former; by thinking that the leauing of sinne, and repenting of sinne is all one. Against these both daily experience and the word of God doth sufficiently declame. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3573:16"/>
with any remorce, vntill thirteene yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the sinne was committed; as wee may see in the processe of the Historie. Dauid had left his sinnes of murther and adulterie (as thinking all quiet and well) the space of a whole yeare; after which time (being admonished by the Prophet <hi>Nathan)</hi> he repented of it. And experience hath tried in many that haue had some working of God in them, that though they left their sinnes many yeares agoe, yet because they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not truely for them, they haue rebound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp on them with terrible sights &amp; fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full visions, to humble them, and to bring them to serious examination of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done and left long since. Examples whereof wee neede not fetch from farre, seeing so many preachers as are acquainted with fearefull spirits will giue witnes hereof. The fruite of which amazed mindes for sins alreadie left, is ours, to beware of sinnes which are to come: And that other mens harmes may teach vs blessed wisdome, let vs labour not onely to leaue sinne, which one may doe for profite, for feare, for praise, or for werisomnes; but also to repent of it for conscience sake.</p>
            <p>This Examination of our sinnes past, must bee partly of those that we committed bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our calling, &amp; partly of those which were
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3573:16"/>
done after our calling. Euery man (especially hauing his reason reformed by the worde of God) will graunt an examination of the life, before our true knowledge of God in Christ, to be most needfull: But it may be some wil thinke that wee neede not be so precise in the searching of those sinnes, which were after our knowledge. But seeing of all other sins these bite sorest, and pierce deepest, for that they are agrauated with all the mercies of God going before, and Sinne is then most sinfull, when after we knowe the truth, after wee haue beene deliuered from sinne, after wee haue beene inlightened with the grace of God, wee haue falne into it: I thinke that an examination most specially ought to be had of these sinnes. Wherefore to ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our former examples in a new matter, as we may see the former kinde of examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our sinnes before our calling, in the sons of Iacob; so we haue a patterne of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the practise of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> who at the hearing of his sin was so troubled in his spirit, that he could not rest in the Prophets speach telling him his sin was forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, but still was disquieted, as one vtterly forsaken of God &amp; could find no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of Gods spirit in him. For as it fareth ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with sores, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe in sins we are loth to haue our wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds often grated vpon, we cannot so wel away to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3573:17"/>
haue our sores rifled, seared, and lanced; but fed with healing salues: so we are hardlye brought to haue our consciences grounde, or our sinnes ransacked, sifted, searched, &amp; ripped vp; but would still haue them plaist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with sweete promises, and bathed in the mercies of God: whereas it is farre safer before incarnatiue and healing Medicines, to vse corrosiue and mundifying waters, without which though some sores may seeme to close and skinne vp a pace, yet they proue worse, and being rotten still at the coare; they haue aboue a thin skin, &amp; vnderneath deade flesh. In like manner, wee woulde cloake, we would hide and couer our sinnes, as it weare with a Curtaine; but it is more sounde Chirurgery to pricke and pierce our Consciences with the burning yron of the Lawe, and to cleanse the wounde of the Soule by sharpe threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, least that a skinne pulled ouer the Conscience for a while, wee leaue the rottten corruption, vncured vnderneath; and so we bee constrained to crye out of our sinnes openly. As it is a folly then to disemble our soares whilest they bee curable, and after to make them know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en when they bee growen vncurable; so it is as greate folly to dissemble our sinnes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3573:17"/>
whilest they may be remedied, and so after be constrained with shame to blaze them abroade when thy are remedilesse. But of this by the way, because wee shall more largely touch it in the last part to come.</p>
            <p>It is sufficient to commit sinne before knowledge, but after some good light of the spirit to sinne, breedeth eyther hardnes of heart, or a troubled spirite; both which wee shall auoyde, if in trueth we be carefull to watch ouer our affections, and beware that after our deliuerie we fall not into sinne gaine.</p>
            <p>Seuerall men subiect to seuerall sinnes, haue their seuerall checkes in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences: some are ouercome with wrath, and yet after the moodie fit they can tell that the wrath of man doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the righteousnesse of God; some are subiect to lust, and afterwardes they say, it profiteth them nothing. Some are giuen to a continuall course of vanitie, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing can say, that mans l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe hath another ende, some slip deepely into worldlinesse, and yet they bee often wakened with most terrible checkes of conscience. VVell, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they whose heartes be truely grieued; and let them beware that make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aliance with sinne: for either hardnesse of heart will ouertake them, or a troubled coscience will
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3573:18"/>
confound them. Wherfore it comes to passe, that many spending their bodies on lust, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that euer they so abused their strength; many giuen too much to the pleasure of this life, had griefe come vpon them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how they haue spent Gods graces, lauished his good giftes, and mispent their time; or else, if they haue not this griefe, they fall into voluptuousnes &amp; draw such a thicke skinne vpon their heartes, as will cause the strongest denouncings of Gods iudgements to rebound, bee they driuen on neuer so hard. And sure it is the sinne of this worlde, that men beeing controled in their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whilest they are a praying, and feele a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete charge laid against them, to beware of guile in buying &amp; selling; eyther haue these cheekes lesse and lesse, and so they grow to be prophane; or else afterward they are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully wounded, that they haue beene so worldly, so greadely pursuing earthly things; so coldly procuring heauenly things. Thus euen our priuy thoughtes (not profited by) are breeders of farther trouble.</p>
            <p>Now the remedie against this trouble is, willingly and wittingly not to cherish sin,<note place="margin">Remedie.</note> to wish that the minister should touch our most priuie and secret sinnes, to be glad priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be admonished, to profite by our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies when they doe reproach vs: and rather
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3573:18"/>
to desire (in such a case) to be humbled than to suffer our selues to be flattered. This trying of our selues must yet strech it selfe farther, not only to the committing of euill, but also to the omitting of good. As when (after some good working and feeling of the spirite,) we begin to fight and conflict with our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences saing; though I must pray, I must haue time also to prouide for my familie; if I goe so to heare the worde of God, surely I shall bee in danger to loose this profite; if I thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon the exercises of religion, I shall be cut short in the vse of my pleasures. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it shall be good to search our heartes, not onely in the carelesse not vsing of the meanes; but also in the negligent watching ouer the fruites of the meanes: saying to our selues in this manner; I haue heard a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but (alas) without anie feeling or working vpon my affections; I haue beene praying, but with no power of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite; I haue receiued the Sacrament, but without those ioyes glorious and vnspeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which I was woont to taste of. I saw the Discipline of the Church executed, but without anie feare of sinne at all in my selfe, or compassion to the member censured.</p>
            <p>And heere I dare from my owne ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation assuredlye affirme, that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3573:19"/>
sinnes haue not beene at some times so grieuous to Gods children; as that they haue sometimes vsed the meanes with little reuerence and with lesse fruite. And no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, we shall see many men at some times, not so much grieued for their sicknesse it selfe, as for that that they haue either willingly negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the meanes which might haue preserued their health, or that they haue abused the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke that might haue restored their health to them againe: in like manner (I say) it fareth with them, who eyther vnreuerentlie haue refused the meanes, which shoulde keepe their soules from surfetting: or else vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully haue abused those helpes, which might haue recouered them againe. From hence it commeth, that some men are as much grieued for not vsing their good giftes to the benefit of Gods Church, as others are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for pestering the Church with vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table corruptions; or as we shall see a rich man sometimes as much humbled for not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing money to the poore, which hee might haue done; as for heaping vp riches falselie, which hee ought not to haue done. And thus, many (hauing receiued good giftes and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Lord) are seasoned and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by afflictions; whereby they are taught to put their giftes in vre, and to offer their seruice to Christ: and others are forced to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3573:19"/>
hide their giftes, which cannot bee without some decay of Gods glory, without offence to the weake, without the losse of many soules, which otherwise might be wonne to the gospell, and without strengthening the hande of the aduersarie to slaunder our darke and dumbe profession. All which thinges will in the ende bring terrour of minde: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if the Lord cannot worke vpon vs by taking away goods, friendes, credit, wife, children, or such like, to bring vs to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; he will surely whippe our naked consciences, he will enter euen into our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry entrailes, and pierce our secret boweles.</p>
            <p>As wee must examine our selues thus for sinnes of time past, and present, so must we vse this practise in sinne to come: and this is very needefull. For were it so, that our life and conuersation were such, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before not after our calling, man could iustly accuse it: Yet the hidden corruption of our nature, may threaten some haynous downefall in time to come. Which hath made men of very good report and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation to hang downe their heades, and feare their secret hypocrisie, as that which may breake foorth to the shame of all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer life, in time to come.</p>
            <p>But because we forgatte to speake of them, that in the examining of their liues past, are
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3573:20"/>
much grieued for the want of sinceritie, and for priuie vaineglorie in themselues; let vs before we go to the searching of our heartes in sinne to come, speake somewhat of this. Men troubled for this priuie pride are eyther touched, or not touched. If the veyle of sinne was so great in them, that it hid Christ from them; it is the good will of God, that by this sight of their most secret sinnes they should come to see the righteousnes that is in Christ Iesus; and so they shall the better be kept from being Iusticiarie Pharises. For when being a long time well brought vp, and leading a ciuill life, the Diuell woulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade vs of some inherent righteousnes in vs; It is the wisedome of our God to touch vs with the conscience of most hidden cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, as also to certifie and make know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vnto vs, that euen for our birth there was a secret seede of sinne in vs, which (without the Lord watching ouer vs) woulde surely haue broken forth to his dishonour.</p>
            <p>As for them which haue had some woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in them, and yet are often plunged with sore distresses this trouble commeth to them for two especiall causes, eyther for some hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, that they did more in showe than in truth; wherfore the Lord bringeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> back againe to see their corrupt proceedinges, and that they may knowe all their religion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3573:20"/>
to be but hypocrisie, &amp; all their righteousnes to bee but vnrighteousnes: or for the abusing of their knowledge, in that they made it but a maske to iuggle in, &amp; that they made their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to fight with their own iudgements. We must remedy this, by not thinking of our selues aboue that which is meete, and by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to embrace the truth in trueth. And heere let vs note, that many of Gods Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accuse themselues of hypocrisie, when indeed they offend not in it for the most righteous persons are their own greatest accusers. And yet the accusation doth iustlye arise from some fault on their partes: for though they haue done things in trueth, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause with trueth they labored not to see their secret corruptions, in some other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they sustain this trouble of mind. So that there is nothing harder tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to sist &amp; serch our harts to the bottom, whether we respect our sins past or our sins present, whether we looke to our priuy pride, hidden wants, or secret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. And to returne from whence we di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gressed, to the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our harts, in sins to come:<note place="margin">Returne to sins to comes.</note> let vs obserue that in Gods children there is such a iealousy, as they tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble at the very first motions &amp; quake at the least occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinne, although because vice wil sit in resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence very neere vnto vertue, there may be in them sometime too much scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulousnes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3573:21"/>
This feare causeth the dearest of the Saintes of God to reason on this sorte; O Lord, I see now manye excellent in gifts, and constant in profession for a longe time, whose end hath not answered their beginnings, whose deathes were not like to their liues. This is true, whether wee looke into the word or into the world: and it is a thing that may much humble vs. For though we may remember what we haue beene, and knowe what we are; yet who can tell what may come vnto him heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Oh that the serious meditation heereof would dwell long vpon our consciences: that with an holy iealozie wee might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the sinne that is to come. But alas, there bee some venture some knights, which thinke it no masterie to offer themselues to masking, minstrelsie and dauncing, nor to runne into quarrells, braules and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as though they had their eares, their eyes, their hands and their feete in their own power, and at commaundement to vse and gouerne as themselues list.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, GODS Children better fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with his grace, than those bold buxzards are afraide of these occasions: as knowing full well, that their eyes maye soone bee prouoked to lust, their eares may quickly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten

vnto vnchast delightes, their handes may sodainly strike a deadly blow, and their feete may easily be snared in carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>

            <p>In the time of a plague we shall see some will be so bold, that without any lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or godly warrant, they will rush into places infected; and then falling sicke, their conscience prickes them for their tempting of God by an vnaduised boldnes, in the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their death.</p>
            <p>Others plunged as deepely in a quite contrarie extremitie, are too fearfull when they doe but heare of the sickenesse; and

Thus it is with vs in Christianitie, in that as well the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing our selues with too much feare to be ouercome, as the carnall securitie, in not fearing to bee ouercome, may bring sinne vppon vs. God his children must la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a measure, and that must be sought for in the word, which will teach them how they shall neyther decline on the right hand, nor on the left; but will guide them in the narrowe way, showing in euerie thinge what is the vertue, what is the vice; what is the meane, what is the extreame.</p>
            <p>Among many Examples, let vs consider of zeale,<note place="margin">Zeale.</note> a most precious vertue in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, so long as it is free from the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Otherwise if we be colde in zeale, it is a sinne on the left hande: if wee bee zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous without knowledge, it is preposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and becommeth a sinne on the right hand.</p>

            <p>But further to inforce our Exhortation, to auoyde too scrupulous a feare, which hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the true examination of our heartes: let vs think that it happeneth in the spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict as in ciuill wars. Wee reade that manie Cities lying in great securitie, haue sodainely both beene assaulted and ouerthrowen; as also, how some Countries (too much negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e in the meanes) through an excessiue fearefullnes, haue incouraged their enemies with more greedie violence to pray vppon them. With which kinde of stratagems our aduersary the diuell beeing well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; doth often practise this pollicie. If hee see vs without all feare too quietly to rest in our selues, hee thinketh his assault must needes be the stronger, because our resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is the weaker. Againe, if he discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in vs a cowardly feare and fainting of heart, before wee once beginne to ioyne bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile with him; hee will set vpon our immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate feare, &amp; as villainously as sodenly stab vs to the heart, &amp; make a present spoyle of vs.</p>
            <p>Common practise doth farther teach vs, that when we can heare the word without all trembling at God his iudgements, when wee can pray without all feare before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of God, when wee can come to the Discipline of the Church without
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3573:24"/>
all reuerence of the ordinance of the Lord; all is in vaine. Againe, let vs heare with too much trembling, and wee shall learne nothing; let vs pray with too seruile a feare, and our worshipping of God will be without all comfort and vnchearfull. Thus if we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lessen sinne, that is sinne indeede; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make sinne of that which is not sinne in trueth, it is good to proceede to this three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde examination and to lay the edge of this doctrine more neere our affections, because many will be found in this ripenes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and barrennes of conscience, to speake, dispute and declame of al these thinges verie skilfully, which flickring in the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the braine, and not sitting at the ground of the heart, doe seale vp a more iust sentence of condemnation against them. To helpe this euill with, we must meditate deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier of the Law and of the Gospell, together with the appurtenances of them both, that finding our selues farre from Gods blessings promised to the keepers of the law, and seeing our selues nere to the curses due to the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Law, we may raise vp some sense of sinne in our selues. Yet herein we must not stay our foote, but giue a farther stride: for whereas many by a diligent view of the law, haue come to the sense of sinne in themselues, and saw plainly their owne condemnation:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3573:24"/>
yet because they labored not to se their guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse acquited by the remission of sinne in Christ, they plunged themselues into a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse sea of sorrowes. Others hauing pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed these degrees, &amp; hitherto made these steps to auoyd the wounde of Conscience; haue come also too short, and missed of the marke: when because besides the sence of sinnes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the death of Christ, they felt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the vertue of his passion crucifying sinne in them, but saw that with the remission of sinne was not ioined the mortification of sin; they feared that there was no forgiunesse for them, but still languishing with sorrow, they thought themselues to stand charged with their former guiltines. Yea and which is more for that such men haue not truely beene instructed, nor surely haue beene grounded in the doctrine of Christes death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; that is for that they sawe not as well power flowing from his death to slay sinne in them, as vertue to pardon sinne in them; for that they felt not as well strength to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, streaming from the rising againe of Christ, as they were perswaded of iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and righteousnes therein: They haue lyne still bleeding at the heart, in such sort, as the wound of griefe coulde hardly or neuer bee staide and staunched. Wherefore let vs strengthen our weake soules with this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3573:25"/>
sixe-fold coarde of consolation, against these bitter assaultes. Let vs first labour to know sinne, then to sorrow for sinne, after to feele <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> our sinnes in Christ forgiuen, further to looke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for power to crucifie the same, then to lay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> holde on iustification by his resurrection; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and lastly, hope for strength to proceede <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> from thence, to further vs in sanctification and holinesse of life, euen vnto the ende. And thus much briefly for the second thing which we matched in company with the examination of sinne, euen the triall of faith: both which rightly vsed, shall in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure sauegard vs from the trouble of an afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted minde.</p>
            <p>Now let vs hasten to the third parte of our deuision;<note place="margin">The third part of the first deuision.</note> to shew howe Gods children beeing fallen into this wounde of spirite may be helped out of it: which (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) wee will also performe, after we haue answered a necessarie obiection; which (in the former part) might seeme to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against vs. There is no man but will grant, that <hi>Dauid, Iob,</hi> and others of the Saintes of God, had a sight of their sins, a sorrow for their sinnes, and a taste of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of their sinnes: how then commeth it to passe, that these men were so troubled in minde? To this I answere, that their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble so befell them, either for failing in some
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3573:25"/>
of these former things; or els they were rather afflicted for triall of their faith, than for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of sinne in them. And therefore be it alwaies prouided, that wee thinke not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery conflict of Conscience, continuallye and chiefely to bee for the pursuing of our sinnes: but sometimes and principally, that it commeth for the triall of our faith: and yet secondarily, or lesse principally, for the scourging of sinne, as we may see in <hi>Iob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereuppon let all men be admonished, when they see good men thus humbled &amp; throwne downe in minde, to lay their handes on their mouthes from saying; Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these men are but hypocrites, doubtlesse these men be great sinners, the Lord hath founde out their hypocrisie. For good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there is, that such silence should be vsed: for that the Lorde may as well make trial of their faith, as take punishment on their sins. For if such affliction should alwaies and chiefely be sent for sinne, then it should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that all others as they exceeded them in sinne, should also exceede them in the punishment of sinne.</p>
            <p>But now comming to the saluing of this soare,<note place="margin">Salue of this sore.</note> I shall seeme very strange in my cure: and so much the more bee wondered at, by how much in manner of proceeding I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the most sort of men herein. I am

to vs and vncertaine.</p>
            <p>To them which are troubled with such blinde griefes, whereof they can see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as often it happeneth to Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in secret prouidence, vvho either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew God, or else had but a generall knowledge of him: I answere, that as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not Phisicke to be ministered, if it in part proceede from a naturall cause; so I require the word especially to shewe the principall and originall cause to beginne in the soule. And this I doe the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I would haue wisdome both in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the state of the bodie if neede so require; and in looking chiefely to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oule, which so fewe thinke of. If a man troubled in Conscience come to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, it may be he will looke all to the soule and nothing to the bodie; if hee come to a Phisition, hee onely considereth of the bodie, and neglecteth the soule. For my part, I would neuer haue the Phisitions counsell seuered, nor the Ministers laboure neglected; because the soule and bodie dwelling together, it is conuenient, that as the soule should be cured by the word, by prayer, by fasting, by threatening, or by comforting; so the bodie also shoulde bee brought into some temperature, by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, by purging, by dyet, by restoring,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3573:26"/>
by musicke, and by such like meanes; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding alwaies that it bee done so in the feare of God, and wisdome of his spirite, as we thinke not by these ordinarie meanes to smoother or smoke out our troubles; but as purposing to vse them as preparatiues, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both our soules and bodies may be made more capable of the spirituall meanes to follow after.</p>
            <p>As we require these thinges to bee the matter of our Ministerie in such a perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; so we woulde wishe the persons mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string to be men learned and of sounde iudgement, wise, and of Godly experience, meeke and of most louing spirites. For when the troubled patient shall be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of our knowledge and discretion, &amp; there with all shall perceiue vs to come in tender and louing affection, I thinke an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance is made, and all preiudice is taken avvay, so as wee may the more freely worke vppon the Conscience; first bringing them to the sight of sinne, as to some cause of their trouble. Heerein wee must labour to put awaye all confusion and blindenesse of sorrrowe, endeuoring by wisdome to bring the parties wounded to some certaine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect &amp; matter of their trouble; and so draw out of them the confession of some seuerall especiall, and secret, sinne; I say seuerall &amp;
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3573:27"/>
secret sinne, because I know, how many (through a palpable blindnes or disordered discerning of sinne) talke nothing so much as of sinne; and yet they eyther can not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry seuerall sinnes, or they will not be brought to acknowledge their secrete sinnes: wherof the one proceedeth of the ignorance of the Lawe of God, and the other of selfe loue, which maketh vs loath euen in our trauell of minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to shame our selues.</p>
            <p>Now that the confession of particular sins is requisite, it may appeare by the two and thirtieth Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 32.</note> wherein (beeing a Psalme of instruction, concerning the forgiuenesse of sinnes) the Prophet (by his owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience) teacheth vs, that hee could finde no reliefe of his sicknes, vntill hee had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and made confession of his sinnes.</p>
            <p>What? shall we thinke that the Prophet of God (taught so wonderfully by the worde and by the spirite) did not see his sinnes before? Be it farre from vs. Rather let vs know that he had not seuerally and perticularly ripped vp his sinnes before the Lorde, in a seuerall confession of them. Which though the Lorde knoweth farre better than wee our selues: yet such kinde of sacrifice is most acceptable vnto him.</p>
            <p>Now if in this trouble the person hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled can not come to the perticular sight
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3573:27"/>
of sinne in themselues; it is good to vse the helpe of others vnto whome they may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their heartes to bee gaged and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their liues to bee examined more deepely, by hearing the seuerall Articles of the lawe laide open before them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may trye the whole course of their actions. For (as we saide before) the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hypocrites will generally complaine of sinne; and yet deale with them in perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pointes of the perticular precepts, and prooue them in the applying of thinges to bee doone or not doone to their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; and wee shall see many of these poore soules tossed too and fro, now flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ioyes, now plunged in sorrowes, not able to distinguish one sin from another.</p>
            <p>Now when wee shall see the wound of the spirit to arise of any certaine and known sinne, it is either for some sin alreadie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wherein we lie; or els for some sin as yet not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, but whereunto we are tempted. For the former: It pleaseth God oftentimes to bring old sins to minde, when we had not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly repented of them before; that so (as it were) represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs afresh, we might fal into a more misliking of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is not all, to mislike our selues for some perticulars, although it bee good to bee occupied about some especiall
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3573:28"/>
sins: for as it is not sufficient for the auoiding of hypocrisie, to see sinne generally: so it is not enough to escheue the deceiueablenesse of the heart, euer to be poring busilie in one particuler, and to be forgetfull of our great and generall sinnes. But let vs learne by the particulers to passe to the generalls. When any such one sinne then doth pursue thee, rest not onely therein, but say thus rather to thy selfe; Oh Lord, is this one sinne so grieuous? and doth my God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish this one sinne so sorelie? Howe greate then should be my punishment, if thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest (O Lord) so deale with mee for all my other sinnes.</p>
            <p>Let vs labour to haue a sense both of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and of particular sinnes, least in time our griefe passe away without fruite; whilest that not being displeased as well with one sinne, as with another; we either looke to superficially to generall, and not to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; or else too superstitiously obserue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulers and not the generals.</p>
            <p>Concerning those sinnes whereunto we are tempted; as when a man is mooued to thinke blasphemously of God the father, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to doubt wether there bee a Christ or no, or to imagine grosely of the holy Ghost, or to deny GOD, or to doubt of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; or to be mooued to murther, aduouterie,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3573:28"/>
or such like: in which temptations hee fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Gods spirit to cheke him for them, so as he knoweth not in this case what to doe, for that on the one side he dares not listen willingly to these fearefull and monstrous temptations; and on the other side, he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth least in time by long, sute he might fall into them, or at the least for that hee seeth not how to be deliuered from them: I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these motions are not so much to bee disputed with, as we by them are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to more instant and extraordinary zeale of praier.</p>
            <p>Surely these are daungerous temptations, and therefore are not to be kept close; which our nature will easily encline vnto: but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly are to bee confessed of vs. For the Diuell will come sometime to thee, to keepe thee still in a generall acknowledgeing of sin, and vrge thee on this manner; Surely thou must needes doe this sinne, thou seest thou canst haue no ease, vntill thou hast consented, thou art ordained to it: the reason why thou art thus incessantly tempted, is because thou doest not thus take thy pleasure. Goe too, denie God, beleeue not his word: it is but a pollicie to keepe men in awe; Religion is no such matter as men make it. Thus for feare of yeelding on the one hand, and for shame of disclosing the tentations on the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3573:29"/>
other hande; many men haue pined away, &amp; almost haue beene ouercome by them. If we should disclose this (say these men) what would people say of vs? They would count vs Atheists, they would thinke vs the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst men in the worlde. Well for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and consolation herein; Let vs learne that these kindes of tentations, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrections for some sinnes past, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for some sin present, or forwarners of some sin to come. We shal see many tempted to adultery, who (no doubt) cannot bee brought to commit it; &amp; yet because in their youth they haue committed it, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of it, it comes to them againe. The like may bee obserued in theft, in glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, and in other tentations, which are not so much sent vnto vs, presently to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vs, as to put vs in minde, that some time heretofore we hauing bene ouer come with them, should now repent for them. So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e time a man shall lie in some sinne, whereof when he will not bee admonished, neither by the publicke nor priuate meanes, and then some other strange tentation shall fall vpon him, differing from that wherein hee presently lieth, to admonish him of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinne. As when a worldling shal be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to adultery, a thing which he hath noe desire to doe; yet it is to make him looke to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3573:29"/>
his worldlines, whereof he hath so strong &amp; through a lyking: Whereat if then he will not bee awaked, he may sodainely fall into that too, and so by the punishment of GOD, in punishing one sinne with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both his sinnes shall bee to his greate shame laide open, and one sinne shall make knowne another. Sometime also it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that one shall bee tempted with such a sinne, as neither heretofore, nor presently he hath giuen any liking or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement vnto; and yet the Lord by it may forewarne him how he may fall into it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as also to shew that hee hath stoode al his former life, rather by the grace of God than by the strength of flesh and bloode. Wherefore when thou art moued to doubt of God, of Christ, of the word, or of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do not so much stand wondring at these strange tentations, as thinke with thy selfe that it is the mercy of God by them, to cause thee better to discerne of those tentations in others: when thou shalt haue obserued with feare and trembling how they make their first entrie into a mans heart, how they gather strength, how they agree with our corrupt nature, in what degrees they come to some growth, how the spirit of God doth resist them, what bee the meanes best to preuaile against them. And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3573:30"/>
thus if thou make thy profite by them, thou shalt so wonderfully search and descrie by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall veines, the body, age and sleight to of these tentations in others, by an holy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience which God hath taught thee in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that besides that thou shalt lay forth mens secrete corruptions, as if thou wast in their bosomes; thou shalt be able also by the seede of sorrowe in thy selfe, to begette an vnspeakeable ioy in others, who in time may bee tempted as thou now art.</p>
            <p>Thinke moreouer and besides, that such is the efficacie of sinne, that they who are now noe Papistes, Heretiques, Adulterers, or Theeues, may for their secure contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and foolish passing ouer of these tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions sent vnto them, sodainely, shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fall into them; because they woulde not seeke to make some vse of them, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse before the Lord both their pronenesse &amp; worthinesse to fall into them. But if wee will humble our selues in such tentations, and learne by them meekely to discerne the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of our hearts, we shall not onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently deliuer our selues from perill, but bee also further enabled to assist others her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To whome I answeere, that I desire Preachers to bee Builders, and not But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; and it is one thinge generally to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and another perticularly to lay the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine vnto the wound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is good to begin with searching first, and to purge the sore by the vineger of the Lawe, and after to supple it with the oyle of the Gospel. Both which must bee done in wisedome, vsing them to some in greater, to some in lesser measure. For as some hauing nothing but a decay of nature, and no mortall humor, neede rather restoratiue, than purging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines: So some rather troubled for some spirituall wants, than for grosser sinnes, neede not so much the sharpe threatnings of the Lawe, as the sweete promises of the Gospell. But if the bodie, through some extraordinarie repletion hath gotten some greate surfet, not so much to the weakening of nature, as to the threatning of imminent death, and therefore requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rather some stronge purgation, than comfortable and cordiall medicines: then the soule brought almost to deathes doore with some extraordinary sinne, is rather to be boared and pierced with the denouncing of Gods iudgements than otherwise.

we would deale more plainely &amp; lesse confusedly, it is good in our accesse to affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted consciences, to lay these two grounds. First, we must perswade the persons hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that their sins are pardonable and their sores curable: And after, that this visitation is not so much a signe of Gods wrath and anger, as a seale of his mercie and fauoure, in that it is not either blind or barren, but plentifull in good effects, and fruitefull in Godly issues. The former how needfull it is, the experience of so many almost as haue bin throwne downe, is a sufficient witnes; who haue had this as a tagge tyed to their tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that neuer any were so plagued as they, none euer had the like temptations. The Lord will surelie make an end of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in some strange and vnknowne tentation.

            <p>Wherefore as these men seeme to be halfe healed, when any man of knowledge can be brought, who by experience hath cured the like maladie in like degrees in others: So, then the sorrowfull soules are not a little by hope refreshed and strengthned to loke for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3573:31"/>
some ease, when they see none other tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to haue ouertaken them, than such as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fallen into the nature of man, haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mercie at the handes of God, that he might bee feared. This ground worke framed; it is good to build vp and repaire the decayed ioy of the minde, partly by the Law, to make a preparatiue for these ioyes; if the minde not truely humbled, is not fit truely to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: and partly by the gospell, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science kindly throwne downe, is become a fit subiect to aply the sweet promises of God in Iesus Christ vnto it. And here again, to ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were them that denie the law wholly, or at all to bee vsed, when we would breed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in one: I demand whether if it be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to maintaine the righteousnes of Christ, it be not also as necessary to preserue the righteousnes of the Law? Seing the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the Law, of vs not fulfilled, wil draw vs vnto the righteousnes of Christ to vs impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And sith the righteousnes of Christ to vs imputed, is neuer throughly &amp; truly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, vntill we se the righteousnes of the law of vs to be vnperformed. Again if our Sauiour Christ did foreshew his Disciples, that the first work of the holy Ghost at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, should be to conuict the world of sinne, to make men knowe, that without Iesus Christ their is nothing but sinne, and then, that he should
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3573:32"/>
rebuke the world of righteousnesse, that they might see how Christ dyed not for his owne sinne, but for the sinnes of others: I see not why it should not be verie conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, first to lay open the righteousnes of the lawe, that men may see their sinnes; and then the righteousnes of Christ; that men may see their sins discharged in him. Besids, where the Lord saith by his Prophet. <hi>At what time soeuer a sinner doth repent of his sins from the bottome of his heart, I will put all his wickednes out of my remembrance</hi>: it may wel be gathered that there must be a sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sorrow for sin goe before; and then true ioy of sinnes pardoned, may the more frely by vertue of his promise be both hoped for, &amp; loked for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Moreouer, seeing all the promises of God in the gospel are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title and tenor of restoring sight to the blinde, hearing to the deafe, strength to the Lame, health to the Sicke, and life to the Deade; it is manifest, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye that there is noe disease of the soule which Christ cannot heale: but also that wee must first finde our selues blinde, deafe, dumbe, lame, sicke and deade, before hee will meddle with vs; because they that are whole neede not the Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hee came to call sinners, not the Righteous to repentance. Now, to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3573:32"/>
doe this in wisedome, by neither pressing the conscience too seuerely, nor releasing the conscience more vnaduisedly, it shalbe a safe way, to vse the well tempered speech of the Apostle to the sorcerer; Repent, that if it be possible, thy sinne may be forgiuen thee. Where hee doth not wholly discourage him, because it may bee his sinne may be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; neither yet too boldly incourage him, in that without repentance, he sheweth it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impossible to be pardoned.</p>
            <p>And that we be not too preposterous in our consolations, let vs bee warned by the blasphemous speech of that detestable <hi>Arian,</hi> who of late yeares was put to death at <hi>Norwich.</hi> This hellish heretique, a little before he should be executed,<note place="margin">An Arian executed at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</note> afforded a fewe whorish teares asking whether hee might bee saued in Christ or no? When one tolde him, that if he truely repented, he should surely not perish: he brake out most mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously into this speech: Nay, is your Christ so easily to be intreated indeede, as you say? Then I defie him, and care not for him. Oh how good a thing had it beene not to haue cast this precious stone to this swine? Oh how safe had it beene to haue dealt more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie, and to haue dwelt more vehementlie on the conscience of this caytife?</p>
            <p>Now to attaine some discretion in curing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3573:33"/>
this wounded spirite, wee must learne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to iudge, both of the person afflicted, and of the nature of his affliction. First, we may note whether it be a man or a woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we may vrge more fearfully the vse of the law to a man, as beeing the stronger ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell. And as Sathan knewe the woman to be most easie and frameable to be wrought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at his first temptation: so is hee not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that shee is the weaker partye to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine any temptation nowe. Then let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether they that are thus humbled haue knowledge or no? Because, if they haue no knowledge they thinke trouble of minde to be so strange a thing, as neuer anie before had it: if they haue knowledge, then Sathan is readie to accuse them of the sinne against the holy Ghost, as though euery sinne done against knowledge, were a sinne of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption. Further, we are to enquire, howe strong or weake they are, that if they be sorely stricken we cease to humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any further, if they be not sufficiently wounded then to touch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with some deeper sense of sin. Also we must be circumspect, to finde out whether by nature they are more fearful &amp; melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or no: As also, whether they be vsuall sinners, or haue falne once of infirmity; that so vpon their disposition &amp; inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may builde our speeches the better. To these it is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3573:33"/>
good to adde the consideration of the persons age, estate &amp; ability: as if the party be troubled for worldlines, whether he be not a great hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder: if he complaine of vncleannes, whether he be not a yoong man &amp; vnmaried: if he be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled with couetousnes, whether he be not old: because diuers countries, callings, ages, conditions &amp; estates of men, haue their diuers &amp; peculiar sinnes, which we must rightly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. Howbeit of what sex soeuer they are men or women, of what complexion soeuer the are, of what knowledge to discerne sin, of what degree of commiting sinne; of what age, authority, wealth, estate, or condition so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they are, it is good to marke that there be many, who are more troubled for the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and disquietnes of their minde beeing distempered, then for the vilenes and horrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their sinne committed; who are woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more with the feare of shame, with the feare of beeing mad, or with the feare of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of their wittes, than with the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of sinne. Which thing if we find in them, it is our part to trauell with them, that they make a lesse matter of the outward shame, &amp; more conscience of the inward sinne. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must we here forget to make a distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> between our speeches vsed to the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled in the very time of their extream agony &amp; burning a gue of their trobles, &amp; those speches which we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3573:34"/>
vse to them the fit beeing past; because the one and former requireth more consolation and lesse exhortation, the other and latter would haue vs more aboundant in admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and more sparing in comforting, when we may wisely admonish them to beware of sinne, which so procured their owne woe. In this breathing time, it is also expedient to exhort them, that for some season vntill they shall finde greater power of regeneration, they would tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to some holy orders, and godly vowes, whereby they may either be furthered in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying some speciall sinne; which for that they coulde finde no power against it, did most grieue them, or strengthened in some special grace, the want wherof did also wound them.</p>
            <p>But before we launch deeper into this sea of particular tentations, and beginne to founde the dangerous passages of naturall corruption, and originall sinne, the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some froath whereof, doth almost ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme many poore pilgrims it; shall be good to giue this caution, that both in these and in the former troubles, men woulde be still againe admonished, patiently to beare with a wounded spirit, albeit it fall out so, that they be somewhat pettish, seeing the holy Ghost speaketh so fauourably of them, saying:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3573:34"/>
               <hi>A wounded Spirit who can beare?</hi> And surely our practise in other thinges, by the lawe of equitie, may vrge this at our handes. For if men by the light of reason can see it to bee a duetie conuenient, not furiously to controle, but meekely to suffer, and wisely to put vp the vnaduised speeches of a man distemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in braine, by reason of some burning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, or such like violent and vehement sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: we may easily gather euen by the same rule of reason, not so seuerely to censure the impatient speeches of him, who by reason of some parching Feuer of the spirit, is disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all partes of his minde, and hath all the veynes of his heart (as it were in a spirituall agony) vexed. Wherfore both vnsauory for want of godly wisedome, and vncharitable for want of Christian loue, are their murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring obtrectations which say, what? Is this the godly man? Is this hee that is so troubled for his sinnes? Why! see how pettish he is, nothing can please him: no bodie can satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him. Consider, O man, if thou canst beare with a fraile body, that thou must much more beare with a fraile minde. Consider O man that this his pettishnes doth more wound him to the heart, than any iniury thou couldest presse him with. And therefore seeing he afflicteth his owne soule for it, thou needest not adde any thing to his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3573:35"/>
and to exasperate his grieuous smart. Consider that it is a blessed thing mercifully to bethinke vs of the estate of the needy, and that to rub a fresh wound, &amp; to streine a blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding sore, is nothing else, but with <hi>Iobs</hi> friends to bring a new torment, wher there is no need of it. If the wise father doth rather pittie than rebuke his childe, when by reason of sicknes the appetite is not easily pleased: euen so, if we purpose to doe any good with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted minde, we must not be austere in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending euery infirmity, but pitifull in considering of it tender frailtie. Neither do I speake this to nourish pettishnesse in any, but would haue them to labour for patience, and to seeke for peace, which though they finde not at the first, yet by prayer they must waite on the Lord, and say; <hi>Lorde, because there is mercie that thou maist be feared: I will waite vpon thee, as the eye of the seruant waiteth vpon the hand of his Master. I will condemne my selfe of folly, and say, Oh my soule, why art thou so heauy? Why art thou so cast downe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mee? Still trust in the Lorde, for he is thy health and thy saluation.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all afflictions Gods children must looke vnto the ende: They are to desire to profite by them, and in them to seeke the way of perfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and consolation: which that they may finde, they must know that the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the godly last but a while; they serue them but for salues and medicines; the ende of them is alwaies happy. In them they are not onely preserued, and purified from many sinnes: but also much beautified with the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Iesus Christ, who is the eldest Sonne in the house of God. Againe the crosse of true Christians is the sweete and amiable call of God vnto repentance, in that he putteth vs in minde thereby to bethinke vs of our debts: because we are giuen to thinke the daie of payment is yet farre of; yea we fall a sleepe vntill our turne be ended, and whilest God lengtheneth our daies waiting for our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we neuer thinke of our sinnes vntill the houre come wherein we perish with shame. The best meeting then with the Lordes visitation, is without delay and in syncerity to pray for our sinnes to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For therefore doth the Lord oftentimes
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3573:36"/>
shackle vs the more with the chaines of his chastisements, because we are more carefull to be vnburthened of our sicknes, then to be freed from our sinne: which wee the rather are loath to confesse, because we would not be espied, to be in the wrath of God. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there bee that nearing of their sinnes in the time of their afflictions, will acknowledge indeede their infirmities to be the mother of such a broode: yet they haue no true remorse to restraine themselues from sinne, because they haue but a confused con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite thereof, and though their ship be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so much tossed and turmoyled, yet thinke they not that God holdeth the sterne. These men if God beare with them, do as it were settle in their lees, and are as it were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in their sinnes. For prosperitie is a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, to cast our selues into a dead sleepe, and when the Lord setteth vs alone, we cease not to sooth vp our selues, bearing our selues in hand, that we are in Gods fauour, and that he loueth vs, because he scourgeth vs not. And thus retchles we are whilest we measure Gods loue according to our sence and humor. Wherin we be wray our ignorance of the exercise of the crosse, in that affliction is the mother of humilitie, humilitie breedeth repentance, &amp; repentance obtaineth mercy. Some also there are who vsually whilest the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3573:36"/>
fearefull iudgement of God is before their eies, eyther in themselues or in others, haue a fewe glancing motions, and starting co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of their sinnes and of Christ his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: yet at all other times their mindes are so clasped vp from thinking of temptations, &amp; their hearts so locked vp from foreseeing or forethinking of iudgments, that they feele no godly sorrow. They mocke the mourning daies of the elect, as of them that be of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy nature; they make a sport of sin, as little remembring the sting which will either pricke them to the hart blood most fearfully in the houre of death, or meete the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with gry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping agonies in the day of their visitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more speedily. But happely they thinke they haue giuen good testimony &amp; word of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remembrance of God, when they giue one deepe sigh and away, and passe ouer Gods heauy indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ouer burning coals. So that whilest the Lord in prosperity affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth large peniworthes of his loue vnto them, they dally with his Maiesty, and make a sport of his mercy. All which imperfections may be better corrected, if in our deepest rest with a reuerente &amp; humble feare of gods iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, we did waite for the day of our tryall, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our selues to the lords visitations, as they who by the writing of their owne conscience do acknowledge themselues by iust title to be fosterers therof: for the feeling of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3573:37"/>
must come from the sight of our misery by sinne; which being pardoned, we shall soone haue our infirmities heled. Wherfore let vs first learne to cleanse our soules from sin, and then to sustaine the sores of our body. Sure it is that if we haue suffered our hearts to be harrowed with the rake of Gods iudgements, (as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the Lord hath bene giuen) that we are become soft &amp; well exercised in the feare of God: we shall come to the feeling of our sins, the sence wherof; if it bring as it were a sicknes to the body &amp; a corsey to the soule, it is an vndoubted earnest of our regeneration, &amp; happy are we if we find our selues so disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and troubled with our sinnes, that we can hardly (being in the skirmish &amp; agony) make any difference between the motions to any euil, &amp; the consent vnto the same: for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times euil motions do so possesse the soules of gods children, sucking down so strongly in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that though they weepe, pray, and meditate (which be the last meanes &amp; remedies to ease &amp; cure them) yet though they feele them with irksomenes &amp; loathsomenes, as we feele sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in our bodies: yet those motions will be continually in them without diminishing, the delight onely excepted. Wherefore for our comfort herein, we are not to martyre our selues with disquietnes of minde, because we are so pestered, thronged with wicked moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and assaultes, but rather let vs quiet our

selues, and not suffer our selues to be hindred with sicknes either of body or mind: by means wherof we should become more vnprofitable to our selues, &amp; the whole church of God. For the godly shall not be so freed from sinne, but that they shalbe assalted with euill motions, suspitions, delusious, vaine fan ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

For the scome therof is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most continually boyling &amp; wallopping in vs, foming out such filthy froth &amp; stinking sauor into our mindes, that it is not only detestable to the minde regenerate and renewed by the spirit of God, but also it would make abashed the very naturall man, to looke into so loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a stye of sin, &amp; sink hole of iniquity. Yea it maketh vs often to quaile, &amp; if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, it would corrupt the very part regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. For mighty is the power, &amp; raging is the strength of sin: Neither for all this must we cease to sorrowe for our sins, nor dispaire on the other side, although our sorrow bee but small. For if we be sorrowfull for the hardnes of our hearts, if we can be grieued for that we are no more grieued for our sins, if we can but sigh and groone because we feele our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; it is so much a greater comfort vnto vs, as it is a greater testimony that our heartes are not altogether hardened: so that if we feele <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as the humming Bee hauing lost her sting in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth still notwithstanding make a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and grieuous noyse by her often buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing about vs, but is nothing able to hurt vs: so sin &amp; death, hauing lost their stings in Christ
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3573:38"/>
Iesus, do not cease at all, euen in the height of the parching heat of our consciences, to make a murmuring: and with furious stormes of temptations to terrifie vs and our conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, albeit they can neuer sting vs. Wherfore if Sathan charge our consciences with sin (if we can feele the things a little before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in our consciences) let vs bid him, not tell vs what we haue beene, but what we woulde be. For such we are by imputation as we be in affection, and he is now no sinner, who for the loue he beareth to righteousnes, would be no sinner. Such as we be in desire and purpose, such we be in reckoning and account with God, who giueth that true desire and holy purpose to none but to his children whom he iustifieth. Neyther vndoubtedly can the gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of sinne breake the peace of our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, seeing it is the worke of an other who hath commended vs as righteous before God, and saued vs. It must indeed be confessed, that our owne works wil do nothing in the matter of iustification, which from Christ, &amp; in Christ is freely giuen vnto vs: it must be granted that in our selues we are weaker then that we can resist the least sinne, so farre of is it, that we can encounter with the law, sinne, death, hell and Sathan: and yet in Christ we are more then conquerers ouer them all. When the law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth thee because thou hast not obserued it;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3573:39"/>
send it to Christ &amp; say, there is a man that hath fulfilled the law: to him I cleaue, he hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it for me, and hath giuen the fulfilling of it vnto mee; I haue nothing to do with thee, I haue another law which striketh thee down, euen the law of liberty which through Christ hath set me free. For my conscience which henceforth serueth the law of grace, is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous prince to triumph ouer thee. If sin come and would haue thee by the throat, send it to Christ, &amp; say, as much as thou maist do against him, so much right thou shalt haue against me. For I am in him, &amp; he in me: wherfore (O sin) I am righteous through my Christ, which is a condemning sin, to condemne thee which art a condemned sinner. If death creepe vpon thee &amp; attempt to deuoure thee, say vnto it, Christ hath ouercome thee, &amp; opened to me the gates of euerlasting life: thou wouldest haue killed him, with the sting of sin, but the same being of no force, thy purpose (O death) hath failed, and he being my life, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thy death. If Sathan sommon thee to answer for thy debts, send him also to Christ and say, that the wife is not suable, but the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band: enter thine action against Christ mine husband, and he will make thee a sufficient answere: who then shall condemne vs? or what iudge shall daunt vs? syth God is our iudge and accquited vs? and Christ was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,

&amp; iustifieth vs? he is our iudge that willeth not the death of a sinner; he is our man of law who to excuse vs, suffered himselfe to be accused for vs. O gluttonous hell where is thy defence?

Christ my lawe fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee O lawe, and is my liberty. Sinne against thee O sinne, and is my righteousnes: Christ against thee O diuell, and is my sauiour?

Thou diddest desire to paue my way to the burning lake of damned soules: but contrarie to thy will, thou art constrained to lift vp the ladder wherby I must ascend into the new Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem. Wherfore if we shal finde our selues forsaken of God, so as we perceiue nothing but matter of dispaire, let vs still hold our owne; &amp; in the certainty of our faith stay our selues, sith Christ is giuen vs of God that he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish sin, triumph ouer the law, vanquish death, ouercome the diuell, and destroy hell, for our onely comfort and consolation.

for looke what freshnes soeuer was in it, it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished day by day. And I neede not goe farre to seeke for death, for I feele not so smale an infirmitie in my bodie, but the same is vnto me a messenger of dissolution. Yet for all this I shall see my God, and when I am couered in the belly of the graue with mouldes, I am assured, that he will reach me his hande to lift me vp againe to the beautie of his inheritance: so that this smale cottage and shed of leaues, being brought to the graue, shall be caried into an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible tabernacle. Thus communing with our owne harts, and being still in the peace of a good conscience, concerning our outward sufferings, we shall finde that the Lord by his fatherly and louing chastisme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, intendeth nothing more then to proue our o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bedience, as good reason it is that he should, and to confirme our faith, as also is most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie. Howbeit still as I saide, he vseth a fatherly correction, that is, in mercy, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and iudgement. For as he striketh vs downe in anger for our sinnes with the one hande, so he raiseth vs vp againe in loue for our saluation with the other hand. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit his corrections be wearisome woundes to flesh and bloude, yet are they soueraine medicines to the soule and conscience, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when the Lorde giueth vs that priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3573:42"/>
of his children, that by his holy spirite he doth ouermaister vs, least that finally we should be his Iudge, and he not ours. And for this cause the Lord is often times prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to put on (as it were) a contrary face, &amp; to locke vs vp in a prison of aduersitie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine vs from the libertie of our sinnes, which Sathan faine would make vs violently to rush into. And surely though the wisdome of the flesh perswadeth vs that nothing is better then to be spared and not to be espied when the Lord calleth vs to reckoning; yet the spirit shewing our desperate estate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the syre of affliction, and boulter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie, teacheth vs that we cannot of all the blessings of God sufficiently esteeme this, being the mother of humilitie, and nource of true repentance. Againe, the Lorde fitteth vs often by inward temptations and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde crosses, to flitte vs from the stake of securitie and vntowardnes to good workes; least in time we should loose the experience of our knowledge and faith in Christ, and seeke some easier kinde of life for flesh &amp; bloud. Neither can we truely repent, vntill by some crosse we know this world to be a place of sorrowe, and not of mirth and delight. For so long as we make our prosperitie a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke to beate downe all harmes, we are to looke for aduersitie to beate downe the

But we must be as birds on a bough, to remoue at Gods pleasure, and that without resistance when the Lord shall visite vs. And because we are giuen to much to thinke that wee haue the things in our owne right, which we houlde of the free goodnes of God: wee are taught in affliction how hainous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes it were to binde the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to intertaine vs in this life at so full Charge and cost, without respect of his free &amp; vndeserued giftes: or to holde plee against, and sue him as it were by an obligation, at whose handes we ought to begge daily; and at whose gate we receiue all our maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: or to make a rent charge of all that which he giueth of his hee liberalitie. Thus in the end wee make a chalendge of owner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe of Gods giftes, and make accompt to haue their companie to the graue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee prouoke the Lord often to prooue to

our faces, that all that wee haue is but lent and borrowed. Let vs then haue such an eye to euery blow, that whensoeuer the Lord shall lay any crosse vpon vs, wee bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receiue it &amp; to yeelde vp our bonds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, the condition whereof is, that wee be readie to remooue whensoeuer he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, knowing that Gods prouidence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vs alwaies to the best, and as most may make for the hastening of our soules to our euerlasting inheritance.

Thus it becommeth the Lord to change our estate that wee be come not snatled in the giftes of prosperitie, and become so folish as not to keepe on our way to the heauenly life. Our natural inclination is to forget that we are on earth as pilgrimes; to leape vp into the clouds; and to promise vnto our selues the whole course of our liues to be in prosperitie; and so long as God letteth vs alone at our ease, we take our selues (as it were) to be petty Gods. But when we see our selues shut vp, and know not what will be the end of our misery, finde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selues to be intertained in this life but as iorney men, waged for the present day, but

Wee must not thinke that we shall euer be shut vp in a mewe, so that we should see noe crosse: but we must lay open our selues to receaue stripes from the Lord, knowing that our least cryes will stay his greatest scourges. Let vs loue to bee assaulted, but not vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably because God will assist vs. Let vs looke to fal, but on our knees, because Gods hand doth hold vs vp.

But when GOD doth send vs things cleane contrary to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, that we must bee faine one while to enter into a quagmire, and another while to march vpon ragged rocks &amp; stones; then wee shall haue the vse of a well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excised minde in prayer, in repentance, and in contempt of this life. And why doeth the Lorde some time suffer vs to pyne away, and to languishe in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of griefe, seeinge that hee coulde cleane ridde vs at the first, doubtlesse to this end, that wee might confesse his mercy more freely, and bite of his iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice more sharpely.

For there is noe greater cause of our desparing vnder the crosse, then when Sathan perswadeth vs: that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any were handled so roughlye, or els woulde beare vs in hande, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though GOD afflicted the faithfull that haue beene before vs, yet they were not so weake as wee.

Wherefore least our infirmities shoulde ouermaister vs, and when temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are fierce vppon vs, wee knowe not where to become: Let vs call too minde the Saintes of God, who were constrained with sighes and grones to stoup vnder the hande of GOD; whose martyrs and tormented children ought to bee our looking glasses, to the ende that by them wee may learne, that according as GOD dealeth forth the giftes of the Spirite, thereafter doth hee sende greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; both to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the more estemed,

Since the time I receiued M.

And albeit euen still I am in the same case, yet conscience towards God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion &amp; loue towards you, forceth mee to ouercome lets which hardly I could otherwise preuaile against. And albeit I cannot write as I would, yet of that which I shall write pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forenamed groundes I looke for some blessing from God through Iesus Christ if you will not too much faint in faith, and yeeld to the aduersarie: yea, if you will but hope so well of your selfe, as (in the feare of GOD I doe write it) I hope of you. First, whereas it seemeth you are

sometimes grieued, becaus you tarried not still at Cambridge according to mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, you must knowe I aduised it not as a thing necessary, but more conuenient, as I the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> supposed, but I aduised you to obey your father, if his pleasure still continued to haue you home; whereunto you yeelding, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And who knoweth whether beeing there you might not haue beene as much troubled, there beeing no priuiledge for persons and places in such cases: And who knoweth whether it be the Lordes pleasure, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sample and instruction (and I hope the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation) of others in the ende.

That which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue presently by M.

First therefore know you for a certaintie, that this is no other tentation, than such as diuers of Gods children haue beene humbled with, and afterwarde haue had a good issue out of it: and if it please God to moue ye to credit me, <hi>I</hi> my selfe haue knowen others, as deepely this way plunged, as you can be.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3573:52"/>
thee? Verelie because he should more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously offend than the rest: although their offence was verie great; therfore his and our most blessed Sauiour applied to him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, but did not appropriate it vnto him only, and restrained it from the rest. Compare with this place. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.20. and you shall see that the heauenly verity affirmeth; that he praied not onelie for the Apostles, but for all those that should beleeue through their word: yea farther, Our lord Iesus Christ was yesterdaie, is to day, &amp; shalbe for euer.

truth is more then Sathan by all his force is able to ouercome, as may appeare vnto vs by that endles resistance which the spirit of god dwelling in vs maketh against him. For he that so fighteth is not yet captiue: &amp; he that standeth in face of the enimie, and endureth all his assaults, is not yet vanquished. Yet that he holdeth out in so great weaknes of his owne, against so strong &amp; furious assaults of the enimy; it plainely argueth, that he stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by a greater strength then his owne, by which, as he is presently preserued that hee fals not into the hand of his aduersary; so nede he no doubt therby to be finally deliuered, &amp; be crowned with victory &amp; tryumph in despite of Sathan &amp; all hee is able to worke against him. But if the enimie, whose quarrelling with vs is endles, as his malice is vnsatiable, will not thus leaue vs &amp; giue vs rest: then as I said before, it is our best &amp; safest way, at once to end all disputation with him.

In the question of faith wee haue comfort also from the works &amp; effects therof in our selues: For as the tree is knowne by the fruits,<note place="margin">Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the fruits.</note> so faith wanteth not her fruites wherby she may be discerned. These are of diuers sorts, sorow for sinne past, hatred of euill, care and indeauor to auoide it both in generall and in particular, the loue of God &amp; of his righteousnes; desire &amp; care with labour &amp; contention to please him, both in generall &amp; perticular duties. And here againe wee haue a lawful &amp; necessary recorse vnto the time past. For albeit wee haue nothing to glory in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,<note place="margin">Psal. 77.6.</note> when the question is of the cause of our saluation; yet the effects of this grace and fauour of God towards vs in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fruites of our faith, may yeeld vs noe small comfort in the time of our heauinesse and of the anguish of our spirites: here of it is that the Prophet in the psalmes doth so often protest his obedience vnto God,<note place="margin">Psal. 119</note> &amp; care to doe his commaundements, hereof it is that Iob vnto the comforting of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed conscience remembreth the course of his former life,<note place="margin">Iob. 31.</note> led in the feare of God and obedience of righteousnes.

somtimes called vpon the name of God, both publikely &amp; priuately, with others &amp; alone by yourselfe: with what ioy &amp; reioicing of the soule you haue praised the lord for his mercies towards his Church, and towardes you selfe:<note place="margin">Praising of God.</note> Call to minde what hath beene in you at any time the power of those Sacramentes,<note place="margin">Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</note> which are annexed as seales vnto the promise of saluation by Christ, and howe farre they haue by the blessing of God erected your minde in hope and assurance of his goodnes towardes you.</p>
            <p>If your present discouragement resist the comfort of these meditations, it is no newe thing, that in our weaknes we shoulde after the manner of those that be sicke, disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage our selues of that, which might doe vs most good: yet remember howe iniurious a thing it were, to esteeme the children of God by their present agonies and conflict of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, rather then by the comfort of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state wherein the grace of God shined plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully vpon them and in them. For as when men are diseased it cannot therof be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they were neuer in health; so the present discomfortures of the children of God, though they take away the sense of his mercie for a time, yet they are no repeale of his former goodnes and fauour towardes them, nor denie them to haue beene, euen in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3573:65"/>
their owne iudgement and feeling, deare vnto the Lord: and still to be, though the storme and tempest of their present affliction suffer them not so liuelie and comfortably to enioy the same, as before. For which cause they must with <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> call to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance the comfortes of times past,<note place="margin">Iob. 29.3 Psal. 77.6 12.</note> from thence to assure themselues of the returne of the good hande of the Lorde in due time. I doubt not but you can be witnesse vnto God and to your owne selfe, that the time hath beene when your comfort and assurance of Gods fauour was such, as Sathan himselfe coulde not denie the testimonie which then the spirite of God did beare vnto your spirite. Nowe the giftes and calling of God are without repentance,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.16 Rom. 11.29 Iohn. 13.1.</note> and whome hee loueth he loueth vnto the ende, neyther doth our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation depend vppon any thing of our owne: for then wee shoulde a thousande times pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and fall before the enemie, but vppon that eternall and euerlasting loue of God, wherewith hee hath loued vs in Iesus Christ before the foundations of the worlde were laide: which loue of his, if it hath at anie time beene made knowen vnto vs and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of vs, wee haue assurance grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the testimonie of men and Angels. But you will say, that which sometimes I felt is now gone, and in steade thereof I

am perpetually opprested with the horror of the wrath of God iust against me for my sinnes. It is true that the power and sence of faith is not alwaies alike in the children of God: yet is it a false and sophisticall conclusion, suggested from him that is a lyar from the beginning, and the father of lying, to say, wee feele not faith, therefore there is no faith in vs. For in many disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the bodie wee haue no sence of life, and yet we liue. The sunne shineth not in the night season, nor when it is obscured with cloudes: shall wee say therefore that there is no sunne, or that it hath vtterlie no operation? Admitte also (which yet may not bee admitted) that the Lorde had for a time vtterlie giuen vs ouer: can wee conclude thereof, that hee will neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine be mercifull vnto vs? Nay, hee that founde vs when we sought him not, will sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie returne vnto the worke which hee hath begunne, though he seemeth for a while to haue forsaken it. There is somtime as it were an ecclips of our faith, and of the feeling of the grace of GOD towardes vs, but let vs assure our selues, that as the Sunne and Moone doe not perish in their ecclipses, nor loose their lighte for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: soe in this ecclips which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth for a time vnto our fayth,

and sence of Gods goodnes, the same shall not perish or loose his vertue for euer: but shall in good time be restored, or rather quickened in vs againe, vnto our further and more assured comfort. This you haue seene in many the deare children of God whose heauines hath beene knowne vnto you, that they haue not beene forgotten for euer, but that the Lord, who seemed for a while to frowne vpon them, did in the ende cause his most gracious and louing countenance to shine vpon them againe: you haue felt it in your selfe, that there hath beene an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable course of sorrow and comfort, of faith and feare, and that the one hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally succeeded the other, that the same hand that humbled you, did raise you vp againe; that he that inflicted the wounde into your soule, applied thereunto the most sweete and soueraigne remedie of his grace. So ancient and so experienced a soldiour as you are in this spirituall battaile, should now be valiant and strong vnto the combat: our victorie wherein, though it be not to be hoped from the weakenes of flesh, yet the experience we haue had of the goodnes of God in our former troubles, ought to assure vs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of his helping hand in al our necessities.

I will not speake of that which is publique, although not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnfitt vnto my purpose, considering that that which is publiquely spoken as vnto all, hath also a particular addresse vnto those that are the Lordes.

A most excellent practise wherof, we haue in our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: <hi>Luke.</hi> 7. where first he proueth by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument vnto <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharesie,<note place="margin">Luke. 7, 41</note> that the mourning sinner was pardoned all hir sinnes, and therefore was now no sinner and wicked one, as he vncharitably esteemed her to be, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> turning himselfe vnto the distressed soule; first saith, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, thy faith hath saued thee, go in peace.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3573:68"/>
Wherin, though there be some thing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie in our SauiourChrist as the son of God yet is it that power which he hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated vnto all his seruantes,<note place="margin">Iob. 20.23</note> saying whose sinnes you forgiue, they are forgiuen, &amp;c. which is nothing else but, whose sinnes vpon due examination and triall of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance you pronounce to be forgiuen, they are forgiuen. Heere againe remember, (my deare friende) howe many of the faithfull and expert seruants of Christ haue examined your estate by conference with your selfe, and haue founde all signes vnto health and saluation. Vnlesse therefore Sathan dare contradict the spirite of GOD, speaking by the mouthes of so many witnesses, hee cannot saye but you are the Lordes. Nowe for your selfe, I am assured that you will not, nor dare not say, but this hath beene the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant testimonie of all the seruantes of God sente vnto you; and that they were such as you had no cause to suspect their partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie or flatterie in anie sorte. Howe is it then, that the voyce of so many shoulde not bee vnto you as the voyce of GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? Who, though hee doe not speake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs nowe immediately from heauen, as in some times past; yet hee speaketh vnto vs by the mouthes of his seruantes, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.

When <hi>Dauid</hi> saide in the horrour of his soule, I haue sinned against the Lorde, was it thinke you a small comforte that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> saide immediately vnto him,<note place="margin">2.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h pardoned thy sinne? I will say nothing of the prayers of so many of the seruantes of Christ as haue commended your cause vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lorde: which cannot be frustrate, the Lorde himselfe directing them to pray according to his worde, and vppon the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of his promise. Read <hi>Iob.</hi> 33.23.<note place="margin">Iob. 33.23</note> If there be present with him (that is with the afflicted soule, as <hi>verse</hi> 22.) a messenger from God an interpreter (of the will of God,) such as is one of a thousand, who may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie vnto man the equitie of the Lord, and intreating him for fauour shall say: Redeeme thou him that he goe not downe into the pit, by that redemption which I haue founde; when he hath humblie besought the Lord, he doth graciously receiue him that he may beholde his face with ioy, and he restoreth vnto man his righteousnesse. In which words there are many excellent thinges to be noted for the comforte of those that are afflicted. The first is, that the anguished soule finding no comfort at home and in her selfe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the strength of temptation, must seeke reliefe abroade at the handes of those, whom
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3573:69"/>
God hath appointed to make glad the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull minde, and to giue rest vnto the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and distressed conscience. Wherein you must consider with all thankefulnesse, howe greate mercie the Lorde hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto you, for I doe perswade my selfe; as before I haue saide, that since the time of your affliction, there hath not beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most one, that hath had any extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie gifte in that kinde, who by conference, writing, or otherwise, hath not bestowed some parte of his trauaile vnto your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte. I coulde my selfe name a greate number besides those aboue mentioned, but your selfe can remember many more: nowe the testimonie of so many faithfull seruantes of Christ witnessing the grace and goodnesse of GOD towardes you, must bee as the voyce of GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: who is not as man that hee shoulde lie, or as the sonne of man that hee should repente, or alter that which hee hath once testified. And if <hi>Iob</hi> doe acknowledge that the comforte of one faithfull witnesse on the behalfe of GOD, is enough to the erecting and chearing of the heauiest minde, what can Sathan say vnto the testimonie not of 2 or 3 witnesses which the lawe onely requireth, but vnto the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of 2 or 3 score, the meanest and weakest
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3573:70"/>
whereof, should be able to answere in your behalfe vnto all that the enemie is able to obiect against you. The second thing I note is, that these haue not come vnto you by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or by chance, but by speciall addresse of Gods mercifull prouidence, as sent from the throne of grace to binde vp your wounde, and to minister comfort vnto your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The third, that these speake not their owne wordes nor of themselues, but are the faithfull interpreters and declarers of the will and counsell of God, not indeede immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atelie from himselfe, but by viewing and esteeming of the worke of God, and the fruites of his grace in those that are his. The fourth, that as they declare vnto the afflicted, that fauour of God towardes them which themselues are not able for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to discerne, so they commend them by praier vnto the Lorde, who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to heare and to graunt their requestes. The fift, that for comfort in this cause, we must passe out of our selues, in whom there is nothing that may ease our griefe, and cast our eye and cogitation onelie vpon Christ, in whom all fulnesse of saluation doth dwell, considering that this is one of the meanes whereby Sathan doth most distresse and anguish the afflicted soules, that he holdeth them in the cogitation of their sinnes and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3573:70"/>
transgressions against GOD, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them not to see, that length, breadeth, height, and depth, and to knowe that loue of Christ that passeth all knowledge,<note place="margin">Ephe. 3.18</note> that they might be filled with all the fulnesse of God. The sixt, that the Lorde both mercifullie blesseth the labours of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes in comforting his children, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so graciouslie heareth their prayers and supplications made in their behalfe vnto his maiestie. And the last, that God in his good time erecteth the mindes of the afflicted, and openeth their mouthes to praise his name, and to protest his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that hee hath brought againe their soule from the pitt, and hath shined vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with the light of life. Which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffect of the grace of GOD, because you haue both seene in others, and felt in your selfe manie times, you haue greate cause to hope and expecte the returne of his comforting hande in due season, who also shall once determine these conflicting daies, and set vs in that peace which shall neuer bee interrupted, and wherein all teares shall be wiped awaye from our faces for euer.<note place="margin">Apoc. 7.18 14 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The malice of the enemie during this life hath no ende nor measure at all, and therefore wee may iustlie feare all extremity
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3573:71"/>
of attempt against vs: but we must strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our selues in him, who can and will inable vs vnto all thinges.</p>
            <p>The Last and most grieuous assaulte of sathan against the afflicted, is that he calleth into doubt their election.<note place="margin">Against the doubt of electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> For, because that saluation is onely of the elect, he laboureth by all meanes to shake this grounde and pillar of comfort, and if it be possible to subuert and ouerthrowe the same. It behooueth vs to take heede howe wee carrie our selues, as in that temptation which all others is moste difficulte and dangerous. First therefore, wee muste beware of that gulfe wherein the enemie hopeth to deuoure vs, that we enter not into the secrete and hidden coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of GOD.

First the spirite of GOD witnesseth vnto our spirites that wee are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Children of GOD. Then it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to crie <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and stirreth vp in vs those gronings that cannot bee expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> From these let vs descende vnto faith it selfe, the voyce whereof if it bee not suppressed by the grieuousnesse of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3573:71"/>
soundeth cheerefully vnto vs, that wee are beloued of GOD, redeemed be Christ, and fellow-heires with him of his fathers kingdome. If heere also the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> enemye haue darkened our senses and obscured our light: Wee muste of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie with <hi>Iob,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 31.</note> releeue our selues from the fruites of our faith, these what they are hath alreadie beene sayde. If necessitie doe soe compell vs, wee must flye vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the times that are past, &amp; referre our selues vnto the testimonies of the faithfull ministers of GOD, who as they are for their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and manyfolde experience, better able to iudge of our estate then our selues; so haue they power and authoritie from GOD, to decide the controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and our enemie and to pleade our cause against him. Also where the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie from our presente trouble and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of minde, seeketh to driue vs vnto dispaire, wee are to vse against him his owne weapons; for amongest manie te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of our state in grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with GOD, there is none more euidente and sensible, then is that conflicte which wee finde and feele in our selues, of the spirite againste the fleshe, of faythe against vnbeliefe,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3573:72"/>
of a sanctified minde against that parte that is vnregenerated: and finally, of the newe creature against the olde man, and of Christ himselfe in vs, against the power of Sathan. If hee replie that this is not so, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. Wee may answere, that albeit there haue beene many times, wherein wee haue had a more presente and mightie hande of the Lorde vppon vs: yet euen nowe Sathan himselfe cannot denie, but wee hate sinne and loue righteousnesse: that we loue God and to our power obeye his will, and flie the baites and occasions of euill: whereof if if there were for the presente no manifest and apparant effectes, (as yet by the grace of GOD there are) notwithstanding the onelye affection and desire of the heart thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and longing after God his kingdome and righteousnesse, are sufficiente argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the worke of grace begunne in vs, which shall so longe be continued by the good hande of our heauenlie father, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it be consummated and perfected in the life to come. For if it be God (as the Apostle faith) that giueth both the will and the deede: hee that hath giuen vs to desire to obey his wil,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> will also inable vs vnto the doing of the same. And seeing the worke of sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beginneth in the hart, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3573:72"/>
floweth into our whole life, wee nothing doubt but God, who hath giuen vs ioy in the holy Ghost, and thereby a loue vnto him, and vnto his Lawe; will further confirme and strengthen vs, that we may be vessels of honoure vnto his name, and glorifie the Gospell of our profession with fruites agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and according thereunto. Yea the thoughts, meditations, and desires of the hearte, are deedes before God, and principall parts of that obedience which he requireth at our handes. And therefore if the faithfull man should be taken awaye by death, before he hath done any of the outward workes of the Lawe; yet shoulde not his faith be without fruites, in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sanctified in the inward man, he doth now in soule and spirit serue the Lorde, and desireth abilitie and opportunitie, in acte to doe his will, and to honour his nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; as appeared in that penitent malefactor that died with our Sauiour Christ.<note place="margin">Luk. 23.42</note>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing I am to admonish you of, that you be not as the couetous men of the world: who so gape vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desire, as they consider not but rather forget that which they alreadie haue, and hauing much indeede, in ther opinion haue nothing and to all purposes and vses doe as well want that which they haue, as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3573:73"/>
that which they haue not. So it oftentimes happenneth to the deare children of God, that whilest they looke and breath after that, which they haue not yet attained vnto, they forget and neglect that which they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and vse it not to their comfort and reioycing as otherwise they should. This ouerreaching and importunite of theirs, Sathan abuseth against them; from the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hauing nothing, to blinde their eies, not to see the present grace and goodnes of God towardes them. It is true that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith that in the course of Godlines and religion,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.11.</note> we may not thinke we haue attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goale, or are come vnto the ende of our rase: but, forgetting that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde vs, and preassing on vnto that which is before, must contende (as to a marke) vnto the reward of that most high calling of God in Christ Iesus. But he speaketh it not to this ende, that we should not in thankfulnes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the former mercies of GOD bestowed vpon vs, or not vse them vnto our comfort as testimonies of his loue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour toward vs: But that we may not stay in our present profiting, but add dayly a new and fresh increase; that as from a larger and greater heape of benefits, we may more and more assure our selues, that we are beloued of God, and shall inioy the inheritance of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3573:73"/>
his kingdome. When the Apostle saith, work your saluation &amp;c. and laboure to make your callinge and election sure, though the meaning be not,<note place="margin">Phil. 2, 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2, Pet. 1, 10.</note> that we should put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of saluation in workes, yet it telleth vs, that the workes and fruites of our faith are testifications of Gods spirit dwelling in our hearts, more e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ident and pregnant, then that Sathan himselfe can or dare deny them. We may not suffer our selues to be so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerborne of the enimie vnder the colour of zeale and desire to doe well, as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member wherein the Lorde hath alreadie giuen vs some parte of well doing: not so to striue vnto that wee haue not, as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that which by his grace we alredy haue: But rather with all thankfulnesse acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the goodnes of God, from thence assure our selues of the continuance and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of the worke begun. In the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the worlde, as slownesse getteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; so preposterous hast looseth all. It is the subtiltie and malice of the enimie, when hee cannot houlde vs with himselfe; to hasten and push vs on so fast and so headelong, as by rashnes wee may fall into that which by forwardnesse wee had escaped. Good thinges to come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wee must holde them in hope, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them in peace: but the good wee haue
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3573:74"/>
already attained vnto, we must so farr reioice and comfort our selues in, as from thence wee may be able to sustaine and support our cause against the enemy, and from that we haue, to let him vnderstand that wee doubt not of that which remaineth: that the Lord wil both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll the doctrine of the Scriptures may be briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly referred to these two heades. First how we may bee prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the spirit of God. Secondly, how the spirite may bee retained when wee haue once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it. And therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hauing laboured to instruct the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> in the former part of this Epistle, how they may receiue the spirit, doth here teach them how to keepe and continue this spirit vnto the ende: and this the Apostle doth by giu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a charge and commaundement, that in no wise they doe <hi>quench the spirit:</hi> thereby doubtlesse teaching, that as the shu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of euill, is the first steppe vnto good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; so the readie way to continue the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God in our heartes, is to labour that it bee not quenched. Now the Apostle v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon greate and weightie consideration,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3573:75"/>
doth here deliuer this precept. For first of all, though all those be worthely and iustly condemned, that neuer tasted of the spirite of God: yet as our sauiour Christ saith; A more iust and fearefull condemnation is like to come vppon them, that hauing once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, doth afterwardes loose the same againe. Moreouer, without this spirit of God, noe holy exercise can haue his full effecte: For the worde worketh not, where the spirit of GOD is wanting; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers haue no power to pearce into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God; the sacraments seeme small and seely thinges in our eyes, and all other orders, and exercises which God hath graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ordained for man, they are vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to man, where the spirit is not present to conuey them into our hearts, there to seale vp the fruite of of them. Last of all, we are fitte to receiue no good grace at Gods handes: nay, wee doe not esteeme Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when we haue not the spirit to teach vs to set a due price vpon them: for speake of the Law, or of the Gospell; of sinne, or of righteousnes: speake of Christ, or of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, &amp; iustification by him: yea, speake of that huge, and heauy waight of glory wher with the elect of God shall bee crowned; all this mooueth not, wee are little affected therewith, vnlesse God giue vs of his good
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3573:75"/>
spirit, to profit by the same. The Apostle ther forewith good reason, gaue this precept, and wee, for many greate causes, are to listen vnto it, least by any meanes the spirit of God be quenched in vs, &amp; so we depriue our selues of all these fruites. Now, whereas the Apostle saith, <hi>Quench not the spirit,</hi> it may appeare he speaketh to those that had alredy receiued the spirit. For, as the fire ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be said to be que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, where it is not: so they cannot be sayd to quench or loose the spirit, which haue not as yet receiued it. Then knowe, that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept doeth properly beelong to them, that haue receiued the spirit of God, and they es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially are to make a special vse of it: for the other, it cannot profite them, vnlesse that, as the seede lying in the ground a long time doth afterwarde budde and become fruitfull; so this continue in their mindes, tyll they haue tasted (in some good sorte) of the spirite of GOD, and then breede in them some carefulnesse that they doe not quench it. Well then, to them that haue felt and founde the spirite of GOD in them, to them saith <hi>Sainte Paul</hi> in this place. <hi>Take heede, that yee quench not the spirite.</hi> Of this, if wee doe somewhat seriouslye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider; these two questions will offer them selues, and soone arise in our minde.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3573:76"/>
First, how wee may know whether we haue the spirit of God, or no: Secondly, if wee haue it, whether it may bee lost againe or no: which if they bee well and sufficiently answered, they will doubtlesse giue greate force vnto this precept. For the first then, if wee will know whether wee haue the spirit or no; wee must surely vnderstande, that as hee knoweth best that he hath life, which feeleth it in himselfe: so he best knoweth whether we haue the spirit of God, that feeleth the spirit working in him. And if wee will further know, by the peculiar wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and effectes of the spirite, then let vs marke these. First of all, if there bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in man but the nature of man; if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that may bee attained by the art and industry of a man, then surely in that man, is not the spirit of God: for the spirit is from God, it is from aboue, it is aboue nature: and therefore the Apostle doth set the spirit of God, against the spirit of the world, when he saith: <hi>we haue receiued the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, not of the worlde, but of God,</hi> Besides, the spirit of God is eternall, and endureth for euer: but all the doings and deuises of men they perish, and in time they haue an ende. Therefore though a man haue wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with greate knowledge, though in wit and skill hee passe and excell the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

And therefore saith. <hi>S.

Therefore the Euangelist <hi>Iohn</hi> doth make this, the first worke of the spirit, that it shal rebuke the worlde of sinne: and this so needefull, that without it, there is not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, neither yet can Christ come and enter into that man. Hereof it was that Christ compared the Iewes to <hi>Children in the market place, who would not daunce

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and did reioyce to heare the ioyfull ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Gospell.

               </gap>hat if they finde not sinne to bee a heauie loade and burthen to them, they haue not the spirit of God, neyther are they fitt to receiue Christ. Then to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked of sinne, is the first worke of the spirite; which the spirite worketh in vs by these degrees. First it raiseth vp in vs a great and generall astonishment, by reason of all those greate and enormous sinnes that wee haue committed, and this doth strike vs downe, it doth terrifie vs, and houlde vs amazed woonderfully: then it dealeth with vs more perticularly; and besides that, it bringeth vs vnto a speciall griefe for spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall sinnes, it doth bereaue vs of our cheefe desires, and bringeth vs out of conceite and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3573:77"/>
liking with the best thinges that are in vs: for, then it doth display before vs the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and darkenesse of our vnderstanding, how vnfit and vnmeete wee are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande and conceiue those things, that do aboue all others especially concerne vs: then doth it let vs see the peruerse corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our iudgement, that before God, and in thinges belonging to GOD, wee bee as bruite beastes, not able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne thinges that differ, nor to put a sound difference betweene good ad euill; then doth it let vs see that our reason is vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, nay, that it is hurtfull vnto vs, a greate enimie to faith, and a greate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone of infidelitie and vnbeliefe. When it commeth to our affections, it turneth them vpside downe, it turneth our myrth into mourning, our pleasure into paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and our greatest delight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to most bitter griefe: If it doe proceede further, and come once to the hearte, and to the stomacke and courage that is in vs, then it cutteth vs to the quicke, then doth it at once throwe vs downe in humilitie vnder the hande of GOD: for while wee had to deale with men, wee were as stoure as any, and woulde not starte for the best, Wee had reason to say for our
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3573:78"/>
selues, &amp; courage to defend our selues against all them that did deale with vs: but now the spirite draweth vs into the presence of God, it letteth vs see that we haue to doe with God, and that our strength is weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in respect of him. Then doth our harte beginne to fayle vs, then doe wee lay our handes on our mouthes, and dare not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, nay, then doe wee quickly take vp our crosse, because the Lord himselfe hath done it. Beholde here how the spirit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, beholde how sinne is corrupted: and who so can beholde here this in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, may assuredly say, that the spirit of God is in him, that it is not in vaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, nay, that it is mightie and liuely in operation in his heart. The third note and effect, is the bringing on forwarde of this worke vnto iustification: for when the spirite hath brought vs thus farre, then doth it beginne to open vnto vs a doore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the graces and fauour of God: it doth put into our mindes, that there is mercie with God, and therefore stirreth vs vp to seeke mercie at his handes: afterwarde, it doth let vs see how Christ suffered, to take away the sinnes of the worlde, that in the righteousnesse of Christ, wee may looke to be iustified before God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this it doth not let vs see only, but doth effectually worke a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3573:78"/>
sure perswasion of it in our heartes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the same by two notable effectes. The first is, a ioy most vnspeakeable and glorious, wherewith our hearts must needs be wholly taken vp and rauished, when wee see our selues by the righteousnes of Christ of the free mercy and grace of God, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from death, deliuered from hell, and freede from the fearefull condemnation of the wicked. The second is the peace of conscience: which indeede, passeth all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. While sinne, and the guilt of sinne remained there was no peace, nor rest, no quietnesse to be founde, but feare within, terrours without, and troubles on euery side: But when sinne is once nailed to the crosse of Christ, when the guilt of sinne is taken out of our consciences, and the puninshment thereof farre remoued, then must needes ensue great peace: for our accusers dare not proceed against vs, our sinnes are forgiuen vs, and God is at one with vs: and for this, we haue the warrant and testimonie of the spirit. Can flesh and bloode perswade vs of it? can any creature assure vs how God is affected towardes vs? no doublesse. And therefore where this ioy and peace is, there must needes be the holy ghost, the author and worker of the same: for as no man knoweth what is in man,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3573:79"/>
but the spirit of man which is in him: so none knoweth the will of God, but the spirit of God, and therefore it is the spirit of God that must certifie our hearres and spirites of the same. And hereof there doth arise that, which wee take as the fourth note, when we finde it in our selues, to wit; The life and nemblenes that is in vs to doe good: for when a man doth finde fauoure from God, for the forgiuenesse of sinnes, then the loue of God constraineth him, that ioy which hee conceiueth inforceth him, and putteth life into him, for the performance of those thinges, which are pleasing vnto God: then hee beginneth to finde himselfe not onely reclamed from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, but also applyed and framed to that which is good; then is his vnderstanding inlyghtened, to see into the mysteries of godlinesse, and into that great worke of his redemption, and into whatsoeuer concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the sauing health of his soule: then is his iudgement reformed, and he is made able to iudge betweene false religion and trewe, betweene the workes of the fleshe, and of the spirit, betwene that which is good, and that which is euill and displeasing in the sight of God. Then are his affections in some good measure altered, his desire is set, not vpon earthly, but vpon heauenly thinges, his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3573:79"/>
ioyes are not in the ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th, but in the heauens, his anger is wasted and spent, not vpon his owne priuae cause and quarrels, but vpon his owne sinnes, and vpon whatsoeuer hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the glory of his God: This is the life of God in him; thus he liueth that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the spirite, and thus he leadeth his life continually: for they that haue receiued the spirite, are led by the spirit and do liue accordingly, bringing forth the fruites of the spirite. But this hath weakenes ioyned with it, and men through frailtie may sone fal, and therefore their life: is sayde <hi>To be hid in Christ,</hi> because in full and perfect manner it doth not appeare: Therefore, if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these frailties and falles, wee will know whether wee still retaine the spirite of God, wee must search our selues, and trye our hearts by these rules. First, if when through frailtie wee haue fallen (for who is hee that falleth not?) We will then know whether by our fall we haue lost the spirite of God or no, let vs see what liking, or misly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge wee haue of sinne: for it after our fall, wee doe holde our former hatred of sinne, and the oftenner wee fall, the more thorough and deadly hatred wee conceiue against sinne, vndoubtedly that fraile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath not as yet depriued vs of the spirite. Secondly: come and see
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3573:80"/>
how it standeth with thy sorrow: for so long as thy sorrow encreaseth for thy sinnes, it cannot bee thought that sinne and the fleshe, haue ouercome and vtterly quenched the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite in thee, Thirdly, try thy care: and if thou grone in a godly care, both how thou mayst bee able to wage battaile against sinne in the plaine fielde, and how thou mayst preuente sinne in all his pollicies, thou hast a further assurance that sinne, although it be as great as <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet it hath not hitherto preuailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy poore and little <hi>Dauid,</hi> I say, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those fewe and small graces, which the good spirite of God hath bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thee: but the last is most certaine, and that is this. When thou art carefull to redeem that, which by thy fall thou hast lost, &amp; hast a care to runne so much faster forwarde, by how much more thou hast beene letted by thy fall: then it doth appeare that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite is in thee, yea liuely and mighty in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and such as shall neuer be taken from the, vntill the day of Christ. Thus may wee in some good and competent measure try and prooue, whether wee haue the spirite of GOD or noe: for where these fruits are to bee founde, there is also the spirite of GOD. For further confirmation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wee may note the manner of speach, where hee saith, <hi>Quenche not the spirite.</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:3573:80"/>
Wee doe commonly vse to say, the fire is quenched, when the light and heate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is taken away; and indeede nothing can properly be saide to be quenched, but the fire. Now whereas the Apostle saith, <hi>Quench not the spirite,</hi> he giueth vs to vnderstande, that the spirite is in some respect like vnto fire: therfore if we do but a litle consider of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we shal a greate deal better iudge of the spirite, And among others, these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties we finde to be in the fire. First of all it will burne vp, and consume things that may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> burned and consumed: and therefore lighting vpon shawe, stubble, stickes, or such like, it bringeth them to ashes, and doth make them as though they had not beene at all. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it doth purge and purifie those things that can abide to be purged: and this it doth, first by taking away the superfluity of drosse, that hath ouer couered the thing to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Then by fyning the thing it selfe, and by making it purer and purer: Thirdly, it giueth light euen in the most dimme &amp; dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest places: And last of all, it giueth heate, and with all doth as it were put life into those thinges which are capable of life: for whilest a man is frozen and starued for colde, hee is numbde, and as it were without life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but being broughtto the fire, he is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tt, he is reuiued, he is cheared, and then becometh actiue &amp; nimble.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3573:81"/>
These are the properties of fire, and these doe in some manner sort, resemble and shadowe out vnto vs the workes and effectes of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: for first of all, when the spirit of God sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vpon a man, and entreth into his soule, then it beginneth to burne to wast and consume in him, those things that will be wasted: after this sort euill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, noysome lustes, &amp; other stuble which is in man, by the spirite of God are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed and burned. Secondly, it doth purge vs from grosse sinnes, and daily more and more doth purifie vs, that we may be a cleane and holy vessell and Temple for him to rest and dwell in. Thirdly, it is a shining lampe, euer burning and continually gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing light vnto vs, in that way which we haue to walke. And lastly, it doth set vs on heate, and inflameth vs with a zeale of Gods glorie, with a care of our duety, and with a loue of all mankinde: yea, withall it putteth life and lust into vs, to walke in that good way which it doth leade vs, and to doe all those good workes which may glorifie God, or be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious vnto men. Thus we see what likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode there is betweene the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pirite and fire, for which cause the spirite in the scripture is compared vnto fire: nay it is sometimes called fire: for <hi>Iohn</hi> saith. <hi>That our Sauiour Christ shoulde baptise with the holy ghost, &amp; with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3573:81"/>
fire:</hi> that is, with the holy ghost, which is like vnto the fire: Therefore, as truely and as certainly as we may say that there is fire, where we see strawe and such like thinges consumed, or golde and siluer finely purged, or great light in darke places, or great heate in bodies that were nummed before; euen so truely wee may say, and so certainly we may perswade our selues, that the spirit of God is in vs, when we see our coruption consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, our soules purged from the drosse of sinne, our heartes in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ightened and made hot in walking, and working according to that light. The second question to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is,<note place="margin">The seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Question.</note> whether that man which hath once tasted of the spirite, may loose it, and haue it quenched in him. To this it may be saide, that because the spirite of God commeth to, and worketh in diuers men, diuerse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, in diuerse measures: therefore wee must consider of the diuerse woorking of the spirite, and then frame our answere accordingly. First then, there is a ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and lesser worke of the spirite, which may be quenched in them that haue it: and that this inferiour or lesser kinde of woorking may bee taken away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> appeareth plainelye by the parable of the seede which our Sauioure CHRIST propoundeth, for there, besides
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3573:82"/>
               <hi>them that receiue the worde into good grounde, and bring foorth fruites, some an hundreth, some thirtie, some sixtie folde</hi>: he doth also make mention of some others that receiued the worde and yet continued not. And what, had not these the spirite of God in them? yes doubtlesse, for they receiued the worde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, they receiued it gladly, &amp; that which is more, they beleeued that which they had receiued. Beholde then three fruites of Gods spirite in these men, and yet they continued not: for they beleeued indeede, but their faith was temporarie, it lasted but for a time, and after a time it vanished away, and the spirite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them: for, eyther the pleasures and profites of this life did drawe out the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, and drie them vp, or else the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie heate of persecution did quite consume them. More plaine and notable for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is that, in the sixt to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> for there the Apostle faith, <hi>That some may taste of the holy ghost, and thereby be made to taste of the good worde of God, to be inlightned, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue heauenly giftes, yea, and to tast of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the life to come</hi>: and what then? surely the Apostle saith, <hi>That if such fall, it is impossible they should be renewed:</hi> giuing vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that euen they which haue receiued the holy ghost, that haue beene inlightned, that haue receiued heauenly giftes, &amp; haue tasted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3573:82"/>
of the power of the life to come eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such may fall away, and the spirite may be quenched in such. There is a second kinde of working of the spirite, which is a more thorough and effectuall working, which can neuer be taken away from them that haue receiued it. This the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> describeth, when he saith, <hi>That the chosen of God, are begotten againe of the immortall seede of the worde:</hi> This is not a bare receiuing, or a light tasting of the word; but it is a deepe tast of the same, whereby we are begotten and borne againe. The Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> setteth downe an other note of it, saying, <hi>That they that are thus borne againe, cannot sinne:</hi> that is, they cannot make an occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sin, they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nnot fall flat away by sinne: and why? <hi>Euen because the the seede of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth in them,</hi> euen that seede, wherewith they were begotten to a liuely hope of life, euen that seede doth abide, and will abide vnto the ende. Who so is begotten again by this seed, and hath this seede, abiding in him, the spirite hath wrought that in him, which shall not be taken from him: and therefore our Sauiour Christ saith, <hi>The worde that I speake, is spirite and life:</hi> And in an other place he saith, that none shall take his sheepe from him, for the father is mightier then all; and therfore in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he saith, <hi>That it is impossible that the elect should be seduced.</hi> Thus then we see the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3573:83"/>
question is answered: namely, that there is an inferiour working which may be lost; and a more effectuall woorking of the spirite which can neuer be taken away from them that haue it: And this must not seeme strange to vs, neyther must we bee offended that the Lorde should take some, and leue others: or that he shoulde beginne in some, and not bring his worke to perfection: For so he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with other thinges in the world. Some corne is sowen and neuer riseth: some sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, and yet shortly withereth: some grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp to an eare, and yet then is stricken or blasted: and other some (at his good pleasure) doth come to a timelie ripenesse. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, some trees are planted and neuer take roote: some take roote but yet not blossome, some blossoms, and yet neuer bring forth fruit: &amp; other some through his goodnesse do bring foorth fruite in good season. If the Lorde deale so with the plant and herbe of the field, why may he not deale so with vs, the sonnes of men? If we cannot conceiue the reason of this, we must holde our peace: for all the workes of GOD are done in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and all our knowledge is vnperfect; therefore we must heerein rather accuse our selues of ignorance, then the Lord of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse: nay, we our selues doe deale in like sort with those thinges which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3573:83"/>
our handes. In Colledges, Fellowes are first chosen to be probationers; and if they be then approued, they be made full Fellowes, otherwise they are not. If a man (beeing childlesse) do take vnto him some friendes childe, to make him heire of all his goods, he will keepe him vppon liking; if his manners be honest, he shall be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yea it may be, set ouer all his house, and yet afterward for some fault be quit cast off. Some other man taketh an other childe for the same ende, and maketh him his heire indeed: Therfore we must thinke it righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the Lorde to deale thus with vs, seeing we are in his hande: and we must not be offended, though he call some, and doe not inlighten them: and although hee inlighten some, and do not continue them, and doe of his greate mercy continue some euen vnto the ende: let vs rather see what vse we must make of this doctrine. First, we must take heede that wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer quench any grace, or gift that GOD bestoweth vppon vs. Secondlye, wee must still laboure to haue greater measure of giftes: for the wicked may come to haue some small giftes, and such as may bee quite taken away from them. Lastly it doth put a playné difference betweene the Godly, and the Godlesse, beweene them that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3573:84"/>
beare a shew of holinesse, and them that are indeede the holy ones of the Lorde: for the one endureth but for a time, and the other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth for euer. Now if we require a further tryall, whereby we may knowe whether we haue receiued that spirit which lasteth but for a time, or that which will abide for euer with vs: then let vs marke these rules, which put a plaine difference betweene them. First we must marke that inlightning and insight wee haue in to the worde of God, Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>taine it is, that both the godly and wicked are inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the inlightning of the godly is one, and the insight of the wicked is an other: for that knowledge and insight which the godly haue receiued, is certaine and distinct: and therefore in particuler thinges, they be able to apply the threatning of Gods iudgements to the humbling of themselues, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God to comfort themselues. Againe, their knowledge is sufficient to direct them both generally, and in euery particular deuty. And last of all, it neuer sayleth them, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth them vnto the ende: But the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the wicked is not so, for it is confused, general, and vncertaine. And therfore though they haue a general knowle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and of the promises of God, yet can they not make perticular vse of the same. Their knowledge is insufficient, nor able to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3573:84"/>
direct them in their particular actions, and therfore it doth leaue them in the ende. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the knowledge of the godly for the clearenes, the certaintie, and the sufficiencie of it, is compared to the Sunne: so the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the wicked, is compared to the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which doth not giue any certaine light, it doth not continue any time; and when it is gone, men are worse then they were before. So doth it fall out with the wicked; for beside that their knowledge doth soone vanish, there is also in them afterwardes, greater and more dangerous darkenes then there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: heerein then we do see one plaine and manifest note of difference. Secondly, we come to our affections. Certaine it is, that the wicked doe desire the helpe and the fauor of God: but looke to the cause, and that will shewe a difference betweene them and the godly. The wicked doe onely seeke helpe, because of some extremitie which they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? they onely desire to be in the fauour of God, because they woulde be freed from griefe; and therfore it is common with them to say: <hi>Oh that I were out of this payne, Oh that this my sorrowe were taken from me.</hi> By which speaches they shewe, that so they might be at rest, or liue at their case, they woulde little weigh of the helpe or fauour of God. But the godly finde such sweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3573:85"/>
in the fauour of God that for the desire thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they can be contente to forgoe all the pleasures of this life, yea they can be content to suffer much, and endure the crosse patiently, so that at the last, they may assuredly enioy Gods fauour. Not the godly onely, but the wicked also, are grieued when they haue sinned but the wicked do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sorrowe, because their sinne hath, or will bring some punishment vppon them: And the godly sorrowe, because they haue offended God, and giuen him occasion to drawe his fauour from them, therefore his correction doe they beare patiently: but the remembrance of their sinne, that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them still at the verie quicke. Then in their ioy, and in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sorrow, may appeare a seconde difference. The thirde diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in loue, for though both of them doe loue GOD, yet it is after a diuerse manner; the one of sinceritie, the other for wages. A poore childe that is taken vp, fedde, and cloathed, will loue him that doth thus feede and cloath him: but if he receiued no more of that man then of another, he woulde like him, and loue him no better then another: Euen so is it with the wicked, if their bellies be filled, their barnes stuffed, and they haue their heartes desire, they loue God indeede, but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3573:85"/>
yet onely for their belly, and their barnes. Thus did <hi>Saule</hi> loue God, but it was for his kingdome: Thus did <hi>Achitophell</hi> loue God, but it was because he was aduanced to be a councellour: And thus did <hi>Iudas</hi> loue God, but it was because he was chosen to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, and caried the bagg: But what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of their loue the histories doe testifie. <hi>Saule</hi> was a little afflicted, and forsooke God: <hi>Achitophell</hi> somewhat crossed in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, hangeth himselfe: and <hi>Iudas</hi> for againe of money, betrayed Christ. Some experience of this wee may see among vs; Courtiers will be professours, and Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of ripe wittes will be religious, if Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers may come to be Counsellers, and if Schollers may be preferred to the chiefest places: but if promotion come not, then their profession is forsaken, and their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laide aside. And yet that is not all, for ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they waxe prophane in their life or haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall in their opinions. Doe the children of God loue on this manner? No, the holie Ghost which they haue receiued in effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manner, doth shedde the seede of loue in their heartes, and doth worke in them a speciall liking of his goodnesse, of his righteousnesse, and of his holines: and therefore of sincere affection they loue him. As the naturall childe loueth
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3573:86"/>
his father naturally, and though his father beate him, yet beareth he it, and still loueth him: so do the children of God deale. <hi>They haue powred into them</hi> as (Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith) <hi>a godly nature,</hi> so that they do freely loue God their father: and though he afflict them, or crosse them in their desires, yet they loue him, and in loue performe their obedience vnto him continually: therefore <hi>Iob</hi> sayeth, <hi>Though he kill me, yet will</hi> I <hi>trust in him:</hi> They therefore are saide to haue receiued a free spirite, and to serue God in the liberty of the spirite. And who seeth not this to be a plaine and manifest difference betweene them: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may well take it as a thirde marke or rule, whereby to proue and try our selues. The fourth and last rule is, in considering the worke and effect which Gods mercie recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, doth worke in vs: for, heerein doe the wicked shewe their wickednesse two waies. First, on the right hande, the mercies of God do work in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a wonderfull contentation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not such as causeth them to returne the glory vnto God, nay rather it is such, as causeth them to take all glory to themselues: for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God doe puffe them vp, and make them proude, and conceyted in themselues. Heereof there ariseth a greate securitie, which bringeth first neglect, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde contempt of all good meanes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3573:86"/>
they shoulde growe vp in goodnes. On the left hande others offende, beeing neuer pleased nor contented with that they haue: nay, indeede forgetting and lightly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that they haue, and still desiring newe. These men besides that they be vnthankfull, they doe also murmure and grudge against God, &amp; are neuer pleased with him. Between these two, doe the children of God holde a middle and euen course: and therefore wee shall see these thinges in them. First, a sight and an acknowledging of the wantes which doe mooue them, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Like newe borne babes, to desire the sweete and sincere milke of the worde,</hi> that thereby the graces they haue, may be increased, and their other wantes may be supplied: and so farre are they from beeing puffed vp with pride, that they reioyce when their pride may be pulled downe, or their hautinesse abated, eyther by some sharpe rebuke, or by some feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full threatning, or by some moderate cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the Lorde. For they knowe, that if it were needfull for Saint <hi>Paule to be buffited, and that by the minister of Sathan,</hi> to the intent that his pride might be beaten downe: then it is much more needfull for them, after sundry waies to be humbled. Besides they doe not onely desire the worde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they also waite vppon the Lorde,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3573:87"/>
vntill it pleased him to worke further in them thereby: and this wayting is as earnest as is theirs, who hauing watched all the night, doe waite and looke for the dawning of the day. Secondly, as they see their wantes, so also they see that grace they haue receiued, and are for that time will appayde, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented therewith: and therefore as their wantes do humble them, so the graces of God receiued do comfort them: and as their wantes do call vpon them, and cause them to seeke more: so that they haue, doth prouoke them to be thankefull for that they haue receiued. See then a quite contrarye course of the wicked, and those that of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie doe worship God, See I say howe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily the graces and giftes of GOD doe worke in them. And therfore from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration heereof, we may well draw a fourth rule, wherby to make triall and examination of our selues: So to conclude this poynte in a worde, when a man by the spirite of GOD hath beene inlightned vnto a certaine and sufficient knowledge of Gods will, when he findeth his affection, chiefly and aboue all other things set vppon GOD, when he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a pure and sincere loue of God in his heart, not for wages, but for the worke of grace, which after an vnspeakable manner doth moue him thereunto: and when hee doth thankefully acknowledge mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3573:87"/>
as he doth carefully attend and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te vppon the Lord, till he bestow some greater measure of graces vpon him; Then may he be vndoubtedly perswaded, that he hath found the spirite working in him, in a more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manner, and that therefore it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be taken from him. But what then? may such men cast off all care? No, for vnto them doth saint <hi>Paule</hi> giue this charge <hi>That they doe not quench the spirite.</hi> And not with out cause doth he giue them this charge: for though the spirite it selfe can neuer be taken vtterly from them, yet doubtles, if they waxe proude, if they grow secure, if they fall into sinne, the graces and giftes of the spirite, may decaye and die in them, their cleare vnderstanding, their feeling, their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all may be gone, so that in their owne iudgement, and in the iudgment of others, it may seeme that they haue quite quenched, and put out the spirite. Neyther must this seeme so strange: for if the image of God, which was more perfectly placed in <hi>Adam,</hi> then it is now in vs, If I say, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage might quite be lost and blotted out, as we see it was, then no maruell if the graces of the spirit of God be for a time, as it were dead and drowned in vs. And that we may be the lesse offended herewith, the scriptures doe offer vnto vs such examples of men, as hauing
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3573:88"/>
bene once effectually called and truely borne againe, haue yet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>terwarde through some sinnes, lost the graces of the spirite: such were the <hi>Galathians,</hi> for they were truely called, and effectually regenerate by the spirite and Gospell of God, as may appeare by this, that for the wordes sake they reuerenced the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle as the Angell of God; yet they were shared with false doctrine, and fell very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously to the choaking and quenching of the graces of Gods spirite in them. The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it selfe was not taken from them, nay, Christ did still continue in their heartes, but yet for want of godly graces, he was as it were without fashion and forme, so that the Apostle did as it were trauell againe, vntill Christ was fashioned a newe in them. <hi>Dauid</hi> also vppon the committing of his sinne, was brought into the like case, therefore in the 51. <hi>Psal.</hi> he prayeth: <hi>That God will create in him a newe spirit</hi>: What? was the spirit quite gone? no, for by and by in the same <hi>Psalme</hi> he prayeth, <hi>That the Lorde woulde not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his holy spirite from him:</hi> howe can these two stande together, first to pray, <hi>that a new spirite may be created in him, and then, that the spirite of God may not be taken from him?</hi> Surely the spirite it selfe was still in him, and therfore he prayeth, that it may not be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: but the graces, &amp; gracious working of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3573:88"/>
the spirite they were deade and gone, and therefore hee prayeth that they may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in him. By this then we see, that the very chiefe graces of the spirite may be quenched, euen in the most godly, when they fall into sinne. But yet that no libertie may be taken hereby, let vs a litle consider, what griefe and punishment they procure to themselues, that do by any means loose the graces of the spirite. First of all we must know, that though the spirite of God cannot be go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ten by our labour, yet it causeth vs much labour, and we must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe much trauell, and suffer much trouble, before the spirite of God do take possession of vs; now when the graces of the spirite are lost, all this our labour seemeth to bee lost, and what griefe is it to see the whole labour and trauaile of a man to vanish and come to nothing. Secondly, when a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the spirit of GOD, and by the same spirite is assured that his sinne is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen him, and that hee is in the fauour of GOD; there doth arise in his hearte a great ioy in the holy Ghost, a ioy I say, that is vnspeakeable and glorious: and this ioy is lost and gone, when the graces of Gods spirite are gone: with how greate griefe and woe, they know, that in any measure haue tasted of it. Againe, when the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the spirite are choaked in men, then
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3573:89"/>
they haue no hart to doe good, they haue no affection to goodnesse, but all is gone; and they are made for the time, as it were an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable burthen of the earth. What griefe can be greater then this? What sorrow can sinke more deepe, then that a good man should be cleane withholden from doing good? Moreouer it is sure, that when the giftes of the spirit are in this sorte gone, then hee that was most righteous before, may soone fall into greate sinnes, yea and which is more, they shall also suffer the reproch of their sinnes: For this is a part of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that GOD made with his, <hi>That though he will not take his mercies vtterly from them, yet he will visite their sinnes with the rodde, and their iniquities with scou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ges</hi>: and what griefe this is, the example of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may shew vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what griefe was it to <hi>Noah</hi> become a laughing stocke to his owne sonne? what heartbreaking to <hi>Dauid,</hi> by his owne son to be thrust fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his kingdome, so grieuous were those punishments laid vpon them that if without anye respect of hell or heauen, we coulde consider of them, wee had rather want all the pleasures of sinne, which they enioyed, then wee woulde beare the reproch and feele the paine which they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Last of all, when the graces of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3573:89"/>
spirite of GOD are once decayed, they can neuer be repaired and recouered, but with much sorrowe and greate daunger: for it cannot but breede much sorowe of hearte, to remember his former sinnes, to examine and see the greatnesse of them, to apply Gods iudgements to them, and to prouoke himselfe to sorrowe for them: This is as it were to goe thorough the pikes, and through a purgatorie in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life; and yet this must bee done, before wee can recouer Gods graces againe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is a very dangerous thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for in such cases men are brought as it were with <hi>Ionas,</hi> into the bottome of the sea: and as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>into the deepe waters,</hi> so that all the surges, and waues doe passe and flow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him. Now wee know what danger it is for a man to bee thrust ouer heade and ears into the deepe waters: and therefore they that are in such a case, are in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: wherefore all these things considered, the losse of all our labour, the losse of all true ioye, the vnfitnesse to doe good, the readinesse to sinne; the griefe and danger that ensueth thereof, will, or at the least wise may, cause vs to bee ware, how wee <hi>quench the spirit.</hi> And this is the vse of the Doctrine, in humblinge of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3573:90"/>
of vs: which also doth furthermore serue to comfort vs, knowing that we may suffer a greate decay of GODS graces; yet by the rodde, or by the worde of GOD or by both, they shall bee renewed in vs againe. And thus much of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement that the Apostle giueth here, that wee shoulde not <hi>quench the spirite.</hi>

In which sermon, the Apostle had pricked their consciences whith shewing them their sinnes, telling them of a suretie, that their iniquities was the cause of Christ his death: whereby a certaine care began
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3573:91"/>
to be wrought in them, insomuch that being thus troubled, they enquired and saide <hi>men and brethren, what shall we doe?</hi> whereupon afterward followed the second Sermon of <hi>Peter,</hi> wherein he exhorteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in their repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance &amp; teacheth vs that if our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe be good, we must go forward therin. Further he sheweth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this end, that they must beleeue, that beleuing they may be bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tised, that being baptised they might receiue the gifte of the holy Ghost. Lastly it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, how they hearing that sermon first receiued the doctrine, and after perseuered in the practise of the same. Briefely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three thinges are here to bee noted: First the fruite of the former Sermon of <hi>Peter</hi> contained in these wordes. <hi>Now when they hearde it, &amp;c.</hi> Scondely the summe of a new Sermon of <hi>Peter</hi> in these worde. <hi>Then Peter saide vnto them, amende your liues, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly is set downe the fruite of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. In the former part of this Chapter wee may knowe the wonderfull workes of GOD, that the Apostles, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer brought vp in scholes, speake with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers tongues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which when the multitude hearde, some are saide to maruaile and to be astonied, some mocked them and saide, <hi>They are full of new wine.</hi> But when <hi>Peter</hi> with greate boldenesse of spirite had in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which hee made, set the truth of God
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3573:91"/>
against their false accusations, and had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched against their sinnes, then they lefte of mocking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; were pricked in their harts. Where first we may note the power of Gods word, which onely is able to touch our consciences for sinne. For neither the diuersitie of tongues, nor other giftes of the holy Ghost coulde pricke their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eartes, as being able onely to cast them into an admiration. What more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thinge then to cause a go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly sorrow, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue our conscience pricked? What so able to pricke our conscience as the worde of GOD? Indeede many feele sorrowe and are inwardly pricked, but because therewith is not ioyned the power of Gods word, They be either senceles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e as blocks, or in their feeling they are murmurers. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto vs by the dignitie of <hi>GOD</hi> his worde, in that no wonders from heauen, no miracles on earth can touch our heartes, and worke in vs any fruite without the same. For though the Lorde shoulde shewe vnto vs al the wonders from heauen, which he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the olde worlde, and on Sodome, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee shoulde lay all the plagues vpon vs, which he laide on <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and on the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> without the word of God, we should be as vnprofitable beholders, as euer were the Sodomites, &amp; should become as harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harted as euer were <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>

               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:3573:92"/>
so that no iudgement from heauen, no trouble from earth can humble vs, noe blessing from aboue, no benefite from beneath can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> profite vs, vntil the worde of GOD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, which teacheth the olde way to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it, the newe way to enter into it, and the perfecte way to continue in it. And thus much for the generall scope of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Now more particularly we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue in this first part three things. First the power of the worde to pricke our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Secondly that this pricke must not cause in vs a more rebelling againste the worde or ministers thereof: but rather a greater reuerence to them both. Thirdly such prickes must prepare vs to a greater desire to profit. For the first wee must knowe, that this is the beginning of repentance, and this is the ente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie to godlines, euen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a sorrow for our sinnes, and so bee wounded with a feeling of our euils. For as long as men are secure, it is not possible, that they should seriously apply their minde vnto doctrine, neither without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and feeling of our sinnes can wee hartily longe for Christ. To this agree the lawe, the Prophets, and the Apostles. The lawe, because in all their sacrifices, wherein Christ was prefigured, was manifested also vnder darke signes, the contrition of hart, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3573:92"/>
acknowledging their vnworthinesse. The Prophets as <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Esay. Dauid</hi> in the fourth psalme and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That wee may then tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine our selues, wee must feare and humble our selues, because before trouble, terrour, and quaking at the iudgementes of GOD, we will neuer be brought to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our selues to Christ alone. In the <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Vers.</hi> 18.19. the Prophet like wise sheweth, that no sacrifice is acceptable to God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a contrite heart, that is, neither prayer, neither almes-giuing, neitheir praise or thanksgiuing, vnlesse we bringing an humble and contrite spirit with vs, cast our selues downe before his iudgement seate, and sue for mercy in Christ. And here marke, that he saith, <hi>the sacrifices of God, are a troubled spirit &amp;c.</hi> where he vsing the plurall number sheweth, that the sacrifices of repentance, which must not be one, but many, are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of spirite and contrition of hearte. For the affliction of the soule &amp; contrition of the minde, doe so cast vs downe, wounded with our sinnes &amp; humbled with a feeling of Gods wrath, as that it maketh vs to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that we are nothing of our selues, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3573:93"/>
to seeke for our saluation wholly at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God. Noe maruaile then, if by this means we being confounded and ashamed of our selues, and staying our selues on the only promises of God, doe confesse our owne nakednes and wreatchednes, why the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet should say, that the Lord is pleased with this sacrifice as with the sacrifice of sacrifices. The Prophet <hi>Esai. cap</hi> 40. <hi>V.</hi> 6.7.8. saith.<note place="margin">Esa. 40.6.7 8.</note> 
               <hi>All flesh is grasse, &amp; the beautie therof as the flower of grasse, the grasse withereth, &amp; the flower fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, when the breath of the Lord falleth vpon it.</hi> where the Prophet painting out man in his proper couliers, and driuing him to seeke our saluation not in himselfe but in Christ, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth the outward part of man to be as grasse and by the flower of grasse, he sheweth his gifts of minde being vnregenerate, as wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e memorie, knowledge, and vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding. So that, when Gods spirit doth but breath on vs, all our wisdome, all our knowledge, riches, and authoritie fall before the presence of the Lord of hosts, neither can we remaine, but only by the word of God, whereby wee are borne againe.

Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32. our Sauiour Christ preferreth the harlotts &amp; Publicans before the Pharises, for they being pricked for their sins &amp; conuicted, did sorrow, &amp; heard <hi>Iohn</hi> preaching vnto them.

               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:3573:95"/>Wherefore wee may see by this, which hath beene spoken, that the word of God onely pricketh our consciences, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may here appeare by the Iewes, who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not for the Apostles nor made any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, vntill their hearts were pricked. In the second place we must note, that they were rightly pricked. For many often times are pricked, which kicke against the pricke, and hauing their consciences galled by the word, they murmur eyther against the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the word, or against the word itselfe. Here then is the difference betweene the godly and the wicked, the one is pricked and is made more carefull in a godly consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the other more hardened then before. But this is a godly sorrowe, when we loue the man, that rebuketh vs, and reuerence the word the more being by it reprooued in our conscience. Doe we loue him then that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh vs? then we heare profitably. Let vs examine our selues in this sort: I see God hath wounded me by him, he is the instrument, whereby God doth humble me, I will ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loue him. Contrary if we be often tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched &amp; amende not, we are in danger of Gods wrath. Many indeed are pricked, with pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, many with sicknes, &amp; some with other like afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but few with their sins, which is the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3573:95"/>
cause of their pouerty, sicknes, and other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Let vs then learne a willingnesse to offer our selues to be taught and to be pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for sinne, as these men were. The wicked also are pricked somtimes for sinne: but it is rather for feare of punishment, then for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to displease God, as were <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Iudas.</hi> Some men are pricked, and to put away their sorrow, they will goe sleepe, they will go play, they will goe sport, they wil get to merie company, and passe away the time, and so, as they terme it, they will purge &amp; driue away the rage of melancholy, they neuer goe to any Preacher, to aske of the Lord, or at the mouth of his spirite. They neuer respect to prayer, nor seeke any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte in the word of GOD. But to put away sorrow on this sort is to call it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and to feele it more freshly either in the hower of death, or in hell. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise if our sorrow doth driue vs to praier or to the worde of God, it is good. As for the wicked and prophaine worldlinges, though as the wise man saith, <hi>Ecclesiact.</hi> 11. hee spende all his daies without any euill, yet his darknes wilbe greater then the light, his sorrowe greater then his pleasure, his losse greater then his gaine, his trouble greater then his vanitie, in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3573:96"/>
hell. Let vs not then so carnally shake off this godly sorrow, For the worde will send vs often an vnquiet spirite, that wee may seeke to be quiet in Christ. To examine our selues herein. Haue wee heard the worde of God? were we pricked by it? then haue wee profited, haue we not been pricked thereby? then as yet are we not a sacrifice for the Lord. For, as was saide before, Christ comforteth them that are troubled, he helpeth them that doubt, he caseth them, which are in distresse, he setteth their feete in the way of peace and gladnes, that haue long beene in darkenes and sorrow. Haue ye not beene sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, &amp; will ye learne a salue for this sore? be sorrowfull, that ye were not sorrowfull, be pricked in your hearts, because you were not more pricked. Haue we heard the word? Let vs examin our selues? if our knowledge be the beter; If our affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be the holier; As hauing heard the expositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the law of God; do we feare God? do we know how to loue God? do we pray to God? do we worship God in our soules, &amp; in our bodies more carfully &amp; in grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue don hertofore? Are we not now as profaine &amp; carelesse stil in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the right worship to the true God, as before we were to superstitious, in seruing An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels, Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; other false Gods; nether sorrowing for our idolatry, nor careing for true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? haue we not blasphemed, &amp; profaned the name

of god in vnreuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hearing his word, in vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable talking of his works &amp; abusing his owne maiesty with swearing and cursing as much as we euer did before? Haue we kept holie the saboth? or haue we not prophaned it, by open neglect of the worde, by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sporting, drinking, and other vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doe we not still send forth our seruantes to dispatch our busines on that day, as if it were the market day, when they may do such thinges most lawfully? Are not parentes, hous-holders, and gouernours, as slacke in prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king obedience; and children, seruantes and subiectes, as flow in yeelding obedience as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they were? parents in the meane time, not seeing that children therefore rebell against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because they rebell against God; nor hous-holders perceiue that seruants doe not their dueties to them, because they doe not their duety to God? Are we lesse wrathfull, and more mercifull? are we lesse riotous, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy defilers of our flesh? and are we more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, chast, and holy? are we lesse giuen to oppression, to hard dealing one with another, and more iust, righteous, and carefull to maintaine the good estate of our brethren? Are we not backbiters, slaunderers, or sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of discord, causers of contention <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3573:97"/>
our brethren? The cause, why we cannot see further into these things, is because we flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our selues, and because we compaire our selues with our selues &amp; with others, but not with the rule of Gods word. Let vs then learne to accuse our selues and to iudge our owne consciences. For if God see vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne ourselues, he will not condemne vs, if we accuse our selues, God will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Sathan to accuse vs, if we iudge our selues, God will acquite vs from the fearefull iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, if we be displeased for our sins, God will be pleased in Christ his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. On the contrary, whilest we lie in our sinnes, we lie in our owne blood, if we iudge not our selues, God will both iudge vs, and be reuenged of our sinne, he wil set our house on fire, he will send enemies, he will sende earthquakes, he will sende famines to make vs to consume our goods, he will make friends foes, he will sende sicknes and sorenes vpon our bodies, &amp; a troubled spirit into our soules, he will send vs an ill name, thus will he bring plague vpon plague vntill we repent, &amp; come to a feeling of our sinnes. And why doth God all this? because we wil not come to iudge our selues. For this cause, saith the Apostle. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. that is, because we iudge not our selues many are weake, &amp; sicke among you, &amp; many sleepe. 31. for if we would iudge our selues, we
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3573:97"/>
should not be iudged, 32. but when we are iudged, we are chastined of the Lord, that we shoulde not be condemned with the worlde. Likewise the Prophet <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. &amp; 30.31.32.33. But if his children forsake my lawe, and walke not in my iudgments, if they breake my sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and keepe not my commandementes. Then will I visite their transgression with the sword, and their iniquitie with strokes, yet my louing kindnes will I not take from him, neyther will I falsifie my trueth. For as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther withdraweth from his child sometimes his loue, &amp; whippeth him with the rod of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, so the Lord dealeth often with his children &amp; scourgeth their naked conscience. God doth iudge his here, but his enemies will he iudge in the world to come, if we be not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished here, the punishment wil be as a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt in the day of iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Hast thou bene afflicted, &amp; not profited? will not a litle crosse serue thee? a greater shall come to thee, will not a few troubles turne thee to God, then many shall come vpon thee? If a man be not troubled for sin here, it is the way to hell, if he be troubled here, it is the way to heauen. And as they which haue not bene troubled, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had a little ioy shall haue eternall paine, so they which here haue had a little paine, shall after haue euerlasting ioye. They that are corrected and haue profited by it,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3573:98"/>
are afflicted of the Lord in mercy, but they that be vexed and amende not, receiue a token of Gods further wrath. Wherefore we must not looke to feele comforte in the remission of sinnes, vnlesse we also haue sorrowe for committing our sinnes. For neuer any of gods children were comforted throughly, but they were first humbled for their sinne lawfully. To the working of which humiliation, wee must remember Gods iudgements shewed on others: hath God destroyed the whole world for sinne, and can he not, or will he not destroy thee for sinne? hath he ouerthrowen whole nations, and will he suffer thee to lie still in thy sinnes? See how full Hell is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and yet daily we runne headlong thither. Consider also, how great thy sinne was, that could not be cleansed but by the bloode of Iesus Christ; Oh how soule was that sinne, that nothing else could wash it, but Christ his hart blood? oh how great was our guiltines, that were ransomed by such a price? How greate was the sore, that needed such a salue? howe deepe was the wound, that needed such a medicine? O louing kindnes, and vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loue towards vs! Shall Christ be slaine for our sinnes, and we not slaye sinne in our selues? Shall Christ die for our sinnes, and sinne as yet is not dead in vs? Shall Christ be crucified for vs, and will we not crucifie sinne
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3573:98"/>
in our selues? Shall Christ haue his hearte pricked with a speare, and shall not we haue our harts pricked with sorrow? This is the true vse and meditating of Christ his passion. We are wont to defy the Iewes for accusing Christ, we spit at <hi>Iudas</hi> for betraying Christ, and we condemne <hi>Pilate</hi> for condemning Christ, but we are much more to be at defiance with our sinnes, which accused him before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of God, we are to accuse our selues, who haue and daily doe, betray him; we must condemne our selues, whose sinnes haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him. But if neither the iudgements of God, hell, nor the crosse of Christ can moue vs, then let vs examine our selues how we can reioyce in Christ.</p>
            <p>It followeth to speake of the counsell of <hi>Peter,</hi> Repent, as if he should say. I know your heartes are pricked, how be it I will shewe you, how it is the pollicy of the Diuell, to make these good motions quickly to waxe dry in you, he will stay you from perseuering, you must therfore endeuoure to continue in this godly sorrow. The Apostle saw, that this sorrow, which as <hi>Paule</hi> witnesseth is not to be repented of, was well begunne in them, but in continuing his sermon still to that effect, he sheweth that our sorrow must be also conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall. Many sorrow, as hath beene shewed, but in a worldly sorrowing, which bringeth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3573:99"/>
eternal death, not in a godly griefe which brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth repentance. Wherfore we are to note that repentance beginneth in vs, continueth and endeth with sorrow. Now, if it might be, it were expedient to shew what repentance is. In one word, Repentance is not a bare lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of sinne, but an vtter condemning and misliking of that sinne, which we haue left. For though we haue left it, yet Sathan may make vs to sorrow for it many yeares after, yea euen at the point of death. '<hi>Dauid</hi> had left his sinne, but it caused him to sorrow an whole yeare after. <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken and almost forgotten their sinne, yet it troubled them and grieued them thirteene yeares after. Our pricking of heart therfore must be continued and daily renued. This repentance is figured in baptisme, both in that we must die to sin, and bury it, and also that we must rise againe to newnes of life, for a man cannot die to sin but by the vertue of Christ his death, neyther can he rise to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes without the power of his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now we must know that as our sinnes are forgiuen, so we must also receiue Gods spirit. If God promiseth mercy to our children much more to vs, if we beleue and receiue his promises, if to them, which are a farre of, much more to them that are neare. And yet though we haue been baptised an hundred yeares, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3573:99"/>
haue not receiued the holy Ghost: we may die in our sinnes. Some vnderstand by the gift of the holy Ghost the graces of God bestowed on the Apostles, but in my iudgement, their opinion is not sound, because, that was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing giuen only to them of that time, this promise is generall and respectes all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terities. We are then to note, that repentance is a continuall course of sorrowe, and if we haue this in trueth, then may we boldly seeke for comfort out of Gods wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore as it is requisite continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to till the ground, if we will haue fruite, and daily to eate, if we will liue: so in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, we must be humbled with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall sorrow, that we may be refreshed with daily comfort in Christ, in whose name let vs pray.

Wee must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so pray, that the Lord giue not out that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of leaue to the diuell, which we giue out to sinne, to worke rebellion in vs against his maiesty; but that he would rather make Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than a Surgeon to shew vs our sinnes, then a Sregeant to confound vs for our sinnes. It is the pollicie of the aduersary, to perswade many, that the weaknes of their body, and feeblenes of their braine proceedeth of their temptations, when indeed it commeth of the vnstaidnes of their mindes, wandering too much after the motions of the diuell; in that they not resting on the word, nor depending on Christ, nor contenting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting themselues by meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to much, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>for to often with the diuels

The roote of this worldly shame, is pride and hautinesse of minde, which is a priuie euill, and hardly will be beaten into the head of them that are infected therwith. But sure it is, that we wold neuer be so grieued for the losse of a thing, if we did not too much desire it, and too immoderately vse it, whilst wee had it. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12:42. Which sinne of haughtines, the Lord seeing in his children, that they are more humbled, with the losse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of worldly credit, then with the sence of their sinnes, and the losse of their glory; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore this is the best remedie, rather to be grieued that we feele not our sinnes to be pardoned with God, then that we are knowne to be sinners amongst men, and that we be ready to shame our selues that God may haue the glory; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging shame, and confusion, and the whole hell of temptations to be due vnto vs; and glory, praise &amp; compassion, to be only the Lords. For this is a speciall marke of the child of God, by temptations rightly humbled,

For if we lightly account of sinne, he bleares our eyes still with Gods mercies; if we beginne to make a conscience of sinne, he loadeth vs with the iudgements of God; being as ready now to aggrauate the sinne, more then it is in it selfe, as before he woulde extenuate it to make it seeme lesse then it was. Howbeit, said he to the man thus afflicted; I will saye vnto you as <hi>Samuel</hi> saide to the people after they had confessed themselues to haue sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God with a great sinne: True it is, said <hi>Samuel,</hi> not flattering them in their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Ye haue sinned greatly: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if ye will feare the Lord, and serue him, and heare his voice, and not disobey the word, of the Lorde ye shall follow the Lord your God.

So I will not lessen your sine, but I say, you haue sinned with a great sinnne before the Lord, in that you made a mocke of the worde which you knew; yet if you turne to the Lord in feare and serue him, your sinne is remissible, howsoeuer Sathan char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

Some sins are against knowledge, but of humane frailty; some are against know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a rebellious obstinacy. These last are the persecutions of the spirit of God, as he is the power of God; Those first are not so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely against the holy ghost, but against God the Father, the Sonne, &amp; the holy Ghost, the one which may be repented of is remissible, the other which is without repentance is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missible, wherfore in that you quake, and are affraid least this sin be in you, &amp; would reioice in God, if it were not in you: If you purpose to leaue your former sins, &amp; in trueth hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth turne vnto the Lord, I dare assure you, that as yet you are free from this sinne.</p>
