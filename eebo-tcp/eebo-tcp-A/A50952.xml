         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But considering that whatever their proceedings, previous to their obteining the Goverment, might be, that, when obtein'd, the support thereof obliged them to consult the inclinations of the people, and square their actions by the most honourable of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: I adventured, and in their peruseall found the true Spirit of the English Nation soe livelyly displayed, that I was not onely glad I was swayed to their reading, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved for the comon benefit of my Country, to translate them into English; that they might see how Zealous our predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors have been in ascertaining and maintaining the liberty &amp; property both of the Civill, and religious Rights, not onely of themselves, but also their Allies &amp; Confederates, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever invaded, though by the most potent of their Enemies.

And in what degree of honour our Nation must then have stood, when their Resolutions were a Ballance to the actions of Europe?

                  <p>WHEN we were, not without great Clamour, made acquainted with the stealth of <hi>Jeane Puccheringam</hi> a maiden Gentlewoman of good extraction, plentifull fortune, and an heiresse, who yet under age, and consequently the care of a Guardian, has been seised upon, not far from the place of her habitation at Greenwich, forced on board a vessell ready at hand for that purpose, and suddainly hurried away out of the hands and embraces of her friends, by the contrivance of one <hi>Walsh,</hi> who since used indirect meanes; such as the Terrour of death &amp;c. to freight the wealthy girle into a marriage with hm; We did immediatly thereupon, previous to the stopping the successe of a villany fo cruel &amp; un heard of, direct some persons to apply to the Governours of <hi>Newport</hi> &amp; <hi>Oostend</hi> (to one of which two places shee was reported to have been Snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) on behalfe of her freedome out of the hands of her Ravishers, who both acted suitable to persons of singular integrity, &amp; upright dealings to wards the reliefe of the poor captive thus felloniously hurried from home; But shees, to escape (in the mean time) the violence of these vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans, retreating unto a Nunnery as a sequestred person, the said <hi>Walsh,</hi> to force her thence, brings his action at Law in the spirituall Court at <hi>Ipre</hi> where in his declaration, he lays his claine to her by Contract of Marriage. Now in regard the Thiefe, and the Heiresse are both our people, and that it, by good evidence, appeares, that this outrage has been commmitted within our Dominion; and withall that the considerable Bait, being the Estate, which he mainly and originally gaped at, lies under our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction; as also that the cognisance of the whole cause, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it's Judgment does in our opinion, properly belong to us alone; Let him repair hither with his claime, let him comence his Suit here, and make out the right he pretends unto her being his wife. This brings your Excellency in the mean time, an earnest Repetittion of what has been already very often pressed by our Envoy at Brussells, that the afflicted and forlorn maiden, the honesty of her exactation, the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitious method wherein shee was conveyed from out of her Country by theft, be prevalent Inducements to you to take care of her being in safety permitted to repaire home.

Nor has our fleet gone to the River <hi>Tagus</hi> upon any other different Errand, then barely to chastise our Enemies, (who will not be warned by the many Flights, which we so often already instructed them with the experience of) and rescue such effects of ours, as, being by force and Treachery taken away from our people, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain of these Reb Ils has carryed into your Ports and especially <hi>Lisbone</hi> it selfe, where they vend the proceed of their theft at open sale.

to disappont the said Designe, by recommending them to the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Governour there: The Council of State has judgedit becoming her duty and office to observe unto Your Highnesse how gratefully that kindnesse and protection so seasonably and curteously done the English Merchants, is accepted of by the Republick of <hi>England;</hi> promising and engageing unto Your Highnesse that the Memory of this good turne has made such an impression, as is never to be forgot, and their Readinesse to improve all opportunities that may offer of effectually returning Your People the like frindship and office and performing all other things that may conduce to the support of the usual benevolence and commerce of this, and Your Nation. And whereas the Dutch Fleet have, even while conferences of their owne dictation concerning an alliance were under debate; made perfidious attempts upon ours, and that not onely in our owne harbours even (in which wicked attempt God, as a most just Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator, prevented their wickedness) but in forreign Ones also, where they would take, or sinke our Merchant Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We have thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to transmit unto Your Highnesse this Paper on behalfe of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England;</hi> which some controversies lately arisen between this Government and <hi>Holland;</hi> have occasioned the sending of.

The which, the Council of State has in the Name, and by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Parliament so often demonstrated in their written replys to Your Excellency; and particularly, in conformity to Your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies desire, has appointed a Comittee to give Your Excellency a meeting and receive such proposals as you had to offer conduceing to the aforesaid End. Which meeting afterwards has, in liew of other expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, produced some things Consisting in general Tearmes, and as it were, previous to a future conference, which the Council believed the Parliament had in former replies made plaine its opinion concerning: Yet to give further satisfaction, and to remove any doubt which Your Excellency may pretend to remaine under, concerning the particular Instances of the Overtures you then made, the Councils Reply of the 31. March or 10. April, shewes that when all steps necessarily previous thereto, such as what Your Excellency had to offer on behalfe of his said Royal Majesty, in reference to the sormer, as any other stricter alliance to be entered into on the one hand, as what we should exhibit on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of this Republicke, were discoursed about &amp; determined, on the other hand, yea when all things were truely debated as they ought to be, and that Your Excellency came to confer accordingly, they were ready: To which Your Excellency made no reply, nor proceeded further in the matter these almost two months past. And Your Excellencie's of the 27. May or 6. June 52. is the first that the Council heard of since that time, which seemes to signify no more then to desire that the Articles of peace and alliance entered into by <hi>Charles</hi> the late King, and your Master, dated the 6. or 16. of November 1630. might be reviewed, and such alterations made in the heads thereof in reference to an addition to, or diminution therefrom, as the frame of the government and time now alter'd should call for; which as it amounted to no more, then what we, in our aforesaid Reply of the 10.

In which case the Councill

                  <p>As to the proofe of the propriety of such shipps, or Goods, as shall, by shipwrack, happen to be driven on shore: it is the opinion of the Councill that, in such cases, Oath be taken in such Courts as either already are, or hereafter may be erected for the hearing and determining such Cases, where, such as may at any time lay claime to such Goods, may be distinctly heared, and every one's Right knowne and determin'd; which by paper (comonly called <hi>Certificates</hi>) cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>As to the 6.

Therefore as we our selves have not hitherto nor leaded, nor promoted in others, the violation of such friendship and Tearmes of alliances, as have formerly interceded between us, and all forreign People and Princes whatever, so your Excellency may rest assured, on behalfe of your people, as well as your owne, of all fair dealings from us, pursuant to the antient correspondence settled by your Ancestors with the English. And as we are ready to returne all due ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, for those affectionate offices already bestowed by your Highnesse upon us, soe our worke shall be to render you, and yours sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the want of none on our part: Recomending the while, as much as may be, your Excellency to the omnipotenty, and Diety of Almighty God.</p>

But the said <hi>Noel,</hi> and the rest of the Petitioners renewing their said heavy complaint, and urgeing, that although the said Duke had our said let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters delivered him, and that the said Merchants repaired since to <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> where at the Admiralty Court they made proofe of their cause and the integrity of their Claime, but that Justice is neverthelesse denyed 'em, and they exposed to so unjust use<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Your Excellency is not ignorant of its being contrary to the Laws of Nations, as well as the Tearmes of Trade and correspondence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

about it, and endeavour that speedy care be taken, that this busynesse be no longer prolonged, but that Justice be done: as that the said shipp and Goods, together with the damages, expences, and loss which the said English have susteind upon the score of that injust interception, be by the Authority of the said maritime Court of <hi>Brussels,</hi> or some other good manner, restored them, and provision made against any such fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture interception, but that the correspondence now in being betvveen England and France be supported vvithout any Interruption.</p>

                  <p>WEE are, by letters sent us from <hi>Geneva,</hi> as well as <hi>Delphin,</hi> and many other places bordering upon your Confines, informed of a proclamation lately published by your Royall Highnesse, implying that if such of your Subjects, as were Professors of the Protestant Religion, did not, within three dayes after the publication thereof, either declare their renunciation of their owne, and acceptance of the Popish Religion they were strictly charged to forsake their Lands and habitations, within twenty days after upon paine of forfeiting their lives and fortunes: And that haveing thereupon made humble supplication to your Royall High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, praying that the same might be repealed, and that they, (taken into former favour) migt be restored to the Priviledges granted 'em by your most <hi>Serene Predecessors;</hi> yet they were sett upon by part of your Army, who cruelly murthered many, chain'd others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and drove the rest into wildernesses, and uninhabited mountaines covered with Snow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, where hundreds of Familys are reduced to that extremity, that it is much to be fear'd whether their misery may not be such, as may soone draw utter Ruine upon them, under the oppression of Cowld and hunger. Upon our Receipt of this account, we coud not truly decline our being troubled at hart, at so unhear'd of a calamity imposed upon these most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted people. But as we owne our selves united to them, not onely as men, but (in communion of Religion) altogether related as Brethren also. We judged our selves imperfect in the discharge of our duty to God, the charity due to our Brethren, and our profession to Religion it selfe, did we barely pity this calamity and misery of our Brethren, without apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the further endeavour we cou'd, towards the meeting 'em with Reliefe against so many unexpected mischiefs. Wee do therefore, in the first place pray and beseech your <hi>Royal Highness</hi> with all imaginable earnestnesse, to incline your heart to the continueing to your Subjects

And as your Royal Highnesse in all other things bravely and gloriously accomplished, has pursued directly the paterne of your Forefathers, so we do again and again beseech, that you woud not begin to act the contrary in this; but that this proclamation, and if their be any other demand made use of, to interrupt your Subjects, upon the score of their professing the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> be abolished; they restored to their native Country and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations; their former Rights and libortys ratified unto 'em; their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain'd damages repaired; and that you cause all their vexations to be drawen to an end.

And are very apt to believe that Your Highnesse could not decline being much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased at so great a cruelty, when first you heard it, (which I presume may be some time past,) and that you did what you could towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe

For we that are but One (as it were) in point of Religion, why should not we be equally such in our concernednesse at so unworthy a misuseage of our Brethren? And truly many are the experiences of your apparent piety to the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox people in times of oppression, and no lesse favourable to many Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall difficultys and adversitys, As for my part, I had, (if I know my owne mind,) rather been outon in any thing elce, then in love and charity to Brethren labouring under affliction and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon the account of their Religion: For that I would freely give way to the health &amp; repose of the Church, in preferrence to my owne par ticular safety. What we coud therefore hitherto act in it, was to writ to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> almost humbly praying him to entertain milder thoughts and disposition towards these his most inocent subjects and humble people; that he woud restore the wretches to their homes and Estates, and put them in possession of their former liberty of Religion. We did the like to the chiefest of the Protestant Princes and Magistrates, whom we judged it most concerning, to joine with us in our Mediation with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> on behalfe of this people. You have done the same perhaps &amp; more. For if this so dangerous example succeeds with the Instruments concerned, and this Revivall of their late cruelty upon the Protestants thrives with them, to admonish your prudence how farr the same may endanger the Protestant Intrest, is a thing we judge uunecessary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this person, if he suffers himselfe to be perswaded by our united im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitys and prevailed with to give over, we shall reape a Noble and plentifull crop, and Recompence from our susteind care; But if we shoud find him wilfull so as to endeavour to bring into utter dispair, or destroy totally those, who with their owne strength, and (free from corruption,) have either preserved our Religion delivered by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall Preachers of the Gospell, or long before it was restored to its primitive purity in all other Nations, Wee are ready to joine with you and the rest of our Reformed Brethren and confederates, in a comon Councill, whereby the support of the sincking just, may be, with most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency

And truly this anxiety made the deeper figure in our minds, and continues to gaine daily, from some sparkes of Jealousy, which seem to remain unquelled between Your Majesty and the King of <hi>Sweedland;</hi> or at last from your being at greater distance in your minds, then our comon love and affection to the Orthodox Religion seemes to call for; whilest your Majesty entertains (by what fate I know not) a Jealousy that the Trade of your Kingdome may receive some prejudice from the King of <hi>Sweedland;</hi> who is likewise little better satisfied, but

that you may aggravat the warr, wherein he is now engaged, and render the Termes of peace, which he might otherwise make, more intricat. Your Majesty canot but, from that great prudence exerted in all your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, know, how much it will expose the protestant Religion, if such suspition continues long among you, and how much more, if, (which God forbidd) any token of hostility shoud breake out.

For what Letters ought I to entertaine with more regard, then such as come from a most vertuous Prince, and related to a Race suitably Religious, and which concerne nothing so much, as the Repose of Religion, and the reconcileing of Curches to concord; and which also, not onely in your, but in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and judgment of the Christian world, ought to be generally attributed unto me as an honour to be the promoter of the Christian peace? And truly what we have endeavoured'd towards it, thro these three (former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) Kingdomes, what have we accomplished (thro divine help) by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deing, suffering, and conquest; is a thing not unknowne to most of our owne people, and that which they are very sensible of in the great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of their conscience. We have studyed the repose of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, thro out <hi>Germany</hi> more especially, where they have been most, and longest at variance; and have been, for a considerable time past, wanting in nothi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
