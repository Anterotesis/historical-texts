            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A VINDICATION Of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Alexander Osborn,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Design of this Paper is to rescue the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a very worthy and pious <hi>Divine</hi> from one of the blackest Aspersions that could have been cast upon him. And tho' the regard which is due to the deserved esteem of every good man, much more one of that Sacred Profession, set so just and so charitable an Undertaking above the need of any Apology for it, yet our present Circumstances oblige me to premise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for obviating any ill constructions that may be made of it. As it was a great surprize to Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so strangely misrepresented in Papers Printed at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> where so many Persons of Quality then resided, who not only knew his Innocency, but had been pleas'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his good Service: So it was no less trouble to him that some of those Papers wherein he was chiefly wrong'd, bore the venerable Name of a Person whom he so highly esteem'd on the account of his being active in the same Excellent Cause wherein he had Embarqu't him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He is extremely sorry that his own defence lays such an unhappy necessity upon him, to expose any mistake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66153:3"/>
him in the Printed <hi>Account of the Siege of DERRY,</hi> or those added to it in the <hi>Vindication</hi> of that <hi>Account.</hi> But he hopes none that would not themselves be thought partial and unrighteous Judges of things, will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret his care of his own good Name as any envious design to lessen the Reputation of the <hi>Reverend Mr. George Walker.</hi> For that deserving Gentleman may still enioy all the Honour due to his Eminent Service, to the Interest of Their Majesties and the Protestant Religion; tho' the world be undeceiv'd in that ill Opinion of Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> which he has unhappily led 'em into, as if he had done his utmost to undermine it. The asserting Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Integrity and Prudence in managing those Affairs which the Advice of his Friends, and his Zeal for the publick good had involved him in, will be no Impeachment to Mr. <hi>W</hi>—'s care and fidelity in overseeing the Stores, and distributing the Provisions of <hi>DERRY.</hi> Nay, he hopes this Vindication cannot be displeasing to Mr. <hi>W</hi>— him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who at length has ingenuously profest his readiness <hi>to give him all opportunity of justifying himself, and to make him all imaginable satisfaction if he has done him wrong.</hi> He owns this offer to be very fair and candid; only he could have wisht that Mr. <hi>W</hi>— (when he was by a private Letter admonisht of his mistake, and had so much leisure and opportunity to inform himself better) had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time excus'd him from this unwelcom Task by that ingenuous Retractation, which he was with all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and respect sollicited to. The Plaister would have been acceptable from that hand that first gave the wound; and therefore he can scarce forbear taking it a little unkindly to receive from the same hand a second <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> without the least provocation. He is sorry Mr. <hi>W</hi>— should think himself so far interested in his first Errour, as to run into new ones to support the Credit of it, and yet deliver 'em with such an Air of Assurance, as must needs rivet his Readers in the belief of 'em, if they be not undeceiv'd. For after so kind a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as that foremention'd, he is yet pleas'd to conclude
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66153:3"/>
that part of his Vindication, which concerns Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> with these words <hi>[Though he</hi> (i. e. <hi>Mr.</hi> W—) <hi>thinks it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseable they should not put him on justifying himself any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that particular.]</hi> And besides him, that Credulous Gentleman, that Writes the Observations on Mr. <hi>W</hi>—'s Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, intends (it seems) to affright Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> from any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to wipe off this dirt, by more he has yet in reserve to throw upon him. For he talks of no less than more <hi>Demonstrative Proofs,</hi> that may possibly be ready to be produced, if Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> complain of any injury done to him. This were almost enough to perswade a Man out of the belief of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, if a good Conscience were not Armour of Proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the most confident mistakes. But sure all this is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to shew the reasonableness and necessity of Mr. <hi>Osb</hi>'s appearing at last to clear himself. For to have continued silent any longer under a charge as perfectly groundless as 'tis extreamely odious, and this so often renew'd, would justly be thought <hi>Stupidity</hi> rather than <hi>Patience;</hi> and he would not deserve that good Reputation he has formerly had, shou'd he now so wilfully <hi>throw</hi> it away.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore in order to the clearer Vindication of Mr. <hi>Osb. First,</hi> Consider the <hi>Charge</hi> brought against him in the <hi>Account of the Seige of</hi> Derry, and what is said to Establish the Credibility of it, both in the <hi>Observations</hi> on it, and Mr. <hi>W</hi>—'s own <hi>Vindication</hi> of it; and then give so satisfactory an Account of Mr. <hi>Osb</hi>'s Proceedings in those Affairs, as is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to convince these Gentlemen themselves, how injurious a Character they have given of him.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Charge</hi> brought against him in the <hi>Account of the Seige of</hi> Derry; 'tis this, <hi>That he was a Spie upon the whole North of</hi> Ireland <hi>imployed by the Lord</hi> Tyrconnel. A Crime so much the more detestable in him if true; not only as it would argue him persidious to the Protestant Interest in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but particularly to that great Trust which his Friends
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66153:4"/>
in the <hi>North</hi> had repos'd in him: So that by this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter all Men must account him one of the worst of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains.</hi> One wou'd think then there were some clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his keeping up some secret Correspondence with the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> some <hi>Letters Intercepted</hi> or <hi>Discover'd,</hi> in which he had given him dangerous Intelligence and Advices, how he might most effectually ruine those Designs that were forming in the <hi>North.</hi> But 'tis strange, that neither in the <hi>Account</hi> it self, nor in the <hi>Vindication</hi> of it, is there one Syllable produced to this purpose. But least I should be thought to misrepresent these two <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as they have done Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> I shall give the Reader their own Words. In the <hi>Observation</hi> on Mr. <hi>W</hi>—'s Narrative, <hi>Page</hi> 7. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thus speaks.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>I desire</hi> every Man who is not byass'd by prejudice and pre-possession quietly to consider, Whether Mr. <hi>W</hi>— (pen'd up within the Walls of <hi>Derry,</hi> depriv'd of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and Intelligence both of publick Affairs and the Actions of private Men, seeing a Letter from a Person generally known, and an Eminent Leader of a Party, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering an Admission into the presence of the Popish Lord Deputy, (the great Engine and Operator in the ruine of <hi>Ireland)</hi> an Intimacy with him, and a Trust and Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion deriv'd from him, whereby he was directed to cajole the poor distracted and disanimated Protestants with the Terror of Conquest and Military Execution on the one side in case of Opposition; and the delusion of hope to be secure under a Protection, in case of submission, and a tame surrender of their Arms and Horses; I say whether Mr. <hi>W</hi>— perusing this ambiguous Letter, and observing the pernicious Effects of it, upon the generality of the People in <hi>Ulster,</hi> especially those of the Writers persuasion, whereby they were influenc'd to a fatal and stupid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, (As if the Doctrine of Non-resistance and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Obedience may be taught on fit Occasions, even
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66153:4"/>
by such as dissent from the Church of <hi>England)</hi> had not reason to suspect his candour, and become very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive too, and jealous of his integrity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A Paragraph unmercifully long, but very easily pardonable if that were the worst fault of it.</p>
            <p>To the same purpose Mr. <hi>W</hi>— in his <hi>Vindic.</hi> p. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> Mr. <hi>W</hi>— is concern'd he had occasion to name any to their disadvantage, but he did it with that notion he had of him in the Garrison, and those of his own Profession there, and thought it wou'd on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count give the less offence, but he cou'd not easily forget the effects of his Letter which Mr. <hi>W</hi>— had shar'd in to his sorrow— And Mr. <hi>W</hi>— adds further, he has heard of the Gentleman's good Intentions in his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; Mr. <hi>W</hi>— is sorry they were no better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that he might clear him from the imputation of those mischiefs which his Management and Advices brought on that part of the Kingdom. But 'tis hard to serve two such Masters, the <hi>British</hi> and the <hi>Irish.</hi> If he was not more industrious and serious, Mr. <hi>W</hi>— is too sure he was more successful in his service to the latter by his Impression, not only on the meaner sort, but on some of the best Quality.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In which words here is something said to render the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter Mr. <hi>W</hi>— had receiv'd by report concerning Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> highly probable, and something to apologize for Mr. <hi>W</hi>—'s Publishing it on the Account of its Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>What is said to render this Character, Mr. <hi>W</hi>— had received by report concerning Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> probable, does part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend on what is contain'd in the <hi>Letter</hi> it self, partly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66153:5"/>
on the <hi>Effects</hi> which this Letter is said to have produc'd, and partly on the <hi>Impression</hi> which Mr. <hi>Osb</hi>'s <hi>Advices,</hi> as well as <hi>Letter</hi> are suppos'd to have made, not only on the <hi>People,</hi> but on some of the <hi>best Quality</hi> in the <hi>North.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if there be nothing in the <hi>Letter</hi> it self to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance this Charge of his being the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Spye; If no such <hi>Effects</hi> as those mention'd can with any <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Justice</hi> be imputed to the <hi>Letter;</hi> If Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> gave no <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> that any way serv'd the Interest of the <hi>Irish,</hi> nor ever perswaded either the <hi>People</hi> or any <hi>Persons of Quality</hi> to a compliance with the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Offers, but the quite contrary; then all the grounds hitherto alledg'd to favour this report, are but like it self, new mistakes superadded to the first.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in the <hi>Letter</hi> it self to justifie this <hi>Charge.</hi> Mr. <hi>Osb</hi>'s being once introduc'd into my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, is no Evidence of any such intimacy with him (as the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Observations</hi> vainly imagines) that he shou'd meerly on that score be thought one of his great <hi>Confidents.</hi> For as he never spoke with him but once about that affair, so he never before nor after either spoke with, or receiv'd any Message from him, or any employ'd by him. And I wonder where that Gentlemen's eyes were, when he saith the Letter discovers a <hi>Trust and Commission which Mr.</hi> Osb. <hi>deriv'd from him,</hi> when the contrary is suggested in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Letter</hi> it self; and indeed the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> disown'd with some contempt the sending any <hi>Commissioner</hi> to 'em. And sure Mr. <hi>Osb</hi>'s acquainting those Gentlemen in the <hi>North</hi> with what he had heard from the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s own mouth, and had his <hi>Permission</hi> to relate concerning his resolutions of sending an Army thither, can by no Man of sense be thought a proof of his keeping up a treacherous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence with him in order to ther ruine.</p>

To give this the force of so much as a probable Argument: It must be made appear also that Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> made use of that message he brought to move those of the <hi>North</hi> to accept of the terms offer'd 'em by the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel;</hi> which if these Gentlemen can prove, <hi>Mr. Osb.</hi> is content they shall call him what they please. But as he never promis'd any such thing to the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> himself, so much less did he ever go about it. How earnestly he endeavour'd the contrary, will afterwards appear.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Letter</hi> alone has nothing in it to prove this <hi>Charge,</hi> so the <hi>dismal effects</hi> mention'd can with no Truth or Justice be imputed to it, or the <hi>Writer</hi> of it; Such as the <hi>fatal and stupid compliance of the People of Ulster,</hi> as the <hi>Observator</hi> speaks; or the <hi>mischiefs which befel that part of the Kingdom,</hi> as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> expresses it. As the Letter barely relates the Lord <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel</hi>'s discourse to the <hi>Writer,</hi> without the least mention of his own Judgment or Advice; so it was written to none, but such as were Members of the <hi>Consult,</hi> and with no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign than to draw 'em together to take such speedy and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual measures, as the sense of their imminent danger, and the consideration of their common Interest should suggest to 'em. And 'tis certain, that Letter cannot be said to influence those to whom it was written, to any such stupid compliance with the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s offers; when not only upon their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Writer</hi> dissuaded 'em from it, but the <hi>Consult</hi> according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected those very offers in the <hi>Answer,</hi> which they order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to send back. And the <hi>Consult</hi> were so far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending any such tendency in that <hi>Letter,</hi> to discourage the People from their own defence, that they order'd <hi>Copies</hi> of it to be spread on purpose to incite 'em to it. For what cou'd more effectually do so, than a certain Account of the March of the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Army, and consequently the necessity of speedy and vigorous Preparations to oppose it? If any were so weak as to make any other use of it (as I believe none ever did) it was owing to their own Fears and Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66153:6"/>
not to the Letter it self, much less the design of the Writer, or those that order'd the dispersion of it. It was their advantage not to be perfectly surpriz'd (as otherwise they had been) for want of Intelligence; and the People had too just apprehensions of <hi>Irish</hi> Promises of Protection, to be then deluded by 'em. And therefore whereas the Author of the <hi>Observ.</hi> talks of the pernicious effects of that Letter upon the generality of the people in <hi>Ulster,</hi> especially those of Mr. <hi>Osb</hi>'s perswasion, <q>whereby they were influenc'd to a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and fatal compliance, (as if the Doctrine of Non-resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and Passive Obedience might be taught on fit occasions, even by such as Dissent from the Church of <hi>England.)</hi>
               </q> 'Tis a wonder what ill Genius cou'd hurry that Gentleman to such palpable mistakes, as none on the place cou'd well be ignorant of the falshood of. As for the generality of the people in <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> (and since he has given this occasion, I must in justice add) particularly those of Mr. <hi>Osb</hi>'s perswasion; They were so far from being inclin'd to a compliance, that they were most free and resolute for Self-defence, and cou'd scarce forbear very passionate Resentments, when they found that some of their Leaders thought their circumstances and surprize cou'd not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of it, and accordingly began to consult their own safety. And 'tis very hard to add this to all their other miseries, the upbraiding 'em so unjustly with bringing 'em upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And for Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> and his Brethren, they were so far from what this Gentleman would insinuate, <hi>viz.</hi> Preaching the Doctrine of Non-resistance and Passive Obedience in this juncture, that they undertook, with the approbation of the Consult, to exhort all their people that cou'd bear Arms to appear with 'em at the appointed place of Rendevouz. (Of which more in the following Relation.) Their Confession of Faith does indeed entirely agree with the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Doctrine of Subjection to Lawful Magistrates: But for the notion of Non-resistance (so far as it had been strain'd beyond all bounds by those who to secure their own Interest at Court had, made it the distinguishing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66153:6"/>
Character of a Party both in Church and State) as it had been an entire stranger to their Pulpits before; so it wou'd have been wonderful indeed if they had preach't it up now, when the dismal consequences of it were actually in their view. What they did in this juncture to the contrary, was consonant to those very Sentiments concerning the just mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Government and Subjection, which many of those had upbraided 'em with as Seditious, who were themselves forc'd to take Sanctuary in 'em for the defence of their own truly generous Actions in this great and happy Revolution. And whatever occasion this Gentleman has given, I shall not now take it to retort so foolish and so groundless an Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though I might do it with all possible advantage.</p>
            <p>And as those dismal effects cannot be justly imputed to Mr. <hi>Osb</hi>'s Letter, so much less (as Mr. <hi>W</hi>— now further sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests) to his Management and Advice. Though if Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> had from a real perswasion of the inability of the North, to resist the <hi>Irish</hi> Army, advis'd 'em rather to accept the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers he brought, I can by no means think this wou'd justifie his being call'd the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Spy, or accounted a Friend to the <hi>Irish.</hi> For I think he wou'd do the greatest wrong to the reputation of that great Ornament of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, the Reverend Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> who shou'd Brand him as one of the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Agents, or a Well-wisher to the <hi>Irish</hi> and Papal Interest, because he advis'd the Inhabitants of that City to open their Gates after the first shutting of 'em; chiefly, I doubt not, out of a real dread of those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal consequences he apprehended wou'd ensue on so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate an undertaking. But Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> is very far from need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Apology for himself: For that he no otherwise serv'd the <hi>Irish,</hi> than by discovering their designs, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting the most proper methods to defeat 'em; nor made any other Impression on either the People, or the Nobility and Gentry, than to encourage and animate 'em to oppose their Enemies; will be so undeniable evident by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66153:7"/>
Account, that I hope Mr. <hi>W.</hi>— himself will pass a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer Censure on his own Expressions in the Vindication it self, than Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> is willing to do, and at length begin to entertain a better Opinion of him.</p>
            <p>For what is said in the forementioned Passages by way of Apology for Mr. <hi>W</hi>—'s Publishing this report on those presumptions of its truth, which we have here examined, Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> is the less solicitous about it. Only he hopes 'tis capable of a much better Apology than that very weak and miserable one that the <hi>Observator</hi> makes, and Mr. <hi>W</hi>— him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is pleased to insist on. For sure those worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, do not intend to make the World believe, that Mr. <hi>W</hi>— publish't this mistake, <hi>When pen'd up within the Walls of</hi> Derry, <hi>and deprived of all Information there.</hi> And if Mr. <hi>W</hi>— had received this notion of Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, he might have been informed better, if he had pleased, to Consult those Persons of Quality in <hi>London,</hi> who were on the place, and knew the whole affair. Nay, he might have been undeceived by Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> himself, if he had inquired of him the truth of that report, when he waited on him in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he was as industrious to raise Mr. <hi>W</hi>—'s just Reputation, as Mr. <hi>W</hi>— seems to have been in blasting his. He thinks Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s hurry in Publishing his Account a much better excuse; but that will scarce extend to his Vindication of it.</p>

Hitherto then we are far from seeing any demonstrative Proofs of this heavy <hi>Charge,</hi> whatever hidden ones are kept in store: But to put even those out of Countenance, I need do no more than give a plain Relation of Matters of Fact, that have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Witnesses ready to attest 'em, to be outfac'd by slender Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, or the greatest Air of Assurance us'd to bear up the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of 'em.</p>
            <p>About the end of <hi>November</hi> last, 1688. a little after the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Tidings of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Landing had reach'd our Ears in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> was entrusted by his Brethren the <hi>Non-conformist Ministers,</hi> and other <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of Note and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the Province of <hi>Ulster,</hi> to get some Gentleman or other sent over from <hi>Dublin</hi> to the <hi>Prince</hi> with these following <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,</hi> signed by those two whose Names are subscrib'd in the Name of the rest.</p>

            <p>Accordingly on <hi>December</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> they sent over a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, now in Town, who in pursuance of these Instructions

deliver'd in a <hi>Memorial,</hi> enlarging on these Heads (for they begg'd no particular Favour for a Party) to the then <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange.</hi> The <hi>Originals</hi> of both which <hi>Papers</hi> are in my Hands.</p>
            <p>But besides this piece of Service which Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, he was further desir'd by his Brethren, and by other Gentlemen in the <hi>North</hi> upon his return to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to send 'em an Account from time to time, by the most prudent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods he could contrive, not only of the Success of their Message to <hi>England,</hi> but of the Designs of the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> in that Kingdom, especially what concern'd the Province of <hi>Ulster:</hi> Nor was this conceal'd from such of the Conforming <hi>Nobility, Gentry</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> as it was fit, and there was opportunity to communicate such an Affair to: And if Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, the Reason is too obvious to be mention'd. Accordingly Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> wrote many Letters, giving 'em the best Intelligence he could learn; several of 'em I have seen in <hi>Dublin,</hi> most written in a kind of Character, but two (if I misremember not) of his, written in plain English, are insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already in a Paper, call'd, <hi>An Apology for the Protestants in Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. one Dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 22.

            <p>This Trust he so faithfully discharg'd, that several of the most discerning Protestants in the North have often regretted that those Letters of his were no better improv'd, which gave 'em so fair warning to expedite their Measures, and provide against the shock they might expect, as soon as the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was in a Capacity to attacque 'em. And this is so well known, that had not Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> in this Passage oppos'd Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to that of his Brethren in <hi>Derry,</hi> I should have imagined there had been some mistake of the Printer, and Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> had intended to say, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Osborn <hi>was a Spye for the whole North upon the Lord</hi> Tyrconnel; for that had come much near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Truth.</p>

The Noise of the Preparations made in the <hi>North,</hi> by raising of Regiments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as of the Revolutions in <hi>England,</hi> extreamly alarm'd the Government in <hi>Ireland:</hi> And though the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> went on vigorously with the compleating of his New Levies, yet he was so apprehehensive of the strength of the Northern Forces, that he deferr'd the sending down his Army twenty dayes after it had been first resolv'd on in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. But when <hi>Frier O Haggerty</hi> (who was unhappily suffer'd to bring up the Capitulation betwixt those of the North and the Garrison of <hi>Carrick-fergus)</hi> gave him a full Account from his own Observations of the Posture of the <hi>Brittish</hi> in the North: [Viz. <hi>That they were untrain'd, and had few experienc'd Officers; that the most part were without Arms, and such as had 'em, their Arms were unfix'd, and unfit for service; that they were very much scatter'd, and their number not near what had been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and was confidently reported in</hi> Dublin; <hi>that they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Ammunition and necessary Provisions for appearing in the field.]</hi> He resolved immediately to dispatch the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and best-train'd part of his Army, under the Command of Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton.</hi> I am here oblig'd to omit some material Passages, for a reason too obvious to be nam'd; but as to Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> shall add, That as he perceiv'd by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the <hi>North,</hi> that their too great confidence of their own Strength, of Aids from <hi>England,</hi> and of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s fears, made 'em so secure, that they look'd on all the Threatnings of an <hi>Irish Army</hi> as only <hi>bigg words;</hi> so he begun to fear they would be perfectly ruin'd for want of such timely notice of their danger, as might enable 'em to put themselves into any good Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture for their own defence: He found all way of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Intelligence to 'em by Sea or Land entirely stop'd. He had been, without his knowledge, mention'd to the Lord <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel,</hi> as a Person very fit to communicate any Message he pleas'd to send to 'em: And his deep concern to prevent their threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ruine, brought him at last (though with great reluctancy) to yield to the urgent Advice given him, not to refuse so fair an opportunity of conveying to his Friends in the North the best
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66153:9"/>
Information and Advice that could be given 'em. And that this <hi>Wisdom of the Serpent</hi> may appear fully consistent with the <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Dove,</hi> I shall transcribe all the Discourse that pass'd betweem 'em, besides what is referr'd to in the Letter it self, as transmitted to me in his own Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord</hi> Tyrconnel. <hi>I am inform'd you are well acquainted in</hi> Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>with several of the Nobility, Gentry and Ministry living there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, having had your Residence there for many years, to which parts I am a great Stranger, and cannot but admire at the rebellious Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Actions of some hot and rash-spirited men, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the People to leave their labour and run out into Rebellion, yet I pity the poor People, and am willing to Pardon 'em, upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of their serviceable Horses and Arms, and giving up six of their chief Leaders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> reply'd, <hi>He knew the Protestant Nobility and Gentry in the North in former times to have carried it loyally and soberly, but having had his Residence chiefly in</hi> Dublin <hi>for twelve Months by-past, he could not undertake to give a distinct account of present Irregularities among 'em.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> upon mention of <hi>Irregularities</hi> grew hot, and said, <hi>What Sir, do you call 'em but Irregularities? they are guilty of the very height of Rebellion.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> considering his circumstances, thought not fit to make any Answer, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to put this Quest. to him, <hi>What if the People in the North should incline to deliver up six of their chief Leaders, and these six discovering their Inclinations, should withdraw, or transport themselves to</hi> England <hi>or</hi> Scotland, <hi>whether he would send down his Army to destroy the poor People, whom he judg'd to be drawn to take up Arms by their perswasion?</hi> To which he answer'd, <hi>If they did withdraw and leave the Kingdom, he had done with 'em;</hi> and added, <hi>That to shew his Lenity, he would be content with three of their chief Leaders.</hi> Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> Propos'd again, <hi>If those three would not be clear to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what offers were made to 'em in his Excellency's Discourse to him, but should rather incline to come and Discourse with himself, he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em safe Conduct for coming to him; and if they agreed not, for returning again, to be in the same circumstances as before:</hi> To which he condescended, with a solemn Attestation; adding, <hi>That thô
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66153:9"/>
the Earl of</hi> Mount-Alexander <hi>and Sir</hi> Arthur Rawdon <hi>should come to him, whom he judg'd the most active in that Affair, he would grant what was demanded.</hi> The third Person Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> could not learn from him. Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> Propos'd again to the Lord <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel</hi>'s consideration, (with a design to gain time for the Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance expected from <hi>England,</hi> and procrastinate the March of the <hi>Irish</hi> Army,) <hi>That</hi> Ulster <hi>was a large Province, consisting of Nine Counties, and therefore begg'd his Excellency would allow him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable and convenient time for travelling through those Counties, that he might discourse what he had heard from his Excellency's own month, with the Nobility, Gentry and Ministry scatter'd in 'em, and chiefly concern'd in the</hi> Ulster-<hi>Association.</hi> To which he reply'd, <hi>That he would not stop the March of his Army for one day or hour, but would give Directions to Lieutenant General</hi> Hamilton, <hi>to treat with any that should be sent to him from the Protestants in Arms there.</hi> And then he shew'd him a <hi>Paper,</hi> which he said was a Copy of the <hi>Declaration</hi> he would send along with Lieut. Gen. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> and publish before he entred into Warr, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the best terms they might expect if they accepted not those proposed to 'em by Mr. <hi>Osborn;</hi> and he added here that <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage</hi> concerning the <hi>Irish Rabble</hi> mention'd in Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and added further, <hi>That had he been sooner ready with his Army, he would sooner have resented their rebellions Actions, and the Indignity offer'd to his Proclamation of Clemency; and being now ready, would delay no longer, and would not be afraid to go thro all</hi> Ulster <hi>with 5000 Men, and would be at</hi> Newry <hi>against the</hi> 11th. <hi>of</hi> March, <hi>and go on</hi> (as in the Letter) <hi>being consident he would meet with no resistance till he came to the Walls of</hi> Derry, <hi>That he knew well the Case they were in, and that their expectations from England made 'em so violent; but they would find themselves dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, for no help would come so soon as they expected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is (as near as Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> can remember) the whole of that Discourse that pass'd between them, which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had not been troubled with at this length, were it not requisite to obviate their Reproaches, who rather than fail of something to criminate Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> with, are pleas'd to argue, That if Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> was true to the Interest of the North, he must be false to his Promises to the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel:</hi> For he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66153:10"/>
made him none, nor gave him ground to expect any more from him, than that he would relate what he heard, which accordingly he did in the printed Letter. So unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly clean and Innocent was this Negotiation of his. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was as much overseen in permitting Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> to go down to the <hi>North,</hi> as they were in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>Frier O Haggerty</hi> to come up to <hi>Dublin.</hi> And that the success was so different, was not (as will now appear) Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s fault.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> having obtain'd the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Pass, left <hi>Dublin, March</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> came to <hi>Newry March</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> and the next day he and his two Guards were pursued by the <hi>Rapperies,</hi> but got safe to <hi>Loch-bricklan.</hi> Here he wrote the foremention'd Letter to my Lord <hi>Massareen;</hi> and going on to <hi>Hillsbrough,</hi> he wrote the same Letter to Sir <hi>Arthur Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> not finding him there as he expected. In which <hi>Letter</hi> it was as needless as 'twas unadvisable, to give his own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Lord <hi>Tyrconnels</hi> Proposals, since the design of it was to draw the Nobility and Gentry to meet and consult their common Safety; and he knew not what necessity there might be of his going back with any Message from them, or about his own affairs, to <hi>Dublin.</hi> But to those of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry that were there on the <hi>9th</hi> and <hi>10th,</hi> he deliver'd in a Paper containing many particulars, by way of <hi>Information</hi> and <hi>Advice,</hi> of which these that follow were a part.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That for the</hi> Irish <hi>Army, tho their Horses were good, yet their Riders were but contemptible Fellows, many of them having been lately Cow-herds,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That their Provisions of Ammunition were not plentifull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That shou'd those of the</hi> North <hi>comply with the Offers made to them, they had no reason to expect any true performance; the Lord</hi> Tyrconnel <hi>having broken all such Capitulations as he had lately made in the like case with the Protestants in the South and West of</hi> Ireland, <hi>and thereby reduc'd them to Poverty and Slavery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Eyes of all Protestants were upon them. A great Interest depended on their carriage: And 'twere better to die
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66153:10"/>
honourably, than live miserably under Popery and Slavery: That their self-defence might be of great consequence to</hi> Brittain <hi>as well as</hi> Ireland, <hi>either to their advantage or disadvantage, as their part should be well or ill acted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It was advised that they should instantly gather all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they could from all parts, and choose out of them a Party of their best arm'd and train'd men, to engage the Enemy, and have the rest ready to fall on their wings and out-skirts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>'Twas advis'd also that the Conduct of their Military Affairs should be committed to their best known and experienc'd Officers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>That they should debate with 'em from Pass to Pass, and so weary out their Men, Horses and Provisions, in expectation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from</hi> England.</p>
            <p>These with many other things he suggested.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Irish</hi> Army being come to <hi>Newry</hi> on the <hi>11th.</hi> he was on the <hi>12th.</hi> call'd for by such as were in the Consult, and his own Advice desir'd: He insisted on the Advice foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and with all modest importunity urg'd 'em to defend themselves, and not to trust any <hi>Irish</hi> Promises. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was Order'd by 'em to send back the following Answer to the Message he brought:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We Declare the utter abhorrence of the effusion of Blood, and that we will use all proper means to avoid it, but cannot consent to lay down our Arms, which we were forc'd to take up for our own Defence, nor to part with our Goods by any other than legal means; and that we are ready to appoint Persons to treat on such heads as are consistent with the safety of our Religion, Lives and Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>13th.</hi> Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> and several other <hi>Ministers</hi> being sent for from <hi>Bellfast</hi> to <hi>Hillsbrough,</hi> there were Nine of 'em met on the <hi>14th.</hi> viz. Mr. <hi>Archibald Hamilton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Alexander Osborn,</hi> Mr. <hi>Henry Leviston,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Legate,</hi> Mr. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gordon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Alexander Glass,</hi> Mr. <hi>George Lang,</hi> Mr. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Macracken</hi> and Mr. — <hi>Adair;</hi> and before they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented themselves before such of the <hi>Consult</hi> as were then met, they debated among themselves what they should Answer to the <hi>Question, Shall we resist or make peace?</hi> They found only
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66153:11"/>
one of their number inclinable to a <hi>Treaty,</hi> on the account of their bad circumstances; but all the rest were against it, and especially Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> who insisted particularly on these three Reasons against it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That nothing was to be expected but what was contained in the Proclamation that came down to the North with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on the</hi> 11th. <hi>and was spread through the Countrey on the</hi> 12th.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That no true performance even of these Terms was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, which he confirmed by several Instances of the manner of</hi> Tyrconnel's <hi>keeping his word with the Protestanrs in other parts of the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That the safety and peace of</hi> Brittain <hi>depended more on the Resistance which the North of</hi> Ireland <hi>might make than they were aware of.</hi> For he acquainted 'em, <hi>That there was a design laid for transporting an</hi> Irish <hi>Army into</hi> Scotland <hi>as soon as the North of</hi> Ireland <hi>were subdued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly what the <hi>Ministers</hi> foremention'd proposed to the <hi>Consult,</hi> will appear in the following <hi>Memoir</hi> drawn up by one of the Members of it then present.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>MEmorand.</hi> On the <hi>14th. March</hi> last, (168 8/9.) about Nine <hi>Presbyterian Ministers</hi> came to such of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult</hi> as were then present at <hi>Hillsbrough:</hi> They apologiz'd for their offering their Advice in such Affairs, which nothing but a deep sense of the common danger and distress of that great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Protestants (whereof they were Members) could have put 'em upon. The <hi>Consult</hi> receiv'd 'em very kindly, and desir'd 'em to proceed. They then acquainted 'em that there were in their several Parishes many able Men, fit for Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Service, who had Arms, and were not yet listed in the Army, and yet were very willing to venture their Lives for K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> and the <hi>Protestaat Religion:</hi> They therefore Propos'd, if the <hi>Consult</hi> approv'd it, that they would presently repair to their several Parishes, and admonish all Men in their limits between sixteen and sixty, that could bear
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66153:11"/>
Arms, to meet and rendezvouz on such day and place as the <hi>Consult</hi> should think fit, with such Armes as they could procure, and Ten days Provision with 'em. For they found by the Information of their Brother Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> (one of their number) that the Lord <hi>Tyrconnels</hi> Army would certainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque 'em on the refusal of his <hi>Proposals;</hi> which <hi>Proposals</hi> they could by no means advise 'em to comply with, but rather advis'd 'em to make a Vigorous and Resolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>To this Advice, those of the <hi>Consult</hi> then present, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily assented, and presently employed Clerks to write Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for Summoning the Country to meet at <hi>Blaris-More,</hi> on the <hi>Tuesday</hi> following, being the <hi>19th.</hi> Upon which the said <hi>Ministers</hi> resolved to repair to their several Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, to encourage and excite the People to meet at the day appointed; declaring their purpose also to come to the Field with 'em. They also further advis'd, that the next <hi>Monday,</hi> being the <hi>18th,</hi> should be appointed as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique day of Prayer and Fasting, to implore the Assistance and Blessing of God on their Undertaking; which was accordingly agreed to: And the said <hi>Ministers</hi> (with whom (I am inform'd) that very Ingenious Divine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Charles Lesley</hi> concurr'd) drew up reasons to be read in their several Congregations for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But these measures came too late. For the <hi>Irish</hi> Army pressing on 'em with unexpected haste, and their Leaders neither agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about <hi>entrenching</hi> themselves, nor about the choice of any <hi>Post</hi> in those parts which they thought defensible, and some of them leaving the Kingdom: This uncertainty in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels joyn'd with the discouragement, which the delay of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted succours from <hi>England</hi> gave 'em, (with other things not fit for me to insist on,) prevented their appointed Rendezvouz, and obliged them to retire in great confusion towards <hi>Colerain</hi> and <hi>Derry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this should not be forgotten, that though th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Forces so unhappily failed in their design of Defending those parts; yet many of those Regiments raised there, made up the chief Strength of <hi>Derry:</hi> Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s own Regiment was rais'd for the Lord <hi>Charlemount,</hi> Capt. <hi>Chichester</hi> being the design'd Lieut. <hi>Collonel,</hi> but afterwards made <hi>Collonel</hi> of it; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of such of them as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stayed in that <hi>Garrison,</hi> has (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> justly observes in his Narrative) <hi>set 'em above Apologies for any miscarriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being a true Relation of matters of fact, (of which unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable evidence will be produc'd if desir'd,) every one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects on 'em, must needs think this worthy <hi>Gent.</hi> deserv'd some other character then that of <hi>Tyrconnel's Spye;</hi> nor can there be a greater wrong done to him, then to impute those <hi>mischiefs</hi> and <hi>calamities,</hi> which befel that part of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to his <hi>management</hi> and <hi>advices,</hi> by which he did all that was possible to prevent them. These reproaches are but a sorry requital of those Services, which wanted nothing but that success, which is not in human disposal, to render 'em as considerable as any of his Prosession was capable of, and were not a little <hi>expensive</hi> as well as <hi>hazardous</hi> to himself. How different the apprehensions, which the <hi>Consult</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> had of Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> were from these Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had receiv'd from idle reports, will appear in the following <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonial,</hi> subscrib'd by several, of whom all but one were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, and two of them are the very Persons, to whom the <hi>Letter</hi> so much talk't of was directed.</p>

                  <p>We whose names are hereunto subscrib'd, do at the request of Mr. <hi>Alexander Osborn,</hi> a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Minister, late of <hi>Dublin,</hi> hereby certifie, That the said Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> was to the certain knowledge of some of us, and as others of us have credibly heard and believe, for diverse months before his coming down to the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> in <hi>March</hi> last, intrusted and employd by diverse <hi>Protestants</hi> of credit in the <hi>North,</hi> as a Person of known Integrity and Zeal to the <hi>Protestant Interest,</hi> under a private method to correspond by Letter, and give Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from time to time of affairs in <hi>Dublin,</hi> especially of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66153:12"/>
Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Proceedings there, in reference to the Army, and his designs upon the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which with other matters of no mean Importance to the <hi>Protestant Interest,</hi> he (as we have ground to believe) transacted with great care and fidelity. And that about the beginning of <hi>March</hi> last, when all correspondence between <hi>Protestants,</hi> from <hi>Dublin</hi> to the <hi>North,</hi> was cut off, the said Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> perceiving the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> immediately about to march down his Army to the <hi>North</hi> against the <hi>Protestants</hi> there, whereof they could in all likelyhood have no notice, but were in manifest danger of being surpriz'd and destroy'd thereby; He then (as we have credibly heard and believe) in order to prevent the same so far as in him lay, by timely Information, found means of procuring the Lord <hi>Tyrconnels</hi> Pass for himself to the <hi>North,</hi> where he had his former abode, the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> first tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that he might acquaint the <hi>Protestants</hi> there, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially some of the Chief, with what his Lordship then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd: Whereupon he came down to the <hi>North,</hi> running a considerable hazard of his life by the way, being notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his Pass pursued by some of the <hi>Irish</hi> on that Road, (as we were credibly inform'd, and believe) Being come to the <hi>North,</hi> he by his Letters acquainted some of us, and others, with the purport of the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s discourse to him, as he left <hi>Dublin;</hi> but in the same Letters desir'd if we thought fit some personal conference, that he might have opportunity of discoursing more fully with us touching the matters therein contain'd, as by those his Letters of <hi>March</hi> 9th (8 8/9) may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; whereupon diverse of us and other <hi>Protestants</hi> meeting with him at <hi>Hillsbrough,</hi> receiv'd from him a more particular and fall account thereof: He the said Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> at the same time advising us as his own private judgment, and as we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued our lives and interests, not to put confidence in the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> or any of his promises, but if we possibly could to defend our selves to the utmost, or words to that effect. And as for his Letters containing the substance of <hi>Tyrconnels</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses and threats against the <hi>Protestants;</hi> Some of us order'd
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66153:13"/>
by common consent, Copies of the same to be sent and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd through the Countrey, that they might the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselves against the dangers that threatned them. We likewise directed what Answer the said Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> should make, and committed the same to his discretion and care. Now in regard some of late, unacquainted (as we presume) with the proceedings then in that part of the Country, or at least with what past on that occasion, have represented the said Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> in a publique manner, in respect of his being so concern'd, as an ill man, <hi>and Spye upon the whole</hi> North, <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Lord</hi> Tyrconnel, <hi>and as serving two Masters, the</hi> Brittish <hi>and the</hi> Irish, <hi>and the like,</hi> to his great disadvantage: We cannot but own, that we (who had as we suppose good reason to <hi>understand</hi> him herein) had and still have better thoughts of him, and are so far from looking on him as guilty of any such matters, that we are well assur'd of his having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and done therein the best service he could to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Interest</hi> there; and that he was very faithful to the same to his utmost. All which at his desire by Letter, in order to his just vindication, We do hereby certifie this 19th day of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> 1689.</p>

            <p>This <hi>Testimonial</hi> is so full, that had I receiv'd it sooner, it had spar'd me a great part of my labour. And I hope Mr. <hi>W.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self will pay too great deference to the Testimonies of persons who knew these affairs, and whose Reputation is above all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to persist in those mistakes concerning Mr. <hi>Osborn,</hi> which the little stories of some ignorant people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had impos'd on him. And the very same Character of his Integrity and Zeal, has been given, both by the Earl of <hi>Mount Alexander,</hi> and by other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66153:13"/>
of the <hi>North,</hi> who have left this Town, as <hi>James Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> of <hi>Tillimore,</hi> and <hi>James Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Bangor,</hi> Esquires, <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> Esquire. The principal Members of the <hi>Consult,</hi> were so well satisfied with his Services, that they judg'd 'em worthy of a publique reward, as indeed they must be thought by all that take their estimate of worthy Actions from the sincerity and prudence of the Actor, rather than the success, which was not in his own power. For my part, thô Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> cannot but think this usage very hard, yet I think him not a little oblig'd to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> for laying on him such an absolute necessity of exposing his <hi>own,</hi> as well as his <hi>Brethren</hi>'s Exemplary Zeal for the <hi>Protestant Interest,</hi> to publique view; which their modesty would else have suppress'd the notice of; and doubt not but the <hi>Government</hi> will in due time take it into consideration.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Hewson,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>W.</hi> joyns with Mr. <hi>Osborn;</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he is not ignorant, that he was some years before publickly discarded by the N. C. Ministers in the <hi>North,</hi> for his scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and turbulent carriage; and therefore they do no more then <hi>right</hi> to themselves in disowning him. His narrow Zeal that would suffer none to fight for the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> but such as would take the <hi>Covenant,</hi> was certainly very unseasonable as well as foolish <hi>Bigottrie;</hi> And I hope as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> spy'd this <hi>Mote</hi> in Mr. <hi>Hewson's</hi> Eye, he will not overlook the <hi>Beam</hi> in theirs, who are as zealous to exclude all from fighting for the same cause, who comply not with their <hi>Sacrament-Test.</hi> For they equally sacrifice the <hi>common</hi> Interest of the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> to that of a <hi>party;</hi> and deprive their Majesties of the service of one part of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as firm and steady to the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> and the <hi>present Government,</hi> as any whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Having done this right to Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> I think my self concern'd also to do the same Justice to the Dissenters in <hi>Derry.</hi> I confess, I think it would become both Parties more, to joyn in their thankful Acknowledgments to God for such a Series of Wonders in their Deliverance, then to quarrel about their share in being only the Instruments of it. But as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> gave the first publique occasion to these Debates, by that passage in his Preface, which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66153:14"/>
(as explained by himself) ascribes the <hi>chief,</hi> not to say the <hi>sole</hi> glory of it, to the <hi>Church of England;</hi> so he is chiefly accountable for the ill consequences of 'em. And what I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall here suggest, is only to rectifie, what (if I mistake not) Mr. <hi>W.</hi> has misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented. As the <hi>Dissenters</hi> of <hi>Derry</hi> do not dispute with Mr. <hi>W.</hi> most of the Principal and Experienc'd Officers in the Garrison being <hi>Conformists</hi> (for it could not be otherwise, while none else but such had access to Military Employments, till some rais'd Regiments in this juncture) So on the other hand, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> should as little Dispute with them, their <hi>Numbers</hi> in <hi>Derry</hi> being more considerable. By the modestest Account of such Officers in the Garrison as were Conformists, The Dissenters in the Garrison it self, as well as those that stay'd in Town, were near five to one; nay many of 'em make the disproportion much greater. Nor are the Arguments imply'd in Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s <hi>Q</hi>'s <hi>Vindication, p.</hi> 15. of any force to prove the contrary. For a Governour, Coll. <hi>Baker</hi> had those advantages to recommend him, that would easily set him above any Competitor in their choice. And he had too great an Interest in the Hearts of Dissenters on the account of his known Affection to 'em, to be excepted against by 'em. All that can be inferr'd from his being a Conformist, on supposition of the Dissenters being more numerous, is only this, That they were too Zealous for their common Interest, to prefer their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to a party, before the safety of it, and regarded more in that excellent Person the <hi>Qualities</hi> that fitted him for that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the <hi>distinguishing Name</hi> he bore. Nor had any other been chosen, if Col. <hi>Baker</hi> had not desir'd an Assistant to be joyn'd with him, on the <hi>Civil part,</hi> to take care of the Stores. And it was on his Recommendation that the Garrison assented to the <hi>Reverend Mr. W</hi>'s being his Assistant; which may still consist with the supposition fore-mentioned, if we do but allow the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the <hi>good temper</hi> which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself elsewhere attributes to 'em. And they paid too great respect to the <hi>Laws,</hi> to desire such a share in the Church as they then had, on any other occasion; and were too Modest to go about to engross it. But I would humbly offer to Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Memory, a much surer way of compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66153:14"/>
their Numbers then this that he has offered. In the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral in the <hi>forenoon</hi> when the <hi>Conformists</hi> Preach'd, there was but comparatively a <hi>thin</hi> Auditory; in the Afternoon it was very <hi>full,</hi> and there were four or five <hi>Meetings</hi> of Dissenters in the Town besides. And how any man will reconcile this with the Number of Conformists being more considerable, or indeed near equal to that of their <hi>Brethren,</hi> I cannot well imagine. And for the <hi>Nonconformists Ministers</hi> (and the same may be justly said of the <hi>Conformists)</hi> they not only <hi>kept their people Quiet and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> but by their Exhortations constantly animated their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in their many bold and resolute Sallies. And therefore so very <hi>slender</hi> a Commendation of 'em as the <hi>former,</hi> needed not have been allay'd, by adding the <hi>misbehaviours</hi> of their Brother Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> which are but <hi>feigned,</hi> and the <hi>real</hi> ones of Mr. <hi>Hewsons,</hi> wherein they are not concern'd. Nor are Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Reflections on their Brethren here in <hi>England</hi> (to whom he supposes the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their Brethren in <hi>Derry</hi> a reproach) any better grounded then those on Mr. <hi>Osb.</hi> but being only <hi>General,</hi> no Man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to go about to disprove 'em. I must also add, as to those Ministers in <hi>Derry,</hi> That there was some real ground to suspect the Ingenuity of Mr. <hi>W</hi>—s <hi>Amanuensis</hi> in the omission of their Names. (All being willing to excuse Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himself from so mean a thing) For not to insist on other things, a Minister here recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Letter from two of his Brethren in <hi>Scotland,</hi> bearing Date <hi>Edinb. Aug.</hi> 15. (89) wherein are these words, <hi>This Account we have confirm'd by Mr.</hi> Walker, <hi>&amp;c. on whom we waited yesterday at the</hi> Abby, <hi>in D.</hi> Hamiltons <hi>Lodgings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to Enquire concerning the Condition of our Brethren there. The Account be gave us of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is indeed afflicting; There being three besides Mr.</hi> Gilkrist <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (by Death)</hi> viz. <hi>Mr.</hi> William Crook, <hi>Mr.</hi> Robert Willson, <hi>and (as we took it) Mr.</hi> John Rowatt. <hi>The rest of 'em,</hi> viz. <hi>Mr.</hi> Tho. Boyd, <hi>Mr.</hi> John Hamilton, <hi>Mr.</hi> John Mackenzy, <hi>and another whose Name he could not remember, were in Health,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hint is all we judg'd needful for the present, but you may have a more full Account from Mr.</hi> Walker, <hi>who hath taken his Journey this day for</hi> London. I alledge this passage only to clear those from any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66153:15"/>
imputation of ill-will to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> who were ready to blame this Omission as <hi>partial,</hi> for I am still so Charitable as to believe it possible, either that he might forget the Names here mentioned in such a hurry of Visits and Business since, or he might intend no more by that passage, then that he could not learn all their Names, and might be unwilling to publish an imperfect List of 'em. I am almost asham'd to mention these <hi>Tristes,</hi> did not the clearing these matters of Fact tend to extinguish these foolish Heats about 'em: And I am perswaded these slips of Mr. <hi>W—s</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pen had not been taken notice of, if they had not lookt too like a Design to diminish the just Credit of a Party, which above all things, an <hi>Impartial Historian</hi> should avoid all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of.</p>
            <p>There is but one thing more I would trouble the Reader with, A Relation of Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s has done me the honour to report me the Author of a Paper call'd, <hi>An Apology for the Failures,</hi> &amp;c. I must be so just to the real Author (whom I do not certainly know) and to my self, as to profess I neither <hi>Wrote</hi> it, nor <hi>knew</hi> any thing of the <hi>Writing</hi> of it; but yet I think this sharp <hi>Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> at the End of Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s <hi>Vindication,</hi> has done the Book-seller the kindness of helping off the <hi>Impression</hi> the sooner. 'Tis true that <hi>Gent.</hi> has run into some mistakes, by taking things upon slight Reports. As he has been less kind to Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> then he intended, in intimating that as a Publique Declaration, which was only Private Discourse and Resolution, and ascribing that to him as single, which he always own'd was done by joint consent with others. Ard he has done the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi> wrong, by suggesting a common, but (I suppose) ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less story of his having receiv'd a <hi>1000l.</hi> out of the Fund of Charity for <hi>Irish</hi> Protestants. But as Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Pen is no more <hi>Infallible</hi> than that <hi>Gent</hi>'s, so he should in kindness to himself, have treated these mistakes with softer Names than those of <hi>Lies, Malice, Impudence,</hi> &amp;c. For I suppose that Gent. will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in em.

And however he had despis'd that <hi>Paper</hi> 'twas not so decent to consign it into the hands of the <hi>Executioner,</hi> nor was it so Civil a Complement to the <hi>Magistrate</hi> to concern him in all the little <hi>squabbles</hi> of quarrelsom Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For the <hi>Reflections</hi> which he pretends that Paper casts on the <hi>Government,</hi> he must have very good eyes that can see 'em. I am indeed much troubled to find so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny severe ones on some of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> but think Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had the least right to reprove that <hi>Gentleman</hi> for it, who in this Paper has so perfectly <hi>copied</hi> his <hi>example</hi> in those he casts on the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> which are as <hi>ill-tim'd,</hi> and as little <hi>excusable</hi> as the others. But I foresee so little good from, and take so little delight in these <hi>ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd</hi> Subjects, that I shall give no occasion for new heats by descending into any particular examination of their Truth or Justice on the one hand or the other. I could rather wish these two <hi>Gentlemen</hi> would make the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick this reparation for the harm they have done by their unseasonable Reflections, to write each of 'em a Panegyrick on the others Party. This argument would shew more good humour, and the carriage of the moderate and sober Clergy and Laity on both sides, both in the <hi>late Reign,</hi> and in this <hi>happy Revolution,</hi> will furnish 'em with mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials enough. And methinks, of all things, the account of the Seige of <hi>Derry</hi> shou'd never have rais'd these warm Contests. 'Tis pity that distinction of Parties, which was so generously laid aside during the <hi>Seige</hi> it self, should be soon resum'd in these <hi>Discourses</hi> it has unhappily occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned. There is no <hi>Reflection</hi> which the <hi>Account</hi> of it can more naturally suggest, than <hi>the necessity of all Their Majesties Subjects, being united by their affection to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government, and to one another.</hi> For how certainly had that important place been lost, and thereby the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> (and perhaps the Peace of <hi>Brittain</hi> endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered) if the factious Spirit of a <hi>Party</hi> on either side had prevail'd either to divide their Counsels, or weaken their Strength! With what admirable vigour did so small a Garrison, struggling under all possible discouragements,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66153:16"/>
defend those Walls against a numerous Army, when the sense of common danger had cemented their affections! By what a series of astonishing successes did <hi>Heaven</hi> seem to smile on their united Zeal in so just a Cause! How little then can it befriend the common Interest of the Protestant Religion to set it on the narrow <hi>Pedestal</hi> of any Party; especially when the mighty opposition it must yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, both in these Kingdoms and abroad, require all the hands that can be us'd in the defence of it! And how soon might the honour of our Nation revive, and our Arms become a <hi>Terror</hi> to our <hi>Enemies abroad</hi> by the easy Conquest of <hi>those at home,</hi> if abilities for service and a steddy zeal for the Protestant Religion and the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were the only <hi>Standard</hi> of such as are admitted to <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military</hi> Employments! For that excellent <hi>Maxim</hi> of His <hi>Majesty</hi> carries it's own convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with it, <hi>That the employing all his Protestant Subjects in his Service will lay the best foundation of Union among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi> And all other <hi>narrow</hi> Politicks will but hazard our Ruine, because they will certainly divide, and so weaken us.</p>
