            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the dayes of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> there had beene an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible apoſtaſie from the purity of Gods worſhip: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was very much corrupted, and the forces of the Kingdome were exceedingly weakned. And in <hi>Abijahs</hi> time things grew worſe and worſe. But now when <hi>Aſa</hi> (being a godly man) came to the Crowne, he begins at the right end, and makes it his firſt work to ſet upon reformation of <hi>Religion,</hi> taking away the <hi>Altars of the ſtrange Gods and the high places, brake down the Images, cut downe the Groves, commanded</hi> Judah <hi>to ſeeke the Lord God of their Fathers, and to doe the Law and the Commandements,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 14, 2, 3, 4.</note> caſting out whatſoever was a ſtench in the Lords noſtrills, and he proſpered in whatſoever he put his hand unto.</p>
            <p>This done, hee then calls all his Nobles and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Elders together, and tells them that they had
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157694:3"/>
ſought the Lord in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> and God had beene found of them, and that now they ſhould goe and fortifie the Kingdome; and ſo they did in all the Cities and proſpered.<note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> But in the midſt of this worke comes out <hi>Zerah</hi> the <hi>Cuſhite,</hi> the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> (or rather the <hi>Arabian, Ethiopia</hi> lying beyond <hi>Egypt</hi>) with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of a <hi>thouſand thouſand, and three hundred Chariots,</hi> (it may be the greateſt Army that ever you read of in any ſtory) with theſe he breakes in ſuddenly upon <hi>Aſa.</hi> But he humbles himſelfe before God, betakes himſelfe to prayer, tells the Lord that it was <hi>all one with him to helpe by many or few.</hi> And in the Lords name hee went out to encounter with that huge Army; over which the Lord gave him a glorious victory, and the ſpoyle of the enemies Country to boote.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3 The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis.</note> Now as they were comming backe to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> the Lord calls out <hi>Azariah the ſonne of Oded,</hi> to make the gratulatory Oration for their ſafe returne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, in theſe words that I have read, and ſo forward to verſe the eighth; and ſo I am come to my Text.</p>
            <p>In which (that I may make as briefe a way as I can poſſibly to the matter that I ſhall inſiſt upon) two things are to be unfolded.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſcope and intent of the Prophet, and that is laid downe in the latter end of his ſpeech, <hi>Bee ſtrong therefore, and let not your hands be weake:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> that is, goe on with the good worke of Reformation of Religion, wherewith you were in hand before the enemy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the arguments whereby this is preſſed, and they are two.</p>
            <p>The firſt is taken from their <hi>owne preſent happineſſe</hi> who were in Gods wayes: <hi>The Lord is with you while</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:157694:4"/>
               <hi>yee are with him, and if yee ſeeke him hee will be found of you: but if yee forſake him he will forſake you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is taken from the <hi>miſery of the ten Tribes,</hi> who were out of Gods way, concerning whom he ſpeaks to this effect, <hi>That for a long time Iſrael</hi> (that is the ten Tribes) <hi>had bin without God, &amp; without a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſt, and without law:</hi> and as they had caſt off God, ſo God had caſt off them: howbeit, if they would have ſought to God, and turned to him, God would have bin found of them: but they going on in the way of deſperate apoſtaſie, the Lord vexed them every where, in the City, in the Country, in the Family; every where God was too ſtrong for them, (as certainly God will make every one to know that he hath a hard match to encounter with, that dares to beare Armes againſt the Lord.) And ſo from their <hi>miſery</hi> hee preſſeth <hi>Aſa</hi> and his people to go on in the right courſe, to prevent the like for comming upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>This ſecond Argument of the <hi>miſery</hi> of the ten Tribes belongs not to my worke.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4 The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.</note> I betake my ſelfe therefore to the other, wherein I ſhall ſpend the allotted time for this exerciſe, namely, The <hi>preſent happineſſe</hi> of the Church of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that were in Gods way: in which obſerve theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what the <hi>happineſſe</hi> was that they enjoyed, in theſe words, <hi>The Lord is with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Condition</hi> upon which they enjoyed this <hi>happineſſe,</hi> or the termes upon which they held it; and that is</p>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, more particularly and exegetically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the next words, <hi>If yee ſeeke him, hee will</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:157694:4"/>

            <p>For that, through Gods providence, the mornings worke hath ſaved me part of my labour.

            <p>Firſt, to <hi>demonſtrate the truth</hi> of it out of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to make a briefe application of it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of the <hi>Church</hi> proved, 1 By <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
               </note> For the firſt, ſee how cleere it is in the Scriptures, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 7, 8. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after this manner: <hi>What Nation (in all the world) is ſo great as thou art?</hi> All their neighbours ſhould ſay, ſurely this is a <hi>great people, a wiſe,</hi> a happy people: I pray you what was their condition when <hi>Moſes</hi> thus magnified them? there were 600000 men of them in a deſolate, barren, howling wilderneſſe: There was not one houſe for a man to hide his head; but onely floting Tents, ſome covered with cloathes, ſome with boughes: No land that they could either ſow, or plough, or reape: No trading; <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 5.</note> hardly a man that had two ſuits to his back, (but as ſome think) as their bodies grew, their cloaths grew; as their feete grew, their ſhooes grew: wherein then was their happineſſe? Mark what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>What Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things, &amp;c?</hi> There was their happineſſe, that <hi>Iehovah</hi> was <hi>nigh them,</hi> and marched up and downe before them. So you ſhall ſee in <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. the Lord was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the people for making of the golden Calfe, In the beginning of that <hi>Chap.</hi> he ſpeaks after this manner to <hi>Moyſes. Take this people and carry them to the Land that I have promiſed to give them: It is a Land flowing</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:157694:5"/>
               <hi>with Milke and Hony. I will ſend my Angell before you, He ſhall drive out all the Nations, and plant you in that goodly Country: onely J my ſelfe will not goe with them,</hi> for I ſhall be ſo farre provoked by their ſinnes, <hi>that I ſhall fall upon them ſuddenly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them.</hi> But my Angell ſhall not leave them till they be ſetled <hi>in that good Land.</hi> One would have thought that this had beene an excellent offer, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands would have eſteemed it a glorious thing to have an <hi>Angell</hi> of God to goe and plant them in the goodlieſt Country that was under the cope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But marke how <hi>Moyſes</hi> takes it. O Lord rather kill us all in the Wilderneſſe, let us never ſtir a foote if Thy preſence goe not with us. I pray thee, if I have found favour with Thee, goe with us thy Selfe: well, ſayth God, my preſence ſhall goe. <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> preſſeth againe, let it be that or nothing: for <hi>wherein elſe ſhall it be knowne to the World, that I and thy people have found grace in thy ſight? Is it not in that thou goeſt with us? So ſhall we be ſeparated, I and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the Earth.</hi> This is the ſumme of that Chapter. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine you ſhall finde in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 46. and <hi>Pſalme</hi> 48. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſtrangely magnifies <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> above all the Cities in the World: Excellent are the ſtraines of Rhetoricke flowing from the Spirit of God in ſetting forth the glory of that City, which in a word was ſuch as <hi>All the Kings of the Earth ſhould come and looke on,</hi> and <hi>ſtand amazed at it.</hi> Without queſtion <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> or <hi>Niniveh</hi> excelled <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> time for outward glory, as farre as the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>London</hi> doth one of our meane Country Townes. What was the glory of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> then? You ſhall read in thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:157694:6"/>
Pſalmes <hi>God was with them. God is in the midſt of her: God is knowne in her Palaces.</hi> And every where this is the thing he cries up: it was a glorious place, becauſe <hi>Iehovah</hi> was there.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 144. The Pen-man of it ſo farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols even the common mercies that God oft times beſtowes upon a people, that they then become Bleſſed, <hi>When their Sonnes grow up as plants, and their Daughters as the corners of the Temple, poliſhed after the manner of a Palace; their Garners affording all ſtore, their Oxen ſtrong to labour; that there is no breaking in, and carrying into Captivity. Bleſſed, ſayth he, are the people that are in ſuch caſe.</hi> But marke how hee gives a daſh to all he had ſaid, in compariſon of that he had to ſay of the bleſſedneſſe of Gods people, <hi>Yea</hi> rather <hi>happy are the people whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> You ſhall ſee alſo in the latter end of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> Chapter 40. and in <hi>Revelation</hi> 21. ſuch an Hyperbolicall deſcription of a moſt glorious City the new <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as never had parallell. And what is the <hi>Glory</hi> of that <hi>City?</hi> Read but the laſt words in the Propheſie of <hi>Ezechiel, The name of that City from that Day ſhalbe</hi> THE LORD IS THERE. As if he had ſaid, would you have an abridgement of all the excellencies of this City and Temple? This it is, <hi>Jehovah is there.</hi> And in <hi>Revelation</hi> 21. <hi>The Lord God Almighty and the Lambe are there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide you ſhall ſee it as plaine, when the Lord threatneth the greateſt plague and curſe that can betide a Nation, he never mentions other, above this, that He will <hi>depart from them:</hi> As if hee had meant to ſtrike them dead at a blow, by ſaying, <hi>He</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:157694:6"/>
               <hi>will leave them.</hi> That place in <hi>Hoſea</hi> Chapter 9. 11. is very remarkable: <hi>As for</hi> Ephraim (that is, the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the ten Tribes) <hi>his glory ſhall flee away as a Bird;</hi> that is, ſuddainly, ſwiftly, irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, he ſhall be utterly undone. What is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? The next Verſe tels you, <hi>Woe unto them when J depart from them.</hi> If God goe, woe comes; all goes, if God goe. It is a knowne ſtory in the 1. <hi>Samuel</hi> 4. that when the Arke (that was called <hi>the glory of God</hi>) the viſible token of Gods preſence in the Covenant of Grace, was taken Captive by the <hi>Philiſtines; Phineas</hi> his wife bowed her ſelfe and travailed, and though they after told her that a <hi>Man-child was borne,</hi> ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded it not, but called his name <hi>Ichabod,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The glory is gone;</hi> becauſe then Gods <hi>preſence</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them.</p>
            <p>What need I ſay any more? The worke of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation</hi> of the Sonne of God, and the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the VVorld by him, was ſuch, that one maine end of making this goodly frame of Heaven and Earth was, that it might be the ſtage upon which that Worke ſhould be acted. A worke wherein not onely all mans happineſſe lyes, and whence it flowes; but wherein all Gods Attributes are glorified to the higheſt; and for which the Church Triumphant ſhall thinke Eternity ſhort enough to prayſe God. Of this Worke (I ſay) the ſumme is given in one word, <hi>Immanuel, God is with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2 By Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> And plaine <hi>Reaſon</hi> may demonſtrate that it muſt needes be ſo. What is <hi>glory,</hi> but the <hi>ſhining out of excellency?</hi> VVhat is <hi>happineſſe</hi> but the <hi>fruition of the greateſt good?</hi> Now there is no <hi>Excellency</hi> that <hi>ſhines</hi> out in any thing, like to that which beames
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:157694:7"/>
out from God in the Covenant of grace to his people. There is no <hi>good</hi> that any people can enjoy like the fruition of God in that Covenant. It is true, God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts himſelfe to all the Nations in the World (<hi>in him they live, and move, and have their being:</hi>) yet it is as in a darke Cloud, they grope after him, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feele him, but in the covenant of grace men behold <hi>him with open face,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> like the Sunne ſhining in his ſtrength, as through a <hi>Mirrour:</hi> Such a Mirrour as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had, that would ſhew the Sunne in his full bigneſſe and beauty. Thus God ſhines in the Covenant of grace.</p>
            <p>The Prince is virtually preſent in all places of his Kingdome, but his <hi>Court</hi> is his <hi>Glory:</hi> So where God is in his Covenant, there <hi>Heaven</hi> is; therefore this is uſually in the Scripture phraſe called the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if yet more particularly you enquire, what <hi>Gods preſence in his Covenant</hi> implyes: As he, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſkt what God was, required firſt a day, then two, then three, alledging, that the more he ſtudyed it, the leſſe able hee found himſelfe to anſwer it. So the more I thinke of this, the more unable I ſee my ſelfe to make a ſatisfactory anſwer: what I can, take thus; To the Nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> it implyed ſomething which concernes not us, but myſtically or analogically: As to have the <hi>Arke, Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim:</hi> to have God to reveale himſelfe in <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Dreames:</hi> To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by <hi>Thunder, &amp;c.</hi> which my haſte allowes me not leiſure to explaine. But to them, and to all other people <hi>Gods preſence</hi> in the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> implyes theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe further ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>planed, to conſiſt, 1 Of Gods owning them.</note> Firſt, the owning and acknowledging of them to

be his owne ſeparated people, knit to him in a league of love: he is <hi>their God,</hi> they are <hi>his people;</hi> they have a propriety in God, and God hath a propriety in them, ſo that they may ſay of Him, <hi>This God is our God;</hi> and God of them, <hi>This people is my people.</hi> Now this is the greateſt happineſſe, nothing can exceed it: It hath bin often queſtioned, what was the greateſt favour that ever Almighty God did for man? Some preferre <hi>Creation</hi> wherein man received his being, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent endowments: ſome <hi>Redemption,</hi> wherein man is recovered to a better and ſurer eſtate than hee injoyed in <hi>Creation:</hi> but out of queſtion to be a <hi>Iedediah,</hi> belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God, to be <hi>neare</hi> to God as his Children, as his Spouſe, is the comprehenſion of all that can be ſaid or thought of the happineſſe of a people. And if you looke into the Scriptures, you ſhall ſee that Gods love to his peculiar people, is ſuch a love as carryes with it all relations: It is the love of a Father to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; <hi>I will be your Father and you ſhall bee my Sonnes and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.</note> It is the love that a man beares to the wife of his boſome: <hi>I will marry thee to mee in righteouſnes, and truth, and mercy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.</note> It is the love of a friend: <hi>I have called you my friends:</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 14</note> And <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of all that are in Covenant, he was ſtiled, <hi>The friend of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from this intereſt in God flow innumerable priviledges, for being thus <hi>beloved of God,</hi> and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to him, it followes that they are accepted in their ſervices, that all their ſinnes are pardoned, and that they have liberty to aſke any thing that is good for them. When <hi>Solomon</hi> was beloved of God, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 5. God bids him, <hi>Aske what I ſhall doe for thee:</hi> It is but aſke and have. <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 14.</note>
               <hi>And this is the confidence that</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:157694:8"/>
               <hi>wee have in him, that if wee aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us.</hi> They have friendſhip with all his friends: In <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>Ten men ſhall lay hold upon the skirt of one that is a Iew,</hi> of whom they be able to ſay, <hi>Wee have heard that God is with you.</hi> Indeed, to have God thus making himſelfe over to a people, to bee their portion, to love them, and to owne them, is not onely an heaven upon earth, but the very heaven of heaven.</p>

This is the ordinary expreſſion of the Scripture: Every thing <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers,</hi> where God is.

            <p>A notable example of this, that <hi>Gods preſence</hi> is mans proſperity, wee have in <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. where when God had told them that the reaſon of all their ill ſucceſſe in their enterprizes came from <hi>Gods</hi> withdrawing from them, for their unfaithfull walking with him in the matter of rebuilding his houſe, and that thereupon the people were ſtirred up to conſider their wayes, and to build <hi>Gods Temple,</hi> the Lord tells them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. that though their ſeed was not yet in their Barnes, nor any of their trees had brought forth their burthen; and ſo for ought they could ſee, they were like to have as hard a year as before: yet now, ſaith the Lord, <hi>from this day I wil bleſſe you.</hi> Now you ſhall have a crop, that there ſhal not be roome enough to receive it: for if they would build his <hi>Temple,</hi> he would come <hi>and dwell with them.</hi>

               <note place="margin">3 Of <hi>Gods</hi> protecting and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them.</note> Thirdly, <hi>Gods preſence</hi> in his Covenant implyes his <hi>protection,</hi> and defence of that people againſt all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. It is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he went into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he was <hi>ſold</hi> for a ſlave: but ſaith the Text, <hi>God was with him, and delivered him out of all his afflictions:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 7. 9.</note> None could hurt him, while God was with him. Aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of excellent Scriptures ſpeake this truth. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two or three compariſons which the Holy Ghoſt frequently uſeth, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4. the later end, the Lord ſpeaks thus of the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that he would <hi>create upon all the aſſemblies</hi> (upon all the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the people ſhould aſſemble to ſerve him) a pillar of a Cloud, and a fire to keepe them ſafe day and night: <hi>for upon all the glory ſhall be a defence.</hi> Marke, Gods preſence in his Ordinances, is their <hi>Glory,</hi> and upon all the <hi>Glory</hi> GOD would cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Defence. <note place="margin">Gen 7.</note>Hee compareth Himſelfe to a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:157694:9"/>
Shield, <hi>I am thy Shield.</hi> Now the nature of a Shield is to take all the blo vs, that the body cannot be hurt, till the ſhield be pierced through. In <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 5. God ſaith he will bee <hi>a wall of fire round about them:</hi> allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of Travellers in waſte wilderneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who uſed to make fires round about them in the night, and then none of the wilde beaſts durſt come neare them; ſuch a defence is God to his people: And he often ſaith, he <hi>beares them upon Eagles wings.</hi> Some obſerve, that other birds carry their young ones in their clawes, (and then the young one may bee killed, and the old one not hurt) but the Eagle carries her young upon her back, upon her wings, and ſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hurt till ſhe be ſhot through. Excellent is that expreſſion in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 46. where God comparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the Idols of the Heathens, ſpeakes to this purpoſe, <hi>Their Idolls muſt be borne:</hi> but God beares his people: They muſt be <hi>ſet in their place,</hi> and bee kept leaſt they be ſtolne or broken; they muſt defend their gods: but <hi>Iehovah</hi> defends his people: In many places God calls himſelfe the Watch-man of his people, the Leader of them, the Defender of them: all ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thus much, that the ſafety and defence of his people reſts upon his preſence with them.</p>
            <p>Some where I have read a Dialogue betwixt a <hi>Iew</hi> and a <hi>Heathen:</hi> After the <hi>Iewes</hi> returne from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, all the Nations round about them (being ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to them) a <hi>Pagan</hi> asked a <hi>Iew</hi> how they could have any hope of ſafety: becauſe (faith hee) every one of them is as one ſilly ſheep compaſſed about with fifty wolves? I, but ſaith the <hi>Iew,</hi> wee are kept by a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard that can kill theſe fifty Wolves when hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth. This God, where ever he comes is the protector
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:157694:9"/>
of his people; who, if he but ſpeake the word, all the enemies of his people are conſumed and brought to nothing. And this is the ſumme of all <hi>Balaams</hi> anſwer to <hi>Balaak, Numb.</hi> 23. and 24. that neither force nor fraud could hurt the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> while God was with them.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, if God leave a people, all their ſtrength is gone, as <hi>Sampſons</hi> was when his Locks were cut of. A notable inſtance of this you ſhall find in <hi>Ier.</hi> 37. God was then withdrawing from his people, tooke away the ſignes of his preſence, and told them they ſhould be delivered up into the hands of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans:</hi> they thought yet to hold it out. But ſaith the Prophet, <hi>If yee had ſmitten all the army of the</hi> Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>and none of them had beene left but a few wounded men, they ſhould come and burne your City.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Amaziah's</hi> caſe<note place="margin">2 Chr. 25.</note> alſo is moſt famous; hee had warre with a great company of malicious neighbour Princes that hated him, and he hires 100000 valiant men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and joynes them with his owne forces: But there comes a Prophet, and bids him ſend theſe 100000 people backe; why? for <hi>God is not with the Armies of</hi> Iſrael; As if he had ſaid, <hi>Amaziah,</hi> it were all one for thee to carry 100000 wiſps of ſtraw, or a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dead Carkaſſes into the Field to fight, as a <hi>hundred thouſand valiant men,</hi> if God bee not with them.</p>
            <p>While God was with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> he could carry the gates of a City upon his ſhoulders; when God left him, when his Locks were cut (which were a pledge of <hi>Gods preſence</hi>) then they took him and made a foole of him at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>If you be not yet ſatisfied, that all theſe three things
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:157694:10"/>
are implyed in <hi>Gods preſence:</hi> obſerve further that not onely of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but even of all the Idoll <hi>gods of the Nations,</hi> the like things are ſpoken.</p>
            <p>As firſt, they are ſaid to be <hi>fathers</hi> and <hi>friends</hi> of the people that worſhipped them. Thus the people of <hi>Moab</hi> who worſhipped <hi>Chemoſh,</hi> are ſtiled the people of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer 48. 46</note> When <hi>Iudah</hi> joyned himſelfe in marriage with Idolaters, God ſaith of him, <hi>He hath taken the daughter of a ſtrange god:</hi>

            <p>Secondly, all their <hi>proſperity</hi> was ſaid to come from their gods ſuppoſedly preſent among them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to them. <hi>Wilt thou not poſſeſſe that which</hi> Chemoſh <hi>thy god gives thee to poſſeſſe?</hi> ſaid <hi>Iepthah</hi>

            <p>A few words may ſerve in this aſſembly: theſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> ſhew not the <hi>moving cauſe</hi> of Gods preſence, but deſcribe the <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>People</hi> with whom he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: the hand of the Diall <hi>makes</hi> not the Clocke to goe, but ſhewes how it doth goe. Theſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> quicken us to our duty, and tell us upon what termes wee muſt look for <hi>God to bee with us,</hi> but he himſelfe is not thereby limitted, but ſtill at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to worke in us the <hi>Condition</hi> which himſelfe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of us: Gods love of Friendſhip (which is his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting himſelfe in his Covenant) we cannot expect, except we be <hi>with him;</hi> but no Law is hereby laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>beneplacitum,</hi> his free favour, whereby hee <hi>workes both the will and the deed,</hi> and cauſeth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to walke in his wayes. God gives conditions to us, but takes none from us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, much leſſe neede wee ſticke at the gloſſe of the Papiſts, who out of ſuch conditionall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures uſe to argue our performance of the condition, <hi>formally to merit</hi> Gods gracious preſence, and ſo they will have it to bee rendred by him, not as a <hi>mercifull giver,</hi> but as a <hi>juſt Iudge.</hi> The Scripture is plaine to the contrary; our merit is nothing but Gods mercy: Wee grant indeed Gods preſence to his people is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their obedience; but it is a reward not of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but of mercy. So ſaith the Prophet <hi>David, Thou</hi>

Look over all the Epiſtles in the new Teſtament, and you ſhall finde, that however the externall profeſſion of Chriſtianitie admits men to the external priviledges of Gods preſence, yet unleſſe they be inwardly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſanctified, there is no being nigh to GOD, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and hee will draw nigh to you: Cleanſe your hands yee ſinners, and purge your hearts, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is moſt cleare in that great worke of mans <hi>Redemption</hi> by Ieſus Chriſt: when God had created man holy and righteous, God delighted to bee nigh unto him: but ſo ſoone as iniquity was found in him, there was a wall of ſeparation built, and a gulfe made, that never could bee filled up, till the Lord Ieſus Chriſt by his infinite ſufferings did it: And when that worke is done by Chriſt, the Lord will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Chriſt to any ſoule in the world, but upon theſe abſolute termes, (and God hath ſworn that it ſhall be ſo) that ſo ſoone as he hath delivered them, and brought them neare to himſelfe, in calling them to participate that Redemption, <hi>they ſhould ſerve him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the daies of their life.</hi>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:157694:15"/>
               <hi>Is there not a lie in my right hand?</hi> Thus <hi>Ephraim</hi> (that is the ten Tribes) <hi>compaſſeth me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, but <hi>Iudah remaines faithfull with God,</hi> therefore hee ruleth with the Saints. What was <hi>Iudahs faithfulnes?</hi> it was her keeping of the marriage Covenant with more care; when in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time (to which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet referreth) Religion was reformed and advanced, then <hi>Iudah was faithfull with God.</hi> For the more full underſtanding of this ſecond branch, let me commend one obſervation to you concerning all the Kings of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> after <hi>Solomons</hi> time; the Scripture ſets downe a character of every one of them, that all the world might know what judgment God had of them. You ſhall finde that of all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (though there were ſome very brave men, yet) there is not one of them that God acknowledged to have <hi>walked with him,</hi> becauſe they were all <hi>Ieroboamites,</hi> worſhippers of the golden Calves. And when hee ſpeakes of any King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> hee ever ſingles out one thing as the chiefe matter of his commendation; and that is, how he ſtood affected in poynt of Religion: <hi>Such a man was upright with God:</hi> the meaning is, all his dayes <hi>he maintained Gods worſhip.</hi> And yet let mee tell you ſome of their moralities were no better than they ſhould be. <hi>Aſa</hi> in the Text was a cholericke paſſionate man, and covetous in his old age, and many other weakneſſes were found in him; yet becauſe hee went through-ſtitch in the reformation of Religion, <hi>Aſa's heart</hi> was ſaid to bee <hi>upright with God all his dayes.</hi> With this God uſeth to cover all their infirmities as with a veile.</p>
            <p>But if any of the good Kings did but halt in this poynt, God hath left it upon record, as a blot upon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:157694:16"/>
their honours, therefore are they blamed, if (through their default) <hi>the high places were not taken away,</hi> though the Idolls ſet up in thoſe places were removed. And in the new Teſtament, throughout all the time of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts</hi> apoſtaſie, the true <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that walked with him aright, are deſcribed by this Character, that they are a virgin company, <hi>not defiled with women;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 4</note> that is, they were never guilry of the ſpirituall pollutions of that Apoſtaticall Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This was <hi>to be with the Lamb, and to follow him whereſoever he goeth.</hi> That is the ſecond, to keepe cloſe to God in his worſhip.</p>

the defiling of the marriage bed betwixt God and his people. God hath viſited all the Reformed Churches, brought moſt of them almoſt to nothing: yet, paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ſee, whether ever any of them have provoked the Lord in this kinde ſo much as wee have done. Let mee name foure or five things, too much practiſed, and too little lamented: God in mercy affect our hearts with them this day.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Articles of our faith, the <hi>depoſitum, the good thing committed</hi> to us, which we received from our fore Fathers; and ſhould tranſmit entire to our poſterity: oh the miſerable defection that wee have made from God, adulterating thereof! Tell mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, what one poynt, what one Article of Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted betwixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is there, that our Pulpits, and Preſſes, and Univerſity Acts have not beene bold withall? as if we were weary of the Truth which God hath committed to us: as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, for our not <hi>receiving the truth in love,</hi> God were giving the Nation up <hi>to believe lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, let me inſtance in the Lords Day; a day which is a <hi>ſigne</hi> betwixt God and his people, that <hi>He is their God that ſanctifieth them.</hi> That as Idoll-worſhippers are knowne by keeping holidayes to their Gods: So Gods people are knowne to bee his people, by obſerving of his <hi>Holy day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is moſt true, that our ancient Doctrine eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed is purer in this poynt than can be found in moſt of the Churches, and excellent Lawes we have for the backing of it: but I believe there hath not beene in all the Chriſtian World ſuch high affronts offered to the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as of late hath beene in <hi>England,</hi> and (I am confident) they all lie in the Deck charged, as the ſin of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:157694:18"/>
the Nation, till by ſome publicke Act, the fourth Commandement bee reſtored to its due place and honour.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, goe to another branch, the poynt of <hi>preaching the Word.</hi> The preaching of the Word is the <hi>Scepter</hi> of Chriſts Kingdome, the <hi>glory</hi> of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Chariot</hi> upon which life and ſalvation comes riding: ſuch a treaſure as that any wiſe Merchant would ſell all to buy the field wherein this Treaſure lies. O that God would humble <hi>England</hi> for the great abuſe of this invaluable mercy! What little care hath the State in general taken to provide that Chriſt might ride in Triumph upon his <hi>white horſe?</hi> that the Word of God might ſpread into every corner of the Land? But, oh the cruelty that hath beene offered to many poore Congregations, in taking away the bread of Life from their mouthes, without any pitty! as if the ſtarving and murthering of ſoules, for which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhed his blood, were a matter of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And oh, the ſpoyle, and havocke that hath beene made among many faithfull and painfull Miniſters, for ſuch trifles as will not endure try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the day of the Lords appearing? Could wee as in a mirrour, behold the great guilt wee lye under for theſe things, and apprehend what great wrath is kindled againſt the Kingdome for them, how would our hearts tremble before God this day?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, but above all, the extreame daring, bold audaciouſneſſe of a generation of men, that have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured as much as in them lies, to corrupt Gods worſhip, that not onely rejoyce to ſee the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and ſuperſtition of <hi>Rome</hi> practiſed by others,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:157694:19"/>
but have dared to ſet <hi>their threſholds by Gods threſhold,</hi> and to dreſſe out all Gods worſhip, according to their owne fancies, things too apparent to need any further proofe.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome may think, this is no great matter, and much complaint need not be made againſt it: a few diſtinctions will ſalve all that is done to quit it from Idolatry, and ſuperſtition. But as <hi>Lodovicus Vives</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in his dayes, that for ought he ſaw, they (in effect) gave the ſame reverence to their Saints, which the <hi>Pagans</hi> did to their gods: So I may truely ſay of theſe men, (that notwithſtanding all their diſtinctions) little difference is to bee found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their practiſe, and the ſuperſtitions and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will ſome ſay, let it be granted that men have been too blame, (as doubtleſſe multitudes have been too bold) in this kind, yet God forbid, that we ſhould judge ſo farre, as to make them as odious to God, as if they were the bringers of Gods wrath upon the Nation, as if they were as bad as whoremongers, or blaſphemers; or that we ſhould offer to compare them with the groſſe Idolaters of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> God forbid ſuch a ſtaine ſhould bee caſt upon them. Thus ſome men draw a fine veile over theſe foule enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>Good Lord, that the glorious light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in eighty two yeares, ſhould not take away this filme from the eyes of men! Judge you the caſe, you that are husbands, you that have a ſpirit of jelouſie, bee yee Arbitrators betweene the Lord and this Generation; and ſay, if a wanton looke in your owne wife, if a whoriſh dreſſe, if the giving, or receiving of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:157694:19"/>
love tokens, if the leaſt degrees of dalliance would not render your owne wife more abhominable to you, than the knowne fornication, or adultery of any other woman whatſoever? Doe you not know that the Church of Chriſt is his Spouſe? <note place="margin">Exo. 33. 5</note> Do you not know that God is more eaſily provoked by a people among whom hee walkes, than by any other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whatſoever? I beſeech you lay theſe things to heart.</p>
            <p>And let the remembrance of this day, helpe you in it. This day eighty two yeares agone, the Lord ſet up the Goſpell among us, and tooke us to be a nation in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him. Oh the progreſſe that ſome nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would have made! The thankfulneſſe and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe that ſome people would have attained to in ſo long a time! but that wee ſhould grow worſe and worſe in poynt of Gods <hi>worſhip,</hi> that we ſhould han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker after Idolatry, and Superſtition, and fall away worſe than any of our neighbours, that God hath viſited ſo ſeverely: what ſhall wee ſay, when God comes to reckon with us for theſe things?</p>
            <p>Fiftly, adde the horrible prophanation of the holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> the promiſcuous multitude every where, not onely allowed, but even compelled to the receiving of it: Multitudes of whom, know not whether Chriſt were a man or a woman, nor how many Gods there be, multitudes wallowing in all prophaneneſſe and licentiouſneſſe; yet if they profeſſe that they be no Papiſts, almoſt every where they are admitted to the polluting of theſe reverend Myſteries, as if we would compell the Lord to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part away from us.<note place="margin">Ezek 8.</note>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:157694:20"/>
               <hi>ingaging ourſelves in Gods cauſe,</hi> how little zeale is there for God? The wrongs and cruelties that are done to many, the teares of the afflicted, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and ſo few that will open their mouths, or appeare to plead any cauſe which GOD will owne, abundantly proclaimeth this. Verily, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, were you all as innocent as <hi>Ezra</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 9.</note> was of the fact among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> of the wretchedneſſe of the people of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> If you did know what God looks for at your hands this day, you would rent the very Caule of your hearts before the Lord, and ſit downe with him aſtoniſhed, and refuſe to be comforted, and wonder that GOD hath not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left us, and delivered up our glory as a ſpoile, and ſeverely revenged the quarrell of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>But to come nearer yet, and bring it home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your owne boſomes; what if you your ſelves bee guilty of theſe things? You that are the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of your Tribes, the chiefe of the Thouſands of <hi>England;</hi> You that are lifted up above your Brethren, whom GOD hath made the Head, and not the Taile of the places where you live, when GOD might have left you to be <hi>hewers of Wood,</hi> and <hi>drawers of Water.</hi> And hee hath made ſome of you Noblemen, ſome Knights, and Gentlemen, and now called you to bee the Repairers of our breach, to heale and prevent our ruine. What if you your ſelves have a chiefe hand in theſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions? What if among you be found ſwearers, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, adulterers, drunkards, haters of Gods waies, ſcorners of his Children, and his Ordinances, men who goe on in your ſinfull wayes, and reſolve to

doe ſo: and becauſe you are great, will therefore bee children of <hi>Belial,</hi> refuſing to carry Gods yoake: what if any ſuch ſhould be here? The Lord of heaven forbid. But if there ſhould be any ſuch, I beſeech you thinke what a <hi>Magor-mizzabib,</hi> what a terrour round about you there will be, when God comes to find you, and to reckon with you!</p>
            <p>Are <hi>you</hi> come to <hi>Faſt,</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> before the Lord? Doe <hi>you</hi> come to ſtand betwixt God, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when you wallow in ſuch wayes as GODS ſoule abhorres?

            <p>You ſhall reade in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. divers of the <hi>Elders</hi> came to the Prophet to inquire of God. <hi>Theſe men,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>have ſet up their Idolls in their hearts,</hi> and they come to enquire of mee: Tell them I will anſwer them with a witneſſe, <hi>I will ſet my face againſt them, and make them a ſigne, and a Proverb.</hi> So I ſay, from God to the greateſt of you, who brought your ſins in the morning, and purpoſe to returne to them in the evening, and keepe ſuch a ſolemne day onely for a <hi>formality,</hi> and there an end, God will reckon with you for it.</p>

To live in hell you would not; to live with God you cannot: hard it will bee to be damned; impoſſible it will bee to bee ſaved, unleſſe with full purpoſe of heart you turne to God, and become new creatures. I muſt ſay to you as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſaid to his ſouldiers at the battaile of <hi>Newport,</hi> when they had the Sea on the one ſide, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the other: If (ſaith he) you will live, you muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eate up theſe <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or drinke up this Sea; So muſt you, either conquer your luſts, eate up the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or drink up the Sea, the devouring Gulfe of Gods wrath: and none of you know how ſoone this time may come, that will yee, nill yee, yee muſt be be brought neare to God, who is a <hi>devouring fire,</hi> utterly to conſume you, if you be <hi>Straw and Stubble,</hi> or to glorifie you if you be <hi>Gold.</hi>

What ever bee the cauſe, whether it bee that our Lawes and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are defective: whether the negligence or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Governours; whether the want of a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:157694:26"/>
preaching maintenance, or whether all theſe bee the fault: Certaine it is, there hath beene hitherto a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſomewhat which hath hindred the ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it.</p>
            <p>And it is worth your moſt diligent enquirie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the neglect of this hath not beene one maine cauſe of the ill ſucceſſe of ſo many former <hi>Parliaments.</hi> Could you provide mercifully for people in this, you would make all ſafe, and <hi>England</hi> would thanke you as long as it is <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To incite you, be pleaſed to conſider but theſe two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we deſerve no further the name of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Nation than this is done, nor any further than this is advanced. This is the Scepter whereby Chriſt rules: The dwelling of his Word with a people, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt proof of their owning him for their <hi>Prince,</hi> and his acknowledging them for his owne <hi>Subjects.</hi> Is any Country eſteemed a part of a Princes Dominion, that is not ruled by his Lawes? Neither can any Land be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Chiſts Kingdome, where the preaching of the word, which is the <hi>Rod of his power</hi> is not eſtabliſhed. And the Lord hath ever eſteemed the hinderers of his Word, to bee the men that would not have Chriſt rule over them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if all the good Lawes in the world were made, without this, they would come to nothing; order what you can, leave this undone, you will never doe the thing you aime at. Magiſtrates and Miniſters of Juſtice will not execute them, and people will not obey them. <hi>The darke places of the Land are</hi> ever <hi>full of the habitations of wickedneſſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſalm. 74. 20.</note> But if Chriſt <note place="margin">Iſaiah 11. 4, &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, the Wolfe ſhall dwell</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:157694:27"/>
               <hi>with the Lambe, and the Leopard ſhall lye downe with the Kid, the Calfe, and the yong Lion, and the fatling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a little Child ſhall lead them.</hi> There ſhall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hurt nor deſtroy, where Chriſts Scepter rules: Your Lawes cannot give men new hearts, nor new ſtrength; that is the priviledge of the Lawes of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Poets ſpeake of excellent Muſitians, who by the power of their Muſicke made ſtones leap into Walls, beaſts to bee tame, &amp;c. This will doe more, this will take the ſtone out of mens hearts, this will give them a new heart; this will make all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements eaſie; there is a kinde of omnipotencie in it. Ibeſeech you amongſt all your excellent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for our good, let this bee the firſt, and chiefeſt: If this will not doe, nothing will: <hi>If they heare not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, they will not believe though one riſe from the dead.</hi>
