            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> In two things espycially:

                  <item>2. He had familiar communion with God.</item>
                  <item>3. He felt unspeak able joy arising from this communion.</item>
                  <item>4. He had dominion over all inferior creatures.</item>

                  <item>2. That I ought to labour to get this image of God repaired in me.</item>
                  <item>3. That I ought not to be ashamed of holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, nor to content my self with some small

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> His misery now appears in four things.
<list>
                  <item>1. In his birth: he is borne dead in sinne and so void of all good, and full of all evil, and so a child of wrath. <hi>Ephes. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. Rom. 1. 29.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. In his life: whatsoever he doth is sinne in Gods sight. <hi>Tit. 1. 15.</hi> God and all creatures are his enemies. <hi>Psal. 5. 5. Iob 5. 23.</hi> he remains abondslave of Satan till God convert him. <hi>Act. 16. 18.</hi> and hangs by the twine-thred of life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment ready to drop into hell.</item>
                  <item>3. In his death: then comes an end of all his hopes, and pleasures, and the beginning of all his woes and sorrowes.</item>
                  <item>4. After death: First comes his particular judgement. <hi>Heb. 9. 27.</hi> after this followes his generall judgement, when that terrible sentence, <hi>15. and the 41. ver.</hi> shall be pressed upon him. After this followes the execution, wherein the vialls of Gods fierce wrath are powred out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his soul and body, which fire shall never be quenched.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Wherein doth the aggraration of this wofull estate of man by nature appear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In three particulars:
<list>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:33067:5"/>
                  <item>1. He knowes not his misery. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17.</item>
                  <item>2. He is not affected with it, though he should know it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5.</item>
                  <item>3. He is unable of himself to come out of it, though he should both know it, and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What learn you from hence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I learn that Gods wrath against sinne, and sinnefull man (remaining in this condition) is very great.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How great is it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> So great that nothing (without Christ) but eternall death of body and soul in the cverlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torments of Hell can satisfie Gods just dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Is it best now to see your miserable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by nature, and to feel this wrath of God, and mourn under it while there is hope, and means to come out of it, or to stay till the gate of grace be shut, and God snatches the soul from all hope, and means by death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It's farre better to see it, and to mourn under it now.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How, and why must a man see and feel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self under this wrath and misery?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Every man must see that he is under Gods wrath for the present, else he will never seek to Christ to bear it for him.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:33067:5"/>2. Man must see what this fearfull wrath of God is, that is now piled against him; else he will never prize Christ to deliver him out of it.</item>
                  <item>3. All men must see that this wrath is ready to light on them every moment in the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of it; else they will deferre their returne till hereafter.</item>
                  <item>4. A man must see he is bound hand and foot in the chains of his sinnes, and cannot come from under them, nor lay hold of Christ to help him out of them; else he will presume he hath received Christ when he hath not,</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is to be known of every one concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iesus Christ, the only means of deliverance out of this estate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> These four things:
<list>
                  <item>1. What his person is, namely, both God and man united into one person which is, Jesus Christ.</item>
                  <item>2. What his love is towards man, namely past understanding. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 18, 19.</item>
                  <item>3. What his offices are, which are these three.</item>
               </list>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His Priestly office, whereby he offered himself for his Church. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 27.</item>
                  <item>2. His Propheticall office, whereby he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Church. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22.</item>
                  <item>3. His Kingly office, whereby he rules his Church. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 6.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:33067:6"/>4. How he delivers those, whom he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to save, namely by being made sinne, and curse and righteousnesse for them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Q. What learn you from hence?</p>
            <p>A. I learn that all my sinnefull duties, no nor my death, cannot pacifie Gods wrath, and deliver me from it: It is done only by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteousnes and death of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Q. How may we come to get this Christ to doe all for us?</p>
            <p>A. By receiving him by Faith. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
            <p>Q. When may a man without presumption re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ as his own?</p>
            <p>A.
<list>
                  <item>1. When the poor soul is so weary, and heavy laden with the apprehension of sinne, and wrath that it cannot live without Christ. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28, 29.</item>
                  <item>2. When the poor sinner is so out of love with himself, that he is content to part with all sinne for Christ. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 7.</item>
                  <item>3. When the poor sinner receives Christ to that end that God the Father offers him, namely to be his Priest, Prophet, and King.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Q. How may a man come to receive Christ? can man create Faith in himself to receive him, or must the Lord by an infinite almighty power work it in him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:33067:6"/>A. The Lord must create faith in him by his almighty power. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
            <p>Q. What is to be known concerning faith, the only means of applying Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi>
               <list>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Q. What is Faith?</p>
            <p>A. It is a speciall grace of God, whereby an humbled sinner feeling himself unable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, is drawn, and so comes by the help of Gods Spirit to Christ for all good, and so rests upon him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Iob</hi> 6. 44, 45. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Q. How doth the Lord work this Faith in the soul by his mighty power, and how comes the soul to know it is wrought?</p>
            <p>A. By these nine steps:
<list>
                  <item>1. The Lord gives the soul a listning eare to the word preached, as if God himself were speaking to it.</item>
                  <item>2. The Lord makes the soul to understand the word. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 23.</item>
                  <item>3. The Lord savingly wounds the soul, with the sence and apprehension of his lost estate; having understood it. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37.</item>
                  <item>4. Then the Lord makes the soul poor in spirit, ready to dye for want of grace, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33067:7"/>
Christ. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 9.</item>
                  <item>5. The Lord reveals unto the soul the freenes of his grace and mercy in Christ, and then brings the soul to ponder on this mercy, from whence ariseth hope of help, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. hereupon hope comes and waits on Christ for it, seeing now it is possible that an unworthy sinnefull, lost creature may have it. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. 9.</item>
                  <item>6. The Lord reveals the riches of his mercy in Christ, whereby the soul hungers after it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6. and is not quiet without it, hence the desires, and longs, and beggs for it, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable groans, seeing and knowing (with the prodigall) that there is enough in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 26.</item>
                  <item>7. Then the Lord reveals the worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his mercy in Christ, and hereby makes the soul to love it. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 7. Hence love to this mercy comes secretly, and contents it self with it; hereupon the soul promiseth, if it may but have this mercy in the Lord Jesus to pity it, and receive it; it will everlastingly own it, and admire the Lord for it, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 24.</item>
                  <item>8. The Lord reveals the sweetnesse of his mercy in the Lord Jesus, and hereby gives the soul a satisfying taste of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 3. and hence the will comes and is perswaded with joy to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33067:7"/>
leave it self for ever upon it, here to live, or here to die. <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 7.</item>
                  <item>9. The soul being thus come up to Christ; the Lord doth at last reveal the property of mercy to him, (thus beleeving) whereby the soul is now assured and perswaded that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther height, nor depth shall separate him from Gods love in Christ. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39.</item>
