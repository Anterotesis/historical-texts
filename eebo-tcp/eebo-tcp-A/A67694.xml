         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

seeking of the LORD) by the Commission of the GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERALL
ASSEMBLY 1650. with the advice of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
Ministers from severall parts of the Kingdom, met
at Edinburgh, October 1651. so far as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
they could attain light therein, which they offer
and advise to be made use of by all the LORDS Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the Land, leaving place to adde, as the Lord
shall make further discoveries hereafter of the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Land, and intending more fully and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to enlarge this Paper.</head>
                  <p>1. <hi>Article.</hi>
THe grosse Atheisme and ignorance of God and
of his Word and Works, that is in a great part
of the Inhabitants of the Land, which is such,
that neither Law nor Gospel, nor the most
common and necessary points of truth are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
or known by many thousands.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Article.</hi> Horrible loosnesse and prophanity of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in all sorts, against the Commandments, both of the first and
second table, which hath so abounded and encreased, that scarce
hath any of the Nations exceeded us therein.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Article.</hi> The despising and slighting of JESUS CHRIST
offered in the Gospel (which we look on as the chief and mother
sin of this Nation) and the not valuing and improving the Gospel
and precious Ordinances of CHRIST, unto the establishing and
building up of our selves in the lively faith of CHRIST and power
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29688:3"/>
of godlinesse, but either neglecting and despising these things alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
or else resting upon and idolizing outward and bare forms,
without studying to know in our selves, or to promove in others
the Kingdom of God, which is righteousnesse and peace, and joy in
the Holy Ghost: whereby it hath come to passe, that persons not
rightly qualified, have been admitted unto, and continued in the
Work of the Ministery and Elderships, and that publick repentance
and Kirk-censures have been gros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Lords Supper fearfully polluted by the promiscuous admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of many ignorant and scandalous persons thereto, and many
wilfully ignorant, and openly and continuedly prophane, have been
keeped in the fellowship of this Kirk, contrary to the Word of
GOD, and Constitutions of this Kirk, and that many other sad and
fearfull consequences have followed unto the prophaning of all the
Ordinances of GOD, and rendering them for the most part barren
and fruitlesse to us:</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>Art.</hi> Not only the exercise of godlines in families much sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
great men being unwilling and ashamed to call on the name of the
LORD in their Family (which guilt is exceedingly heightned by the
continuing of many of these in the same after solemn Publick confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thereof, and engaging to the contrary duty in the year 1648.)
and others much neglecting the same; But also the loathing and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the power and life of Religion and godlinesse, and bearing
down such as make conscience thereof, or aime at any perfection
therein, which hath come to such an height, that the Godly are eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-where
reproached, reviled, oppressed and persecuted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Land by sundry of all ranks: yea, by sundry Magistrates and
Ministers; and the ungodly and prophane countenanced, encouraged
and imployed.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Article.</hi> The base love of the world, and Covetousnesse,
which hath made not onely the Body of the People, but many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
more to minde their own things, then the things of JESUS
CHRIST; and many Masters, Rulers, Magistrates, Officers
and Souldiers in Armies, exceedingly to abuse their power unto
the exercising of intollerable oppression of all kindes on the poor,
to the grinding of their faces, and making their lives bitter to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29688:3"/>
them: Which fountain of Covetousnesse did also produce the
great insolencies and oppressions in our Armies in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and the fearfull perjuries in the Land in the matter of valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Excise.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Article.</hi> The abusing and prostituting the Publick Faith of
the Kingdom in the way of borrowing of Money and otherwise;
unto the dishonouring of GOD, mocking of Men, and reproach
of the Nation.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Article.</hi> In pursuing of necessary Duties of renewing the
Nationall Covenant, and entring into and renewing the solemn
League and Covenant, the way of many mens taking these Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
was without the knowledge of the necessary things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein, and without reality and sincerity of heart, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the performance thereof; some being induced thereto by
example, some by fear, and not a few by principles of policy, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
their own carnall and corrupt ends.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Article.</hi> The Following the work of God, and pursuing the
ends of the Covenant not in a Spirituall holy way, setting the
LORD alwayes before our eyes, and acknowledging him in all our
paths but in a carnall politick way, abusing GODS Interest for
our own interest and ends, as if it had been the Work of men,
and not the Work of GOD, which made us walk more in the
counsels of our own hearts then in the Counsel of GOD, and to
trust more in the arm of flesh, then in the Arm of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Article.</hi> Backslyding and defection from the Covenant,
and from our solemn Vows and Engagements; the guilt whereof
is exceedingly heightned by the aggravating circumstances of our
renewed Oaths, and of the LORDS Mercies and Engagements,
and of our frequent relapses into the same sins, whereof we once
seemed to have repented, and which we condemned in others: Of
this Defection there be these speciall heads and Steps.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Step.</hi> A soul falling from that honesty of heart, and purity
of conversation, and from the singlenesse and integrity of heart,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29688:4"/>
and from the fervency &amp; zeal for GOD that appeared to be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
at the first entry to the Covenant; and declining into loose wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and self interest, and neutrality and indifferency, from which
haue issued many sad consequences, especially the great scandall and
stumbling of many godly in the Land, at us and the Work of God
in our hand.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Step.</hi> The sitting up of many Professors in the Land under
the Gospel, and becoming formall and remisse, not entertaining
tenderness, spirituall life and soberness of minde, which as it hath
been amongst the provoking Causes of the LORDS wrath, and
hath rendered some obnoxious to snares on both hands, so may it
(if it be not mourned for and amended) draw on more wrath,
and expose to the hazard of errour and disaffection to the Work
of GOD.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Step.</hi> The secret falling off of some, and open falling away
of many unto the opposite party, after their entering in Covenant,
especially that defection carried on by <hi>Iames Graham</hi> &amp; his party,
and that which was afterward carried on by the Authors and Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the unlawfull Engagement 1648.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Step.</hi> The neglecting, obstructing, and condemning, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the Judicatories and Army, 1649. and afterward, from
scandalous and disaffected men; and of the constituting the same of
men of known integrity and affection to the Cause, and of a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and Christian C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nversation, notwithstanding of the solemn
publick Confession of these sins, and Engaging unto these duties a
little before that time.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Step.</hi> The Authorizing of Commissioners to close a Treaty
with the King, for the investing him with the Government, upon
his subscribing such Demands as were sent to him, after he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
many clear evidences of his disaffection and enmity to the
work and people of God, and was continuing in the same: And
the admitting of him to the full exercise of his power, and Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, notwithstanding of new discoveries of his adhering to his
former principles and way, and of many warnings to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:29688:4"/>
6. <hi>Step.</hi> The Rejecting of Discoveries of guiltiness and causes
of the Lords contending with us, and of our duty in reference ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
such as the cause of humiliation offered by the Commission of
the General Assembly, to the Committee of Estates at <hi>Leith,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the defeat at <hi>Dumbar:</hi> The causes of humiliation condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on at <hi>Sterlin</hi> immediately after the defeat at <hi>Dumbar:</hi> The
Remonstrance of the Gentlemen, Ministers and Forces in the West,
and many other testimonies of Presbyteries and Synods together;
neglecting the means tending to peace, and to the preventing the
effusion of more blood; from pride and bitterness of spirit against
those who had—invaded us.</p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Step.</hi> The Publick Resolutions of Kirk and State, for bringing
in the Malignant party, first to the Army, and then to the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,
and to the actual intrusting of them with the power of the
Kingdom, both Military and Civil, whereby the state of our cause
is not only turned up side down, by subordinating the interest of
God to the interest of men; but the work and people of God have
been entrusted to the enemies thereof.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Step.</hi> The joyning of many engaged in the Covenant and
Cause of God, in Arms with the Forces of the Kingdom, after that
by the Publick Resolutions, there was a prevailing party of Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
brought into the Army, who had the sway of Counsels and
Actings therein, and were carrying on a malignant interest.</p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Step.</hi> The pre-limiting and corrupting of the Gen. Assembly,
in regard of the free, lawful and right constitution thereof, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
such as were faithful and constant in the Cause, and making
it up, for the most part, of those who had been active and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in carrying on a course of Defection, or were consenting
thereto; whereby it came to pass that that Meeting did ratifie and
approve the Defection it self, and did not only censure sundry
for protesting against them, but also laid a foundation for censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all such Ministers, and for keeping all such out of the Ministry
who did not approve of their Constitution and Acts, and did issue
Warnings and Declarations reflecting exceedingly upon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29688:5"/>
and condemning former pious and warrantable procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and the instruments thereof.</p>
                  <p>10. <hi>Article.</hi> Deep security, impenitency, obstinacy and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigibleness
under all these, and under all the dreadful stroaks of
God, and tokens of his indignation against us, because of the same,
so that whilest he continues to smite, we are so far from humbling
our selves, and turning to Him, that we wax worse and worse
and sin more and more.</p>

a floud of prophanity hath overflowed the whole Land, and
that the most part of the Inhabitants thereof have corrupted their<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

Ah, sinfull Nation, a people loaden with iniquity, a seed of
evill doers, children that are corrupters, they have forsaken the
Lord, they have provoked the holy one of Israel to Anger, they
have gone away backward; why should ye be stricken any more, ye
will revolt more and more, the whole head is sick, and the whole

and an abomination is committed in Israel and Ierusalem,
for Iudah hath prophaned the holinesse of the Lord which he loved,

the Tabernacles of Iacob, and him that offereth an offering unto

and Iudah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

loosnesse and prophanity is so much the more heightned
by these circumstances that do attend it: First, that it is under the
clear light of the Gospel, of the Word preached now for many
years throughout the Land, in purity and plenty. Secondly, that
it is contrary to many solemn Vows, Engagements, Oaths and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
taken on us before God, Angels and men to the contrary.
Thirdly, that it is under many blessings, mercies and deliverances
from the Lord. Fourthly that it is under many chastisements, rods
and judgements, especially the sword and pestilence, by which two,
many thousands in the Land have been taken away within these
few years. Fifthly, that it is common and universall, and hath reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over all sorts of persons, Noblemen, Gentlemen, Barons, Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Ministers and Commons. Sixthly, from the greatnesse of it, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melesnes
of it, avowedness and grossness of it, which is such that
many declare their sin as</hi> Sodome, <hi>and commit all sorts of wickednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
with greedlnesse. Seventhly, from the kinds of it, some of the chief
and most common of which, especially these who are not named in
some other Article of the former Paper; we shal here touch: 1. Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiencie,
murmuring and freting against God and his works, which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hath
made many to weary of the charges and expence they have
been put to, for the Gospel, and to wish there had been no such thing
as the entering into the Nationall Covenant, and the renewing and
entering into the solemn League and Covenant, not to an few to
curse and blaspheme the Covenants, and to look on them as the rise
and originall of all the evils where with the Land hath been afflicted
and it is an great provocation before God, as it appears from these
and the like Scriptures, Numb.</hi> 14, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12. And all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
lifted up their voice and weeped and cryed, and the people
weeped that night, and all the children of Israel murmured against
Moses, and against Aaron, and the whole Congregation said to
them, would to God we had died in the land of Egypt, or would to
God we had died in the wildernesse; and wherefore hath the Lord
brought us to this land to fall by the sword, that our wives, and
our children should be a prey, were it not better for us to return
to Egypt? And they said one to another, let us mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but all the Congregation bade stone them with stones, and the
glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the Congregation
before all the Children of <hi>Israel:</hi> And the Lord said unto <hi>Moses.</hi>
How long will this People provoke me? and how long will it be

and will make of thee a Nation, mighter and greater then they.
<hi>Numbers</hi> 2. 1. 5, 6. And they journied from Mount Hor, by the

it is His Footstool: neither by <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for it is the City of

For discovering the greatnesse of these sins, consider,</hi> Exod. 20. 14.
Thou shalt not commit adultery, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 13. Now the body is not for
fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord, for the body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.
It is reported commonly, that there is fornication amongst you, and
such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that
one should have his fathers wife. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. Let us walk honestly
as in the day, not in chambering and wantonnesse. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 3. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
and all uncleannesse, let it not once be named among you.
4. <hi>ver.</hi> Neither filthinesse, nor foolish talking, nor jesting,
which are not convenient. 10. <hi>Prodigality, oppression, extortions,
usury, bribery, theft, robbery, false weights and measures,
injustice and unfaithfulnesse in Contracts and Bargaines, with
fraudulent dealing and deceiving one another; Artificial dearthing
of victuals and other things, the livelyhood and maintenance of
the People. Exod.</hi> 20. 15. Thou shalt not steal. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 12. In thee
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29688:10"/>
have they taken gifts to shed blood, thou hast taken usury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbour by extortion.
<hi>Amos.</hi> 5. 12. They afflict the just, they have taken abribe, they
turn aside the poor from his right. <hi>Micah.</hi> 6. 10, 11. Are there
yet treasures of wickednesse in the house of the wicked, and the
scant measure that is abominable? Shall I count them pure with
the wicked ballances, and with the bag of deceitfull weights?
1 <hi>Thess</hi> 4. 6. That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in
any matter, for the Lord is the avenger of all such. 11. <hi>Lying,
slandering, backbiting, detracting, riviling, tale-bearing, rash censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and defaming and speaking ill one of another, with false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
and perjury, breach of Oaths, Covenants, promises.</hi> Exodus
20. 16. Thou shalt not bear false witnesse against thy neighbour.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 19, 20. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue
frameth deceit: thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou
slanderest thine own mothers son. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20. Left there be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
envyings, wrath, strife, backbiting, whisperings, swellings
and tumults. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 1. Iudge not, that ye be not judged. <hi>Rom.</hi>
1. 31. without understanding, Covenant-breakers, without natural
affection, implacable, unmercifull. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3. 1, 2. This know also, that
in the last dayes, perillous times shal come, for men shal be lovers
of themselves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to
parents, unholy. <hi>Before we close this Article of prophanity, we
cannot but in a speciall way take notice of the carriage of many
beggars in the Land, amongst whom for a long time past, abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of all sorts hath abounded; which sin lyes so much heavier
on the Land, because though it hath been generally known and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by all, yet hath no effectuall course been taken to
this day for the helping thereof.</hi>

                        <hi>THe third Article which relates to JESUS CHRIST and
the Gospel, is in a great measure spoken to in the Causes of
Humiliation, concerning the contempt of the Gospel, condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on by the Commission of the Generall Assembly at</hi> Perth, Dec.
22. 1650. <hi>yet some particulars there be in the Article, which we
shall now speak unto: 1. The resting on out ward and bare forms,
without studying to known in our selves, or to promove in others,
the Kingdom of GOD, which is righteousnesse, and peace, and joy in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29688:11"/>
the Holy Ghost. The Work of Reformation in the outward part of
it, or externall means, that do relate to Worship and Ordinances
of GOD and the purity thereof, is certainly a thing excellent and
desirable, which all the lovers of pure Religion and undefiled,
ought to endeavour to attain to and preserve, Ezra</hi> 7. 27. Blessed
be the Lord God of our fathers, who hath put such a thing as this in
the Kings heart; to beautifie the house of the Lord at Ierusalem.
<hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 42. According to all that the Lord commanded Moses.
so the Children of Israel made all the work, 43. <hi>v.</hi> And Moses did
look on all the work, and behold they had done it, as the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
even so had they done, and Moses blessed them. <hi>Ezek.</hi>
42. 11. And the way before them was like the appearing of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that were toward the North, as long as they, and as broad as they,
and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their doores. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2. Who was faithful to him that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as
Moses was admonished of God, when he was about to make the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle;
for, see (saith he) that thou make all things according to
the pattern shewed thee in the mount. <hi>But when these things are rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon and idolized, they do through our corruption become
snares to us, to keep us from seeking in to more excellent and
better things, to wit, communion and fellowship with GOD, and
the power and life of godliness, which are the kernell, whereof these
things are but the shell and the scrooff, and being rested upon, do
provoke the Lord either to make them barren and fruitlesse to us,
or else to loath us in the following of them, or to remove them
wholly away from us.</hi> Isai 1. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Hear the
word of the Lord ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the Law of our God
ye people of Gomorrah; To what purpose is the multitude of your sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
to me, saith the Lord? I am full of the burnt-offerings of
rams, and the fat of fed beasts: I delight not in the blood of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks,
or of lambs, or of he-goats When ye come to appear before
me, who hath required this at your hands, to tread my Courts?
Bring no more vain oblation, incense is an abomination to me, the
new moons and the Sabbaths, and the calling of the assembly, I
cannot away with, it is an iniquity, even the solemn meeting: your
new moons and appointed feasts my soul hateth, they are a trouble
to me, I am weary to bear them: And when ye spread forth your
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29688:11"/>
hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea when ye make many
prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood. <hi>Isai.</hi> 66. 1, 2,
3, 4. Thus saith the Lord, The heavens is my throne, and the earth
is my footstool, where is the house ye will build me, and where is the
place of my rest? for all these things hath mine hand made, and all
these things have been saith the Lord But to this man will I
look, even to him that is of a poor and contrite spirit, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
at my word. He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man: he
that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dogsneck: he that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
an oblation, as he that offereth swines blood; he that burneth
incense, as he that blesseth an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own
wayes, and their soul delighteth in their abominations; I also
will choose their delusions, and bring their fears on them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when I called, none did answer; and when I spake, they did not
hear, but did evill before mine eyes, and chose that in which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
not. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Trust ye not in lying
words, saying, The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are
these. Behold, ye trust in lying words that cannot profit. Will ye
steal, murder, commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense
to Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not, and come
and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and
say, we are delivered to do all these abominations? Is this house
which is called by my Name become a den of robbers in your eyes?
Behold, even I have seen it, saith the Lord: but go ye to my place
which was in Shiloh, where I set my Name at the first, and see what I
did to it, for the wickednesse of my people Israel. And now because
ye have done all these works, saith the Lord, and I spake to you, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up early, and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but
ye answered not: Therefore will I do unto this house which is called
by my Name, wherein ye trust, and to the place which I gave to
your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 20, 21, 22. As
for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in Majesty: but they made the
Images of their abominations, and of their derestable things therein:
therefore have I set it far from them. And I will give it to the
hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for
a spoil, and they shall pollute it; my face also will I turn from
them, and they shall pollute my secret place, for the robbers s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

enter into it and desile it. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 13. The remnant of Israel shal
not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither shal a deceitful tongue be

                        <hi>sound in their mouth, for they shal feed and ly down, and none shal
make them afraid.</hi> And this hath been undoubtedly in a great
measure the fault of many in this Land, the height of whose zeal
and endeavours hath been for the most part to attain the purity of
Ordinances, not labouring for the power thereof, whence hath
issued a great deal of boasting and confidence in a Covenant and
pure Ordinances, and a well reformed Kirk, when in the mean while
most men be strangers to that grace that bringeth salvation, and
teacheth to deny ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to live sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
righteously and godly in this present world. <hi>Titus</hi> 2, 11, 12. <hi>For
the grace of God that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men,
teaching us, that denying vngodlinesse and worldly lusts, we should
live godly, righteously and soberly in this presene world.</hi> The second
is the sad Consequents that hath followed on this, whereof there
be four speciall in the Article.</p>
                     <p>The First whereof is, The admitting of persons not rightly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
to the work of the Ministry, and Elderships in Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the continuing of such in these places. For understanding
of which, ye would consider, that the Word of God, and Acts and
Constitutions of our Kirk, do require of Ministers, not only that
they be men of knowledge, understanding and conscience, for ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the house of God, and of a blameless conversation; but that
they be sanctified and holy, and spiritual, and have their sences ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in spiritual things: <hi>A Bishop</hi> (saith <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 1. 8.) <hi>must
be a lover of goodmen, sober, just, holy, temperate.</hi> And the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle:
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. tels us, <hi>he must not be a novice,</hi> or one newly come
in to the faith. He would not only have him in the faith, that he
may speak because he beleeves, and be able to comfort others with
the consolations wherewith he hath been himself comforted of
God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord
Iesus Christ, even the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort,
who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to
comfort others who are in trouble, with the comfort wherewith we
our selves have been comforted of God.</hi> In the Acts of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1596, <hi>March</hi> 26. it is provided, That the
trial of the persons to be admitted to the Ministry hereafter, consist
not only in their learning and ablity to preach, but also in conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and feeling, and spiritual wisdom; and in the same Act it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
that such as shall not be found given to sanctification and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29688:12"/>
prayer, that study not to be powerful and spiritual, but be cold, and
wanting spiritual Zeal, that all such persons be censured, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
therein, be deprived: Which Act was revived in the Gen.
Assembly 1638. likewise in the Gen. Assembly 1646. The putting
in, and holding in of insufficient and suspected men, who savour the
things of this life; and the keeping the door straiter on these whom
God hath sealed, then on these who have less evidence of Grace
and holiness, is reckoned amongst the enormities and corruptions
of the Ministry in their callings; and amongst the remedies of these
corruptions, it is provided, That all Presbyteries make great consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to have all vacant places, within their several bounds setled
with godly and able men, wherever they be found. These Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and Acts, with sundry others of the like kind, require, not
only that a Minister be negatively holy, that is, one who is not scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
in his life and conversation, but that he be positively holy,
acquainted with God and spiritual things, and a partaker of the
grace of the Gospel in himself, which he preacheth to others; and
religious reason doth require the same: How shall he be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Minister, who is not a Christian? how shall he preach to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who doth not himself beleeve? how shall he know to speak
a word in season, to whom the Lord hath not given the tongue of
the Learned? to comfort others with the consolations of God,
who was never comforted therewith himself? How shall he pray
for others, who cannot pray for himself? How shall he reveale
Christ, who never knew him? How shall he naturally care for
souls, who hath not the love of Christ dwelling in him? The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
do also require of ruling Elders, not only that they be men
of understanding, knowledg, and wisdom, and such as are able to
discern and rule, but also that they be blameless and holy, as is
evident in the Epistles of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> And the
Discipline of our Kirk requires, That besides abilities to govern,
consult, admonish, and order all things appertaining to the state of
the Congregation, that they be men of a good life and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
without blame, and all suspition, careful for the Flock,
wise; and above all things fearing God: notwithstanding hereof,
many litteral and formal men, who are strangers to the mysterie of
godliness, &amp; work of the Spirit of life, which is in Jesus Christ, are
admitted unto, and continued in the Ministry and Elderships (nay,
in some places, especially in Elderships, men that are ignorant and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29688:13"/>
scandalous) by which things it comes to pass that there is a lifeless,
dead, and careless Ministry, and unprofitable Elderships in many
Congregations, and that the growth of the Gospel and godliness,
is exceedingly obstructed and hindered.</p>
                     <p>The second Consequent which is mentioned, is, The gross sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and mocking of Kirk Censures, and of Publick Repentance;
whereof it would be considered, That the Word of God, Acts and
Constitutions of this Kirk, do require of these who are to make
Publick Profession of their Repentance for scandalous offences, not
only a naked and bare profession of Repentance, but such a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Repentance, as doth hold forth a real conviction and sorrow
for sin; and not only the ceasing from the sin for the time, but the
bringing forth of the contrary good fruits of sobriety, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and holiness. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Speak unto the Children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
when a man or a woman shall commit any sin that men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
to do a trespass against the Lord, and that person be guilty;
then they shall confess their sin which they have done; and he shal
recompence his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it
the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath
trespassed. But if the man have no kinsman to recompence the
trespass unto, let the trespass be recompenced unto the Lord.
even unto the Priest: beside the Ram of atonement, whereby an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shal be made for him.</hi> It is appointed that offenders who have
wronged others, and were to be admitted to the trespass, offering,
should not only make confession of their sins, but also make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the party to whom the wrong was done, which satisfaction
is a fruit of righteousnesse; to which agrees that of <hi>Iesus Christ.
Mat.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brest
that thy brother hath ought against thee, vers.</hi> 24. <hi>leave
there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, and first be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> In that publick
penitentiall confession that is mentioned, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10 10, 11. <hi>Ye
have transgressed and taken strange wives, and increased the tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of Israel: now therefore make confession to the LORD GOD
of your fathers, and do his pleasure, and separate your selves from
the people of the land, and from the strange wives.</hi> There it not
only a confession of the sin, but a doing of the LORDS pleasure,
and a separating of themselves from the people of the land, and
from the strange wives. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. which was penned to be a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29688:13"/>
of <hi>Davids</hi> Publick Repentance, for the scandalous sins of
murder and adultery committed by him; and was therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the chief Musician, to be Published in the Sanctuary and
Temple, doth contain many not able Evidences of Repentance and
Reformation: And we see the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. doth not
give charge to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for the receiving the Incestuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
until he is in some appearance of hazard to be swallowed up
with too much sorrow. 7. <hi>verse Ye ought to forgive him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him, least perhaps such an one be swallowed up with over m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ch
sorrow;</hi> which doth argue that the Apostle thought a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of reall conviction and sorrow requisite in such an one, before
he ought to be received: According to these Scriptures, the first
book of Discipline, in the 7, head thereof requires, that before scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
persons be admitted to the Publick confession of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
that there appear in them signes of unfeignedrepentance;
and the form and order of Publick repentance appointed by the
Generall Assembly of the Ministers and Elders, in the which they
ought sharply to be examined what fear and terrour they have of
Gods judgements, and what hatred for sin, and dolor for the
same, and what sense and feeling they have of Gods mercies; in the
which if they be ignorant, they ought diligently to be instructed:
For it is but a mocking to present such to Publick Repentance as
neither know what sin is, what Repentance is, what Grace is, nor
by whom Gods mercy and favour is purchased, thereafter the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
shall be instructed in the Assembly, so that he have some taste
of Gods Judgements, but chiefly of Gods Mercies through Jesus
Christ, he may be presented before the Publick Kirk; And the Act
of the Generall Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1596. <hi>March.</hi> 26. That
none falling in Publick scandall be received in the fellowship of the
Kirk, except his Minister have some appearance and warrand in his
Conscience, that he hath both a feeling of sin, and an apprehension
of mercy; and for this effect, that the Minister travail with him in
Doctrine, and private instruction, to bring him thereto; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Doctrine of Publick Repentance, which being neglected,
the Publick place of Repentance is turned to a mocking. And the
Acts of the Generall Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> 1649. provids that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many heretofore have made a shew and profession of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
who were not convinced of their guiltinesse, nor humbled
for the same, but did therafter return like the dog to the vomite,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29688:14"/>
and with the sow to the puddle, unto the mocking of God, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great reproach and detriment of his Cause; Therefore for the
better discerning the truth &amp; sincerity of the Repentance of these
who desire to be admitted to the Covenant and Communion, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and ordained that none of the persons who are debarred
from the Covenant and Communion, shall be received and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thereunto, but such as after tryal shall be found for some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
time either before or after the offer of their Repentance,
according to the discretion of the respective Judicatories, to have
in their ordinary conversation given reall testimony of their dislike
of the late unlawfull Engagement, and of all the courses and ways
of Malignants, and of their sorrow for their accession to the same,
and to live godly, righteously, &amp; soberly &amp;c. And reason also proves
the same point, for whether we take Publick Repentance in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the removing of scandal and offence given to the Kirk, or in
reference to the absolution of the party from the guilt of the same
intimated to him by the Minister as the servant of Christ, and in
the Name of Christ, on his Repentance; it must alwayes be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of such a profession of Repentance, as doth evidence the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and humility thereof in outward fruits; for a real scandal can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be removed by a bare and verbal profession without fruits; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can a minister with any perswasion of conscience make any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
of mercy and pardon to him of the reality and sincerity
of whose profession he hath no testimony in his carriage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
Yet notwithstanding of these things many scandalous
persons of all sorts, especially these who were prophane Malignants
disaffected to the Work of GOD and his people this last year, have
been admitted to Publick Repentance, on bare convictions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and sorrow, without any reall evidence and fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in their carriage and conversation; nay, in many of them there
was presumptions in the contrary; which as it hath proven a snare
to their souls, so hath it exceedingly provoked God, and stumbled
the godly, and rendered Kirk Censures and Publick Repentance
base and contemptible.</p>
                     <p>The third consequence is, That the Sacrament of the LORDS
Supper hath been fearfully polluted and prophaned, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseuous
admitting of many scandalous and ignorant persons
thereto: The truth whereof in the matter of fact, as it hath been
the constant burden and complaint of all the godly Ministers and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29688:14"/>
people in <hi>Scotland</hi> these many years past; so it hath been oft
confessed in the Causes of solemn Fasts, and publick Humiliation
and particularly in that publick Acknowledgement of Sin that was
made by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the year 1648. that it may be
the better understood and taken up; ye would consider first what
persons by the Word of GOD, and doctrine of the Kirk of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> are to be debarred from, or admitted to the Sacrament
of the Lords Supper; how the rule of the Word and constitutions
of the Kirk are keeped in this particular. For the first, it is clear
from the Word of God, and the Doctrine of the Kirk of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
that all scandalous and ignorant persons ought to be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and that none ought
to be received and admitted thereunto, but such who do not only
know and make profession of the Gospel, but walke sutable
thereunto. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. appoints that
a man must first examine himself, and so eat. And he also saith,
That he who comes to that Sacrament, must be one who discernes
the Lords Body; otherwise, that he eats and drinks damnation to
himself; and he further adds, That this must be done in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of JESUS CHRIST, to shew forth his death till he come
again; and therefore such as by reason of their ignorance cannot
examine themselves, nor discern the Lords Body, nor knowes not
what it is to shew forth the Lords death, ought not to come. This
same duty of examination, discerning the Lords Body, which the
Apostle calls for, doth also debar scandalous persons, and admit of
none but such who walk orderly according to the Gospel, because
the examination here required, must be according to the nature of
the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, to wit, whether they be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
or not, that is, whether they have repentance or not; For he
that comes without it, is unclean, and so pollutes the Ordinance;
as also whether he hath faith or not, without which, there can be
no discerning of the Lords Body, nor shewing forth his death; and
whether they have love or no, without which, there can be no
Communion with CHRIST and his Members in that Ordinance.
The Confession of Faith of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Intituled, To
whom Sacraments appertain, speaks thus: <q>But the Supper of the
Lord (we confesse) to appertain to such only as be of the hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
of Faith, and can try and examine themselves, aswell in their
faith as in their duty to their neighbour; but if such persons ought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29688:15"/>
not to come, and if the Sacraments do not appertain to them, there
can be no question, but if they presume to come, they ought to be
debatred, it being a trust committed to the Officers of the Kirk,

for the Publick Worship of God throughout the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
in the Head concerning the Celebration of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
asserts, that the ignorant &amp; scandalous are not to receive the
Sacrament. And the Large Catechism asserts, That such as are found
to be ignorant &amp; scandalous, notwithstanding their profession of
saith and desire to come to the Lords Supper, may &amp; ought to be
keeped from that Sacrament, by the power which Christ hath left
in his Kirk, untill they receive instruction, and manifest their refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
And the Confession of Faith condescended on by the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Divines, and approven by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29688:15"/>
of the Lords Supper, saith, That all scandalous and ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as they are unfit to enjoy Communion with CHRIST, so are
they unworthy of the Lords Table, and so cannot without great
sin against CHRIST (whilst they remain such) partake of the
holy Mysteries, or be admitted thereto. And for proof thereof, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
these Scriptures, 1 Cor. 11. 27, 28, 29. <hi>Wherefore whosoever
shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily,
shall be guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord: But let a man
examin himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that
cup: For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lords body.</hi> 2 Cor.
5. 14, 15, 16. <hi>For the love of Christ constrainceth us, because we thus
judge, That if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he
died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live
to themselves, but to him that died for them, and rose again.
Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though
we have known Christ after the flesh, yet we henceforth know him
no more.</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 6, 7. <hi>Know ye not, that a little leaven leaveneth
the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may
be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover
is sacrificed for us.</hi> v. 13. <hi>But them that are without, God judgeth:
Therefore put away from among your selves that wicked person.</hi>
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 6, 14, 15. <hi>Now we command you, brethren, in the Name
of our Lord Iesus Christ, That ye withdraw your selves from every
brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which
he received of us. And if any man obey not our word by this Epistle,
note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be
ashamed. Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a
brother.</hi> Mat. 7. 6. <hi>Give not that which is holy unto dogs, neither cast
ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet,
and turn again and rent you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the other, how the Rule of the Word, and Constitutions of
this Kirk are keept in this particular it needs nor much be spoken,
the transgression being so palpable &amp; common that they who runs
may read, these particular faults may be taken notice of in order
to this point: 1. To say nothing, that in some places, few or none
at all are excluded for ignorance, but that persons being once come
to such an age, are admitted, and being once admitted, are never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
excluded: There is in many Congregations little or no care to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29688:16"/>
examine, or take any notice of the knowledge of all persons indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
something being done in reference to servants, and these of
the poorer sort, but masters of families and those of the richer sort
for the most part neglected, taking it for granted (as it were) that
they have knowledge, when indeed many of them are grosly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and ought because of their ignorance to be debarred. 2. That
the bare repeating of the Lords Prayer, the Belief, or ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
or answering a Question or two of the Catechisme by
rot-rime (as we say) when nothing of the meaning is understood,
is by many taken for knowledge sufficient. 3. There is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
care to take notice of all scandals and scandalous persons, in
which respect there is a twofold gross neglect: 1 That the scandal
of omission of Duty is not taken notice of, as well as the scandal of
commission of sin, notwithstanding that the Acts and Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Kirk make express provision for the one aswel as for the
other, as may be seen in their Acts against these who absent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on the Lords day from the Publick Worship of God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
masters of families who neglect to pray in their family, and
others of that nature. 2. The many scandals of commission are also
neglected, it being a custom in many Congregations to take notice
only of Fornicators and Adulterers, and workers on the Lords day,
and such as these; but do neglect Tiplers, Drunkards, Swearets,
Lyars, Deceivers of their Neighbors, Fighters, Oppressors, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners,
Covetous persons, and many others who walk contrary
to the Gospel; whereas it is expresly provided by the Discipline
of this Kirk, in the year 1587. that if the Eldership perceive any
thing in the Congregation either evil in the example, or scandalous
in manners, and not beseeming their profession, whatsoever it be
that may spot the Christian Congregation, yea rather whatsoever is
not to edification, ought not to escape admonition or punishment,
or higher degree of Kirk-Censure, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Sufficient to such
a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many.</hi> 3. That
many such as have been judicially convicted of scandalous faults,
are pressed and received into a publick profession of Repentance,
when as indeed there is no real evidences of Repentance, yet by a
profession therof are put in a capacity to come to the Lords Table:
By these waies it comes to pass that many ignorant and scandalous
persons are admitted who ought to be excluded; which certainly
is a fearful sin, as may appear in these and many other respects:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29688:16"/>
1. It hinders many poor souls from searching after knowledge, and
from departing from iniquity, and hardens them in their ignorance
and lewdness. 2. It causeth them to prohane the precious bloud of
the Covenant, and to eat and drink damnation to themselves. 3. It
makes the ignorant and scandalous promiscuously partakers of the
seals of the Covenant of Grace with the truly godly. 4. It provokes
the Lord to depart from his Ordinances, and forsake his Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of such dishonour to his Name. 5. It brings on the judgment
of God on particular persons and the whol Land. Lastly, it grieves
and stumbles the godly amongst our selves, and exposes our selves
and the Ordinances of Christ therein, to contempt and reproach
amongst others.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Consequent which is named to follow on the resting
upon outward and bare forms, is the keeping in of many continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; openly profane in the fellowship of this Kirk, by which is
meant the neglect of casting out such from the fellowship of the kirk
by the sentence of excomunication; for certainly these who do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
continue in their ignorance from year to year, slighting the
means of knowledge, and refusing to be instructed, or to learn the
way of the Lord: And these who do continue in an open course of
prophanity, making a profession of repentance, and still persisting
in their wicked way after sufficient pains taken on them, and their
slighting other inferior Kirk Censures, ought to be casten out as dry
and withered, corrupt and rotten branches, and not to be looked
as Members of the Kirk of GOD. <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 30. <hi>But the soul that
doth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the Land, or a
stranger; the same reproacheth the Lord, and that soul shall be
cut off from amongst his People. Psal.</hi> 50. 16, 17. <hi>But to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that
thou shouldest take my Covenant in thy mouth, seeing thou hatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and casteth my Words behinds thee? Mat.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Verily
I say unto you, Whatsoever you shall bind on Earth, shall be bound
in Heaven.</hi> And therfore it is provided in the old Acts of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of this Kirk, that who will stubbornly remain ignorant in
the principal points of Salvation, shall be Excommunicated: And
that every Master of Family shall be commanded, either to instruct
his Children and Servants, or cause them be instructed; and if they
will not, the Kirk shall proceed against them. The Gen. Assembly
at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in the year 1648. in the Overtures for the remedy
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29688:17"/>
of Grievances and common Sins of the Land, provided, That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
often guilty of gross scandals, be Excommunicated more sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
then ordinary Process, except there be more then ordinary
signs &amp; an eminent measure of repentance, made known to the Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Presbyterie. Besides these four, the Article also mentions
many other sad and fearful consequents unto the prophaning of all
the Ordinances of God, and rendring them bare, barren and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to us. And there is no question, but that formality in professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and resting upon, and idolizing outward and bare forms, brings
out many sad consequents besides these; such as the slighting by
many, and mocking by some, the work of the Spirit, not seeking
after communion and fellowship with God in Ordinances, not
studying to know, and be humbled for the iniquity of our Holy
things, not seeing a need, and imploying of JESUS CHRIST
for strength, and acceptance in all our performances; and turning
the living God to a dumb Idol: and many others that are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
and spoken to, in that Paper published by the Commssion,
concerning the contempt of the Gospel.</p>

                     <head>The Fourth Article.</head>
                     <p>The fourth Artcle hath two parts; the first whereof relates to
the neglect of Family-worship: which though it be a grievous sin,
which provokes the Lord to pour out his wrath on a People, <hi>Ier.</hi>
10. 25. <hi>Pour out thy fury on the Heathen that know thee not, and
on the families that call not on thy Name.</hi> Yet there be many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Families amongst all ranks of persons, Noblemen, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
Gentlemen, Burgesses, Commons, and even some Ministers
who lie under the guilt; nay, there be but few in which the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
will not be found to neglect, or never to have practised the
Duty: Instance is given in the Article of Great men, (Nobles,
Barons, Gentlemen and Burgesses of special note) because very few
are to be found amongst these who make conscience to call on the
Lords Name in their Families, some of them turning over the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
wholly on a Chaplain, or some other person in the Family; and
others of them having no such Duty in their Families performed at
all, either by themselves, or by any other, they being either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
or ashamed and unwilling to do it; whereas great and eminent
persons have accounted it their duty and glory, and have followed
it with much conscience and care, as may be instanced in <hi>Abraham,
Gen.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>For I know him, that he will command his children,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29688:17"/>
and his houshold after him, and they shal keep the way of the Lord,
to do justice and judgement, that the Lord may bring on</hi> Abraham
<hi>that which he hath spoken of.</hi> And in <hi>Ioshua,</hi> 24. 15. <hi>And if it
seem evill unto you to serve the</hi> LORD, <hi>choose you this day whom
ye will serve whether the gods that your fathers served who were
on the other side of the floud, or the gods of the</hi> Amorites <hi>in whose
Land ye dwel: but as for me, and my house we will serve the</hi> LORD.
And in <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Then</hi> David <hi>returned to bless his
houshold.</hi> This woful neglect of so necessary and profitable a duty,
especially in the Families of great Ones, usually attended with
the neglect of catechising and instructing of Children and Servants,
in the way of the Lord, and pressing and exercising them unto
Prayer and other religious Duties, as it is a great sin before God,
the height where of is encreased by their continuing therein, after
solemn publick confession thereof, and engaging to the contrary,
in the year 1648. and is expresly to be seen in the solemn, publick
confession of sins, and engagement to duties; so it is the cause of
much ignorance of God, Atheism and loosness, prophanity, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
and discontent that is in Families: and not only proves a
binderance to the spreading of piety amongst others who walks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their example, but also stops the course of the Lords blessings
on themselves and on their Families, and brings down upon them
many judgments and curses from the Lord. The other part of the
Article relates to the loathing and hating of godliness, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
reviling, oppressing and persecuting the godly: A sin,
as it is great in it self, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 9. <hi>And</hi> Sarah <hi>saw the son of</hi> Hagar <hi>the</hi>
Egytian <hi>which she had born unto</hi> Abraham <hi>mocking. Gal.</hi> 4. 28. <hi>Now
we, brethren, as</hi> Isaac <hi>was, are the children of promise: But as
then he who was born after the flesh, persecuted him who was born
after the Spirit, even so it is now.</hi> Ps. 14. 6. <hi>Ye have s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the poor; because the Lord is his refuge.</hi> Isa. 8. 18. <hi>Behold, I
and the children whom the Lord hath given me, are for signs, and
for wonders in</hi> Israel, <hi>from the Lord of Hosts who dwelleth in
Mount Sion.</hi> Act. 9. 4 <hi>And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice
saying to him,</hi> Saul, Saul, <hi>why persecutest thou me? And drawes
down a recompense of tribulation from the Lord.</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1 6 <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is a righteous thing with the Lord to recompense tribulation
to them which trouble you:</hi> so it seems to be a monstruous sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
a People, making profession of Reformation, and who are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29688:18"/>
so often covenanted to God in so solemn a way, and yet hath it
prevailed and abounded exceedingly this year by gone, in Court, in
Country, in Cities, in Judicatories, in the Army, and every where
throughout the Land: <hi>A man was made an offender for a word,
and he that departed from iniquity, made himself a prey.</hi> It was
quarrel enough, not to have run with others to the same excess of
riot: They who would not be disaffected and disolute, behooved
to be esteemed enemies to their Country: they who studied to
make conscience of holy Duties, and keep their integrity, were
slandered as Sectaries, and complyers with Sectaries, and were not
only exposed to the scourge of tongues, but also to the violence and
oppression of malignant, graceless and prophane men: Neither were
Magistrates and Ministers free of this sin, but even sundry of these
who ought to have protected, encouraged and countenanced the
godly, were as pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides; not
only by withdrawing their countenance from them, giving way
to others, to revile, oppress and persecute them, but by imploying
their own gifts and power in Judicatories, and Pulpits, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
for keeping them down, and making them hateful and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to others amongst whom they liue. And whilest we are
speaking of these things, We cannot but mention the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
and enmity which many Ministers had against the exercises of
godliness and duties of mutual edification, together with the great
blot brought upon piety, and the great blow given to the exercise
of godliness by the Act of the Assembly at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> not repented
of by the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor repealed to this day: and the great
neglect of the duties of mutual edification amongst the Lords Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and People, after there was allowance given for the same
by the following Assemblies, and the suffering of many giftless and
unprofitable Ministers not gifted of God to edifie his People, to
continue in the Ministry; whereby it comes to pass that many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
People were necessitated either to want edification in the
Publick Ordinances, or to fall under the censure of such Acts made
against such as did usually withdrawe from the Ordinances and
Ministry of their own Parish Churches. This sin of hating and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
down the power of godliness, and persecuting the godly, was
accompanied with another, which is mentioned also in the Article,
to wit, The countenancing and employing the ungodly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
a thing that the godly mans soul abhorred, <hi>Psa. 26. 1, 2. 3, 4.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29688:18"/>
Iudge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine integrity, I have

                     <p>THe fifth Article speaks of Covetousnesse and Oppression, the
one as the root, the other, as the fruit and effect thereof.
We need not to insist to shew what a sin the love of the World

frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> And to abhor them, Psalm 10. 3.
<hi>The wicked boasteth of his hearts desire, and blesseth the covetous
whom the Lord abhorreth.</hi> As that which brings the curse of
God on them and on their families, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Wo to him
that coveteth an evil covetousnesse to his house, that he may set his

nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil. Thou
hast consulted shame to thine house, by cutting off many people, and
hast sinned against thy soul. For the stones shall cry out of the wall,
and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</hi> And though it have
in it all these and many other mischiefs and evils, yet hath it
taken hold on, and doth cleave closely to many of all ranks in
the Land in their carriage and actings: Do not the Body of the
People spend their time in seeking after the things of a present
world; and according as they prosper, or are crossed in these
things, accordingly do they think themselves happy or miserable.
And there be Ministers not a few, that as they entered, so do they
follow the work of the Ministery for the things of a present world,
and are more for caring for these things, then for the souls commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their charge, and more eager in pursuing an encrease and
augmentation in these things, then in pursuing the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the beating down of Satans Kingdom, and the promoving of
the Kingdom of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. And hence also it
is as from a main cause that Ministers not a few, prove unfaithfull
in their duty, and unsutable in a day of temptation, rather choosing
to forbear to reprove and censure the faults of these who may bring
prejudice to them in things worldly, rather then to offend them, and
rather choosing to become neutrall and indifferent, or comply with
evill courses, then to hazard the losse of their stipends, but especially
the sad and wofull fruit of this wofull evill appears in Masters to
their servants, Landlords to their Tenents, Magistrats and Rulers
to these over whom they bear rule, Judges to these who come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, Advocats and Procurators to their Clients; Clerks, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missars
and Collectors to these with whom they have to do; Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Souldiers in the Countrey where they bear charge, yea
and amongst the Commons themselves, where they have any
power one over another; The Lord hath forbidden to oppresse an
hired servant, and hath commanded at his day to give him his
hire: Deut. 24. 14, 15. <hi>Thou shalt not oppresse an hired servant that
is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers
that are in  the land within thy gates, at his day thou shalt give him
his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it: for he is poor and needy,
and setteth his heart upon it, lest he cry unto the Lord against thee, and
it be sin unto thee.</hi> Yet behold, the hire of the labourer is by many
Masters keeped back violently &amp; fraudulently, and this cryeth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29688:19"/>
unto Heaven, and is entred into the eares of the Lord of hosts. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.
4. <hi>Behold, the hire of the labourer which have reaped down your fields,
which is of you kept back by fraud, cryeth; and the cryes of them which
have reaped, have entred into the ears of the Lord of sabbath.</hi> The
oppression of Landlords to their Tenents, are so many and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant,
that they cannot easily be reckoned, the Lands for the
most part set by them at a dearer rate then the Tenents can pay the
Duty, and live in any tollerable condition themselves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are they forced with their wives and children to drudge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in the earth from morning till evening; by which it comes
to passe, that their lives is but a kind of lasting bondage and slavery,
and that they have neither time nor encouragement for serving
and seeking GOD themselves in their Families, or for breeding their
children in knowledge, vertue and piety. Secondly, Beside the Rent
of the Land condescended on, they also lay on them many burdens
and taxations in an arbitrary way by their Bailiffs and Courts, and
otherwayes at their pleasure, such as services of all sorts beyond
paction and agreement, and quarterings; and beside the putting out
of the Foot, and the burden thereof, sometime the burden of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out the Horse, and the bearing of a great part, or the whole
Monethly Maintenance and Sesse. Thirdly, The giving of short
Laces of Lands, and removing them therefrom, and taking away
what they have when they grow poor, and are not able to pay, or
else if they thrive, by heightening and augmenting their Farms and
Rent, by which means it hath in the righteous judgment of GOD,
occasioned that Tenents in many places prove undutifull to their
Masters, and deny to them these things which in conscience and
reason they are obliged to perform. And for the Rulers, albeit we be
far from joining issue with these who from dis-affection to the Work
of GOD and the Instruments thereof, did traduce and speak evill of
those whom GOD set over us in their charge, and even in the
imposing of the most necessary burdens, and in the most moderate
and equall way, yet we cannot but acknowledge and bemoan the
great reproach that hath been brought on the chief Judicatories of
the Land, and on the Work of GOD, by the felfshness and particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of some persons of note therein, who not only contrary to the
practice of good <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who would not eat the bread of the
Governour, took large allowance for their attendance on Publick
Affairs: and notwithstanding that they had sufficient estates of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29688:20"/>
their own, but also abused their power and moyen for exacting and
imploying summes of Money for themselves, and for their friends
and followers, while in the mean time small regard was had to the
condition of these from whom these summes were exacted, or to
the equall supplying of the condition of others, to whom as much
and possibly more in desert and justice was due, as to these to
whom those Moneyes were given. We shall not insist on the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
that hath been amongst Judges, the cunning, cozenage, and
exorbitant pilferings and taking that hath been amongst Advocats,
Procurators, Commissars, Clerks and Collectors: many of them have
made haste to be rich, and have by the Bench, by the Purse, by the
tongue and by the Pen, heaped up much treasure, and made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of Lands and Estates, but with an evill conscience, because it
hath been the gain of bribery and injustice and lying and deceit,
violence and oppression; but amongst no sort of persons hath
these sins of covetousnesse and oppression more appeared and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
then amongst many of the chief Officers and Souldiers in
our Armies, insomuch that many of these who were raised for the
Lands protection and defence, have been their intollerable burden
and plague, and have by their most exorbitant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> violent, tyrannicall
and insatiable exactions, made the lives of the Inhabitants bitter,
and a burden to them: What interverting of Levies, what false
Musters, what exorbitant exactions above the Law for men and
horse and Arms; what Quarterings and covetous subtile oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
devices of many sorts for getting of Money have been amongst
Officers, and what plundering of Goods, destroying of Corns, taking
and robbing of Moneyes, railing upon, and beating and wounding
the poor people: what excessive eating and drinking, and unpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cablenesse
in their diet, not satisfying themselves with such fare as
people could afford to them, but killing their Kine and Sheep, and
what ever came in their way: and how many other things of that
kind hath been amongst Souldiers, and what exorbitancies and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
whereof the negligence and over-sight of some great ones
and officers in our Armies, was not the least cause; for they not being
able to shake their hands of dishonest gain themselves, did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wink at, nay sometimes obstruct the purging out, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of others; Amongst other effects of Covetousnesse, instance is
given in the close of the Article of the great Insolencies and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of many in our Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29688:20"/>
fearfull perjuries of the Land in the matter of Valuation and Excise,
both of which were dreadfull and horrible provocations: The first
of them as it was a grievous burden to our Brethren in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and did exceedingly stumble them at this Nation and the
Work of GOD in their hands; so we make no question but it
is one of the sins that GOD is pointing at now in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the rods wherewith he now chastiseth us. The other of
them though little adverted to, or laid to heart, or acknowledged
to this day, yet is a fearfull guilt which many in the Land ly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
How many in the matter of Valuations, that Lands might be
valued at a low rate, did swear falsely? And how many were there
who were Instrumentall to cause others to swear falsely? And
some Judges for their own advantage and interest, did connive
thereat: And many likewise did swear falsely in exciseable goods.
Before we close what relates to this Article, we desire that these
Scriptures may be considered, in reference to the sins mentioned
there, as the fruits of the love of the World and Covetousnesse.

                     <p>The sixth Article relates to the abusing and prostituting the
Publick Faith of the Kingdom, in the way of borrowing of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and otherwise: which no question is not one of the least pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
Publick sins in the Land. As private men ought so far to
have their faith and credit in estimation, for the love of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and truth, as not to engage the same but when they do sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
intend, and really endeavor to perform what they promise:
so much more ought publick persons, and the Judicatories of a Land
have such regard to the Publick Faith of a Nation, as not to engage
the same, but when there be some real purposes, and honest endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
to fulfil it: Because the prostituting and breach of Publick-Faith,
as it is an high provocation before God, so it is a great deal
more pernitious, reproachful, slanderous, and injurious, and of a
worse example amongst men, especially when it becomes common
and is used as a state engine, to draw in mens propriety from them,
under a vail and shadow of righteousness, and is attended with a
kind of conslraint upon men, to take the Publick Faith for security,
as it was in this Land. Job 15. 4. <hi>Yea, thou castest off fear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strainest
prayer before God.</hi> Psalm 37. 21. <hi>The wicked borroweth
and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy and giveth.</hi>
Isa. 59. 12, 13, 14. <hi>For our transgressions are multiplied before
thee, and our sins testifie against us: for our transgressiont are
with us, and as for our iniquities we know them. In transgressing
and lying against the Lord, and in departing away from our God;
speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the
heart words of falshood. And judgment is turned away backward,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29688:22"/>
and justice standeth a faa off: for truth is fallen in the street, and
equity cannot enter. Yea, truth faileth, and he that departeth from
evil maketh himself a prey. Aud the Lord saw it, and it displeased
him that there was no judgment.</hi>

                     <p>The seventh Article mentions two sins that many of this Land
are guilty of, in their first taking of the National Covenant, and
solemn League and Covenant, and renewing thereof. The first
whereof is, The ignorance that was in many, or the want of the
necessary knowledge of the things contained in the Covenants. The
Lord requires of al those that take an oath, That they do it in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

righteousness, and in judgment, and the Nations shall bless them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in him.</hi> That is, That they take it with such a measure of
discretion, judgment and understanding, as is needful for men in
their station, in order to the Duty which by their Oath they tie
themselves to. But it is beyond question that many in the Land
do swear these Covenants without the knowledge and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the heads thereof, so far as was needful for them in their
station; who when they were catechised on the particulars, do
know little or nothing thereof: Which, no doubt is one cause why
they have so little minded and followed, and do so little mind and
follow the duties contained therein. Jer. 5. 4. <hi>And I said, Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these are poor, they are foolish; for they know not the way of the
Lord, nor the judgment of their God.</hi> The other is, The taking of
these Covenants without reality and sincerity, in order to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
thereof: Which was to swear not in truth, as the Lord
requireth. Jer. 4. 2. <hi>And thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth, &amp;c.</hi>
not falsly. Hos. 10. 4. <hi>They have spoken words, swearing falsly,
making a Covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the
furrows of the field.</hi> And with an heart that was not right, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have they not been stedfast in the Covenant. Psal 78. 36, 37.

to him with their tongues: for their heart was not right with him,
neither were they stedfast in his Covenant.</hi> The judgments therefore
mentioned to have been, in some, example; in others, fear; and in
not a few, principles of policy, for attaining their own ends. Other
bad principles certainly there were in sundry persons, be side these,
but these are mentioned as the most common, and which ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>way
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29688:23"/>
with most of these who were guilty either of ignorance, or of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
in the entering into these Covenants. Many did take the
National Covenant, in example of others, it being counted praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
and commendable, after such a defection as was then in the
Land, to engage in such a duty, and to be reckoned amongst the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairers
of the breach: Many did take the solemn League and
Covenant, for fear; because the refusing to take it was attended
both with Ecclesiastical and Civil Censures, and therefore did
they rather choose to hazard on the OATH of GOD,
then to run these hazards amongst Men; which doth not yet
condemn the injoyning the taking of these Covenants upon a good
and warrantable principle. It is lawfull for the Judicatories of a
Kirk and State to injoyn to men cohabitation with their wives; and
to children, obedience to their Parents; to subjects, obedience
to their Magistrates, and suchlike under such respective relations:
Yet as these persons sin against God if they give obedience only
from a principle of carnal fear; neither doth the influence that
these relations have on them make the commanding of these things
under those relations to be a sin, because they are in themselves du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which are commanded of God, the neglect whereof may in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of scandall be censured by the Kirk, and in regard of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
that redounds to the honour of God, and good of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
be punished by the civil Magistrate. In taking of both Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
though there were many whom a principle of the fear and
love of God did move, yet there were not a few, whom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discoveries
have made manifest, who were acted thereto by carnall
wisedome and policie, for attaining their own base and corrupt
ends, such as riches, places of preferment, and lively hood, and
ease; and hence mainly hath issued that sin which followes in the
next Article.</p>

the one is the walking in the way of our own hearts, more
then in the Counsel of God: For when mens hearts are not single and
streight in reference to the glory of God, they love not to walk
according to the simplicity of the Word of God, but turns aside to
their crooked ways, to chuse such carnal midses as seem most plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to their carnal hearts, for compassing their corrupt ends: a siu
that was confessed in the publick solemn Confession of sins, in the
year 1648. And yet never have these crooked paths been more
troden in, and these counsels of flesh and blood been more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to, then since that time; which is one of the causes, <hi>why
the sword doth abide in our cities, and consume our branches and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:</hi>
For this the Prophet threatens against Israel, <hi>because of their
own counsels.</hi> The other, Trusting more in the arm of flesh, then in
the arm of the Lord; which hath been a constant and continued
sin in this Nation these years past; in doting on multitudes, skill,
and abilities of men, and numbers, and strength of horses; whence
have issued the corrupt mixtures in our Armies and the imploying
of all ranks of persons, how malignant and prophane soever: what
wonder then though our Armies have not prospered? but have
oftentimes met with a curse in stead of a blessing. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5, 6.
<hi>Thus saith the Lord, Cursed be the man that trusteth in man,

for he shall be like the heath in the desart, and shall not see when
good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

hath proceeded needless alienation of mind, and estrangedness of
heart, on the least difference in judgment amongst Brethren, often
attended with passion and spleen. Which makes our affection ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to favour our own image then the Image of Christ in others:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29688:24"/>
and our zeal against malignancie and error did divers times break:
forth into bitterness and reproach against the persons that did turn
aside, whereas it ought to have been accompanied with Christian

they have for saken the Covenant of the Lord God of their fathers,
which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the Land

And they rejected his Statutes and his Covenant which he made with
their fathers, and his Testimonies which he testified against them, and
they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen

and do the first works, or else I will come to thee quickly, and remove
thy Candlestick out of his place, except thou repent. <hi>This sin is aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by several circumstances mentioned in the Article, which are
clear in themselves, and need not to be insisted on: therefore
passing these, we come to speak of the special Heads and Steps
that are condescended on in the Paper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. <hi>Step.</hi> The first is, declining from that purity of conversation,
that integrity of heart, that zeal of God that seemed to be in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
at their first entry to the Covenant, and a falling off into loose
walking, self-interest and indifferency. About the time of the first
renewing of the Covenant; there was an sensible change to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in mens carriage and conversation; most of all these who joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in opposing the defection; not onely reforming themselves from
common and grosse sins, such as drunkennesse, uncleannesse, swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
prophaning the LORDS Day, flighting of the Ordinances,
self-seeking, covetousnesse and oppression, &amp;c. but giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29688:25"/>
to the Duties of Religion and Righteousnesse, such as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,
Edifying Discourse, Chaste behaviour, hallowing of the
LORDS Day, diligent seeking of the LORD in secret and in their
Families, attending on the preaching of the Word as often as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
is offered, liberality, love, charity one towards another,
a Publick spirit and zeal for GOD; but all these things are now
decayed in many, and they are again growen as ill if not worse then
before, which as it is an evidence of great unsoundnesse of heart,
so hath it brought many sad reproaches on the Work of GOD in
our hands, and hath proven a great stumbling block to many in the
neighbour Land, to make them averse therefrom, and hath given
them no small advantage to speak both against us and it, though
these, who do reject and speak ill of any part of the precious truth
of God be not to be justified in so doing, yet certainly they are much
to be condemned who by their untender and loose walking mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
occasion thereto: <hi>Wo to these by whom offences come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Step.</hi> The second Step is the sitting up of many Professors
in the Land under the Gospel, and becomming formal and remisse,
not entertaining tendernesse and sobernesse of minde, a sin that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
especially to the Godly in the Land, not a few of which have
much decayed in former tendernesse, and zeal, and diligent seeking
of God, and sober and exact walking, studying to root themselves
in the solid knowledge and love of the truth, and invaluing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the Gospel &amp; the means of grace unto a loathing and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of themselves, and a growing into and loving and imploying of
the Lord Jesus Christ. By which, deadnesse of spirit hath seized on
some, and lazinesse of spirit on others; whereby it hath come to
pass, that they have been tempted to step out of the way, and some
to turn aside to the left hand, to imbrace Malignant courses, and
some to the right hand to imbrace errour, whose sin is so much the
greater then the sin of others, by how much their knowledge and
the LORDS loving kindness to them hath been greater then to
others; and this declining of Professors, and falling off from their
first love, if it be not deeply mourned for, and if they do not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oussy
lament after the Lord, as it may prove a snare to many more
then yet it hath done, so it is like to be amongst the chief causes
that may provok the Lord to remove his Candlestick from us, <hi>Rev.
2 4. Neverthelesse I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29688:26"/>
left thy first love:</hi> v. 5. <hi>Remember therefore from whence thou art
fallen, and repent and do the first works, or else I will come to thee
quickly and remove thy Candlestick out of his place, except thou
repent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Step.</hi> The third is, the secret falling off of some, and
open falling off of many to the opposite party, after their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
to the Covenant; especially the defection carried on by
<hi>Iames Graham,</hi> and his party, and that of the year, 1648. by
the authors and abettors of the unlawfull Engagement, which
particulars are so well known, that we shall not need to stay
upon them. Onely we desire that it may be remembered, that
as they were early begun and long in ripning, that of <hi>Iames
Graham,</hi> having begun in the year 1639. and ripned till the
year 1645. and that some of the chief Authors of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Engagement having begun in the year, 1644. and ripned
till the year 1648. and did take hold upon, and infect very many
of all ranks throughout the Land, so have they been really and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feinedly
repented of by very few to this day: which we doubt not
is one of the reasons why so many of these who had hand in these
bloudy and backsliding courses have fallen by the sword, and are
gone into captivity.</p>
                     <p>4. Step. <hi>The fourth Step, is, The neglecting and condemning the
purging of Judicatories, and the Army, in the year 1649. and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
from scandalous and disaffected men, and of constituting
the same of men of known integrity and affection to the Cause,
and of a blameless and Christian conversation: That it was a duty
so to have constituted and purged the Judicatories and Armies,
ought in reason to be questioned by none: it being a duty holden
forth in the Word of God. That the Rulers of thousands, Rulers
of hundreds, Rulers of fifties, and Rulers oftens (amongst the
People of God) should not only be able men, but such also as fear
God, men of truth, hating covetousness.</hi> Exod. 18, 21. Moreover,
thou shalt provide out of all the People able men, such as fear God,
men of truth, hating Covetousness; and place such over them to be
Rulers of thousands, Rulers of hundreds, Rulers of fifties, and
Rulers of tens. And let them judge the People at all seasons. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.
15. So I took the chief of your Tribes, wise men, and known, and
made them heads over you, Captains over thousands, Captains over
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29688:26"/>
hundreds, Captains, over fifties, and Captains over tens, and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
among your Tribes. <hi>v. 16.</hi> And I charged your Iudges at that
time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge
righteously betwixt every man and his brother, and the stranger, that
is with him. <hi>v.</hi> 17. Ye shall not respect persons in Iudgment, but you
shall hear the smal aswel as the great; you shall not be afraid of the
face of man, for the judgment is Gods: <hi>2 Sam. 23. 3. 4.</hi> The God of
Israel said, The Rock of Israel spake to me: He that ruleth over
men must be just, ruling in the fear of God; and he shall be as the light
in the morning, when the Sun riseth, even a morning without clouds;
as the tender grasse springeth out of the earth by clear shining after ram.
<hi>2 Chr. 19. 6, 7, 8.</hi> And he said to the Iudges, Take heed what ye do,
for ye judge not for man; but for the Lord, who is with you in the
judgment; wherefore now, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take
heed and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of persons, nor taking of gifts. <hi>v. 9.</hi> And he charged them,
saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the Lord, faithfully, and
with a perfect heart; and <hi>Deut. 23. 9.</hi> When the host goeth forth against
thyn enemies then keep thee from every wicked thing. <hi>Therfore
were they unclean by Leprosie, by an Issue, and by the Dead,
to be put out of the Camp.</hi> Num. 5. 2. Command the children, of
Israel, that they put out of the Camp every Leper, and every one
that hath an Issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead. <hi>Deut. 22.
10.</hi> Thou shalt not plow with an Oxe and an Asse together. <hi>v. 11.</hi>
Thou shalt not wear a garment of diver: sorts, as of woollen and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen together;
<hi>because the Lord their God did walk in the midest
of the Camp of his People, to deliver them, and to give up his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
before them; therefore was the Camp to be holy, that he
might see no unclean thing in them, &amp; turn away from them.</hi> Deut.
23. 14. For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy Camp,
to deliver thee, and give up thine enemies before thee: therefore shall
thy Camp be holy, that be may see no unclean thing in thee, and turn
away from thee.</p>
                     <p>And because this Nation had exceedingly neglected the purging
of Judicatories and Armies, and constituting the same of persons
rightly qualified, which was the cause of many evils of sin and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment;
therefore was this neglect publickly and solemnly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to GOD, and the contrary duty engaged unto, at the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:29688:27"/>
of the Covenant toward the end of the year 1648. as is to be
seen in the solemn Publick Confession of sins, and engagement to
duties. For rendering of the which effectual, the Commission of
the Generall Assembly did present many Petitions, Remonstrances
and Warnings from time to time to the Committee of Estates, and
to the Parliament, who did make sundry Lawes both for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the Judicatories and Armies which then were, and for
keeping them pure for the time to come, as is to be seen in their
Registers and Acts, <hi>Anno</hi> 1649. and 1650. And accordingly some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
was done in that great and necessary duty by themselves and
others, to whom they did commit the trust, but not withstanding
of all these things, it did appear very soon after the Confessing of
that sin, and engaging to that duty, that many did neither mind
repentance of the one, or performance of the other. Therefore as
the Commission of the Generall Assembly were necessitated to
renew their desires in that particular very often, and from moneth
to moneth, so were not these Lawes and Committees having
power to execute the same, established without some wrestling
and difficultie: not a few labouring to obstruct and retard the
same, and when it came to the execution, with what neglect and
slowness, and partiality, did they proceed therein? And what impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
did they (who were not diligent) cast in the way of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who were more diligent and faithful, and zealous in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the duty? By which it came to passe, that little could be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
done in that matter, and what was done was not onely load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with imputations and reproaches, but also was for most part
made ineffectuall: The persons appointed to be removed, being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
keeped still, or shortly thereafter being brought again to their
own or some other place, or else as evill being put in their place.
Nay, after the defeat at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> these duties came not only to be
neglected, but what formerly had been gotten done therein, was
looked and cryed out upon, as the cause of the ruine of the Army;
and therefore not only these who had been formerly purged, but
all others how malignant and loose soever, were brought to the
Judicatories and Army, and what had formerly been confessed a
sin, was then followed and commended as a duty.</p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Step.</hi> The fifth is, The authorizing of Commissioners to
close a Treaty with the King, for the investing him with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29688:27"/>
upon his subscribing such demands as were sent to him,
after he had given many clear evidences of his dis-affection and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Work and people of GOD, and was continuing in the
same; and the admitting of him to the full exercise of his power,
and Crowning him notwithstanding of new discoveries of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to his former Principles and way, and of many warnings to
the contrary. For the better understanding and more full and clear
discovery of this sin, we would consider these things which are set
down by the Generall Assembly of this Kirk, in their Declaration
of the date <hi>Iuly</hi> 27, 1649. to wit, that as Magistrats and their
power are ordained of GOD, so are they in the exercise thereof,
not to walk according to their own will, but according to the Law
of equity and righteousnesse, as being the Ministers of GOD for the
safety of his people, &amp;c. Secondly, That there is a continuall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and stipulation betwixt the King and the People, as both of
them are tyed to GOD, so each of them are tyed each to other, for
the performance of mutuall and reciprocall duties, according to
which it is statute and ordained in the 8. Act of the Parliament of
King <hi>Iames</hi> the Sixt, That all Kings, Princes and Magistrats what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somever,
holding their place, which hereafter shall happen at any
time to reign and bear rule over this Realm, at the time of their
Coronation, the receipt of their Princely Authority, make their
faithfull Promise by Oath, in the presence of the Eternall GOD,
That during the whole course of their lives, they shall serve the
same Eternall GOD to the utmost of their power, according as
he hath required in his Holy Word, contained in the Old and New
Testament, and according to the same Word shall maintain the true
Religion of JESUS CHRIST, the Preaching of his most holy
Word, and due and right Administration of the Sacraments now
received and preachd within this Realm, and shall abolish and
gainstand all false Religion contrary to the same, and shall rule the
People of GOD committed to their charge, according to the will
and command of GOD revealed in his Word, and according to the
laudable Lawes and Constitutions received within this Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Thirdly, That in the League and Covenant that had been so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
and publickly sworn and renewed by this Kingdom, the
duty of defending and preserving the Kings Majesties Person and
Authority, is joyned with, and subordinate to the duty of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29688:28"/>
and desending the true Religion and Liberty of the Kingdoms.
Fourthly. That an arbitrary Government and an illimited Power
was the fountain of most, if not of all the corruptions both of
Kirk and State: And that it was for restraint of this, and for their
own just defence against tyranny and unjust violence (which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
is the fruit and effect of such a power) that the Lords People
did joyn in Covenant, and have been at the expences of so much
blood, travels and pains these years past. Fifthly, That the King
being averse from the Work of Reformation, and the Instruments
thereof, and compassed about with Malignant and dis-affected
men whom he hearkens to as his most faithfull Counsellours, and
looks upon as his most loyall and faithfull Subjects, being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the exercise of his power before satisfaction given, would
by these counsels, endeavour an over-turning of these things which
the Lord hath wrought amongst us, and labour to draw Publick
Administrations concerning Religion and the Liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
into that course and Channel, in which they did run under Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacie,
&amp; before the Work of Reformation: Which we had the more
cause to fear, because his Royall Father did often declare, That he
conceived himself bound to imploy all the power that God had put
in his hands to the utmost, for these ends, and that he adhered to his
Fathers principles, and walked in his way, and had made a peace
with the Irish Rebels, by which is granted to them the full liberty
of Popery. From these Principles the Generall Assembly did then
infer, That it would be the wisedome of every one who dwells in
this Land, to take heed to such a temptation and snare, that they be
not accessory to any such designes and endeavours of bringing or
admitting the King to the exercise of his Power, without satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
given concerning the security of Religion, and Liberty of the
Subjects, as they would not bring upon themselves, and on their
Families, the guilt of all the detriment that would undoubtedly
follow thereupon to Religion and the Covenant, and of all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
and calamities that it would bring on his Majesties Person
and Throne, and on these Kingdoms. Such a thing (say they)
would in all appearance be the under-minding and shaking off, if
not the over-throwing and destroying the Work of Reformation,
and that therefore whosoever attempts the same, do oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Cause of GOD, and will at last dash against the rock
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29688:28"/>
of the Lords Power, which hath broken in pieces many high and
losty ones since the beginning of this Work in these Kingdomes:
From all which it dotli appear upon good grounds, that it was an
high provocation, to admit the King to the exercise of his Power,
or to intrust him with the Cause and People of GOD, whilst he
was continuing in his former disaffection to, and eninity against the
same; with which sin the Lord hath been so displeased, that he
Hath in a great measure verified the same things on the Land which
are holden forth by the Generall Assembly, and which would be
the consequents thereof.</p>
                     <p>We know that it will be objected by many, That the King did
desist from, and abandon that course of enmity against the Work
and People of God, before the close of the Treaty, and that he did
give satisfaction concerning the security of Religion, and Liberty of
the Subjects, by condescending to, and subscribing these demands,
which were sent to him from the Parliament of this Kingdom, and
the Commission of the Generall Assembly. To which we reply,
First, that these demands were desicient, at least not so plain and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
and expresse in the main and necessary thing, to wit, a reall
abandoning of former malignant courses and principles, and a reall
and cordiall cleaving to the Work and people of God, without
which there could not be a reall security; it was not a shadow of
security for Religion and Liberty, or a paper and verball security
onely, but a reall security which we were bound before the Lord to
have evdeavoured and obtained before the close of a Treaty with
the King, for intrusting him with the Government, and to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
Commissioners to settle with him upon such paper-securities,
and accordingly to intrust him, was but to mock God, and to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive
the World, and to betray and destroy our selves, by giving
up all the precious Interests of Religion and Liberty into the hands
of one who was in a course of enmity to these. Secondly, it is
certain, (if men will not deny clear and evident truths) that the
King had not only (before the authorizing of these Commissioners
to close a Treaty with him upon his condescending to these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands)
given evidence of his emnity to the Work and people of
God, but also was continuing in the same, during the time of the
Treaty, and that he had not abandoned these Principles and courses
at the close of the Treaty; And when he did swear and subscribe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29688:29"/>
the Nationall Covenant, and the Solemn League and Covenant;
Nay, the whole tenour of his carriage, did then, and afterward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly
enough (to intelligent men) demonstrate him to be the
same he was before. We shall not need bring many instances,
therefore passing over these things which he did, before this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
began to treat with him, such as the Declaration emitted by
him when he was Prince, against the Cause and People of God, and
his Printed Declaration at <hi>Iersey,</hi> as King, against all who had been
in opposition to his Father in these troubles: We shall mention on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a few particulars that fell out thereafter, to wit, these: first, he did
not only countenance and entertain the most Capital and known
Enemies of this Kingdom, such as <hi>Iames Grahame,</hi> and others,
who had shed much of the bloud thereof, but also did give Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the said <hi>Iames Grahame</hi> to make war upon, and invade
the Inhabitants thereof, as Traitors and Rebels. Secondly, in the
whole progres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of the Treaty, as he did communicate and take
counsell with known dis-affected and malignant men in all things
relating to the same, and not moving a step, but according to their
advice, so did he procrastinat and delay to grant what was desired,
untill all other means of help had failed, and his own estate and
condition was now become desperat, and what he did grant, was
not all at once, and cheerfully, as if it had been a duty, but by little
and little, and by a kind of coaction and merchandise, as if it had been
a bargain of buying and selling. Thirdly, after the Treaty was
brought to some close, he did before his coming to Sea, receive the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper from one of the Prelatical Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
and according to the Servi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e-Book notwithstanding the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
of the Kirk did represent the evill thereof to him, and
did earnestly deal with him to the contrary. Fourthly, he brought
to Sea, and into <hi>Scotland</hi> with him almost the whole Train of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
and dis-affected men, who had followed him in his former
evill courses, and fled from the Justice of both Kingdoms, and these
he did more familiarly &amp; intirely converse with, then with others.
Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>thly, he was nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the coast of <hi>Scotland</hi> before he would condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to the subscribing of these Demand which were sent from the
Parliament, upon the report of the close of the Treaty, as it was
first closed in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Commissioners were so far out of
hopes of obtaining their desire, that even when they were come
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29688:29"/>
near the shore, they were preparing Papers of exoneration; and
when in an instant on the suggestion of some Malignants, he did
condescend to subscribe the Demands, and take the Covenant; it
was with a reserve of a Declaration to be printed therewith, which
he did not pass from untill the Commissioners of the Church did
refuse to admit thereof. Sixthly, Within a few dayes of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Scotland,</hi> when removing Malignants from his Family and
Court was earnestly pressed by the Commissioners both of Kirk
and State, at <hi>Falkland,</hi> he shewed himself very averse from the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
and did not only at that place, but at all places and times after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
countenance and entertain men of that stamp, who were in
his Family and Court, and came to the same. Seventhly, He did
for a long time refuse to subscribe the Declaration which was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to him, for the acknowledging of his own, and his Parents
guiltiness for the time past, and according to his duty for the time
to come; and after that he had, with a great deal of reluctancy,
subscribed the same, he did oftentimes express, That he did not
think his Father guilty of bloud, and that not withstanding he had
so declared, he had his own meaning thereof. Eighthly, As he did
first by Letters authorize sundry of the Malignant party to rise in
Arms without the knowledge of the Committee of Estates, and
contrary to the standing Laws of this Kingdom; so did he himself
within a short time thereafter, desert the Publick Councels of the
Kingdom, and joyn with the Malignants. Ninthly, During the whole
time of the Treaty, and after the close thereof, he had correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with all the Malignants of the three Nations, to sundry of
which he gave Commissions. These Instances do clearly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nough
prove what was said concerning the Kings continuing in a course
of enmity to the Work and People of God, which made it a sin in
us, whilest he was in that condition, to entrust him with the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of both: neither was our carriage here more faulty in the
matter, then it was rash and precipitant in regard of the manner.
The news of the late Kings death, brought to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> on the
Lords day at night, the Parliament did the next day before twelve
of the clock, proclaim this King with all publick solemnitie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
setting any time apart to seek the Lord for Counsel and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
therein; which, as both Reason and Religion might have
taught us, to have used more deliberation amongst ourselves, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29688:30"/>
more supplication to God, before he (whose Father and himself
had been engaged so much in opposition to the Work and People
of God) had been proclaimed King, and within a short time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
solemn Address was made to him for offering him the Crown
and Kingdom upon some verbal and paper security, without any
previous Address for informing his conscience, or taking notice
whether he did adhere to his former principles and way; and
when the Lord was pleased to render these Applications ineffectual,
and to bring back the Commissioners to this Kingdom and Kirk,
without any satisfaction to their desires; we did again no less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitantly
then before, rush on a second Address, which was at one
and the same day concluded and proponed in Parliament, not only
without any previous Consultation or Debate had there anent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
these who had been tender and faithful to the Work of
God from the begining, but without their knowledge, and contrary
to their expectation; and afterwards, in regard of the close and
dispatch of Commissioners, which was so passionatly and violently
driven on, that many were impatient, even of the most necessary
delaies, and of the most reasonable contradiction in any thing that
related thereto: and it is not to be past without observation, that
whilest we were treading these slippery and sinful steps, the Lord
suffered not us to want warning. We shall not insist on the sad
apprehensions that were in the hearts of many of the godly in the
Land in reference thereto: So albeit they durst not altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
duty to be in making Application to the King, yet did the sence
of the Lords controversie with him and his house, together with
his walking in his former way, lie heavy on their spirits and made
them rather fear a curse, then expect a blessing thereupon. Nor
shall we speak of the passionat inclination, desires and endeavors of
the Malignant party, and of their rejoycing herein, and of their
heightning of their hopes thereby. But we desire it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,
That whilest the second Address was in preparing, not only
did the Lord give us warning of presumptions, first of the King
his authorizing of <hi>Iames Graham</hi> to invade this Kingdom, and of
his encouraging him by Letters to go on in that Invasion, even whilst
he was in terms of a Treaty with Us; but also by <hi>Iames Graham</hi>
his actual invasion a little thereafter by the Kings Commission, and
by bringing to our hands the authentick Commission it self, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:29688:30"/>
sundry Letters under the Kings own hand, testifying his adherence
to his former principles, &amp; his affection to that great Enemy of this
Cause and Kingdom. And what were all these instances which we
have formerly spoken of in the Kings carriage, but warnings from
the Lord to have taught us wisdom in this thing? We know that
some may think it unsutable for us to meddle in these things which
seems to have been otherwise determined by the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of this Kirk 1650. and that others may wonder that that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
should have so determined. We shall not now stand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
how far that Assembly did approve of these things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Treaty with the King, anent the security of Religion: but
the Lord having declared so much from Heaven against the whole
Land, it concerns us and all others impartially to search into, and
to discover the causes thereof, so far as he is pleased to convince
and give light therein; and we do in charity, and not without
ground, presume, That of all the passages of procedor of the Kings
carriage in the Treaty, and from the beginning in order to this
Kingdom, and the enemies thereof, had been impartially and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discovered and made known to the Assembly as they have been
since; they had nor gone the length which they went.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Step.</hi> For understanding of the sixth <hi>Step,</hi> which rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
unto the rejecting the discovery of guiltiness and causes of
the LORDS contending with us; It will be needfull to speak
some what for clearing of the matter of fact in the instances which
are given in the Article: The first instance is in the causes of
humiliation, condescended on by the Commission of the Generall
Assembly at <hi>Leith,</hi> and offered to the Committe of Estates, by
whom they were rejected; the story whereof as to the matter of
fact was thus: The next day after the English forces came in view
of our Army, which was then intrenched betwixt <hi>Leith</hi> and
<hi>Edinburgh:</hi> Some generall persons in our Army (whether from
any desire to approve themselves to the King, who the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was come to <hi>Leith</hi> from <hi>Sterlin,</hi> or from any other principle,
we know not) did draw forth a great many of the Horse to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
with the Enhlish, by whom they were with some losse,
and much shame beaten back again to the trenches, which bred
such a disheartning and astonishment in the whole body of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that had the English then stormed the Trenches, they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29688:31"/>
gained them, and routed our Army. Upon this occasion,
the Commission of the Generall Assembly gave themselves to
search after the causes of this stroake and spirit of confusion and
astonishment from the LORD, and after some pains taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
found that there had been a malignant design for bringing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the malignant party of a long time, hatching and carrying on by
sundry in the Judicatories and in the Army, and that it was far
promoted and advanced: And for the more conviction herein, they
did condescend on severall Instances and Particulars of moment
and consequence: This they offered to the Committee of Estates
as grounds of humiliation to be keeped by them and the Army;
but the Committee, as they did refuse to take with any such guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness,
so did they refuse to joyn in any humiliation to be keeped
for the same Upon the which the Commission did leave it before
them with a Declaration, That they had exonered themselves, and
with a desire to the Committee of Estates to do therein, as they
would be answerable to GOD, who was contending for these
things. The second is the causes of humiliation, condescended on
at <hi>Sterlin</hi> immediatly after the defeat at <hi>Dumbar:</hi> these causes
which were first condescended on by the Presbytery with the
Army, and afterwards approven by the Commission of the
Generall Assembly did specifie somewhat of the crooked courses
which had been taken in carrying on the Treaty with the King,
and of the obstructing the purging of the Army, and of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories,
and of the Kings Family, and of the not differencing of
Instruments imployed in Publick trust, and severall other things
relating to the carriage of these in Publick trust in Judicatories and
Armies, which though reall truths in themselves, and just matter
of humiliation before GOD, yet were rejected and not so much as
read or intimated by many Ministers in their Congregations, and
were refused to be taken with, or acknowledged by sundry States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Officers of the Army, and others, who were guilty of
them. The third Instance is the Remonstrance of the Gentlemen,
Ministers and Forces in the West, which though it was a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
given in reference to sin and Duty by a company of men who
had been straight from the beginning in the Work of GOD, in the
simplicity of their hearts, and did contain in it many sad truthes,
yet was not onely rejected, but condemned by the plurality of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29688:31"/>
Committee of Estates, and Commission of the General Assembly,
notwithstanding that many of the Members of both these Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
did dissent from, and protest against these voices, and as if it
had not been enough, was again resumed by the Parliament and a
most harsh censure put upon it, and all such as did not disclame it
before such a day, appointed to be proceeded against with Censures
of an high nature; other testimonies of Presbyteries and Synods
beside these are also mentioned, for diverse such there was, as the
Letters from the Presbyteries of <hi>Sterlin, Aberdeen. Glasgow, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sley,</hi>
and severall other Presbyteries and Synods, which were wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to the Commission as testimonies of their dis-satisfaction with
the Publick Resolutions concerning the Leavy, and were rejected,
and sundry of the authors thereof sharply rebuked: nay, some of
them discharged to speak their Consciences, and confined in places
far distant from their charge for doing thereof. In the close of
this Article there is mention of the neglecting of means tending to
peace, and the preventing the effusion of more bloud, from pride
and biternesse of spirit, against these who had invaded us. We
know that before this Kingdom was invaded by these who hath
now brought it low, there was a Letter writen by the Parliament
to the present power in <hi>England,</hi> and duplicates thereof to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
Liutenant Generall, and Generall Major of their Army,
upon the 22. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1650. wherein they did shew that as in their
Letter of the 6. of <hi>March</hi> 1649. they did acknowledge their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
and declare their resolution, to observe the rule of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating;
first the breaches of Peace for craving just reparation,
of using all fair means of giving a preceding warning of three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths,
before any Engagement of these Kingdoms in war, so they
do again renew the same, and accordingly renewed the Acts of
Posture and Leavy for putting this Kingd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m in readinesse in case of
invasion, which were made the former year when they wrote the
foresaid Letter of the 6. of <hi>March,</hi> all which they do professe so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
to be done by them in the sincerity of their hearts; not out
of any policy to catch advantages, nor for any other end or design
whatsoever, but meerly for their own defence, which they do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
abundantly sufficient to remove all grounds of jealousies,
and misreports of their intentions, and to take away all pretence
of necessity of the marching of forces for defence of the borders of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29688:32"/>
                        <hi>England;</hi> and on the other part being informed of a resolution in
<hi>England</hi> to send an Army to Invade this Kingdom, they desired to
know whether these who have the present power in England do
acknowledge themselves oblieged, or by their answer will obliege
themselves and declare their Resolutios to observe the foresaid
way and order upon their part to us, and plainly and clearly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
whether their Forces do march for offence or defence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with intention for keeping onely within the borders of <hi>England</hi>
or comming within ours, which way of procedour for clearing each
others, and dealing plainly, is not onely agreable to particular Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and to the many Tyes, Bonds and Declarations past betwixt
these Kingdomes, but also to the Law of God, and practise of his
People in his Word, and to the common law and practice, even of
heathen Nations, much more of Christian Covenanted Kingdoms,
and may prevent many evils &amp; dangerous consequences, which may
fall out, even beyond and contrary to the intentions of the Nations,
by their Armies lying near others upon their borders, although
meerly upon intended defence: This did indeed savour of a spirit of
peace; but since the comming of these men into the Land there
hath been such pride and bitternesse of spirit, that not onely were
all essayes of peace neglected, but every motion tending thereto,
whether made by any amongst our selves, or hinted at by any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, were slighted and some time entertained with disdain,
reproach and contempt; and albeit the invasion was unjust, yet
certainly it was our duty to have followed and endeavoured peace
so far as was possible, <hi>Rom. 12. 18. If it be possible, as much as
lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</hi> Heb. 12. 14. <hi>Follow
peace with all men, and holinesse, without which no man shall
see God.</hi> Psalm 120. 7. <hi>I am for peace, but when I speak they are
for war.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. Step. <hi>The seventh is, the Publick Resolutions of Kirk and
State, for bringing in the Malignant Party first to the Army, and
then to the Judicatories, and the actuall intrusting of them with
the power of the Kingdom both Military and Civill; We conceive
that these Publick Resolutions in the complex of them do (besides
other sins which may be mentioned) include those: First, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the Enemies of God and his Cause, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by many clear Scriptures,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 1, 2. And Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat

and said to King Iehoshaphat, Shouldst thou help the ungodly, and
love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath on thee from
before the Lord. <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 1, 2, 3. Wo to the rebellious children, saith
the LORD, that take councel but not of me; and that cover with
a covering, but not of my spirit, that they made adde sin to sin: That
walk to go down to Egypt (and have not asked at my mouth) to
strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in
the shadow of Egypt; Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be
your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion:
<hi>Isa. 31. 1, 2, 3.</hi> Wo to them that go down to Egypt for help, and
stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many, and
in horsmen, because they are very strong, but they look not to the
holy one of Israel, neither seek the LORD; Yet he also is wise,
and will bring evill, and will not call back his words: But will
arise against the house of the evill doers, and against the help of
them that work iniquity: Now the Egyptians are men and not
GOD, and their horses flesh and not spirit; when the LORD snall
stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is
holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fall together. <hi>Jer. 2. 18.</hi>
And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the
waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to
drink the waters of the river? <hi>Jer. 13. 21.</hi> What wilt thou say

thou shalt provide out of all the people, able men, such as fear
GOD, men of truth, hating covetousnesse; and place such over
them; to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of

and violation of the fourth Article of the Covenant, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
that we be so far from giving trust to Malignants, that they
should endeavor to bring them to condign punishment. 4. That
there was therein a manifest receding from the solemn publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession

of humiliation these years past.</hi> Ier. 2. 35, 36, 37. Yet thou
sajest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shal turn from me:
Behold I will plead with thee, because thou sayest I have not sinned.
Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way: thou also shalt
be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria; yea, thou
shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the
Lord hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in
them. <hi>5. That there was a great deal of diffidence, and distrust in

and deceitfull dealing by many,</hi> Ier. 5. 2. 3. And though they say
The Lord liveth, surely they swear falsely. O Lord, are not thine
eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,

correction, they have made their faces harder then a rock, they
have refused to return: <hi>Because albeit the arguments that
were used, were taken from necessity and other things of that kind,
yet the great wheel that moved in that businesse, was a design to
bring in that party into places of power and trust into the Army,
who had been formerly put out for their malignant and disaffected
carriage, and thereafter, albeit in the beginning of this businesse
so great haste was pretended, that they could not wait for a very
few dayes, till the Commission might conveen, but made use of a
unfrequent and occasionall meeting, when not onely many of the
Members were absent, but also not advertised; yet when that which

was aimed at concerning the Modelling of the Army was obtained
they did move but very slowly, and Acted nothing at all for many
months thereafter; nay, not till long after the Army was compleatly
Leavied, and until they had gotten the Act of Classis also resemded,
and that Party brought to the Parliament aswell as to the Army,
and untill the Generall Assembly did sit down, that they might
have their approbation of these proceeding so far as was fit for
them to meddle with.</hi> 7. <hi>There was in it a reall stumbling and
offence to the most part of the godly in the Land, whose hearts
were much grieved, and their hands exceedingly weakened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
together with the making glad and strengthening the ungodly,
and disaffected and prophane in the Land,</hi> Ier. 23. 14. I have
seen also in the Prophets of Ierusalem an horrible thing, they commit
adultery and walk in lies; they strengthen also the hands of evill
doers, that none doth return from his wickednesse; they are all to me as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the inhabitants thereof as Gommorrah <hi>Ezek. 13. 22.</hi> Because
with lies ye have made the hearts of the righteous sad, whom have not
made sad and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not
return from his wicked works by promising him life. <hi>Lastly, the
state of our Cause was thereby upon the matter turned upside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down
by intrusting the Work and people of God to the enemies
thereof, it being known and made manifest that these men did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the same principles, and did drive on the same designs which
could not but prove destructive to Religion &amp; the People of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8. <hi>Step.</hi> The next Step, is, The joyning of many of the People
(who are engaged with God by Covenant to the contrary, no lesse
then the Rulers) with the Forces of the Kingdom; after that by
the Resolutions there was a prevailing party of malignants brought
to the Army, who had the strength of Counsels and Actings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and were carrying on a malignant interest; what ever question
there may be of the associating of subjects in war with the wicked
enemies of God, on the command of the Magistrate in a lawful
cause, which seems to us to be condemned in the People of God,
Isa. 8. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>For the Lord spake thus to me
with a strong hand, and instructed me, that I should not walk in
the way of this people, saying, Say ye not a Confederacy to all these
to whom this People shall say, a Confederacy; neither fear ye their
fear, nor be afraid. Sanctifie the Lord of Hosts Himself, and let
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29688:34"/>
Him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he shall be for a
sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence to
both the houses of Israel, for a gin, and for a snare to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Ierusalem, and many among them shal stumble and fall,
and be broken, and be snared, and be taken. Bind up the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
seal the Law among my Disciples. And I will wait upon
the Lord that hideth his face from the house of Iacob, and I will
look for him. Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me, are for signs, and for wonders in Israel, from the Lord of
hosts which dwelleth in Mount Sion.</hi> Aswel as in the Magistrates; the
ground of the prohibition, to wit, learning of their works, and the
ensnaring of the People, having a more immediate connexion with
the Peoples joyning, then with the Magistrates commanding them
to joyn; yet as the thing is laid down in the Paper we think there
will be no question about it, because it includes these Particulars.
1. The joyning of a People who with the consent and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nay by the commandement and authority of their Magistrates
had covenanted with the LORD, not to joyn with his Enemies.
2. That it was when the rule of constituting the Army was corrupt,
to wit, the Publick Resolutions, which made the case desperat
and left no place or remedy for purging of the Army. 3. That
it was when a party of Malignants who had the sway of Counsels
and Actings were brought to the Army, which being added to the
former, not only made the purging of the Army in an ordinary
way impossible, but also carried the stream and current of all their
Resolutions and Actings into a malignant Channell; that they
were the prevailing Party, is more manifest, then that time needs to
be spent in verifying thereof. 4. That they were carrying on a
Malignant Interest, to wit, the establishing the King in the exercise
of his Power in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the re-investing him with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in <hi>England,</hi> when he had not yet abandoned his former
enmity to the Work and people of God; and the securing of
Power in their own hands under him: And though none of these
four had concurred (all which we believe will be acknowledged
by un-byassed men) yet there was a sin in the Peoples joyning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
few or none of these who did joyn, did give any testimony
against the Magistrats employing of the Malignant Party, but went
willingly after the commandment, <hi>Hosea</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Ephraim is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29688:34"/>
and broken in judgment, because he willingly obeyed and
want after the commandment.</hi> It is acknowledged to have been
the Peoples duty, even by these who justifie their joyning with
them upon the command of the Magistrate, to have bemoaned it
before the Lord, and in their stations to have testified against it
before men.</p>
                     <p>9. <hi>Step.</hi> The ninth Step is, the prelimiting and corrupting of
the Generall Assembly, in regard of the free and right constitution
thereof. Generall Assemblies rightly constitute in their liberties
and freedom, as they are one of the most precious Ordinances of
JESUS CHRIST, so have they been most wholsome and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
means in this Kirk, for the purging and preserving all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of CHRIST in the Land; and therefore as it hath been
the care of all the faithfull servants of God in the Land, to vindicat
and preserve their right constitution and due liberty and freedom;
so in the promoting of any course of defection hath Satan alwayes
studied to intrench thereupon, and to corrupt the same. That the
Generall Assembly was prelimited this year, is evident by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
written by the Commission of the Generall Assembly to the
Presbyteries, with an Act sent therewith, appointing, that all these
who remain unsatisfied in the Publick Resolutions, after Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and did continue to oppose the same, should be cited to the
Generall Assembly; Which Letter and Act had such influence on
many Presbyteries, that though there were in them many able and
faithfull men who were unsatisfied with the Publick Resolutions,
yet very few of these were chosen to be Commissioners; and where
any such persons were elected, there was for the most part either
Protestations against it, or else another election of other persons;
by which it came to pass, that almost all these were incapacitated to
sit in the Assembly, and the Meeting was almost wholly made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>only
of these who had been instrumentall in carrying on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
defection, or were consenting thereto, and were approving the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof.
A more grosse prelimitation then this could not readily be that
men intrusted by the Generall Assembly with the Publick Affairs,
and to preserve the liberty thereof, should first (contrary to their
trust) open a door for bringing in the Malignant Party, and then
shut the door against the sitting of all these in the Assembly, where
their proceedings were to be tryed, who did not before their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29688:35"/>
there, approve of their opening the door to the Malignants;
which was not onely to make defection themselves, but to invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
others therein, and to take away the remedy thereof. Beside
this grosse prelimitation, there was also diverse other particulars of
importance that fell out in the Meeting it self, in the constituent
Members in the liberty &amp; freedom of voicing, which were set down
at length in the Protestation made at St. <hi>Andrews</hi> against that
Meeting, and the Reasons afterwards penned for strengthening
thereof, and therefore we shall not need in this place to repeat these
things, but recommends the reading of them to such as desire more
fully to be informed in these particulars. It were tedious to fall on
the Acts of that Assembly, and Warnings issued by them. These
things we now leave, as a subject requiring a more large and distinct
consideration; desiring onely this one thing to be pondered and
considered. That besides their ratifying and approving the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of the former Commission (which were in many things the
great grief of all the godly in the Land) in such ample manner, as
even (in way of expression) is not free of some flattery and vanity;
and besides the censuring of some honest men for no other thing but
only protesting against them; and besides, the emitting of Warnings
reflecting exceedingly on former pious and warrantable proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
they have laid a foundation for censuring all Ministers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
and for keeping such out of the Ministery, who do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of all these proceedings, which have this last year so much
vexed and grieved the godly, and so much rejoyced and made glad
the Malignant Party and wicked of the Land: And if these things
shall be accordingly executed and take effect, what persecution shall
there be of many godly Ministers, Elders, Expectants and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors;
and what a Ministery, and what a Church shall we have
in a few years?</p>

under all these, and under all the dreadfull stroaks of God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of his indignation against us, because of the same, so that whilst
he continues to smite, we are so far from humbling our selves, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:29688:35"/>
we grow worse and worse, and sin more and more: that it is so
with us, will not (we suppose) be denied by any godly man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, who knowes and observes the Lands condition, and the
present temper and carriage of the Inhabitants; every man crying
out almost for his affliction, but none almost mourning for his sin;
We think it may be truly said, That sin and iniquity of all kinds, and
amongst all ranks of persons hath been more multiplied and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in</hi> Scotland <hi>since the defeat at</hi> Dumbar, <hi>then in many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and that this Nation was not so dull, hard hearted, and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
under any of the former rods wherewith the Lord did smite
us these years past, as under these rods wherewith he now smites
us; and that this doth much highten our iniquity, and speak sad
things to come, if not repented of, is evident from</hi> Isay. 1 5.
Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more the
whole head is sick, and the whole heart is faint. Isa. 9. 13. For the
People turneth not unto him that smitteth them, neither do they seek
the Lord of hosts. <hi>v. 14.</hi> Therefore the Lord will cut off from Israel
head and tail, root &amp; branch in one day. <hi>v. 15.</hi> The Ancient and
Honorable, he is the head; and the Prophet that teacheth lyes, he is
the tail. <hi>v. 16.</hi> For the Leaders of this People cause them to erre, and
they that are led of them, are destroyed. Ier. 5. 3. O Lord, are
not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have
not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
correction: they have made their faces harder then a rock, they
have refused to return. Ier. 8. 4. Moreover, thou shalt say unto
them, Thus saith the Lord, Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he
turn away and not return? <hi>v. 5.</hi> Why then is this People of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
sliden back by a perpetual back sliding? they hold fast deceit, they
refuse to return. <hi>v. 6.</hi> I hearkened and heard, but they spake not
aright; no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have
I done? every one turneth to his course as the horse rusheth into the
battel. <hi>v. 7.</hi> Yea, the Stork in the Heaven knoweth her appointed
times, and the Turtle, and the Crane, and the Swallow observe the
time of their coming; but my People know not the judgement of the
Lord. Isa. 42. 23. Who among you wil give ear to this? who wil
hearken and hear for the time to come? <hi>v. 24.</hi> Who gave Iacob for
a spoil and Israel to the robbers? did not the Lord, He, against
whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29688:36"/>
were they obedient to his Law v. 25. Therfore he hath poured upon him
the fury of his anger, and the strength of battel; and it hath set him
on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him yet he laid it
not to heart. Lev. 26. 14. But if you wil not hearken to me, and wil
not do all these Commandements; <hi>v.</hi> 15. And if ye shal despise my
Statutes, or if your soul abhor my Iudgments, so that ye will not do
all my Commandements, but that ye break my Covenant: <hi>v.</hi> 16. I
also wil do this unto you, I will even appoint over you terror, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and the burning-ague; that shall consume the eyes, &amp;
cause sorrow of heart; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your
enemies shal eat it. <hi>v.</hi> 17. And I will set my face against you, and
ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over
you, and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. <hi>v.</hi> 18. And if you will
not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I wil punish you seven times
more for your sins. <hi>v.</hi> 19. And I wil break the pride of your
power; and I will make your Heaven as Iron and your Earth as
Brasse: <hi>v.</hi> 20. And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your
Land shall not yeeld her increase, neither shall the Trees of the Land
yeeld their fruits. <hi>v.</hi> 21. And if ye walk contrary unto me, and
will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon
you, according to your sins. <hi>v.</hi> 22. I will also send wilde beasts
among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your
cattel, and make you few in number, and your high waies shall be
desolate. <hi>v.</hi> 23. And if you will not be reformed by these things, but
will walk contrary unto me: <hi>v.</hi> 24. Then will I also walk contrary
unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. <hi>v.</hi> 25.
And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of
my Covenant: and when you are gathered together within your Cities,
I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the
hand of the enemy. <hi>v.</hi> 26. And when I have broken the staff of your
bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
you your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat and not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
<hi>v.</hi> 27. And if you will not for all this hearken unto me, but
walk contrary unto me: <hi>v.</hi> 28. Then I will walk contrary unto you
also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your
sins. <hi>v.</hi> 29. And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of
your daughters shall ye eat. <hi>v.</hi> 30. And I will destroy your high
places, and cut down your Images, and cast your carcases upon the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29688:36"/>
carcases of your Idols, and my soul shall abbor you. <hi>v.</hi> 31. And I
will make your Cities wast, and bring your Sanctuaries unto desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and I will not smell the savour of your sweet Odours. <hi>v.</hi> 32.
And I will bring the Land into desolation; and your enemies which
dwell therein shall be astonished at it. <hi>v.</hi> 33. And I will scatter you
among the Heathen, and will draw out a sword after you; and your
Land shall be desolate, and your Cities waste. <hi>v.</hi> 34. Then shall the
Land enjoy her Sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in
your enemies Land; even then shall the Land rest, and enjoy her
Sabbaths. <hi>v.</hi> 35. As long as it lieth desolate, it shall rest; because
it did not rest in your Sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it. <hi>v.</hi> 36. And upon
them that are left alive of you, I will send a faintnesse into their
hearts in the Lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf
shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword, and
they shall fall when none pursueth them. <hi>v.</hi> 37. And they shall fall
one upon another as it were before a sword, when none pursueth; and
ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. <hi>v.</hi> 38. And ye
shall perish among the Heathen, and the Land of your enemies shall
eat you up. <hi>v.</hi> 39. And they that are left of you, shall pine away in
their iniquitie in your enemies Lands, and also in the iniquities of their
fathers shall they pine away with them.</p>

                  <p>ALthough we are not ignorant, that mockers of all sorts may
take occasion by this Acknowledgment of the Sins of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
to strengthen themselves in their prejudices at our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Callings, and turn this unto our reproach, and that some may
misconstrue our meaning therein, as if we did thereby intend to render
the Ministery of this Church base and contemptible, which is far
from our thoughts, We knowing and being perswaded in our selves,
that there are many able, godly and faithful Ministers in the Land;
yet being convinced that we are called to humble our selves, and to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the Lord in all the contempt that he hath poured upon us: That
they who shall know our sins, may not stumble at our judgments: We
have thought it our duty to publish this following Discovery and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the corruptions and sins of Ministers, That it may
appear how deep our hand is in the Transgression, and that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of <hi>Scotland</hi> have no small accession to the drawing on of these
judgments that are upon the Land.</p>
                  <p>Only in this following Acknowledgment we desire it may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
That there are here enumerated some sins, whereof there be
but some few Ministers guilty, and others whereof m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> are guilty,
and not a few, which are the sins of these whom the Lord hath keeped
from the more grosse corruptions herein mentioned; And that it is not
to be wondered at, if the Ministery of <hi>Scotland</hi> be yet in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
unpurged, Considering that there was so wide a door opened for
the entering of corrupt persons into the Ministery, for the space of above
