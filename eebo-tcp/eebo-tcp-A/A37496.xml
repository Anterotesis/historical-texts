         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F it shall seem <hi>grievous</hi> to any, that I have dealt thus <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>plainly</hi> with Mr. <hi>Sydrach Simpson,</hi> one of the first <hi>pastors</hi> of an <hi>independent</hi> Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in <hi>England</hi>; let them <hi>consider</hi> how <hi>Paul</hi> dealt with those <hi>Brethren Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>to whom</hi> (according to his <hi>Zeal,</hi> and the present <hi>occasion) he gave no place by subjection, no not for an hour, that the Truth of the Gospel might continue with the Galatians</hi>; and though those brethren <hi>seemed to be somewhat,</hi> yet saith <hi>Paul,</hi> what ever they are, <hi>it makes no matter to me,</hi> seeing <hi>God accepteth no mans Person:</hi> And so notwithstanding their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi> he did not <hi>spare</hi> them. Yea, let them <hi>consider</hi> how <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> withstood <hi>Peter to the face</hi> for <hi>dissembling</hi> with the <hi>Jews</hi> in the case of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and for not <hi>walking uprightly according to the Truth of the Gospel:</hi> wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>publikely</hi> and <hi>sharply</hi> reprove him before them all. For no <hi>true believer</hi> is to keep <hi>silence,</hi> when the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the

               <hi>Gospel</hi> is <hi>corrupted</hi> by the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> or to be <hi>modest</hi> in this <hi>matter.</hi> Wherefore I was compelled to speak thus <hi>plainly</hi> to him, for his <hi>gross prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the things of God; and I am well <hi>satisfied</hi> in my <hi>conscience</hi> in the <hi>discharge</hi> of my duty, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall be the <hi>censure</hi> of <hi>carnal Christians,</hi> who have no <hi>true sense</hi> of the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Christs Gospel,</hi> or of the <hi>profit</hi> of his <hi>People,</hi> whom yet <hi>Christ</hi> so loved, as to lay down his <hi>life,</hi> and to be <hi>Crucified</hi> for them.</p>

               <hi>Again,</hi> if it shall <hi>offend</hi> any that I deal thus <hi>round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> against <hi>Humane Learning</hi>; Let them <hi>know,</hi> that I am not against <hi>Humane Learning</hi> upon <hi>all accounts,</hi> but do allow <hi>Humane Learning</hi> (so it be <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>serious</hi>) in its <hi>own place</hi> and <hi>Sphear,</hi> as well as other <hi>Humane things</hi>: But I do <hi>oppose</hi> it as it is made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>John Baptist,</hi> to prepare the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> into the <hi>world,</hi> or to pepare the <hi>worlds</hi> way to <hi>Christ:</hi> And also, as men make it <hi>necessary, for the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures</hi>; Yea, the <hi>very Unction for the Ministry.</hi>

and <hi>Knowledge) I say,</hi> if any think that I have <hi>too</hi> deeply censured these <hi>Universities</hi>; let them <hi>know,</hi> that I have done in this matter but as <hi>Wickliff, Hus, Luther,</hi> and several others, <hi>holy men of God,</hi> and <hi>happy Instruments</hi> in the hand of <hi>Christ</hi> have done before me. As for <hi>instance</hi>;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wickliff</hi> terms the <hi>Universities, Castra Caimitica,</hi> Cains Castles; <hi>Synagogas Satanae,</hi> the Synagogues of Satan, and affirms they were never Ordained or Instituted by Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Hus,</hi> (or <hi>Otho Brunfelsius,</hi> if he set out the Contents of the Chapters) calls them <hi>Satrapas Antichristi,</hi> the <hi>Lieutenants of Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> in his book <hi>Contra Ambrosium Catharinum,</hi> shewing out of <hi>Daniel</hi> the <hi>Prophet,</hi> that <hi>Antichrist</hi> is <hi>Rex facierum,</hi> the <hi>King of faces,</hi> or <hi>appearances,</hi> he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that <hi>the Universities are one of those faces of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and that they are very comely or sightly to look on,</hi> and <hi>yet indeed are a very chaos and open gate of Hell,</hi> and <hi>that in these the most choise youth of Christian people are prostituted, and are cast into the open throat of Hell</hi>; And that in these <hi>Aristotle is read, whereby the wits of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian youth are possessed &amp; busied with Humane &amp; Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Learning; Yea, are quite blinded and oppressed with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He saith also, <hi>that the Universities are the Woe, that the fifth Angel</hi> (mentioned Revel. 9.) <hi>brought upon the earth: and that who ever it was that did first institute and confirm Universities, he was a star fallen from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth</hi>: to wit, from the <hi>Gospel</hi> of Christ to <hi>Humane Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in his <hi>Exposition</hi> on <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. he calls the <hi>Universities the Mothers of Learned men,</hi> the <hi>Gates of Hell,</hi> and saith, they are called (<hi>Scholae,</hi> i. e. Ludi)

               <hi>Schools,</hi> that is, <hi>Plays by a fatall name, seeing they make sport with the Scriptures, and cast lotts upon them, as upon the Garments of Christ, every one dividing to himself a share of them, according to his own humane and Philosophical apprehension.</hi> And he saith, <hi>that the Doctors of these Universities are by the same providence</hi> called <hi>Doctores Scholastici,</hi> i. e. <hi>Ludicri, vel Illuso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii: School-Doctors,</hi> that is, <hi>mocking or May game Doctors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again</hi> he saith, <hi>those most glorious Mothers of studies, the Universities, stink before God with most loathsome abomination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>Universities</hi> are those <hi>Antichristian Souldiers,</hi> who put <hi>a Reed</hi> into <hi>Christs right hand</hi> instead of a <hi>Scepter</hi>: and this reed is <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that <hi>vain deceit,</hi> or as the <hi>Apostle</hi> else where terms it, the <hi>Operation</hi> of <hi>Error: by which Philosophy</hi> (saith he) <hi>the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py people of Christ began to be governed,</hi> that is, <hi>to be seduced, and to be led away from the Gospel of God.</hi> And this <hi>vain Reed</hi> they put into his <hi>right hand,</hi> by preferring <hi>Learning</hi> before <hi>Godliness</hi>; saying, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their usual manner of speaking) he is a <hi>Learned</hi> and a <hi>godly</hi> man; hereby making <hi>Learning</hi> to take place of <hi>Godliness.</hi> And yet this <hi>Philosophy</hi> is nothing but a <hi>weak Reed,</hi> which <hi>counterfeits</hi> a <hi>Scepter,</hi> rather then <hi>represents</hi> it, and so is nothing but <hi>vain deceit</hi>; for there is <hi>nothing</hi> propounded in <hi>such</hi> Doctrine but <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>lying,</hi>

the <hi>rules</hi> of <hi>sinful men,</hi> for worldly <hi>stipends</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

            </p>
            <p>And so however <hi>Religion</hi> for the <hi>outward form,</hi> hath been much <hi>reformed</hi> in these <hi>Nations</hi>; yet the <hi>Universities</hi> as the <hi>strongest Holds</hi> that <hi>Antichrist</hi> hath had amongst us, have still remained much what the <hi>same,</hi> not only as to the <hi>inward substance</hi> of all things, to wit, their <hi>Statutes, Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> but also in a <hi>great measure</hi> to their <hi>outward forms,</hi> as they were in their <hi>first Antichristian Institution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore it was <hi>necessary</hi> also, that I should be <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>free</hi> for <hi>Christs</hi> sake and his <hi>Churches,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these (as <hi>Luther</hi> calls them) <hi>stews of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> and <hi>Dens</hi> of <hi>Thieves,</hi> who have been, and still <hi>are</hi> the <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>fruitfull seed</hi> of <hi>Antichrists</hi> Kingdom in the <hi>world,</hi> out of which it might <hi>sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly</hi> on all <hi>occasions</hi> and <hi>opportunities</hi> grow up <hi>afresh,</hi> how greatly soever it had been before <hi>wasted</hi> and <hi>destroyed</hi> among the people, by the clear <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>mighty Providences</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> as it was <hi>necessary</hi> this work should be <hi>done,</hi> so through the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was I made <hi>willing</hi> to do it, seeing <hi>no body</hi> else more <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>able</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.

therefore according to <hi>Christs</hi> Counsel, <hi>sate down and counted the cost of this undertaking,</hi> and after all do say, <hi>the Lord is on my side, I will not fear what man can do unto me.</hi> And so I commit thee <hi>Christian Reader,</hi> to <hi>that Grace</hi> which is from <hi>God,</hi> to keep thee in this <hi>new hour of Temptation,</hi> if the <hi>Lord</hi> suffer it to <hi>come forth</hi> upon the earth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, if any shall <hi>Object</hi> in reading this <hi>Reply,</hi> that I, my self make use of <hi>Humane Learning,</hi> whilst I speak against it.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Answer,</hi> what <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Philosophy</hi> is here made use of? or <hi>who</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> are here <hi>quoted</hi>? I have <hi>chiefly</hi> made use of the <hi>Testimony</hi> of some <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Christians,</hi> who have lived in <hi>several</hi> ages, and yet have <hi>all</hi> witnessed by the <hi>same Spirit,</hi> the <hi>same Truth.</hi> And it is no more <hi>Humane Learning</hi> to quote <hi>Believers</hi> in the Church <hi>since Christ,</hi> then to quote the <hi>Patriarks</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> before <hi>Christ,</hi> or the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists</hi> which <hi>immediatly</hi> followed him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And <hi>last</hi> of all, If any say, <hi>I my self relate to the University, why then do I speak against it thus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that I neither <hi>do,</hi> nor <hi>will</hi> relate to the <hi>University,</hi> as it is <hi>polluted</hi> with any of the <hi>Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> herein mentioned: But as by the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> alone, I have been <hi>brought</hi> to that <hi>Relation</hi> in which I <hi>now</hi> stand, and <hi>continue</hi> in it, against the <hi>wills</hi> and <hi>workings</hi> of many; so through his <hi>good pleasure</hi> I will <hi>remain,</hi> till <hi>he</hi> shall otherwise <hi>dispose</hi> of me; and during my <hi>sojurning</hi> with them, I will not <hi>fail</hi> to <hi>testifie</hi> against their <hi>evil,</hi> and to <hi>endeavor</hi> to win all those whom <hi>God</hi> shall <hi>perswade</hi> to receive his <hi>Truth,</hi> from <hi>Heathenism</hi> to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and from <hi>Antichrist</hi> to <hi>Christ.</hi>

               <hi>Wherefore</hi> let none be <hi>offended</hi> that I am made <hi>willing</hi> to <hi>hazard</hi> and <hi>part</hi> with my <hi>worldly accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> for <hi>Christs Names</hi> sake; but let them <hi>rather</hi> praise the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which hath <hi>enabled</hi> me to <hi>witness a good confession,</hi> what ever <hi>worldly disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> I might run into thereby.

                  <note place="margin">No Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was taught in the Church of God all the time of the Old-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and <hi>these Vniversities,</hi> as in many <hi>other</hi> things, so chiefly in <hi>this</hi>; That in those <hi>Schools of the Prophets,</hi> named by him, the <hi>holy men of God</hi> freely taught the <hi>Youth,</hi> who came <hi>willingly</hi> to them to learn, especially in the <hi>corrupt</hi> times of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi>; I say they taught them <hi>only</hi> the Knowledge of the <hi>Books of Moses,</hi> and of the <hi>other Prophets</hi> then extant, and no <hi>Heathenish knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Disciplines</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at all. And these <hi>kinde</hi> of <hi>Schools</hi> began <hi>early</hi> in the Church: For the <hi>Fathers</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks</hi> after, <hi>all</hi> taught their <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Families</hi> the <hi>Word of God;</hi> And so <hi>each</hi> of their <hi>Families</hi> was such a <hi>School.</hi> And that we may not be at <hi>uncertainties</hi> in this matter, it is manifest <hi>what Doctrine</hi> they taught, by that which God himself saith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.19. <hi>I know Abraham</hi> (saith God) <hi>that he will command his Children and Household after him, that they keep the way of the Lord, and to do Justice and Judgement</hi>: This was the <hi>summe</hi> of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Doctrine to his <hi>Family.</hi> And this is <hi>farther</hi> confirmed by that of <hi>Asaph, Psal.</hi> 78.2.3.4. Where he saith, <hi>I will open my mouth in a Parable, I will utter dark sayings of old, which we have heard and known, and our Fathers have told us: We will not hide them from their Children, shewing to the Generation to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and the wonderfull works that he hath done:</hi> Where we <hi>plainly</hi> see what <hi>Doctrine</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> received from their <hi>Parents,</hi> and the <hi>Parents</hi> taught their <hi>Children</hi> from one <hi>Generation</hi> to another; to wit, not <hi>vain Philosophy,</hi> and the <hi>Disciplines</hi> of the <hi>Heathens, but the praises of the Lord, and his strength and wonderfull works.</hi> This also is <hi>manifest</hi> by the practise of <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> who sent his <hi>Princes</hi> with the <hi>Levites</hi> up and down throughout <hi>Judah,</hi> and they onely took the <hi>Book of the Law of the Lord</hi> with them, (and no <hi>Heathnish Authors) and taught the People,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97823:9"/>And <hi>Ezra</hi> after the Prophets return from <hi>Babilon,</hi> took onely the <hi>Book of the Law of Moses,</hi> and read it to them, and the <hi>Levites</hi> also read in the <hi>Book of the Law of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly to the People, and gave them the sense, and caused them to understand it.</hi> Nehem. 8.</p>

               <p>So that the <hi>faithfull</hi> Prophets of the <hi>Lord,</hi> during all the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi> had the chief <hi>care</hi> in their <hi>Schools</hi> to keep the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> among them in a <hi>right sense,</hi> according to the <hi>mind</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For seeing the <hi>Lords People</hi> are his <hi>Portion,</hi> they knew they were to be <hi>carefully</hi> Educated and Instructed in the <hi>right</hi> knowledge of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> them for the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to make them <hi>meet</hi> for his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> And the keeping of the Word and Doctrine of God <hi>pure,</hi> is one of the <hi>greatest matters</hi> of all in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi>: For as the <hi>Word</hi> is, such is the <hi>VVorship,</hi> such is the <hi>Faith,</hi> such is the <hi>Conscience,</hi> such is <hi>all</hi>: Wherefore the <hi>Holy men</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> would by no means bring in the <hi>Philosophy</hi> or <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> into their <hi>Schools,</hi> to teach that to their <hi>Sons,</hi> or <hi>Scholars,</hi> but onely the true, faithfull, and unmixed <hi>word of God.</hi>

And therefore I began humbly to intreat the Lord, that he would vouchsafe me his own light: By which means it shortly came to pass, that the reading of the holy Scripture did much delight and please me; and they being nakedly and alone propounded, did flow unto me with more ease, then if I had read them divided and distracted with variety of Comments. <hi>And as he rejected</hi> Philosophy <hi>wholly, and entertained the</hi> word, <hi>So did he only</hi> teach <hi>this word to</hi> faithful C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and flourished about the year</hi> 1230, <hi>in his</hi> Commentary <hi>on</hi> Jeremy <hi>the Prophet, speaks to this purpose,</hi> That the sixt Angel, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Revel.</hi> opens the bottomless pit, and brings out Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy into the Church; and out of the smoak of this Doctrine Locusts proceeded, and are spread over all the Church into every fruitfull place; and these Locusts he saith, are <hi>Scholastici &amp; Magistri, qui nunc facietenus blandiuntur ut decipiant, nunc caudetenus feriunt unsubvertant simplices &amp; incautos;</hi> that is, the Locusts are Scholars and Masters, according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademical degrees, who sometimes flatter with their countenances to deceive, and sometimes strike with their tails, that they may subvert the simple and unadvised. And to these Scholars and Masters, the ignorant and common people resort, and they open to them the old Cisterns of heathenish Learning and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, long ago stopt up by the Doctrine of the Apostles: and these Cisterns they open, by teaching Philosophy to the people: But they shut up the living fountain of saving water, that is, the word of faith: But the spirit of the Lord (<hi>saith he</hi>) in

               <p>
                  <hi>Further he saith,</hi> that as Antichrist brings forth his mark, which is Philosopical Doctrine in the Church of Christ, and by this mark all his Teachers and People are known; so there shall rise up against these, such as have the mark of Christ, or the sign of <hi>Thau</hi> in their foreheads, that is, the open and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Doctrine of Christ crucified. And as the signs of <hi>Moses</hi> destroyed the signs of the Magicians so shall the word or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cross destroy all Philosophical Doctrine, and Humane and secular Learning out of the Church. <hi>And then the</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>and</hi> youth, <hi>and, men of all ages, sorts and conditions, shall be taught no</hi> other <hi>Doctrine in the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Christ, <hi>then that which is found in the</hi> Scriptures, <hi>even in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the</hi> Prophets <hi>and</hi> Apostles, <hi>and that not according to any</hi> humane <hi>and</hi> Philosophical understanding, <hi>but according to the</hi> teaching <hi>and</hi> mind <hi>of the</hi> Spirit. And God by all his true servants shall destroy the studies of carnal Doctors, and Masters in Divinity, and shall dissipate all secular and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Learning, by the word of Truth in their mouths. And so shall the Church be reformed aright, when the Doctrine of Christ only shall be received and esteemed of, and shall live and flourish among Christians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thus as</hi> Antichrist <hi>hath laid aside the</hi> Scriptures, <hi>and all true</hi> spiritual <hi>and</hi> divine Learning <hi>out of his</hi> Schools <hi>and</hi> Vniversities, <hi>and hath brought into them, instead thereof,</hi> Philosophy <hi>and</hi> Humane Learning <hi>(and so</hi> these Schools <hi>are most unlike to the</hi> Schools <hi>of the</hi> Prophets) <hi>so in due time, when</hi> God <hi>shall undertake to</hi> reform <hi>his</hi> Church, <hi>all this</hi> sort <hi>of Learning shall be</hi> cast out <hi>again as dirt and dung, and the</hi> plain word <hi>of the</hi> Gospel <hi>only shall</hi> prevail <hi>and</hi> flourish <hi>among the</hi> Christian <hi>People: which time the Lord hasten for his Elects sake.</hi>

How much <hi>truer Doctrine</hi> had it been to have taught, <hi>that all true Divinity is contained in God and his word,</hi> and that we can know nothing of <hi>God</hi> aright but by his <hi>word,</hi> which <hi>holy men</hi> have spoken by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>believers</hi> do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>out</hi> of <hi>this word.</hi> All the <hi>Learning</hi> in the world doth not contain in <hi>it self,</hi> neither can it <hi>reveal</hi> to us <hi>aright,</hi> the <hi>least</hi> thing of <hi>God,</hi> or of his <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi>

               <p>But I <hi>conceive</hi> he might speak thus, <hi>that all Divinity is wrapped up in Humane Learning,</hi> to deterr the <hi>common people</hi> from the <hi>study</hi> and <hi>enquiry</hi> after it, and to cause them <hi>still</hi> to expect all <hi>Divinity</hi> from the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who by their <hi>education</hi> have attained to that <hi>Humane Learning</hi> which the <hi>plain people</hi>

are destitute of: For it is the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new design</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> to make the <hi>People</hi> depend on the <hi>Clergy</hi> for all <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> though the <hi>people</hi> have the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as <hi>near</hi> them, and the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> usually <hi>nearer</hi> to them then <hi>they;</hi> seeing <hi>God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if <hi>all Divinity be swadled in Humane Learning,</hi> then must it <hi>sadly</hi> follow, that <hi>all</hi> who want <hi>Humane Learning,</hi> must needs also want <hi>Divinity</hi>; And then, how shall <hi>poor plain people,</hi> who live in <hi>lawfull callings,</hi> and have not the <hi>leisure</hi> to attain <hi>Humane Learning,</hi> how shall they do to be <hi>saved</hi>?

For the <hi>Question</hi> between them, being touching <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prove that <hi>Paul</hi> was rude and unlearned, but the <hi>Christian</hi> through his simplicity did endeavor to prove that <hi>Paul</hi> was more learned and eluquent then <hi>Plato.</hi> And so the <hi>Greek</hi> should obtain the <hi>Victory,</hi> if the <hi>Christians</hi> Reasons should prevail. For if <hi>Paul</hi> were more learned then <hi>Plato,</hi> then might men object that he overcame not the world through <hi>Grace,</hi> but through <hi>Eloquence.</hi> Wherefore that which the <hi>Christian</hi> spake, made for the <hi>Greek,</hi> and that which the <hi>Greek</hi> spake; made for the <hi>Christian.</hi> Wherefore <hi>(he saith</hi>) when the <hi>Greeks</hi>

shall say the <hi>Apostles</hi> were rude, and unlearned, poor, mean simple, obscure persons, let us acknowledge it as the truth; For this is not their <hi>reproach</hi> but their <hi>glory;</hi> that being <hi>such, they</hi> yet overcame the Learned men, the Wise men, the Philosophers, the Rhetoricians, the Orators, the Princes, and all the world, as if they had not been men.

               <p>
                  <hi>And thus doth</hi> Chrysostom <hi>affirm, and prove that</hi> Humane Learning doth not fit men to the Ministry of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but is rather a hindrance thereunto, <hi>and that the</hi> Grace of God <hi>only fits them for this</hi> heavenly work.</p>

                  <hi>in his</hi> book <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,</hi> The Path way to perfect knowledge; <hi>where he sheweth, that it is not</hi> Humane Learning <hi>that helps to</hi> understand <hi>the Scriptures, and to</hi> profit <hi>in the</hi> study <hi>of them, but something
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97823:21"/>
more</hi> high <hi>and</hi> heavenly; <hi>His own words as these.</hi> He whose heart is full of love, comprehendeth without any error, the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, abundance, and largest teaching of Gods Scripture; For <hi>Paul</hi> saith, the fulness of the Law is Charity; <hi>and in another place,</hi> the end of the Law is Charity of clean heart, and good conscience, and of faith unfeigned; <hi>And Christ saith,</hi> Thou shalt love thy Lord God of all thy heart, and of all thy soul, and of all thy mind, and thy Neighbor as thy self: For in these two Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hangeth all the Law and the Prophets: And as the root of all evil is Covetousness, so the root of all good is Love.</p>
               <p>Charity by which we love God, and the Neighbour, holdeth surely all the greatness and largness of Gods speeches. Therefore, if we have not leisure to search all the holy Scriptures, and to pierce into all the privities of them; hold thou love, whereon all things hang, and so shalt thou hold that which thou learnest there, and also that which thou learnest not. For if thou know Charity, thou knowest something, whereon also that hangeth which thou knowest not. And in that that thou understandest in Scripture, love is open; and in that that thou understandest not, love is hid. Therefore he that holdeth love in vertues or good life, holdeth both that which is open, and that which is hid in Gods word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> after <hi>speaking to the</hi> Clergy, <hi>he saith,</hi> Therefore worldly fools, do ye first repent of your sins, and forsake pride and covetousness, and be ye meek, and fear ye God in all things, and love your neighbour as your self, and then shall ye profit in the study of Holy Writ. <hi>And this is a</hi> far <hi>other way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Scriptures then</hi> Humane Learning.<note place="margin">

It seemeth well that God will not cease from vengeance, till it and other things be punished sore. For it seemeth that worldly Clerks, and feignedly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, do this under pretence, that simple men of wit and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge know not Gods Law to preach it generally against sins in the Realm.

that God both can, and may if it liketh him, speed simple men out of the Vniversity, as much to know the holy Scriptures, as Masters in the Vniversity. Wherefore (<hi>he saith</hi>) it is no great matter, though men of good will be not poysoned with Heathen mens error nine or ten years together; But let them live well, and study the holy Scriptures, and preach truly and freely against open sins till death. <hi>Thus he. Whereby he declares that the</hi> Scriptures <hi>are not to be understood by</hi> Humane Learning, <hi>but by</hi> faith <hi>and</hi> love: <hi>And that</hi> Humane Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>doth not prepare men to the</hi> knowledge <hi>of the</hi> word, <hi>but rather</hi> corrupt <hi>them with</hi> Heathen mens <hi>Errors.</hi>

Now (saith he</hi>) Aristotles <hi>Doctrine is,</hi> that the world was without begining, and shall be without end, and that the first man never was, and the last never shall be: And that God doth all of necessity, neither careth what we do. <hi>Without this Doctrine (saith he Ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally) how could we understand the Scripture, that saith,</hi> God Created the World of nought, and God worketh all things of his free will, and for a secret purpose, and that we shall rise again, and God will have accounts of all that we have done in this life.</p>
               <p>Aristotle <hi>saith,</hi> Give a man a Law, and he hath power of himself to do, or fulfill the Law, and becometh righteous with working righteously. <hi>But</hi> Paul <hi>and all the Scripture saith,</hi> That the Law doth but utter sin only, and helpeth not; Neither hath any man power to do the Law, till the Spirit of God be given him through faith in Christ. Is it a not madness then to say that we could not understand the Scripture without <hi>Aristotle?</hi> Moreover <hi>Aristotles</hi> felicity and blessedness standeth in avoiding all tribulations, and in riches, health, honor, worship, friends, and authority, which felicity pleaseth our spirituality well <hi>Now without these and a thousand such like points, couldst thou not understand Scripture, which saith,</hi> that Righteousness

cometh by Christ, and not of mans will: And how that vertues are the fruits and gifts of Gods Spirit, and that Christ blesseth us in tribulations, persecution, and adversity. <hi>How I say;</hi> couldst thou understand the Scriptures without Philosophy, <hi>in as much as</hi> Paul, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. warned them to beware lest any man spoyl them (<hi>that is to say,</hi> rob them of their faith in Christ) through Philosophy and deceitfull Vanities, and through the Traditions of men, and Ordinances after the world, and not after Christ? — <hi>And after</hi> — But now ye drive them from Gods word, and will let no man come thereto, untill he have been two years Master of Art.

               <note place="margin">University-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</note> 
               <hi>being most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly contrary to the word of the Gospel, and the light that shines in the New Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97823:33"/>For first, In the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>God our Saviour,</hi> we learn, That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> onely a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>heavenly birth</hi> makes men to be of the <hi>true Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Degrees in the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> and that the <hi>pouring</hi> forth of the <hi>spirit</hi> on these <hi>children</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> according to the <hi>measure</hi> of the <hi>gift of God,</hi> makes Christians of <hi>several Degrees</hi> in this Church, and not <hi>Academical Graduations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In this <hi>Gospel</hi> also we are taught, that all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> true <hi>Ministers of Christ</hi> are <hi>equal,</hi> and not one <hi>superior</hi> to another, as these <hi>Degrees</hi> make them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In this <hi>Gospel</hi> also we are taught, that the <hi>true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> greatness</hi> amongst <hi>Christs</hi> true <hi>Disciples,</hi> doth not stand in <hi>Academical Degrees,</hi> or <hi>worldly honour</hi> and <hi>Dignities,</hi> but in the <hi>faithfuls</hi> neer and exact <hi>following</hi> of <hi>Christ in</hi> word <hi>and</hi> conversation; and that the <hi>sons</hi> of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> in desiring <hi>superiority</hi> and <hi>pre-eminence</hi> above the <hi>other</hi> Disciples, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> did grievously <hi>offend,</hi> and were therefore sharply <hi>rebuked</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Yea here, we hear <hi>Christ himself</hi> forbidding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this <hi>very thing</hi> to <hi>his</hi> Disciples, that <hi>Antichrist</hi> and his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> might have no <hi>cloak</hi> for doing the <hi>contrary,</hi> where his <hi>Gospel</hi> is <hi>truely</hi> taught and published. For <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>Christ doth forbid his Disciples before all the multitude, to be as the Jewish Rabbies or Doctors, who</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>do their works to be seen of men,</hi> and <hi>disguise</hi> themselves with <hi>different gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> or <hi>habits</hi> from <hi>others</hi> (that they might be the more taken <hi>notice</hi> of, and have the more <hi>respect) and do love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the Synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men Doctor, Doctor</hi>; but saith Christ to his Disciples, <hi>Be not ye called Doctor, for one is your Master, even Christ, and ye all are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> and so equal.</p>
            <p>Whence it is <hi>evident,</hi> that this <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Universities</hi> and <hi>Colledges</hi> in giving men <hi>Degrees</hi> in <hi>Divinity,</hi> as they call it, and <hi>Titles, Habits,</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> accordingly, is <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>express command</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and so is a meer <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Antichrist,</hi> to put <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> on his Ministers.</p>
            <p>It is also <hi>manifest,</hi> that this <hi>practise</hi> of the <hi>Universities,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97823:34"/>

            <p>It is also <hi>manifest,</hi> that these <hi>Degrees</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> do cause men to be <hi>proud,</hi> and to lift <hi>themselves</hi> up above their <hi>brethren,</hi> and to think themselves <hi>something</hi> when they are <hi>nothing</hi>; such <hi>Graduates,</hi> u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Farther, these <hi>Degrees</hi> are a <hi>dangerous snare</hi> to <hi>simple</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, causing <hi>them</hi> to receive <hi>all</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Conradus Pellican</hi> also, a godly preacher, having the sense of this on his death-bed, desired his friends, that he might by no means be buryed, as the manner then was, in the <hi>habit</hi> of a <hi>Doctor, quia sperabat se resurrecturum ad judicium non ut Doctorem, sed ut humilem Christianum</hi>; because he hoped he should rise to judgement, not as a Doctor, but as a humble Christian.</p>
            <p>Now me thinks, the <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>precious word</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, should take off the <hi>Universities</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> from <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> these <hi>Degrees</hi> and <hi>titles,</hi> if they do in <hi>good earnest</hi> profess themselves to be his <hi>Disciples</hi>; but how much ought they to be ashamed and confounded, when they see other believers, for the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>word,</hi> utterly <hi>renouncing</hi> these things before their <hi>faces,</hi> that they, if they <hi>persist,</hi> may be left <hi>wholly</hi> without <hi>excuse</hi> before <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Church.</hi>

And yet under these sins and destructions, Science and Sapience are promised. Yea Titles and Degrees are given in stead of rewards.</p>
            <p>But what do they perform at length? First, the more choice youth of christian people are here prostituted, and are cast into the open throat of Hell, that I verily think this destruction was figured by the Idol Moloch, to whom anciently they made their

Afterwards <hi>Aristotle</hi> being read to them, and not rightly understood, the wits of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian youth are exercised with heathenish and humane learning, yea, are quite blinded and oppressed with it. And in stead of the Word of God, the doctrine of Antichrist is delivered, that it may seem, the devil himself could not bring forth a more subtile and effectual Invention and engine, Eutterly to extinguish the Gospel, then to set up Universities. Wherein, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Christian Doctrine, nothing should be taught but that which is most contrary to the Christian Faith.

            </p>
            <p>And truly to me, this last face of Antichrist seems to be the most hurtful of all, because this hath the pretence of the Word, when all the rest have onely the colour of Example; and this is plainly Schola Hidoth, the School of Propositions, of which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.

               </gap>loch, <hi>saith thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moses and Jeremy have described the worship of this Idol to be after this manner, that they did burn or offer to him their children in the fire, supposing that hereby they did perform the greatest and highest service to God, inasmuch as after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Abraham they do not spare their own children, though they do this, not onely not being called as Abraham was, but also without faith, &amp; in the highest wickedness; and therefore the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist testifies, Psal. 78. <hi>That they offered not their children to God, but to Devils.</hi> For whatsoever is not done by the call and command of God, is not done to <hi>God</hi> but <hi>devils,</hi> who sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest this, though it be done under pretence of the name of God.</p>
            <p>Now hereby <hi>(saith he)</hi> I conceive the <hi>Universities</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, in which the best and choicest part of Christian youth is offered, as it were in burnt sacrifice to God, that there they may be instructed, and be made as it were wholly divine. For the common people believe there is no place under heaven, in which youth can be better instructed, so that even religious people have recourse hither. For to learn any thing out of the University, is to learn nothing: but to have studyed in the University, is to know all things. There all Divine and Humane things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived to be taught: for no man sends his son hither with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion then this, that he can nowhere be better sent. They think they performe the highest service to God, that they offer their sons to be formed according to the instruction of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that thereby they may become profitable and useful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Preachers, Governors, who may wholly become Gods own portion, and be useful both to God and men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:97823:42"/>And hereto appertains the name <hi>Moloch,</hi> which signifies a King, or kingly, because this kinde of study doth honour them with <hi>Degrees</hi> and <hi>Promotions,</hi> and renders them fit and able to govern others. For we see that all that are preferred to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,</hi> are taken out of <hi>Universities:</hi> and he that is not a <hi>Graduate</hi> or <hi>Member</hi> of an <hi>University,</hi> is not qualified for preferment, or to be set over any people: but <hi>let the Ass first be crowned</hi> (to wit, with a Degree) <hi>and then let him reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And parents do not see, and they that do see, do not regard, that youth are usually here destroyed, though rude and vile manners, none commonly forbidding them. Yea fornications, lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, and other manifest sins do but <hi>mildly</hi> destroy them, but that they are indued and possessed with Philosophical, heathenish, humane, wicked, and impious opinions, this is the <hi>fire of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch,</hi> which no tears can sufficiently bewail, seeing through this they especially are devoured and perish, who are the most studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and modest youth in Universities. So great is the fury of God upon this <hi>Valley of Tophet and Hinnom,</hi> that they perish more grievously who learn most, and live modestly, then they who learn nothing and are corrupted with lusts. For these learn nothing which is to be <hi>unlearned</hi> again, seeing they know they do evil; whereas the <hi>other</hi> suck in poyson which happily or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they do vomit up again, holding that for good which is evil, and instructing those with the like opinions, whom they take to teach.</p>
            <p>And to these <hi>pits of Hell</hi> it is to be imputed, that the Sun of the Gospel is obscured with the smoak of the pit:<note place="margin">☞ <hi>Ut Academiis, ab initio mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, satanas nihil excogitaret praesentius, ad vastandum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem &amp; Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelium toto orbe.</hi>
               </note> for out of this smoak proceed those Locusts, which possess all Chairs, and Pulpits, and administer all Governments, that Satan from the beginning of the world, could devise nothing in all the world more strong and pernicious to waste Faith and the Gospel, then <hi>Universities,</hi> Neither was it meet that this evil should arise, but in the end of the world, when the world through the prevailing of sin, being loaden with the wrath of God, should draw neer to hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For the miserable people must needs hear those things taught and delivered out of the Pulpits, which those Molochites have learned in the Universities. And they have learned nothing but the highest blasphemies of God. Neither is it lawful to have anywhere any other Pastor then these.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>And now to return to our business again touching the</hi> Universities, <hi>let none object that</hi> Luther <hi>speaks against</hi> Popish Universities only, <hi>for this is but a weak and simple</hi> Defence, <hi>and altogether unable to ward off the mighty blow of Gods word, from their heads and hearts. For the</hi> things <hi>condemned in the foregoing Testimonies of</hi> Luther, <hi>are the</hi> self same <hi>for the</hi> substance <hi>of them, as do live, prevaile, and flourish in our present</hi> Universities, <hi>as hath been before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and I leave it to every faithful Christian to judge the truth in this matter. But men would faine preserve their</hi> Titles, Degrees, Authority, Dignity, State, Stipends, <hi>and therefore for defence of these things, they must needs say</hi> something, <hi>though it be to never so</hi> little <hi>purpose: but yet by such discourse they sufficiently declare how cool and icie they are for</hi> Christs interest, <hi>and how zealous for their</hi> own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But certaine it is, that as the</hi> Universities <hi>were set up at first as</hi> nurseries for Antichrists kingdome, <hi>men being therein so educated (according to the undertaking of</hi> Charles the great) <hi>in</hi> Philosophy <hi>and</hi> School-Divinity, <hi>that it might be said to them,</hi> Vos estis sal terrae, &amp; lux mundi, <hi>Ye are the salt of the earth, and the light of the world (which yet onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the faithful who are born of God) so have they still remained the</hi> same <hi>hitherto in</hi> substance, <hi>though not without some small change of outward form.</hi>

become an <hi>early prey</hi> to the <hi>devil,</hi> who <hi>readily</hi> fills them, with all the <hi>ungodliness</hi> and <hi>unrighteousness</hi> of the <hi>heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5.

            <p>Wherefore my <hi>counsel</hi> is, that they learn the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine tongues,</hi> especially from <hi>Christians,</hi> and so without the <hi>lyes, fables, follies, vanities, whoredomes, lust, pride, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> &amp;c. of the <hi>heathens</hi>; especially seeing neither their <hi>words</hi> nor their <hi>phrases,</hi> are <hi>meet</hi> for <hi>Christians</hi> to take into their <hi>mouths</hi>: and most <hi>necessary</hi> it is, that <hi>Christians</hi> should <hi>forget</hi> the <hi>names</hi> of their <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Muses,</hi> (which were but <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>damned Creatures</hi>) and all their <hi>Muthology</hi> and <hi>fabulous inventions,</hi>, and let them all go to <hi>Satan,</hi> from <hi>whence</hi> they came.</p>
