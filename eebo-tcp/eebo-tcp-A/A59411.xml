            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO CHARLES EARL of <hi>DORSET</hi> and <hi>MIDDLESEX,</hi> Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold, Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Sussex,</hi> and one of the most Honourable Privy Council.</head>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Who have been so long and so continually oblig'd by your Lordship, have ever fresh Occasions of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging your Favour and Bounty to me, and cannot be silent of the late great Honour you have done me, in making me the King's Servant; but must publish my Gratitude for that, and all the rest of the great Obligations I have receiv'd. Your Lordship not only makes use of your own Power, but of that which the King has entrusted you with, to do good to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which you ever delighted in. And as I am apt to believe, that no Man had ever a great Office con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon him with more Favour from his Prince, so I am well assured no Man ever receiv'd one with a more general liking of the People than your Lordship. Nothing but the Service of so Great and Gracious a
<pb facs="tcp:62061:3"/>
King, who so miraculously redeem'd us, and since makes all our Interests his own, could recompence you for the happy Retirement you might enjoy, and wherein you so much delight.</p>
            <p>This Play, my Lord, I humbly submit to your Lordships Iudgment. I can write nothing worthy of your Acceptance; but I hope your Lordship will give some Indulgence to this, since it was Written during eight Months painful Sickness, wherein all the several Days in which I was able to Write any part of a Scene, amounted not to one Month, except some few which were employ'd in indispensable Business. This is indeed no Excuse in any one who does not Write for Necessities of Life.</p>
            <p>The Play has met with a Kind Reception from all for ought I hear, but some of the late Loyal Poets, above whose Censure I esteem my self; and from some who are still so fond of the Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non-resistance,</hi> that they think it a Profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bring the very words into a Comedy.</p>
            <p>These are so weak to mistake that for a Point of Divinity, which is indeed a Point of Law; and some of the most vigorous Maintainers of that Doctrine, have seen their Errour, and not only left off professing it, but have wisely and justly Contradicted it in their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,

               </gap> assisting towards our late wonderful Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And sure there is no need of any great measure of understanding to find out, that, when the Compact on which Government is founded is broken, and those very Laws destroy'd, which were made to secure the People in their Estates, Liberty and Religion, the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture must take place, which not only permits, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges Mankind to Self-defence.</p>
            <p>I never could Recant in the worst of Times, when my Ruine was design'd, and my Life was sought, and for rear Ten years I was kept from the exercise of that Profession which had afforded me a competent Subsistence, and surely I shall not now do it, when there is a Liberty of speaking Common Sence, which tho' not long since forbidden, is now grown Current.</p>

               <p>You may say what you please of me, Sir, but there are so many fine Gentlemen and Ladies, so Gallant, and so well bred, we call it little <hi>London</hi>; and it out-does St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Square,</hi> and all the Squares, in Dressing and Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; nay, even the Court it self, under the Rose.</p>

            <sp>

               <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
               <p>Not Bombs, or Cannons, can do that. While you are awake, I'll ne'r be from you; and when you sleep, I'll watch, and sigh, and sing my Plaints about your House.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>By Heav'n, I cannot help it: and look to it; for this in <hi>Bury</hi> (as all little Towns are full of Tatling and Censure) will bring Scandal to you, at least, if it does not produce Love in you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gert.</speaker>
               <p>For Love, I am sure it shall not: and for Scandal, I'll remove.</p>

               <p>Dear <hi>Ned,</hi> if any thing cou'd tempt me to that noisie Town, thou, and some choice Friends, whose Conversation I extreamly value, might do it: but I am weary of it, and dote upon my quiet Retirement.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
               <p>Man is not self-sufficient: he was made a Sociable Animal, and must have Conversation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>And that, by a Man of a good Estate, as you and I have, may be had in the Country.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
               <p>Merry Meetings may be had; but not so frequently, as your Sessions: and when you think you have a choice Company, in rushes some loud obstrepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Hunter, Hawker, or Jocky, good for nothing else, and Roars about Dogs, Kites, and Horses,; and spoils that Meeting.

the neighbouring Coxcombs is worse than being Host of an Inn: and to meet Company elsewhere, is to be poyson'd with damn'd Wine.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>I take care to meet none but good Company; and where-ever we meet, we take a course to have as good Wine from <hi>London,</hi> as any there: and at my own House, I will entertain none but good Company.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
               <p>Then the Country Gentlemen, who are most of 'em ill Company, will hate you, and you will have no Interest.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>He that esteems himself by another mans opinion, is an Ass. My Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants I make much of.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
               <p>But what can be the diversion of a Country Life? A man must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'd at three in a Morning, by the crack'd Voices of Huntsmen, with damn'd Bugle Horns, and the confounded yelps of Curs: and for want of Friendship with Men, divert themselves with their Enmity to Beasts; and hunt as if the Devil were in 'em, till at dark night they are scarce able to dismount their Horses.</p>

               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>They are Fops, <hi>Ned,</hi> that make a business of Sport. I hunt with my Harriers half a dozen heats in a Morning, for Health and an Appetite: and, at Dinner time, let 'em be in never such full cry, I knock off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
               <p>There is some Reason in that; but your true Country Squire lives in Boots all the Winter, never talks or thinks of any thing but Sports, as he calls 'em: and if an ill Day comes, saunters about his House, lolls upon Couches; sighs and groans, as if he were a Prisoner in the Fleet; and the best thing he can find to do, is to Smoke, and Drink, and play at Back-gammon, with the Parson.</p>

               <p>These are of the strictest Order of Hunters, such as keep Journals of every Days hunting, and write long Letters of Foxchases from one end of <hi>England</hi> to the other. Tho these are Fops, <hi>Ned,</hi> a Reasonable man may enjoy himself very well in the Country.</p>

               <p>Can you find in your Heart to dispose of your Sister to my Friend, and not of your Self to me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gert.</speaker>
               <p>Time enough to think on that, after I have tam'd you, and brought you up to hand: you are too Wild for me, a great deal.</p>

               <p>I think I had as good: he is the most Importunate Lover, I shall never be quiet for him. Well, I will Dissemble no longer: here's my Hand.</p>

               <p>No Raptures. And know, for all my vapouring, I can obey, as well as e'r a meek, simpering Milksop on 'em all; and have ever held <hi>Non resistance</hi> a Doctrine fit for all Wives, tho for nobody else.</p>

            <head>EPILOGUE.</head>
            <stage>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Mountfort.</hi>
            </stage>
            <l>
               <hi>I</hi> Was our <hi>Authors Advocate</hi> last year,</l>
            <l>And then ye very gentle did appear.</l>
            <l>To him ye now should more Indulgence show,</l>
            <l>Eight months he has been sick, and well we know</l>
            <l>How very little a sick man can do.</l>
            <l>But could he Write with never so much <hi>Wit,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He must despair of seeing a full <hi>Pit:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Most of our constant Friends have left the Town,</l>
            <l>Bravely to serve their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country</hi> gone.</l>
            <l>Our unfrequented <hi>Theatre</hi> must mourn,</l>
            <l>Till the <hi>Brave Youths Triumphantly</hi> return.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Soft</hi> Men of <hi>Peace</hi> enough are left at home,</l>
            <l>Daily to cram our House, if they'd but come:</l>
            <l>They eagerly elsewhere in <hi>throngs</hi> resort,</l>
            <l>Crowding for <hi>Places</hi> in the well fill'd <hi>Court.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Here one who has been fifty years a <hi>Knave,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Strives for a <hi>Place,</hi> with one foot in the Grave.</l>
            <l>Another there, who did what e're he cou'd</l>
            <l>Against the Soveraign Author of our good.</l>
            <l>Some who rode Westward at least ten miles down,</l>
            <l>Some made <hi>Blue Coats</hi> at him, and staid in Town.</l>
            <l>All these would have preferment, as if they</l>
            <l>Had to this Glorious Change prepar'd the way:</l>
            <l>Thus there are more admirers to each place,</l>
            <l>Than e're a Celebrated Beauty has.</l>
            <l>And they who cannot that advancement gain,</l>
            <l>They think their mighty <hi>Merits</hi> ought t' attain,</l>
            <l>Steal to some <hi>Grumbling Club,</hi> and there complain.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:62061:36"/>Pox on't, things go not well, I'll change my side,</l>
            <l>I thought they would for my great Worth provide.</l>
            <l>Pray have less <hi>Vanity,</hi> and learn more <hi>Wit,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Come here, we've Places for you all most fit</l>
            <l>Within our empty Boxes and our Pit.</l>
            <l>But you who use to hiss, pray keep away,</l>
            <l>And try to Write before you damn a Play;</l>
            <l>'Twill then so hard a task to you appear,</l>
            <l>You will not have the Heart to be severe.</l>
