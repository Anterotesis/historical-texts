            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Morning Lecture, I have formerly in my course out of severall Scriptures handled the Doctrine of the Sacraments in <hi>Generall,</hi> and then proceeded to speake of the Sacraments of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and therein their <hi>number,</hi> their <hi>agreement</hi> and <hi>disagreement,</hi> with those of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; And now lately have begun to open the Sacraments of the <hi>New Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of them is now in hand; And I have already out of this Text, made foure or five Sermons, concerning the nature and use of the Sacrament of Baptisme, wherein I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50201:4"/>
have cleared unto you: First, Who was the <hi>Authour</hi> and <hi>Institutour</hi> of it: Secondly, Who is to bee the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of it: Thirdly, The <hi>Essence</hi> of it, the matter and forme of it; both the <hi>res terrena,</hi> and the <hi>res Coelestis,</hi> the earthly, and the spirituall part: and now Fourthly, it remaines, that I treat of the <hi>subject</hi> of it, or the persons who are to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and they are of two sorts; either <hi>grown men,</hi> who being instructed in the Doctrine of Christ, and professing their Faith in him, and their willingnes and readines to live according to his will, and do desire to bee partakers of this blessed Sacrament; These whether Jews or Gentiles, Male or Female, bond or free, are to bee admitted to the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of this Ordinance; of the Baptizing of such as these there is no question. The other sort are <hi>Infants,</hi> of whose right to this Sacrament, I shall (by Gods assistance) treate this day.</p>
            <p>And concerning these, there are two sorts of questions:</p>
            <p>First, Whether any Infants at all are to bee Baptized?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Supposing some have right to it, yet it's great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disputed,<note place="margin">The Question stated.</note> 
               <hi>whose</hi> Infants may bee Baptized? <hi>viz.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Infants of <hi>Excommunicate</hi> persons, of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> of <hi>Profane</hi> men, of meerly <hi>civilly Righteous</hi>; whether <hi>Bastards,</hi> whether the Infants of <hi>Heathens, who are to bee brought up by Christians</hi>; and whether these may not be Baptized, with some <hi>caution</hi> used, thereby to make distinction betwixt the pure and the impure? I shall for the present baulk all these latter questions, and handle only the former, <hi>viz. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> any at all are to bee Baptized?</hi> or, as the Question uses to bee stated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether the Infants of beleeving Parents, the Infants of Saints,</hi> are to be admitted to the Holy Sacrament? And here also ariseth another question, Who are to bee meant by <hi>Beleevers</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> whether only such as have the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vertue</hi> of faith and holinesse, who are <hi>really</hi> beleevers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50201:4"/>
and sanctifyed ones, or whether by <hi>Beleevers</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> may be meant such a faith and sanctity as is <hi>outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,</hi> although possibly the inward grace it selfe (which only God can judge of) bee altogether wanting?</p>
            <p>Concerning which question,<note place="margin">The Infants of Beleevers ought to bee Baptized.</note> although for my owne part I beleeve wee are to understand it of that which man may judge of, and that God hath not made that the condition of his servants applying his Ordinances, which can be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly known to none but himselfe, and that therefore the profession of Faith and holinesse, is sufficient to make men passe for Beleevers, and Saints in the Churches judgement, yet I shall at the present baulk the handling of this also, and will take it in the surest sense, in the Apostles sense, what the <hi>Apostle</hi> means by Beleevers and Saints, when he writes unto the Churches, that I will take to bee the state of the Question: if by Beleevers and Saints the <hi>Apostle</hi> meane <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> professors of faith and holinesse; then the Question is, whether <hi>their Infants are to bee baptized</hi>; if the <hi>Apostle</hi> by beleevers and Saints, mean such onely as are <hi>inwardly</hi> holy, <hi>inwardly</hi> beleevers, then the question is, whether <hi>their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are to be Baptized</hi>: in a word, whether the Infants of <hi>such</hi> as were or might have been stiled beleevers and Saints in the <hi>Apostles</hi> daies and writings, are to be admitted to the Sacrament of Baptisme.</p>
            <p>This priviledge of the baptizing of such Infants the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church hath been in possession of for the space of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred yeers and upwards,<note place="margin">The Primitive Church owned it.</note> as is manifest out of most of the Records that we have of antiquity, both in the Greek and Latine Church; which I the rather mention in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, because many of the Anabaptists blush not to say, that the Antients, especially the Greek Church, rejected it for many hundred yeers: <hi>Justine Martyr,</hi> who lived about <hi>Anno</hi> 150 (in a Treatise which goes under his name) <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> 56. disputes the different condition of those children,

Traditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely such things as are delivered from one to another, whether writen or unwriten. And so did the Apostle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.15. when he charged them to <hi>hold the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which they had been taught, either by word or Epistle.</hi> However his calling it a Tradition received from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles gives us a sufficient proofe, that time out of mind, it had been received in the Church, that it was delivered over to the Church in his time, and was of antient use in the Church before his time.</p>

of the waves of the Sea one against another, till all were changed, as the Historian notes of them. And because this Opinion, and divers others which depend upon it, begins unhappily to take place and spread among our selves in this Kingdom; and so the work of Reformation (without Gods mercy) likely to bee much hindred by it; I shall (God willing) handle this Question more largely, then I have done any other in this place; and the rather because of three other great mischiefes which goe along with it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">And the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</note>First, I see that all who reject the Baptizing of Infants, doe and must upon the same ground reject the Religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Lords day, or the Christian Sabbath, <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>there is not</hi> (say they) <hi>an expresse institution or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> in the New Testament. Verily, I have hardly either knowne, or read, or heard of any one who hath rejected this of Infants, but with it they reject that of the Lords day: now God hath so blessed the Religious observation of the Lords day in this Kingdome above other Churches and Kingdomes, that such as indeavour to overthrow it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve justly to be abhorred by us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Teachers of this Opinion, where ever they prevaile, take their Proselytes wholly off from the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, and all other acts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian communion, both publick and private; from any, but those who are of their owne opinion, condemning them all as Limbs of Antichrist, worshippers and followers of the Beast: And so not onely labour to cast the godly Ministers out of the hearts of those people whom they have wonne to Christ; but leave the people whom they insnare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of recovery, whilst they impose upon their consciences to heare none but such as may confirme them in their errors; An old trick of <hi>Satan</hi> which hee taught the Papists long agone, a meere politick device to keep their Disciples fast unto themselves: which unchristian course,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50201:6"/>
how prosperous soever it may seeme to bee at the first, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee blessed by God, nor indeed is it, the Lord giving them up almost every where, to other most dangerous, vile, and abominable opinions. I deny not but some few who are of this opinion are otherwise minded, but all our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth us that the generality of them doe runne this way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this opinion puts all the Infants of <hi>all Beleevers</hi> into the self-same condition, with the Infants of <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> which they <hi>all</hi> readily acknowledge; and from thence unavoidably one of these three things must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. 1. Either all of them are damned who die in their Infancy, being without the Covenant of grace, having no part in Christ. Or, 2. All of them saved, as having no ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sinne, and consequently needing no Saviour; which most of the Anabaptists in the world doe owne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with bring in al <hi>Pelagianisme, Universall grace, Free-will,</hi> &amp;c. Or, 3. That although they bee tainted with originall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and so need a Saviour, Christ doth <hi>pro beneplacito,</hi> save <hi>some</hi> of the Infants of <hi>Indians and Turkes,</hi> dying in their Infancy, as well as <hi>some</hi> of the Infants of <hi>Christians</hi>; and so carry salvation by Christ out of the Church, beyond the Covenant of grace, where God never made any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: That God hath made a promise to bee the God of <hi>believers,</hi> and of <hi>their Seed,</hi> wee all know; but where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is to bee found, that hee will bee the God of the seed of such Parents who live and die his enemies, and their seed, not so much as called by the preaching of the Gospel, I know not. These men say the Covenant of grace made to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> differs from the Covenant of grace made with <hi>Us</hi>; but I desire to know, whether in the <hi>one,</hi> or in the <hi>other,</hi> they find any promise of salvation by Christ to any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants dying in their Infancie, whose Parents no way belonged to the Family of GOD, or Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50201:7"/>The matter then being of such consequence, and many amongst us in such danger of being seduced, further then is easie to imagine, through the subtilty, activity, and diligence of such as with a great shew of Scriptures, and under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of zeale, doe creepe into Houses; yea, proclaime these things openly in Pulpits: I take my selfe bound upon this occasion to shew you upon what grounds the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Church hath hitherto retained this practise, and shall bring all that I intend to speake of it under two Arguments, and under them shall indeavour to Answer whatsoever I have found of any moment objected to the contrary.</p>
            <p>My first Argument is this, <hi>The Infants of beleeving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are</hi> foederati,<note place="margin">First Argument they are under the Covenant of grace, and therefore must have the seale of the Covenant.</note> 
               <hi>therefore they must bee</hi> signati: <hi>they are within the Covenant of grace, belonging to Christs body, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, family; therefore are to partake of the seale of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or the distinguishing badge between them who are under the Covenant of grace, and them who are not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ordinary Answer to this Argument is, by denying that Infants are under the Covenant of Grace; onely some few deny the consequence, that although they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Covenant, yet it followes not that they must bee sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, because (say they) the <hi>Women</hi> among the Jewes were under the Covenant, yet received not Circumcision, which was the seale of the Covenant; but this receives an easie answer, the Women were Circumcised in the Males, else could not God have said, that the whole house of <hi>Israel</hi> were Circumcised in the flesh, else could not the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jewes bee called <hi>the Circumcision,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to all the World beside, who were called <hi>the Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the better clearing of this whole Argument; I shall indeavour to make good these five Conclusions.<note place="margin">This Argument made good by five Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, that the Covenant of Grace hath alwayes for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance been one and the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50201:7"/>Secondly, God will have the Infants of such as enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Covenant with him, bee counted his, as well as their Parents.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God hath ever since <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, had a Seale to bee applied to such as enter into Covenant with him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, by Gods owne order the Seed, or Infants of Covenanters before Christs time, were to be sealed with the seale of admission into his Covenant, as well as their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the priviledge of such as are in Covenant since Christs time, are as honourable, large, and comfortable, both to themselves and their children, as they were before Christs time: and these five Propositions made good, the Argument will be strong and undeniable.</p>
            <p>The first is, <hi>That the Covenant of grace, for substance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>hath alwayes been one and the same,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace alwaies the same for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> 
               <hi>both to the</hi> Jewes <hi>and to the</hi> Gentiles. Which to understand, know, that the new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to life was first revealed to <hi>Adam</hi> immediately after his fall, and that blessed promise concerning the Seed of the woman was often renewed, and the Patriarchs faith <hi>therein,</hi> and salvation <hi>thereby,</hi> recorded plentifully in the Scripture: but the first time that ever it was revealed under the expresse name of a League or Covenant was with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>; and therefore we shall need looke no higher then his dayes: who because he was the first explicite Covenanter, is called the father of the faithfull; and ever since clearly hath all the world been divided into two distinct bodies or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; the one called the Kingdome, City, Houshold of God, to which all who owne the way to life, were to joine themselves; and these were called the <hi>Children of God,</hi> the <hi>Sons of Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Children of the Kingdome</hi>: all the rest of the World, the Kingdom of the <hi>Devill,</hi> the <hi>Seed of the Serpent, Strangers from the Covenant of Grace, without God

in the world</hi>;<note place="margin">Wherein lies the substance of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> &amp;c. Now I say that this Covenant of Grace hath for substance been alwayes the same; for substance I say, for wee must distinguish betwixt the Covenant it selfe, and the manner of administration of this Covenant: The <hi>substance</hi> of the Covenant on Gods part was, to be <hi>Abrabra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams God,</hi>

The <hi>manner</hi> of administration of this Covenant at the first was by <hi>types,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Though not the same for manner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration.</note> and <hi>shadowes, sacrifices, &amp;c.</hi> And foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty yeeres after the Law was added with great terrour upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> not as a part of this Covenant, but as the Apostle saith expressely, it was added because <hi>of Transgressions,</hi> to bee a Schoolemaster to whip to Christ; Plainly in that giving of the Law, there was something of the Covenant of workes made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise; yet in order to the Administration of the Covenant of grace, there was a <hi>rehearsall</hi> of the Covenant of workes, under which all men lie by nature, untill they bee brought under the Covenant of grace: and this was delivered with great terror, and under most dreadfull penalties, that they who were prone to seeke justification in <hi>themselves,</hi> by finding the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the impossibility of their keeping the Law, might be driven to seeke for a better Mediator, even the Lord Jesus Christ, as was excellently shadowed out, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.18, 19, 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.24. when they cryed out to <hi>Moses; that they might no more heare this dreadfull voice,</hi> which would kill them, but that they might bee spoken unto by a Mediator: and GOD said, they <hi>had well spoken,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently accepted <hi>Moses</hi> for their <hi>typicall</hi> mediator, and by him
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50201:8"/>
gave them the Gospel in their <hi>Tabernacle Ordinances.</hi> And there was also somthing of the <hi>administration</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace</hi>; partly, because all the threatning and cursing part of it was intended as a preparative and meanes to fit them for Christ; and partly because the directing part of it, containes that <hi>very rule</hi> whereby <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all his Seed were ordered to walke in obedience towards God.</p>
            <p>To conclude this, All their externall promises in case of obedience, all outward blessings which were to bee injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and all the good things in it, all outward punishments and threatnings, losse of their Countrey, going into Captivity, all their Sacrifices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Washings, their Sprinklings, their holy Persons, holy Feasts, and holy things, were all of them but so many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations of the Covenant of Grace; Earthly things <hi>then,</hi> were not onely promised or threatned more distinctly and fully, then now they are to them who are in Covenant, but were figures, signes, types and Sacraments of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things, to bee injoyed both by them and by us; as might bee cleared by abundance of particulars: Take but that one instance of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which albeit in it selfe it was but like other Lands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet was it by the Lord sanctified to spirituall ends, where he would have his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle pitched, and Temple built, out of which Land, when the ten Tribes were carried captive, hee is said to have put them out of his sight: the very Land being figuratively ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a signe of Gods presence,<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.18.</note> the resting of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there, a signe of their eternall rest in Heaven, into which not <hi>Moses</hi> the Lawgiver, but <hi>Joshua,</hi> or <hi>Jesus,</hi> the type of their true Jesus was to bring them:<note place="margin">

               <hi>Noble,</hi> yet here the issue hath <hi>honour</hi> from the <hi>Father,</hi> and is not accounted <hi>base</hi> by the basenesse of the <hi>Mother.</hi> This I take to be the plaine meaning of the Apostles answer: But because the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> doe very much indeavour to weaken the evidence of this Argument, I shall indeavour to cleare it from their exceptions. They utterly deny that this place is meant of any <hi>Federall holinesse,</hi> but of <hi>legitimation,</hi> which they call civill holinesse, and so interpret the <hi>Corinthians</hi> doubt to bee, <hi>whether their marriage with Unbeleevers were not now a nullity,</hi> and their children thereupon to bee <hi>spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> illegitimate, or Bastards, and the Apostles answer to bee, that <hi>because the unbeleeving wife is sanctified to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving husband,</hi> that is, <hi>their marriage remaines lawfull,</hi> therefore their children are not spurious, but lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.

            <p>First, uncleannesse and holinesse, when opposed one to the other,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Argument.</hi> Because un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse and holinesse no where taken for civilly law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> are never taken for <hi>civilly</hi> lawfull; <hi>uncleannesse</hi> indeed, when opposed to <hi>cleannesse,</hi> may be taken in severall senses, an uncleane vessell, an uncleane cloath, an uncleane garment; when opposed to <hi>cleane,</hi> may signifie nothing but <hi>dirty</hi> or <hi>spotted</hi>; but when uncleannesse is opposed to <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> it is alwaies taken in a <hi>sacred</hi> sense, referring to a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle use,</hi> to a right of admission into, or use in, the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle or Temple, which were types to us of the visible Church; and <hi>holinesse</hi> is alwaies taken for <hi>a separation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or things from common to sacred uses</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I Answer, <hi>Chastity</hi> among <hi>Heathens,</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> is never called <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,</hi> but among <hi>Beleevers</hi> it may well bee called <hi>so,</hi> being a part of the new creation, a branch of their sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, wrought by the Spirit of God, a part of the inward adorning of the Temple of the holy Ghost. So that the meaning cannot be, your children are <hi>holy,</hi> that is, now they are <hi>not Bastards</hi>; but rather, whereas <hi>before,</hi> both <hi>you</hi> and <hi>they</hi> were <hi>uncleane,</hi> and might have nothing to doe with the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, <hi>now</hi> both <hi>you</hi> and <hi>your Children</hi> are a <hi>holy seed,</hi> according as was shewed to <hi>Peter</hi> in his vision, where God shewed him, that the <hi>Gentiles formerly no better then uncleane beasts, and creeping things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 10.</note> 
               <hi>should upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to Christ bee no longer esteemed common or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, this being so, had <hi>this</hi> beene the meaning,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Argument.</hi> The Apostles answer had not contained a truth.</note> 
               <hi>else were your Children uncleane,</hi> but now they are <hi>holy, else</hi> had your children been <hi>Bastards,</hi> but now they are <hi>legitimate</hi>; the Apostles answer had not been <hi>true,</hi> because then if one of the Parents had not been a Beleever, and so by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a believer, sanctified his unbeleeving Wife, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren must have been Bastards: whereas wee know their children had been legitimate, being born in lawfull Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, though <hi>neither</hi> of the Parents had been a beleever: Marriage being a <hi>second Table</hi> duty, is <hi>lawfull,</hi> (though not sanctified) to Pagans as well as to Christians, and the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation or illegitimation of the issue depends not upon the <hi>Faith,</hi> but upon the <hi>marriage</hi> of the Parents; let the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be lawfull, and the issue is legitimate, whether <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> or <hi>neither</hi> of the Parents be beleevers or infidels: take but away lawfull marriage, betwixt the Man and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50201:14"/>
and the issue is legitimate, whether one, or both, or neither of the Parents are beleevers or infidels: withall, if the children of <hi>Heathens</hi> be Bastards, and the marriage of Heathens no marriage, then there is no adultery among heathens, and so the seventh Commandement is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vaine in the words of it as to them.</p>
            <p>Besides, St. <hi>Pauls</hi> reason had no <hi>strength</hi> in it, supposing the Text were to be interpreted as these men would have it;<note place="margin">3. <hi>Argument.</hi> Nor had the Apostles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had any reason in it, if interpreted as they would have it.</note> Their doubt (say they) was, that their marriage was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull wedlocke, and so consequently their children Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards; now mark what kind of answer they make the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle give, <hi>Were yee not lawfull man and wife, your children were Bastards, but because the unbeleeving wife is sanctified in the husband, &amp;c. because your marriage is a lawfull marriage, your children are legitimate.</hi> What strength of reason is in this? if this had been their doubt or question, whether their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage were not a nullity, the Apostle <hi>by his Apostolick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> might have <hi>definitively</hi> answered, <hi>without giving a reason, your marriage is good,</hi> and <hi>your children legitimate</hi>; but if <hi>Paul</hi> will go about to satisfie them by reason, and prove them to be mistaken, it behoved him to give such a reason which should have some weight in it, but this hath none; set their doubt (as these men frame it) and the Apostles an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swer (as these men interpret him) together, and you will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily see the invalidity of it; <hi>We doubt,</hi> say the Corinthians, <hi>we are not lawfull man and wife; and that therefore our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are bastards. No,</hi> saith Paul, <hi>you are mistaken, and I prove it</hi> thus, <hi>Were ye not lawfull man and wife, your children were bastards; but because ye are lawfull man and wife, your children are not bastards.</hi> Is there any Argument or proofe in this?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, according to <hi>this</hi> their interpretation, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles answer could no wayes have reached to the quieting of their <hi>consciences</hi>;<note place="margin">4. <hi>Argument.</hi> Nor could have satisfied their doubt.</note> there doubt was, whether according

to the example in <hi>Ezra,</hi> they were not to put away their wives and children, as <hi>not belonging to God,</hi> as being a Seed whom God would not own among his people; now what kind of quiet would this have given them, to tell them that their children were not Bastards? We know the <hi>Jewes</hi> did not <hi>put away</hi> their Bastards, as not belonging to the Covenant of God; <hi>Phares,</hi> and <hi>Zarah,</hi> and <hi>Jepthah,</hi> and innumerable others, though <hi>bastards,</hi> were <hi>circumcised,</hi> and not cut off from the people of God.</p>
            <p>And whereas some object out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.2.<note place="margin">Deut. 23.2.</note> That Bastards did not belong to the Covenant among the <hi>Jews,</hi> because <hi>God there forbad a bastard to come into the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord.</hi>

            <p>I Answer, that is meant <hi>onely</hi> of <hi>bearing Office</hi> in the Church, or some such like thing, and not of being under the Covenant, belonging to the Church: as is manifest, not only by what hath been <hi>now</hi> said of <hi>Jepthah</hi> and others, who were <hi>circumcised,</hi> and <hi>offered Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>drew nigh to God,</hi> as well as any other; but the very text alledged gives sufficient light, that it cannot be meant otherwayes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in that place <hi>who ever is an Eunuch,</hi> or <hi>wounded in his stones,</hi> hath the <hi>same</hi> exclusion from the Congregation of the Lord: and I hope no man will dare to say, that <hi>none such are holy to the Lord</hi>; if they should,<note place="margin">Esa. 56.3, 4. Acts 8.27.</note> the Scripture is full e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough against them: That putting away in <hi>Ezra</hi> was of an higher nature then bare illegitimation; and therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved the Apostle to give another manner of satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to there doubtfull consciences, then to tell them their children were not bastards: Therefore I conclude, that <hi>this holinesse being the fruits of one of the Parents being a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, must be meant of some kind of holinesse, which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the seed of them whose Parents are both Unbeleevers, and that is enough</hi> for our purpose.</p>
            <p>Yet there remaines two Objections to bee answered,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50201:15"/>
which are made against this our interpretation.</p>

               </note>First, The <hi>unbeleeving wife</hi> is here said to <hi>bee sanctified,</hi> as well as the <hi>childe</hi> is said to <hi>be holy,</hi> and the Originall word is the same for both, one the <hi>verb,</hi> the other the <hi>noune</hi>: if then the <hi>childe</hi> is <hi>holy,</hi> with a <hi>federall holinesse,</hi> then is also the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving wife sanctified</hi> with a <hi>federall sanctification,</hi> and so the <hi>wife,</hi> although remaining a heathen, may be yet counted to belong to the Covenant of Grace.</p>

               </note>That holinesse of the Children is <hi>here</hi> meant, which could not bee, unlesse one of the Parents were sanctifyed to the other, which is the force of the Apostles arguing, the <hi>unbeleever is sanctified</hi> to the beleever, <hi>else</hi> were not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren holy, but unclean: but <hi>federall holinesse</hi> of children may be where the Parents are not sanctifyed, one <hi>in</hi> or <hi>to</hi> the other, as in bastardy, <hi>Davids</hi> childe by <hi>Bathsheba, Phares,</hi> and <hi>Zarah, Judahs</hi> children by <hi>Thamar,</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by the Concubines, <hi>Abrahams</hi> son <hi>Ishmael</hi> by <hi>Hagar, &amp;c.</hi> in which cases the children were federally <hi>holy,</hi> and accordingly were circumcised, and yet the Harlot not san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed <hi>in</hi> or <hi>to</hi> the Adulterer or Fornicator, though a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50201:15"/>I answer, we must attend the Apostles scope, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is to shew that the children would be <hi>unholy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> if the <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>beleever-ship</hi> of <hi>one</hi> of the Parents could not remove the <hi>barre,</hi> which lies <hi>in the other,</hi> being an unbeleever, against the producing of an holy seed, <hi>because one of them was a Pagan, or unbeleever, therefore the childe would not be a holy seed, unlesse the faith or beleevership of the other Parent, could remove this bar.</hi> Now this can have no place of an Argument, in any case, where <hi>one</hi> of the Parents is not an <hi>Infidell</hi>: but this was not the case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews; <hi>Hagar,</hi> and <hi>Thamar,</hi> and the <hi>Concubines,</hi> however <hi>sinfull,</hi> in <hi>those acts,</hi> yet themselves were <hi>beleevers,</hi> belonging to the Covenant of God, and <hi>that barre</hi> lay not against their children, as did in the <hi>unbeleeving wife</hi>: indeed if a <hi>beleeving</hi> man or woman should <hi>adulterously</hi> beget a childe upon a <hi>Pagan,</hi> a <hi>Heathen,</hi> or <hi>Unbeleever,</hi> there this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection deserves to bee further weighed, but here it comes not within the compasse of the Apostles Argument.</p>
            <p>Before I passe from this second conclusion, let me further shew you why the Lord will have the children of beleeving Parents reckoned even in their Infancy,<note place="margin">Reason why God will have such Infants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his.</note> to belong to him. First his own <hi>beneplacitum,</hi> his free grace and favour which moves him to shew mercy to whom he will, is a sufficient answer to all: But secondly, he will have it for <hi>his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It is the honour of other Princes, that all who are born in their kingdome should be accounted <hi>borne their Subjects</hi>; and the honour of great Masters, that the children of their servants born in their houses should be born their servants:<note place="margin">Eccles. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>7.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> counts it a peece of his glory, that he had servants born in his house. And on the other side, it is a dis-honour to a King not to be able legally to lay claime to those born in his kingdome, but that another King, yea, an <hi>enemy</hi> might <hi>legally</hi> challenge them to be <hi>his</hi> Subjects. So is it with the Lord, he having left all the rest of the world, to be visibly the devils kingdome, will not for his <hi>owne glories sake</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50201:16"/>
the devill to come and lay visible claime to the sonnes and daughters, begotten by those who are the children of the most High. And thirdly, he doth it both for the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> of those who are in Covenant with him, partly, I say, for their comfort and priviledge, while they may see their children visibly to be provided for by a better Father, under a Covenant of Grace, to whose care, and under whose wing they may leave them, when themselves shall faile; and partly to be an obligation to bring them up <hi>for</hi> God, not to <hi>themselves,</hi> much lesse to the <hi>devill,</hi> but ever to look upon themselves in the education of their children, to be but <hi>nursing Fathers and Mothers to train them up in the nurture and feare of the Lord,</hi> unto whose kingdome, family and Covenant they thus belong.</p>
            <p>I have been the larger upon these two first Conclusions, because indeed the proving of <hi>these,</hi> gains the <hi>whole cause,</hi> if the Covenant be the same and children belong to it, then they are to be owned as <hi>Covenanters,</hi> and to be admitted to the distinguishing or discriminating sign betwixt Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the devils, and this the most learned of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists doe professe, that if they knew a childe to be holy, they would baptize it.

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50201:16"/>
untill they were <hi>circumcised,</hi> nor into the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Church of the Christians untill they be <hi>Baptized</hi>; none but the circumcised might eat of the <hi>Paschall</hi> Lamb, none may, but those who are baptized, be admitted to eat the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which succeeds in the room of the Passeover, and this our <hi>Lord himselfe</hi> taught us by his own example, who was <hi>circumcised,</hi> as a professed Member of the Church of the Jews, and when he set up the new Christian Church, he would be initiated into <hi>it,</hi> by the Sacrament of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this Conclusion there is no great doubt, but because some of the Anabaptists doe deny the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme to succeed in the roome, place,<note place="margin">Col. 2.11, 12. opened.</note> and use of Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be pleased to observe how plaine the Apostle makes it, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2.8, 9; 10, 11, 12. where the Apostles scope is to disswade the beleeving Christians from the rudiments of the world and Jewish Ceremonies, and observations upon this ground, that we <hi>are compleate in Christ,</hi> and that in him as in the head, the Church hath all perfections, and because he would take them wholly off from Circumcision, the use wherof ingaged them to the use of the rest of Jewish Ceremonies, he tels them,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.3.</note> that in <hi>Christ we are circumcised with a Circumcision made without hands</hi> (a better Circumcision then the Jewes was) <hi>in putting off the body of the sinnes of the flesh by the Circumsion of Christ.</hi> And whereas the Jewish tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers would be ready to object that the receiving of the <hi>inward</hi> grace of Circumcision, did not make them so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed was, because they also had an <hi>outward</hi> sensible signe whereby they might be <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perswaded, comforted</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi>; to this he answers, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. That neither is this priviledge wanting to <hi>Christians</hi> who have as excellent and expresse a Sacrament of it, <hi>being buried with Christ in Baptisme,</hi> the effect whereof he there sets downe, and therefore they needed not Circumcision,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50201:17"/>
as their false Teachers insinuated, thereby directly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that our Baptisme is in stead of their Circumcision. And the Analogy lies betweene two Sacramentall types of the same substance [<hi>regeneration</hi>] to both Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. And in truth had not Baptisme come in the roome of <hi>it,</hi> the Apostle could not have pitched upon a worse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance then that of Circumcision, which was so much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by them, and was so great and usefull a priviledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Nor had there been any reason to have here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Baptisme, but that he meant to shew Baptism to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians was now in the roome of Circumcision to the Jews.</p>
            <p>That <hi>by Gods owne expresse order, infants as well as growne men were in the time of the Jewes to be initiated and sealed with the signe of Circumcision:</hi>

               </note>I answer, there is nothing plainer then that the Covenant

whereof Circumcision was the signe,<note place="margin">Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.11.</note> was the <hi>Covenant of Grace; Abraham received Circumcision</hi> a signe of the righteousnesse of faith, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> received it not as a Nation, but as a Church, as a people separated from the world, and taken into Covenant with God: It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that Circumcision bound them who received it to conforme to that manner of administration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which was carried, much, by a way of <hi>Temporall blessings</hi> and <hi>punishments,</hi> they being types of <hi>spirituall things</hi>; but no man can ever shew that any were to receive the Sacrament of Circumcision in relation to these <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things onely,</hi> or to them <hi>at all,</hi> further then they were administrations of the <hi>Covenant of grace</hi>; sure I am, the <hi>Prosolytes</hi> and their children could not be circumcised in any relation at all to the <hi>Temporall blessings</hi> of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> as they were <hi>temporall,</hi> because notwithstanding their Circumcision they were not capable of receiving, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing any inheritance at all in that Land, sojourne there they might, as other strangers also did, but the inheritance of the Land, no, not one foot of it could ever bee alienated from the severall Tribes to whom it was distributed as their possession by the most High: For all the land was divided unto twelve Tribes,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.8. Lev. 25.13. &amp;c.</note> and they were not any one of them allowed to sell their lands longer then till the yeare of Jubilee, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.13, &amp;c. Yea, I may boldly say that their Circumcision was so farre <hi>from sealing</hi> to them the outward good things of the Land, that it occasioned and tyed them to a greater expence of their temporall blessings by their long, and frequent, and chargeable journeyes, to worship at Hierusalem. And as for what was alledged concerning <hi>Ishmael</hi>; the answer is easie, God indeed there declares that <hi>Isaac</hi> should bee the <hi>type of Christ,</hi> and that the Covenant of grace should bee <hi>established</hi> and continue in his family; yet both <hi>Ishmael</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50201:18"/>
the rest of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family were <hi>really</hi> taken into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, untill afterward by Apostasie they discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted themselves, as also did <hi>Esau</hi> afterward, though he were the Son of <hi>Isaac,</hi> in whose family God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Covenant should continue.</p>

               </note>Fifthly and lastly, the priviledges of <hi>beleevers under</hi> this last and best administration of the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes <hi>inlarged,</hi> made more <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>comfortable,</hi> then ever they were in the time of the <hi>Jewes</hi> administration; <hi>many</hi> Scriptures speake of the inlargement of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, not <hi>one</hi> for the <hi>diminishing</hi> or <hi>depressing,</hi> or <hi>extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of them; that yoke, that hard and costly way of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, which neither they nor their Fathers were able to beare, is taken off from our shoulders; our Covenant is said to be established upon <hi>better promises,</hi>

               </note> we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring for priviledges which are branches of the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> which every man who is in Covenant with God, may expect from God by vertue of the Covenant, were he a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Proselyte,</hi> not for any particular or <hi>peculiar</hi> favour to a particular <hi>man</hi> or <hi>woman,</hi> or <hi>family,</hi> or <hi>tribe</hi>: All these forementioned things, and many other of the like kind (as the <hi>Ministery</hi> of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> to belong to <hi>one Tribe,</hi> the <hi>Kingly</hi> office to <hi>one family</hi>; such and such men never to lack a man of their house to <hi>stand before God</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded indeed from <hi>Free-grace,</hi> but were no parts of that Covenant of grace which God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Seed</hi>: For could <hi>every</hi> man in <hi>Covenant</hi> challenge these things at Gods hand, and that by vertue of the Covenant? Could every one of them promise to himself that Christ should be born of his flesh? Or every one of their women that she should be the Mother of Christ? Could every one whom God owned to be in <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, promise by vertue of the Covenant, that their children, if cast off by <hi>unbeleefe,</hi> should after many hundred yeers be again called in? We speake only of such priviledges as <hi>were universall,</hi> and <hi>common to all</hi> who were in Covenant, for which by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant they might relie upon God; Let any man shew out of the Scripture where our priviledges under the Gospel are cut short in any of <hi>these</hi> things, and he saith somwhat; and in particular for the Case in hand, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Infants right to the Covenant of grace, and the seale of it, once we are sure the Infant <hi>Children</hi> of all <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters were</hi> within the Covenant, and the seale also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them, and by vertue of the <hi>Covenant</hi> (which is still the same) we plead their interest in it. Let any man shew when and where this was taken away, when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-children of <hi>beleevers</hi> were expunged out of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace; certainly whoever will go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50201:19"/>
them of it, to cut off such a great part of the comfort of <hi>Beleeving parents,</hi> must produce <hi>cleare</hi> testimonies, before they can perswade <hi>beleevers</hi> to part with <hi>either</hi> of them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their right to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> or to the <hi>seale</hi> of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>For, first, their Infants interest in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> next to glory of God, and the salvation of their own souls, is the greatest benefit of the Covenant of grace; even this (I say) to have their Children belong to Gods family and kingdom, and not to the Devils: certainly, the greatest treasure of Parents is their children, and in them the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their souls: Now how uncomfortable a thing were this to Parents, to take away the very ground of their hope, for the salvation of their <hi>Children</hi>? and I dare affirm it, that we have no ground of hope for any particular person, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he be brought <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> All the world, as I have formerly touched, is divided into two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the kingdom of Christ, which is his Church; and the kingdom of Satan, which is the rest of the world; now so long as any person is <hi>visibly</hi> a member of the <hi>kingdom</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have no cause to doubt their <hi>election</hi> &amp; <hi>salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> until they visibly shew the contrary, although we know that there are some <hi>reprobate</hi> among them; so on the other side, although we know Christ hath many of his <hi>elect</hi> to be gathered out of the <hi>Devils</hi> kingdom, yet we have no cause or ground to hope that any particular person is any other then a <hi>reprobate,</hi> being a visible professed member of Satans kingdom, untill he give hope to the contrary: now what a most uncomfortable abridgment were this of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace, thus apparently to cut off the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Beleevers</hi> from their visible right in the Church of Christ, and to put them in the visible Kingdome of Satan?</p>
            <p>And, Secondly, as really unwilling must they look to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50201:19"/>
find Parents, to part with their childrens right to the <hi>Seale</hi> of the Covenant; this their right to the Covenant being all the ground of hope that <hi>beleeving Parents</hi> can have that their Infants who die in their Infancy, are saved rather then the Infants of <hi>Turkes, had need bee sealed,</hi> if they live untill they are grown men, and give <hi>other</hi> signes of grace, they may conceive good hopes of them, though they were not sealed with a Sacramentall seale: This therefore is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that the cutting off our priviledges and comfort in these two were a great abridgment of the priviledges of the new Covenant, and would put the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith into a farre worse condition in regard of their posterity, then the <hi>Seed</hi> of his flesh were in: And the Jews in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. if this Doctrine had been preached to them, might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he exhorted them to be baptized <hi>for their Childrens good; Nay, Peter, even therefore</hi> we will not be baptized, for as yet we are sure our Children are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and reckoned to his family; but if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your new way, our children must be counted to the kingdom of the Devill; and so might <hi>they</hi> in <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. when <hi>Paul</hi> told <hi>them</hi> they need not be circumcised, because Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism came in the room of it, <hi>they</hi> might have replied, that though they need not be circumcised <hi>themselves,</hi> yet they would still circumcise their <hi>children,</hi> because Bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ism was not to be applied to them according to these mens Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>Upon these five Conclusions, 1. That the Covenant of grace is alwayes the same. 2. That the Infants of those in Covenant are alwayes reckoned Covenanters with their Parents. 3. That our Baptisme succeeds in the room and use of their Circumcision. 4. That by Gods expresse or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, their Infants were to be Circumcised, as it was a <hi>seale</hi> of the Covenant. And 5. that our priviledges for our selves and our Children are at least as honourable, large,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50201:20"/>
and comfortable as theirs were: The Conclusion follows undeniably, that therfore <hi>the Infants of beleeving Parents are to be baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against this Argument the Anabaptists object many things. They say the Covenant was not the <hi>same</hi>; some of them say, the children of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were not under the Covenant in relation to <hi>spirituall things</hi>: They say, <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> and <hi>baptism</hi> served not for the same ends and uses: They say Circumcision was administred as a nationall badge, and properly <hi>sealed</hi> temporal blessings: They say, whatever privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges Infants of <hi>Beleevers</hi> had <hi>before</hi> Christs time, they have <hi>now</hi> none at all; and many such like things: All which I have so fully cleared in this former Discourse, that I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I need not adde any more; the main and only Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction remaining, which hath any colour of weight in it, is this,</p>

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because circumcision might be administred but <hi>once,</hi> being the <hi>seale</hi> of initiation; therefore Baptism being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the <hi>seale</hi> of initiation, is also to be administred but <hi>once.</hi> But that circumcision was to be administred upon the <hi>eighth

day onely,</hi> was an <hi>accidentall</hi> thing, and therefore bindes not us; the Jewish <hi>Passeover</hi> being to be <hi>yearely</hi> repeated, binds us to have a <hi>repetition</hi> of the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which came in roome of it, because this belongs to the substance of the Covenant, both of them being Sacraments for <hi>spirituall nourishment, growth</hi> and <hi>continuance</hi> in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; (as the other was for birth and entrance) but that their Passeover was to be eaten in an <hi>Evening,</hi> and upon <hi>one set Evening</hi> in the yeare was <hi>accidentall,</hi> and so binds not us. The like instance I give in our <hi>Christian Sabbath</hi>: the fourth Commandement binds <hi>us</hi> for the <hi>substance</hi> of it as much as ever it bound the <hi>Jewes; There</hi> God once for all separated one day of seven to be sacred to himselfe, and all the world stood bound in all ages to give unto God <hi>that</hi> one day of seven, which should be of his <hi>owne</hi> choosing.

            <p>When God made the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and promised for his part to be the God of him and his seed, what God promised to <hi>Abraham,</hi> we claime our part in it, as the children of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> and what God required on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part for the <hi>substance</hi> of <hi>obedience,</hi> we all stand charged with, as well as <hi>Abraham</hi>; we as <hi>Abraham</hi> are tyed to <hi>beleeve,</hi> to <hi>love</hi> the Lord with all our heart, to have our heart circumcised, to walke before God in upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to instruct our children, and bring them up for God
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50201:21"/>
and not for our selves, nor for the Devill, to teach them to worship God according to his revealed will, to traine them up under the ordinances and institutions of Gods owne appointment: all these things Gods command to <hi>Abraham</hi> charges upon <hi>all</hi> the children of the Covenant, though there were no <hi>expresse reviving</hi> these commands in any part of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and therefore consequently that command of God to <hi>Abraham</hi> which bound <hi>his seed of the Jewes,</hi> to traine up their children in that manner of worship which was <hi>then</hi> in force, bindes the seed of <hi>Abraham, now</hi> to traine up their children in conformity to such ordinances as <hi>now</hi> are in force.</p>
            <p>And the same command which injoyned <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>seale</hi> his children with the <hi>seale</hi> of the Covenant, injoynes <hi>us</hi> as strongly to <hi>seale ours</hi> with the <hi>seale</hi> of the Covenant, and that command of God which <hi>expressely</hi> bound <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>seale</hi> his with the signe of <hi>Circumcision</hi> which was the Sacrament <hi>then</hi> in force, <hi>pro tempore</hi>; doth <hi>vertually</hi> binde us to <hi>seale</hi> ours with the signe of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> which is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament <hi>now</hi> in force, and succeeds in the roome of the other by his owne appointment.</p>
            <p>There is one command by <hi>cleare</hi> consequence, another you shall find,<note place="margin">And in Mat. 28 19. opened and explained.</note> 
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. where our Saviour bids them <hi>goe and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Sanne, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Where you have two things: First, <hi>What they were to doe</hi>; Secondly, <hi>To whom they were to doe it.</hi> They were <hi>to preach and teach all things which he had commanded them,</hi> that is, they were to preach the <hi>whole Gospel, Mark.</hi> 16.15.

Baptisme as a <hi>Seale</hi> of the Covenant to <hi>all</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Covenant. Secondly, wee have the <hi>persons to whom</hi> they were to doe this, <hi>all Nations,</hi> whereas before the Church was tyed to <hi>one</hi> Nation, <hi>one</hi> Nation onely were Disciples, now their Commission was extended to make <hi>all</hi> Nations Disciples, every Nation which should receive <hi>the faith</hi> should be to him now, as the peculiar Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> had beene in time past. In a word, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> here are opposed to the <hi>one Nation</hi> before. Now we know when that <hi>one</hi> Nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were made Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, and circumcised their infants were made Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, (made to belong to Gods Schoole) and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised with them, when that nation was made Disciples in <hi>Abrahams loynes,</hi> and circumcised, their seed also was the same, when that Nation was taken out of Egypt, and <hi>actually</hi> made Disciples, their children were also with them; and we know that in every Nation the <hi>children</hi> make a great part of the Nation, and are alwayes included under <hi>every administration</hi> to the Nation, whether promises or threatnings, priviledges or burthens, mercies or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unlesse they be <hi>excepted</hi>; so are they in Cities, in Families, it being the way of the Scripture, when speaking <hi>indefinitely</hi> of a People, Nation, City or Family, to be either saved or damned, to receive mercies or punishments, <hi>expresly</hi> to except <hi>Infants</hi> when they are to be excepted, as we see in the judgement that befell <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, when all that rebellious Company that came out of Egypt, was to perish by Gods righteous doome, their little ones were <hi>expresly</hi> excepted, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.31. and in the Covenant <hi>actually</hi> entred into by the body of the Nation,<note place="margin">Fumb. 14.31 Nehem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10.28.</note>

               <hi>children</hi> were taken in with them to appertaine to the same schoole, and therefore it behooved the Lord to give them a <hi>caution</hi> for the leaving out of <hi>Infants</hi> in this new admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, that they might know his mind, if that he intends to have them left out, which that ever he did in word or deed, cannot be found in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>If it be said, they are not capable of being Disciples:<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>I answer, even as capable as the Infants of Jews,<note place="margin">

            <p>And I desire it may be seriously weighed whether that expression, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.15. Now therefore why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the necks of the <hi>Disciples,</hi> do not necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate us, to give the name of <hi>Disciples</hi> to <hi>Infants,</hi> as well as to <hi>grown men:</hi> for I reason thus, All they upon whose necks those false Teachers would have put the yoke of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion are called <hi>Disciples,</hi> and to be called Disciples: but they would have put the yoke of circumcision upon <hi>Infants,</hi> as well as <hi>grown men</hi>: therefore Infants as well as grown men are called Disciples and to be called so. The <hi>major</hi> is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable, the <hi>minor</hi> I prove thus: They who pressed circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision to be in force, <hi>according to the manner of Moses Law,</hi> and would put it upon their necks <hi>after the manner of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his Law,</hi> they would put it upon Infants of those who were in Covenant with God, as well as upon the necks of those who were grown men, for so <hi>Moses</hi> Law required: but these fals teachers pressed circumcision to be <hi>so</hi> in force, as is apparent, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:50201:23"/>Another command by good consequence for the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Infants, you shall find in that forementioned place where the Apostle exhorted them to repent &amp; be baptized,<note place="margin">Act 2.38, 39.</note> &amp;c. <hi>Because the promise was made to them and to their children,</hi> which, as I shewed you, clearely proves that the Children of such who beleeve and are baptized, are taken into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and therefore by good consequence they also are to receive the seale of the Covenant. The Text not onely shewing that they are within the Covenant, but also that a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Baptisme</hi> is a <hi>consequence</hi> of being within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Thus for Commands: for Examples, though there should be none, there is no great argument in it, when the rule is so plain, yet we have examples enough, by good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, for you shall finde the Gospell took place, just as the old administration, by bringing in <hi>whole families together</hi>; when <hi>Abraham</hi> was taken in, his whole Family was taken in with him; when any of the Gentiles turned Proselytes, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily their Families came in with them: so in this new Administration, <hi>usually</hi> if the <hi>Master</hi> of the House turned Christian, his whole <hi>Family</hi> came in and were baptized with him; The whole household of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Gentile, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.14. the household of <hi>Stephanus</hi>; the household of <hi>Aristobulus</hi>; the household of <hi>Narcissus</hi>; the household of <hi>Lydia</hi>; the household of the <hi>Gaoler</hi>; these are examples not to be contemned.</p>
            <p>And whereas some object against this Argument, taken from whole Families, that the argument is at least as strong to prove that the Jewish Infants did eat the Passeover, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not only severall Families might, but did, and that by Gods appointment, eat the Passeover.</p>
            <p>I Answer, by denying the consequence, the argument is not so strong, for the one as for the other, because no other Scripture shews that the Passeover doth belong to Infants; but we have other plaine Scriptures proving that Baptisme
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50201:23"/>
is in the room of Circumcision, which belongs therefore to Infants, as well as grown men: If any can instance of any families of Gentiles who were circumcised, the consequence were good, <hi>Therefore Infants were,</hi> if there were any Infants, because other Scriptures shew that circumcision belongs to Infants as well as grown men, but in this case the argument is not good.</p>
            <p>So much for my first and main Argument, they are <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derati,</hi> and therefore must be <hi>signati,</hi> they are under the Covenant of Grace, and therefore are to be signed with the seale of admittance into the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The <hi>major</hi> Proposition, that <hi>they who are made partakers of the inward grace, may not bee debarred of the outward signe,</hi> is undeniable, it is <hi>Peters</hi> argument,<note place="margin">Act. 10.47. &amp; 11.17.</note>

            <p>But I answer, though it be true that in <hi>other</hi> places this is <hi>one</hi> use that Christ makes of an Infants age and condition, to shew that such as receive the Kingdome of Heaven, must be qualifyed with humility, &amp;c. like unto children; yet <hi>here</hi> it cannot be his meaning, because his argument is, <hi>suffer them to come to mee and forbid them not, because of such is the Kingdome of God,</hi> that is, my Church and Kingdom is made up of these as well as of others. This was the very cause why the Disciples rebuked those who brought the children to Christ, because they were <hi>little,</hi> not <hi>fit to bee instructed,</hi> and therefore not fit that Christ should be troubled about them; this Christ rebukes in them, and tels them that the <hi>littlenesse</hi> of children, is no argument why they should be kept from him: <hi>Suffer them,</hi> said he, <hi>to come, and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdome of God:</hi> and what kind of argument had this been, if the Text should be interpreted as these men would have it, <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me,</hi> that I may <hi>touch them, take them up in mine armes, put my hands upon them, and blesse them,</hi> because the Kingdom of God belongs to them, who have such like qualities, who resemble children in some select properties? By the very same ground, if any had brought <hi>doves,</hi> and <hi>Sheep</hi> to Christ, to <hi>put his hands upon them, and blesse them,</hi> the Disciples had

And it is <hi>further</hi> considerable, that in the working of <hi>that</hi> inward grace, of which baptism is the sign and seale, all who partake of that grace, are but <hi>meere pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,</hi> and contribute no more to it, then a <hi>childe</hi> doth to its own begetting, and therefore <hi>Infants</hi> as fit Subjects to have it wrought in them as grown men, and the most grown men are in no more fitnesse to receive this grace when it is given them, in respect either of any <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>repentance,</hi> which they <hi>yet</hi> have, then a very little childe, it being the primary intention of the Covenant of Grace, in its first worke, to shew what Free Grace can and wil do to miserable nothing, to cut miserable man <hi>off from the wild Olive,</hi> and graffe him into the true Olive, <hi>to take away the heart of stone, to create in them a heart of flesh, to forgive their iniquities, to love them freely,</hi> what doth the most grown man in any of these, more then an Infant may do? being <hi>onely passive</hi> in them all; and of this <hi>first</hi> grace is the Sacrament of Baptism properly a seale: and who ever will deny, that <hi>Infants</hi> are capable of these things as well as <hi>grown men</hi>; must deny that any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants dying in their Infancy are saved by Christ.</p>
            <p>Against this Argument severall things are objected: which I shall indevour to remove out of the way.</p>
            <p>First, It is said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note> that although Infants are capable of these things, and they no doubt are by Christ wrought in many Infants, yet may not we baptize them, because, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50201:25"/>
to the Scripture pattern, both of <hi>Christs command, Matth.</hi> 28. in his <hi>institution</hi> of Baptisme, where this was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; and <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, Christs Disciples, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, They alwaies taught and made them Disciples by teaching, before they baptized any.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>I answer, First, that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. is not the <hi>institution</hi> of Baptisme, it was instituted long before, to be the Seale of the Covenant; it's only an inlargement of their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereas before they were to go <hi>onely to the lost sheepe of the House of Israel,</hi> now they were <hi>to go unto all the world.</hi> And beside, it is no where said, <hi>that none were baptized,</hi> but such as were <hi>first taught,</hi> and what reason we have to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the contrary, you have before seen.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is said indeed, that they taught and baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no expresse mention made of any other: but the reason is plain, there was a new Church to be constituted, all the Jews who should receive Christ, were to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>another administration,</hi> and their Infants were to come in only <hi>in their right,</hi> and the Heathen Nations who were to be converted to Christ, were yet wholly without the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and their children could have no right untill themselves were brought in; and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, though both <hi>John,</hi> and Christs Disciples, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, did teach before they baptized, because <hi>then</hi> no other were capable of baptism: but when once themselves were instructed and baptized, <hi>then</hi> their children were capable of it, by vertue of the Covenant. If any in the Jewish Church had received Commission, to go and make other Cities, <hi>Proselytes</hi> to them, their Commission must have run thus, <hi>Go teach and circumcise,</hi> would it therefore have followed, that none might be circumcised, but such as were first taught?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note>But it is expresly said, <hi>That hee that beleeves and is baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, shall bee saved; Faith in Christ</hi> is the Condition, upon
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50201:25"/>
which men may be baptized: and this is the most <hi>common</hi> objection among the <hi>Anabaptists: Unbeleevers may not bee baptized, children are unbeleevers, therefore they may not bee baptized.</hi> We have, say they, cleare evidence, that <hi>Faith</hi> is a condition required in those that are to be baptized, no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of <hi>any other</hi> condition that makes them capable of Baptism. Others of them adde, that under an affirmative command, the negative is to be included, beleeving is the affirmative, unbeleeving is the negative, therefore where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are commanded to be baptized, unbeleevers are forbidden to be baptized: this objection they much glory in, and some of them dare all the world to answer it.</p>
            <p>I Answer first,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answer.</hi>
               </note> but if this argument have any strength at all against the <hi>Baptizing</hi> of infants, it hath much more strength against the <hi>salvation</hi> of infants; it is said <hi>expresly,</hi> he that <hi>beleeveth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth not, shall bee damned:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 16.16.</note> there yee have both the <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and affirmative set downe, Hee that beleeves shall bee saved, hee that beleeves not shall bee damned; now I frame their owne argument thus against the <hi>salvation</hi> of infants, <hi>All unbeleevers shall bee damned, all infants are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, therefore they shall bee damned</hi>; now look at what doore they will goe out, for the <hi>salvation</hi> of infants, at the same will we go out, for the <hi>baptizing</hi> of infants; how ever they will evade the <hi>one,</hi> we shall much more strongly evade the <hi>other,</hi> if they say this Text is meant of <hi>growne men,</hi> of the way which God takes for the <hi>salvation</hi> of grown men, <hi>Infants</hi> are saved another way, upon other conditions; the same say we of infants baptisme, the Text means of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of baptizing of grown men, infants are baptized upon other conditions; if, they say, infants though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have <hi>actuall</hi> Faith, they may have <hi>virtuall</hi> Faith, Faith in the <hi>seed and roote,</hi> the same say we; if they say, though infants have not Faith, yet they may have that which is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50201:26"/>
               <hi>Analogous</hi> to faith, the same say we, they have somwhat which hath <hi>analogy</hi> to faith, and as effectuall to make them capable of baptism, as of salvation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I answer, <hi>it is no where said Unbeleevers,</hi> (or rather <hi>Non-beleevers</hi> it should be said) <hi>may not bee baptized</hi>; it is said indeed, <hi>hee that beleeveth and is baptized, shall bee saved</hi>; and it is said, <hi>that he that beleeveth with all his heart, may</hi> be baptized; it is no where said, that he <hi>that beleeveth not, may not be baptized</hi>: Therfore I deny the consequence, if all <hi>beleevers</hi> must be baptized, then no <hi>Unbeleevers,</hi> or <hi>Non-beleevers</hi> may be baptized; these two are not here intended by way of opposition, Christ excludes <hi>Infants</hi> neither from baptism, nor from salvation for want of faith, but <hi>positive Unbeleevers,</hi> and such as refuse the Gospel he excludes from both: The stone upon which these men stumble, is the ignorance in the opposition in the Scripture they bring, which is not betweene <hi>beleevers,</hi> and <hi>their Children,</hi> but betweene <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>Unbeleeving and profane persons</hi> who are shut from the Lords <hi>Covenant, Baptisme,</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note>Answ. Our knowledge that God hath effectually wrought the thing signified, is not the <hi>condition</hi> upon which wee are to apply the signe, God no where requires that we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50201:26"/>
should know that they are inwardly and certainly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whom we admit to the Sacrament of Baptism, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselves were not required to know <hi>this</hi> of those whom <hi>they</hi> baptized, if they were, they sinned in baptizing <hi>Simon Magus, Alexander, Hymenaeus, Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> with others: we are indeed required to know that they have in them <hi>that condition</hi> which must warrant us to <hi>administer the signe,</hi> not <hi>that</hi> which makes them <hi>possest of the thing signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; fallible conjectures</hi> are not to be our rule in administring of Sacraments, either to Infants of grown men, but a <hi>known rule of the word,</hi> out of which rule we must be able to make up such a judgment, that our administration may be of <hi>faith,</hi> as well as out of <hi>charity</hi>: In baptizing or grown men, the Apostles and Ministers of Christ administred the signe, not because they <hi>conjectured</hi> that the parties were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> sanctified, but because they made that <hi>profession</hi> of faith and holinesse of which they were <hi>sure,</hi> that whoever had the thing in truth, were received by Christ into <hi>inward</hi> Communion with himself, and that whoever <hi>thus</hi> made it; that Christ would have them <hi>received</hi> into the communion of his Church, though possibly for want of the inward work they were never received into the <hi>inward</hi> communion with Iesus Christ, indeed when such a confession was made, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>charity</hi> which alwaies hopeth the best, and thinketh no evill, bound them to receive them, and think of them, and converse with them, as with men in whom the inward work was wrought, untill they gave signes to the contrary; but this their <hi>charity,</hi> or charitable conjecture was not the <hi>grou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d</hi> of their <hi>admitting</hi> them to the ordinance, but the profession and confession of the party, made according to the Word, which they were bound to <hi>rest</hi> in; yea, I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly question, whether in case <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> could by the spirit of revelation have known that <hi>Ananias</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> would have proved no better then hypocrites, whether they either
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50201:27"/>
would, or ought to have refused them from Baptism, whilst they made that <hi>publike profession and confession,</hi> upon which others were admitted who in the event proved no better then those were. So that I conclude, not our <hi>knowledge</hi> of their <hi>inward Sanctification,</hi> is requisite to the admitting of any to baptism, but <hi>our knowledge of the will of Christ,</hi> that such who are in such and such condition, should by us be received into the communion of the Church: and in this the rule to direct our knowledge, is as plain for <hi>Infants</hi> as for <hi>growne men,</hi> the rule having been alwaies <hi>this,</hi> That <hi>growne men who were strangers from the Covenant of God, Unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> Pagans, Heathens, should upon <hi>their being instructed, and upon profession of their faith and promise to walke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of the Covenant</hi>; bee received and added to the Church, and made partakers of the seale of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and their <hi>Infants to come in with them</hi>; both sorts upon their admission to be charitably hoped of, untill they give signes to the contrary, charity being bound from thinking of evill of them, not tyed to conclude certainly of any of them, because they ought to know that in all ages, <hi>all are not Israel who are of Israel,</hi> and <hi>that many are called, but few are chosen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all who enter into <hi>Covenant,</hi> and receive the seale of the Covenant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4.</note> must <hi>stipulate</hi> for <hi>their parts,</hi> as well as <hi>God</hi> doth for <hi>his,</hi> they must <hi>indent</hi> with God to perform the <hi>beleevers</hi> part of the Covenant, as well as God doth to perform <hi>his part,</hi> as even <hi>this</hi> Text, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. requires, That Baptism which saves us must have <hi>the answer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to God</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> now although it be granted, that Infants are capable of receiving the <hi>first</hi> grace, if God be pleased to work it in <hi>them</hi>; yet what answer of a good conscience can there be from Infants unto God? they having not the use of reason, and not knowing what the Covenant meanes?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:50201:27"/>Answ. The Infants of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were as much tied as the <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers</hi> under the Gospel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> every one who was circumcised was <hi>bound to keepe the Law, Gal.</hi> 5. and these men professe that <hi>Israelitish</hi> Infants <hi>were within the old Covenant,</hi> when yet they knew not what it meant, nor could have the <hi>same</hi> use of it with their Parents and others of discretion. Looke what answer they will make for the <hi>Jewes</hi> infants, if true, will abundantly satisfie for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of <hi>beleevers</hi> under the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God seales to them presently, their name is put into the <hi>deed,</hi> and when they come to yeers of discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be <hi>adulti,</hi> then in their own persons they stand obliged to the performance of it; in the meane time <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7.22.</note> who is the surety of the Covenant, and the surety of all the Covenanters, is pleased to be their surety; we know when severall parties stand obliged in the same bond, they may seale at severall times, and yet be in force afterward toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or even a child sealing in infancy, may <hi>aguize</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize</hi> that sealing, when they come to yees of discretion; if then they will renounce it, as done when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not, they may free themselves if they please, if they find the former act an inconvenience or burden to them: so is it here, God of his infinite mercy is pleased to seale to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants while they are such, and accepts of such a seale on their parts, as they are able to give in their Infant age, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a further ratification on their part, when they are come to riper yeers, in the meane time affording them the favour and priviledge of being in Covenant with him, of being reckoned unto his kingdom and family, rather then of the Devils; if when they are grown men they refuse to stand to this Covenant there is no hurt done on Gods part, let them serve another God, and take their lot for time to come.</p>
            <p>But what benefit comes to children by <hi>such</hi> kind of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50201:28"/>
as this is? it seems then (say they) by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that this is but a <hi>conditionall sealing</hi> on Gods part, <hi>viz</hi>: that they own it, and ratifie it when they come to age, and if they then refuse to stand to it, all is then nullified, were it not therefore better to defer it to their years of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to see whether they will <hi>then</hi> make it their own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act, yea, or no?</p>
            <p>Answ. 1. This objection lay as strongly against Gods widsome in requiring the <hi>Jewes</hi> Infants, even in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy thus to seale; and therefore argues no great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or modesty in men, who would thus reason with God about his administrations. 2. God hath other ends and uses of applying the seale of the Covenant to them who are in Covenant with him, then their <hi>present gaine,</hi> it's a <hi>Homage, Worship,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> to himself, and it behoves us even in that respect, <hi>to fulfill all righteousnesse: when Christ was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and circumcised,</hi> he was as unfit for the ordinance, through his <hi>perfection,</hi> as children through their <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,</hi> being as much <hi>above them,</hi> as children are <hi>below them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I Answer; The benefit and fruit of it at the present is very much, both to the <hi>Parents</hi> and to the <hi>children</hi>; to the Parents first, whilst God doth hereby honour them to have their children counted to his Church, to his kingdome, and family, to be under his wing and grace, whilest all the other Infants in the world have their visible standing under the Prince, and in the kingdom of darknesse, and consequently whilest others have no hope of their childrens spiritual wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, untill they be called out of that condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these need not have any doubt of their childrens welfare, if they die in their <hi>Infancy,</hi> nor if they live untill they shew signes to the contrary: God having both <hi>reckoned</hi> them unto <hi>his people,</hi> and given them <hi>all the meanes of salvation,</hi> which an <hi>Infants</hi> age is capable of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:50201:28"/>Secondly, here is much priviledge and benefit to the children, when as (beside what inward secret worke God is pleased to worke in them) they being Members of the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> have their share in the Communion of Saints are remembred at the throne of Grace, every day by those that pray for the welfare of the Church, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in those prayers which are made for his blessing upon his <hi>Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, it's no small priviledge to have that Seale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon them in their <hi>Infancy,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> may <hi>afterwards</hi> plead when they are <hi>grown</hi> and come to <hi>fulfill the condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if their being capable of the spirituall part,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 6.</note> must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to the outward signe, why then doe we not also admit them to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which is the seale of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> as well as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptisme? And this is urged, the rather, because (say they) the <hi>Infants</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> did eate of the <hi>Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> as well as were circumcised; now if <hi>our</hi> Infants have every way as large a priviledge as the <hi>Infants</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> had, then can we not deny them the same priviledge which their <hi>Infants</hi> had, and consequently they must partake of the one Sacrament, as well as the other.</p>

But certainly, thus to dash all Infant children of <hi>beleevers</hi> out of the Covenant of Grace (as much as in them lyeth) &amp; to deprive them of the seale of it, is in a spirituall sense farre more heavy. And I dare appeale to the tender bowels of any beleeving Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whether it were not easier for them to thinke that their <hi>Infants</hi> should be dashed against the stones, and yet in the meane time to die under Christs <hi>wing,</hi> as visible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Kingdome, Church and Family, rather then to have them live, and behold them to have a visible standing <hi>onely</hi> in the Kingdome of the Devill: These men know not how much they provoke Christs displeasure against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; He was greatly displeased with his owne Disciples for forbidding little children to come unto him; &amp; one day such men will know, that he is much more displeased with them, who with so great violence oppose the bringing of beleevers children unto his holy Sacrament, that with unspeakable wrong, injury, and slander, they prosecute all the Ministers of Christ, who give <hi>Infants</hi> this their due, condemning them for Ministers of Antichrist, and limbes of the Beast; yea, some of them proceeding so farre, as condemning all the Churches of Christ, to be no Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

            <p>And this is yet more admirable in our eyes, when we se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously consider, how uncleane and filthy, how viperous a brood they are, as proceeding out of our loines, empty of all goodnesse, full of all wickednesse, an uncleane leprosie having bespread them from the crown of the Head to the sole of the Foot, fit only to be cast into the open field, to the loathing of their persons, in the day that they are born,<note place="margin">Esa. 16.

The Papists, as in some things they give and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe too much to Baptisme, making it to take away origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne, <hi>ex opere operato</hi>: So in other things they rob Gods people of the comfortable use <hi>of it,</hi> because they say that when once we commit actuall sinnes we make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of Baptism, and then <hi>Penance</hi> must be <hi>secunda tabula post naufragium,</hi> a Cockbot after our shipwrack; but this blessed Sacrament seekes for a more durable and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble use, even to be an <hi>Arke,</hi> as my Text cals it, to carry to heaven. Know then that whensoever thou findest thy selfe at a losse, sensible of thy undone condition, findest thy guilt, and filth, and bondage, through sinne, and flyest unto Christ, and thy conscience witnesseth with thee, that thou wouldest walke for time to come, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of the Covenant, in uprightnesse, to make God in Christ thy portion, and his word thy guide; So <hi>often</hi> I say as thou doest this, maiest thou fly to thy <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi> and plead it for thy comfort, as we may plead the <hi>Rainbow</hi> in foule weather against the worlds destruction by water. I have often heard a story of a great Queen, who gave a Ring to a Nobleman, while he was her Favourite, and willed him to send it to her when he should stand in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50201:32"/>
greatest need of her favour; who afterward falling into her displeasure, sent the Ring, which through the treachery of the bearer was not delivered till it was too late: But it shall never happen so to <hi>thee,</hi> doe thou in all thy extremity, shew or send by the hand of faith thy <hi>Seale,</hi> which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee, plead it confidently, and to thy dying day, it may be an Arke unto thy soule in all cases of <hi>relapse, desertion, temptation,</hi> or whatever else may betide thee, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of thy repentance and faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">To humble such as walke unworthy of this priviledge.</note> This great love of God in taking us thus neare into his own Family, as his own Children, should make many of us blush, <hi>to remember our unworthy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, in times past</hi>; yea, it might make our very <hi>hearts to bleed,</hi> and make us not only wish we had been <hi>unbaptized,</hi> but even <hi>unborn,</hi> rather then to pollute the holy Covenant, and the seale of it, as we have done with our unhallowed lives: Can it seem a light thing in our eyes, that when God hath left the greatest part of the world, as strangers from his Family and Kingdom, to be under Satans kingdom, and taken us (no better by nature than they are) to be his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ones into Covenant with him, that he should sweare unto us, to be our God, and hitherto to train us up under such heavenly Ordinances, and we to walk in the meane time as rebels and enemies unto him, like the unbaptized world? can we think our condemnation not to be greater then theirs?
